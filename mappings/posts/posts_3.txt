What do the critics have to say?Romantic comedies are often the most difficult films to pull off; you needpalpable chemistry between the leads, inspired jokes, and a delicate sense ofcomic timing. Good luck finding those attributes in Good Luck Chuck,critics say. Dane Cook stars as a guy who’s the victim of a curse, one in whichany woman who dates him finds true love — with someone else. Enter Jessica Albaas a penguin-lover who really digs him. Can she break the curse? Critics say themovie seems to be under a spell of its own, one in which potential laughs aresquandered by means of rude humor, shopworn slapstick, and an ultimately cheesyresolution. At seven percent on the Tomatometer, Chuck this one to thecurb.\"Why yes, I am interested in renewing my subscription toThe Atlantic Monthly.\"Sydney White, the titular heroine of this Snow White update, might find herselfsinging, \"Someday, my prince will come.\" Or perhaps, \"Someday, a bunch ofprincely movie critics may give my movie a good review.\" Sydney White starsAmanda Bynes as a college freshman who has to contend with a malicious sororityqueen while whipping a frat of geeks into social shape. While critics agreeBynes is a talented actress who’s rescued movies in the past, her comic skillsgo largely to waste here on a script that functions completely on stereotypesand does little to plant new twists on the classicfairy tale. In fact, the scribes say the unsubtle references to Snow White lorein the movie are jarring and distracting. At 46 percent Tomatometer, SydneyWhite is one poisoned apple.\"Tomatometers that big gotta be fake.\"With Eastern Promises,David Cronenberg continues to utilize genretrappings for his singular dark, bold vision. Promises stars ViggoMortensen as a mysterious yet charismatic Russian hitman whose loyalties are putinto question when he encounters Naomi Watts’s character. Critics praise Eastern‘s tight pacing, grisly images that are shocking but short ofexploitation, and Mortensen’s daring performance.&nbsp; And a fight scene in abathhouse between Mortensen and a group of thugs is being touted as one of the most impressive action set piecess in recent memory.&nbsp; At aCertified Fresh 86 percent, Cronenberg Promises a good time.

Eight million ways to die (\"Final Destination 3\"). Harrison Ford looking frantic, then looking really, really mad (\"Firewall\"). The Man in the Yellow Hat (\"Curious George\"). It could only be one thing: this week’s wide releases!Steve Martin and Shawn Levy have some pretty big shoes to fill — namely, Peter Sellers‘ and Blake Edwards‘ — with their revival of \"The Pink Panther.\" And critics say that, to quote Inspector Clouseau, they have failed where others have succeeded. The new film is a prequel to the famed series; the French government can’t find a master detective, so Jacques Clouseau is recruited to solve a murder. Critics say the movie isn’t all that bad, but Martin, funny as he is, is not Sellers, who broke the mold for the character. At 31 percent on the Tomatometer, this is one is a \"beumbe.\"\"Final Destination\" fans, you know the drill: A group of kids didn’t get on a plane that exploded, thereby cheating death, so therefore, death, in the form of Rube Goldberg, is out to get them. It’s amazing that they’ve made three movies that began with such a premise. What’s even more amazing is the fact that, according to the scribes, they keep getting better. \"Final Destination 3\" is currently at 52 percent on the Tomatometer (the original: 31 percent; the sequel: 46 percent). Still, the scribes say this one doesn’t quite transcend the genre.Is there anyone in the movies who’s better at looking frantic than Harrison Ford? And is there anyone who’s played more characters defending their families from danger? \"Firewall\" tells the story of a bank security expert who must rescue his wife and child from a ruthless kidnapper. Despite a high-tech update to the formula, critics say this shopworn thriller is more dour and less energetic than similar efforts. At 30 percent on the Tometometer, critics say to block this \"Firewall.\"There’s something we’ve been curious about_: Would animated features ever return to a simpler, gentler tone, jettisoning non-stop antics and pop culture references? The answer is yes, and it comes in the form of everyone’s favorite inquisitive simian, \"Curious George.\" The critics say the sheer joyful modesty of this enterprise is one of its best qualities, and the crisp 2-D animation is bright and colorful.

What do the critics have to say?First, the bad news: critics say Beowulf will inspire English teachersand literary scholars to tear out their hair. The good news? The scribes alsosay it’s a flick that fans of bombastic action and phantasmagoria will want givetheir right arms for. If you didn’t read the epic poem in school, get thee to alibrary; suffice to say the story involves a dude named Beowulf (Ray Winstone)tangling with mead hall-crashing beast Grendel (Crispin Glover) andhis vengeful, seductive mom (Angelina Jolie, much more attractive than her fictionalprogeny would indicate). The pundits say Beowulf‘s amazing visuals arethe biggest draw here, as directorRobert Zemeckis uses dazzling CGI to bringthe classic tale to vivid life. (They also note it’s not for the kiddies,despite its PG-13 rating.) At 79 percent, Beowulf is Certified Fresh, andit’s well above Zemeckis’ previous animation/live-action hybrid, The PolarExpress (57 percent). (Andcheck outour Total Recall feature on Beowulf and animation.)Grendel waiting until somebody invents Jergens.Everyone can use a dose of magic and whimsy from time to time, right? Butfrippery requires a light touch, something critics say Mr. Magorium’s WonderEmporium lacks. Emporium starsDustin Hoffman in the title role asthe proprietor of a magic toy store, a place where baubles can come to life,fueled by imagination;Natalie Portman plays his protégé. The pundits say thebig problem with Mr. Magorium’s Wonder Emporium is that it ODs onzaniness in an effort to make up for a bland storyline. At 24 percent on theTomatometer, business isn’t all that brisk at this Emporium.“Does Mr. Magorium sell cornballers?”Nobel Prize-winnerGabriel Garcia Marquezis widely acknowledged to be one of the world’s great men of letters.Javier Bardem, hot from his performance in NoCountry for Old Men, stars in the adaptation of one of Marquez’ mostcelebrated works, Love in the Time of Cholera. Unfortunately, critics sayit’s more like Love in the Time of Narcolepsy. Bardem stars as a man whois so enraptured by a woman he waits 50 years for her, despite her shiftingaffections. The pundits say Love misses the spirit and passion ofMarquez’ magical realist tale by miles, with fine actors in miscast roles and atoo-literal approach, bogging down material that has a sense of sweep andromanticism on the page.

What do the critics have to say?The perpetually awesomeSteve Carell andJuliette Binoche team up forDanin Real Life, a rom-com about an advice columnist who falls for hisbrother’s significant other. It sounds good on paper: who wouldn’t be intriguedby the pairing of the brilliantly guileless Carell with Binoche, an actress ofuncommon range and depth? Though Life suffers from an uneasy mix of sitcom wackiness and sentimentality, director Peter Hedges has a clear love for the film’s characters, with most critics agreeing Carell and company overcome the weak script.

What do the critics have to say?The highly-anticipated The Golden Compass is the first of PhilipPullman’s novels to hit the screen. It has a veritable Murderer’s Row of actingtalent (Nicole Kidman,Sam Elliott,Eva Green,Daniel Craig,Ian McKellen,TomCourtenay, Derek Jacobi,Ian McShane,Christopher Lee, andnewcomerDakotaBlue Richards). And critics say it’s got visual flash to spare. Unfortunately, theyalso largely feel Compass is a little too cold to work any kind of spell.The film tells the story of a 12-year-old girl attempting to save her friendfrom the strange, malevolent Gobblers, and finds herself in a realm of mysteryand fantastical beings.

What do the critics have to say?For Rhode Islanders, the work ofBobby andPeter Farrelly has long been a sourceof regional pride; their best work (There’s Something About Mary, Dumband Dumber) deftly combined taboo-busting, gross-out yucks with anundeniable sweetness. So it breaks the heart of this Ocean State native toreport that their latest, The Heartbreak Kid, isn’t generating all thatmuch warmth with the critics. Based uponElaine May‘s 1972 semi-classic, Kidstars Ben Stiller as a recently-married guy who quickly learns his new bride hasmuch more baggage than he bargained for; on his honeymoon, he meets Miranda(Michelle Monhagan), who just might be the right gal for him. The pundits saythat while the film does contain a smattering of raunchy laughs, they seemedshoehorned into the film, undercutting character development and any kind ofmessage.

It’scertainly a cut below the original (at 89 percent).The Village People recruits its seventh member.If a compelling, magical fantasy world is something you’re actively seeking,critics say you may want to avoid The Seeker.

(Uh, so was Thomas Edison, like, the greatest ofthose warriors? Just asking.) Critics say The Seeker is several notchesbelow the Harry Potter films in terms of emotional resonance andfilmmaking quality, and underutilizes the talents ofIan McShane andFrancesConroy. At 25 percent on the Tomatometer, The Seeker may not be whatyou’re looking for.They seek him here, they seek him there, his clothes are loud butnever square.If your sensibilities run toward action flicks, you are likely prejudicedagainst light comedies about smart people and their relationship troubles.

The film tells the story of a group of six women whose bookclub assignment is for each to read one of Austen’s novels; they soon findevents in their lives eerily paralleling the texts they’re reading. The criticssay that what could have been a bland exercise in chick-flick-dom is elevated byan outstanding cast that includes Maria Bello, Emily Blunt, andKathy Baker;each of the principals plays her part with intelligence and warmth.

What do the critics have to say?It’s a crime flick starring Denzel Washington and Russell Crowe that’s directedby Ridley Scott. How could this possibly go wrong? According to critics, itcan’t. American Gangster tells the story of a low-level criminal(Washington) who moves up the ladder when his boss dies; Crowe plays anoutcast cop on his trail. Pundits say Gangster is a remarkable entry intothe crime genre, with excellent performances, a compelling sense of moralambiguity, and an outstanding eye for 1970s period detail. At 80 percent on the Tomatometer, American Gangster is Certified Fresh. (Check outthis week’s Total Recall, where we examine some notable organized crime films from thepast.)\"Pour your salt like this from now on or you’re out of the gang.\"Jerry Seinfeld lends his distinctive brand of observational humor to Bee Movie, a CGI feature about ourpollen-producing pals and their interactions with people. Seinfeld stars as the voice of a recent bee graduatelooking for a purpose in life. Leaving the hive for the first time, he comesinto contact with a human (Renée Zellweger) and becomes concerned overhumanity’s rampant consumption of honey. Critics say Bee Movie iselevated by Seinfeld’s witty humor, but otherwise, this is an amiable butforgettable affair. At 57 percent on the Tomatometer, this is no killer Bee.(Check out RT’s interview with Seinfeldhere.)That’s gold, Jerry, gold!On a good day, John Cusack is one of the most likeable actors in the movies. Unfortunately, he can’t sell a middling script. InThe Martian Child, Cusackstars as a widowed sci-fi writer who forms a bond with a boy who hides in anAmazon.com box and claims to be an extraterrestrial; strange events lendcredence to his claims. Critics say that Cusack and 10-year-oldBobby Coleman are excellent, but they bemoan the film’s story, which takes an intriguing premise and weighs it down with clichés andsappiness. At 29 percent on the Tomatometer, this Martian is lost inspace.\"I emailed Amazon.

Starring Lil Wayne and Big Boi). What do the critics have to say?\nThe wait is finally over: The Simpsons have migrated from the confines of television to the silver (or is that yellow?) screen. The result? Well, maybe not the “best…. movie… ever,” but pundits say it’s still pretty exxxxx-cellent. Homer, responsible for an eco-disaster, piles Marge, Bart, Lisa, and Maggie into the car and leaves Springfield for Alaska (you were expecting Capital City?). Ah, but who cares about the plot? The critics say The Simpsons Movie is essentially an extra-long episode of the show, but one that contains plenty of the S-M-R-T jokes, killer slapstick, and poignancy that fans have come to expect. At 84 percent on the Tomatometer, The Simpsons Movie is Certified Fresh. Release the hounds.\n\nMmmmm, Flaming Homer!\n\nNo Reservations joins a list of movies (Eat Drink Man Woman, Like Water for Chocolate, Sideways) about the intersection between the taste buds and the heartstrings; unfortunately, the pundits say this one is bland, under-nourishing, and a bunch of other food metaphors. Catherine Zeta-Jones stares as Kate, a master chef who is at first threatened, then inspired, by the presence of rising culinary star Nick (Aaron Eckhart) in the kitchen of an upscale New York restaurant. Critics say No Reservations is appealingly presented, but its combination of predictability and melancholy make it hard to swallow. At 38 percent on the Tomatometer, critics have some Reservations about this one.\n\n“I told you not to do a Zorro sequel!”\n\nWhen it comes to making movies about the struggle between man and nature, German director Werner Herzog is one of the greats, with such masterpieces as Aguirre, the Wrath of God, Fitzcarraldo, and Grizzly Man to his credit. Add Rescue Dawn to that list. Rescue Dawn stars Christian Bale as Dieter Dengler, a Navy pilot who, after crash-landing in the jungles of Laos, must escape imprisonment and navigate the treacherous depths of the jungle. Critics say Dawn is the closest that Herzog has made to an inspiring popcorn flick, albeit one that challenges viewers’ expectations and doesn’t shortchange the horror or despair of the situation. At 89 percent on the Tomatometer, this is one emotional Rescue. (Check out RT’s take here.)\n\nCrowd surfing on two broken legs is not recommended.\n\nTwo of this week’s wide releases contain mysteries unlikely to be solved before they hit theaters. The makers of I Know Who Killed Me aren’t letting critics in on their little secret. Nor will we learn the identity of your caddy, as Who’s Your Caddy? was also withheld from scribes. Killed features troubled starlet Lindsay Lohan as a college student who escapes abduction and torture. Caddy stars Big Boi and Lil Wayne in a film that features the most golf course antics this side of Dorf.

What do the critics have to say?\nThe third in a series is rarely the best — witness the critical response to the latest Shrek and Spidey installments. However, if you found the thrills and chills of The Bourne Identity and Supremacy too sedate, you’re in luck; critics say The Bourne Ultimatum is one of the most exciting, action-paced movies of the summer, and is easily the best in the series (not too shabby, considering the other two were both Certified Fresh). Yet again, Matt Damon isn’t really sure who he is or how he became such an awesome killing machine, and yet again, he’s on the run from the authorities. But in this episode, pundits say Damon really comes into his own as an action star here, and director Paul Greengrass is well on his way to becoming an auteur of commercial filmmaking. Critics say the dizzying camerawork, rapid-fire editing, and overall craftsmanship make for one wild ride. At 92 percent on the Tomatometer, this may be the ultimate Bourne.\n\nDamon’s still hunting, but not for goodwill.\nCritics are musing: is Bratz much better than Barbie? Since 2001, the ethnically diverse dolls have built an empire based on their unique brand of girl power and lip gloss, including this film adaptation featuring four girls overcoming their differences and joining together in holy BFFness.  But critics deem Bratz: The Movie a vapid and clueless enterprise, with characters who don’t seem to have any discernable characteristics beyond fashion and material wealth.  And it freely employs stereotypes (girls must be skinny, boys must be dreamy, and adults are idiots) while paradoxically arguing stereotypes are bad. At 11 percent Tomatometer, these Bratz need a lesson in filmmaking.\n\n“Picking Bad Movies To Star In For Dummies.” \nYou loved him when he was drinking Mr. Pibb with a Red Vines straw, and you loved him when he was cutting holes in boxes.

Superbad tells thestory of two geeks (Michael Cera and Jonah Hill) on the cusp of graduation whoreally, really want to change their luck with the ladies. The pundits say Superbad is as raunchy and cheerfully vulgar as any comedy you’re likely tosee this summer, but it’s also remarkably wise and poignant regarding theawkwardness of the high school years. At 92 percent, Superbad surpasses Knocked Up‘s Tomatometer score, which means that it’s one of the bestreviewed films of the year. (Check out our interview with the Superbadgang here.)“Those RT critics crack me up.”TheInvasion arrives in theaters with plenty of baggage. The film, helmedby OliverHirschbiegel (Downfall),originally wrapped in 2006, but the studio allegedly balked at what they saw,and it’s rumored that a good portion of the final product is the result of aretooled script by theWachowskibrothers and reshoots byV for VendettadirectorJamesMcTeigue. Such Hollywood intrigue may ultimately prove more interesting thanthe film itself, as critics say The Invasion is a pretty tepid,unsuspenseful remake of an already thrice-adapted story (Invasionof the Body Snatchers). After a space shuttle crash, Nicole Kidman andDaniel Craig discover that an infection is taking over peoples’ bodies in theirsleep, turning them into unemotional quasi-zombies. The pundits say the film isslick but unfocused, lacking psychological complexity and thrills. At 16 percenton the Tomatometer, The Invasion sits far below the precedent set by the 1956 and1978 Body Snatchers, both at 100 percent.They couldn’t hide their horror upon seeing the Wachowski Bros. re-cut.It appears the folks behind The Last Legion are afraid the number ofpundits who wouldn’t dig their movie would be, ahem, legion. Perhaps that’s thereason the film wasn’t screened before hitting theaters. Featuring a prettyimpressive cast that includes Colin Firth, Ben Kingsley, andAishwarya Rai,TheLast Legion tells the story of a boy with the responsibility to save theRoman Empire.

What do the critics have to say?\nIt’s been a good couple years for sophomoric sports comedy; Dodgeball and Blades of Glory each earned cackles by taking the seriousness of athletic competition to absurd heights — and throwing in plenty of raunch. But juvenilia only goes so far; you need a little something more to generate laughs… And critics say laughs are in short supply in Balls of Fury. Randy Daytona (Dan Fogler) is a washed-up pro table tennis player recruited to infiltrate the deadly world of underground extreme ping pong, in which the diabolical Feng (Christopher Walken) oversees a deadly tournament of serve-and-volley. It’s a funny premise, but critics say despite some yucks, Balls runs out of steam pretty quickly, and lacks the sharp comic edge of other sports comedies. At 28 percent on the Tomatometer, Balls of Fury is getting paddled. (Read our interview with Fogler here.)\n\nOne can’t fault James Wan for trying to branch out a little. With Death Sentence, the man behind Saw and Dead Silence moves from straight horror to the realm of the psychological thriller. After his child is brutally murdered, devoted family man Nick Hume (Kevin Bacon) aims for revenge, and goes gunning for a violent gang that committed the crime. It’s not a bad premise; heck, it worked pretty well in Death Wish, and A History of Violence ventured into the darker realms of an everyman’s outwardly placid façade.

What do the critics have to say?After a slight stumble with \"Cars,\" \"Ratatouille\" marks a semi-return to form for Pixar. This animated flick stars Remy (voiced by Patton Oswalt), a rat whose aspirations to become a chef land him in a struggling restaurant’s kitchen, where he befriends a hapless garbage boy (Lou Romano). While critics are floored by the stunning leap in animation quality that Pixar seems to make with each movie, they’re equally impressed by \"Ratatouille\"’s fast pacing, memorable characters, and overall good humor. And like director Brad Bird‘s previous film, \"The Incredibles,\" \"Ratatouille\" juggles themes of identity and individualism without being heavy-handed. \"At 90 percent Tomatometer, the Certified Fresh \"Ratatouille\" is a movie to savor. (Check out RT’s interview with Patton Oswalt.)\"You like me…you really like me!\"Despite the title, the setting for the latest \"Die Hard\" isn’t New Hampshire; it’s Washington, D.C., where a group of super-hackers (led by Timothy Olyphant) are plotting to attack America’s computer infrastructure and bring the nation to its knees. McClane teams with a cyber geek to stop them; rousing pyrotechnics ensue. Critics say that while the plot is beyond preposterous, it’s of little matter with stunts and action this exhilarating and intense. And they also note that Bruno settles nicely into his iconic role. At 77 percent on the Tomatometer, \"Live Free\" is not only Certified Fresh, it’s the second-best-reviewed \"Die Hard\" after the original. (Check out RT’s interview with Bruce Willis here.)Just another day at the office for McClane.Wherever Michael Moore goes, cameras, and controversy, follow. That’s certainly the case for \"Sicko\"; Moore’s latest doc, which compares and contrasts our privatized health care with other health care systems abroad, has gotten him in hot water with the Bush administration over a potentially embargo-violating Cuban medical trip. But Moore is finding much love among critics, who call it a mature, humanistic film. They praise Moore’s decision to spend much of the time off-screen, allowing the events to convince and anger on their own merits. At 89 percent Tomatometer, \"Sicko\" is Certified Fresh and just what the doctor ordered. (Check out RT’s interview with Michael Moore.)\"Anyone know where I can get some freedom fries?\"Like so many other ambitious, richly layered novels adapted into films, \"Evening\" is what some critics call impossible to translate faithfully to the big screen. Assembling a dazzling cast, \"Evening\" stars Vanessa Redgrave as terminally ill mother who recounts to her children an affair she had as a young woman (played by Claire Danes). Critics call it a melodramatic artsy film, one that tries to go for emotional uplift, but with plot devices and character arcs that are too obvious to be genuinely affecting. At 32 percent Tomatometer, \"Evening\" falls and tumbles.A few actors trying to make a quick getaway.Also opening this week in limited release: \"Ghosts of Cité Soleil,\" a harrowing portrait of the titular Haitian slum, is at 81 percent; \"Over the GW,\" an autobiographical look into rehab, is at 80 percent; \"In Between Days,\" a coming of age story with a Korean twist, is at 77 percent; and \"Vitus,\" a drama about a young musical prodigy, is at 69 percent.Recent Pixar Movies———————————-76% — \"Cars\"97% — \"The Incredibles\"98% — \"Finding Nemo\"95% — \"Monster’s Inc.\"100% — \"Toy Story 2\"","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"rom-coms, Fox, Classic, Winter, nbcuniversal, Trivia, TV, Mary, service, Cannes, Schedule","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Critical-Consensus-Ratatouille-is-Tasty-Die-Hard-is-Solid-Sicko-is-Socko-Evening-Falls"},{"id":"47508803522445","title":"Critical Consensus: Hairspray is Certified Fresh; Chuck And Larry is On The Rocks","content":"Critics Consensusvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Critical Consensus: Hairspray is Certified Fresh; Chuck And Larry is On The RocksHow much cross-dressing and gay innuendo can one Friday handle?by Tim Ryan | July 19, 2007 |  CommentsThis week at the movies, we’ve got straight firemen in a domestic partnership(INow Pronounce You Chuck and Larry, starringAdam Sandler,Kevin James,and Jessica Biel),and John Travolta in drag (Hairspray,also starring Michelle Pfeiffer, Queen Latifah, and Amanda Bynes).

And with Punch-DrunkLove and Reign Over Me, he’s proven himself to be a capable dramaticactor as well. Unfortunately, critics say his latest, INow Pronounce You Chuck and Larry, does not represent much of a creativeadvance for New Hampshire’s favorite son. Sandler andKevin Jamesstar as two Brooklyn firefighters who, in a bind, pretend to be a gay couple toqualify for domestic partnership benefits. While the film’s moral is anadmirable one (homophobia isn’t kosher), critics say Chuck and Larrytries to have it both ways by utilizing shopworn gay stereotypes for laughsbefore arriving at a preachy message of tolerance.

What do the critics have to say?For those who dig stargazing, \"Ocean’s Eleven\" must have seemed like a gift from heaven. Featuring George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Matt Damon, Julia Roberts, and Don Cheadle, and directed by the always interesting Steven Soderbergh, it was a heist movie with some good laughs and a sleek design. \"Ocean’s Twelve\" may have been of a trifle, but it got by on the sheer fun of watching a bunch of big name stars having a good time. Now the gang is back with \"Ocean’s Thirteen,\" and critics say it’s loaded with the same stylish, unpretentious charm as the first two. This time, the crew plots to undermine a big-time casino mogul, played by Al Pacino, who swindled one of the gang. \"Ocean’s Thirteen\" may not be the height of cinematic profundity, but pundits say it’s a slick, entertaining piece of mainstream entertainment. At 70 percent, this one is a lucky \"Thirteen.\" However, it’s still a notch below the original (original remake?), which stands at 81 percent.Alternate scene take from \"Garden State.\"With the release of \"Saw\" and \"Hostel,\" critics devised a label for the sub-genre of particularly grisly slasher flicks: torture porn. Within this sub-set, Eli Roth is emerging as an auteur; in addition to his howlingly funny (and completely depraved) fake trailer for \"Thanksgiving\" in \"Grindhouse,\" Roth brings us \"Hostel: Part II.\" Yet again, American college students fall into the clutches of sicko Europeans obsessed with torture. Critics say that while many will be repulsed by what they see (if they see \"Hostel: Part II\" at all), Roth’s filmmaking craftsmanship has markedly improved, with better developed characters and some sly political commentary — in addition to oodles of gore. But other critics say Roth’s work is still in service to brutally disgusting material. \"Hostel: Part II\" is at 64 percent on the Tomatometer.\"I’m trying a new method today. I call it ‘Uwe Boll Marathon.’\"Can’t get enough of cinematic penguins? How about animated penguins? Well, if \"March of the Penguins\" and \"Happy Feet\" didn’t sate your appetite for the antics of those well-dressed, flightless residents of Antarctica, now comes \"Surf’s Up.\" Sort of a \"Waiting for Guffman\" for the kiddie set, the movie goes behind the scenes — mockumentary style — at the Penguin World Surfing Championships, where young upstart Cody Maverick (voiced by Shia LaBeouf) hopes to make a splash. The critics say many of the gags will soar like eagles over the heads of the little ones, but \"Surf’s Up\" is a laid-back, witty frolic. At 72 percent on the Tomatomter, \"Surf’s Up\" is pretty tubular, dude.\"And I got this from a Magic: The Gathering tourney.\"Also opening this week in limited release: \"12:08 East of Bucharest,\" a wry comedy about the fall of communism in Romania, is at 100 percent on the Tomatometer; \"Your Mommy Kills Animals,\" a doc about the animal rights movement, is at 100 percent; \"La Vie En Rose,\" a biopic about the French chanteuse Edith Piaf, is at 83 percent (check out Jen Yamato’s mini review here); \"You’re Gonna Miss Me,\" a doc about the eccentric 13th Floor Elevators singer Roky Erickson, is at 71 percent; and \"Belle Toujours,\" the latest from Portuguese master (and nonagenarian) Manoel de Oliveira, is at 71 percent.Roky knows how we roll.Recent Steven Soderbergh Movies:——————————————-33% — The Good German (2006)69% — Bubble (2006)55% — Ocean’s Twelve (2004)64% — Solaris (2002)36% — Full Frontal (2002)","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"based, Television, IFC, Turner, TruTV, television, of, scary, live","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Critical-Consensus-Oceans-Thirteen-Is-Slick-And-Fun-Hostel-Is-Worth-A-Visit-Surfs-Up-Is-Tubular"},{"id":"47508803535764","title":"Critical Consensus: \"Knocked Up\" Is A Knockout; \"Mr. Brooks,\" \"Gracie\" Less So","content":"Critics Consensusvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Critical Consensus: \"Knocked Up\" Is A Knockout; \"Mr. Brooks,\" \"Gracie\" Less Soby Tim Ryan | May 31, 2007 |  CommentsThis week at the movies we’ve got matters of life (\"Knocked Up,\" starring Katherine Heigl and Seth Rogen), death (\"Mr. Brooks,\" starring Kevin Costner and Demi Moore), and soccer (\"Gracie,\" starring Elisabeth Shue). What do the critics have to say?When director Judd Apatow titles a movie, you always know what to expect. Like, what else could something called \"The 40-Year-Old-Virgin\" possibly have been about? And Apatow’s newest flick, \"Knocked Up,\" is just as bluntly advertised: a perpetually stoned schlub (Seth Rogen) impregnates a woman way out of his league (Katherine Heigl) after a one-night stand, putting the kibosh on his arrested development. But, like \"Virgin,\" \"Knocked\" has a sweetness and depth that extends well beyong most comedies; critics call it a hilarious, poignant, and refreshing look at the rigors of courtship and child-rearing, with a sometimes raunchy, always witty script that is ably acted and directed. At 88 percent on the Tomatometer, \"Knocked Up\" isn’t just Certified Fresh, it even tops \"Virgin\"’s 82 percent.\"Magenta?\"In \"Mr. Brooks,\" Kevin Costner plays a successful businessman and loving father with a big secret: he’s a serial killer on the down low. It’s an admittedly intriguing setup, and critics say \"Mr. Brooks\" gives its talented cast, which includes Demi Moore, William Hurt, and Dane Cook (!) a chance to take on some meaty roles, as well as providing audiences with some amusing, smarter-than-average plot twists and thrills. Unfortunately, the pundits also note that \"Mr. Brooks\" is overstuffed with said twists, making for a film that becomes more preposterous as it goes along. \"Mr. Brooks\" currently stands at 53 percent on the Tomatometer.\"They call me Mister Brooks!\"\"Gracie\" is the latest in a long line of inspirational sports movies that feature a dogged protagonist overcoming prejudice and family trauma. The film, a fictional treatment of star Elisabeth Shue’s high school sports career, tells the story of a 15-year-old (Carly Schroeder) who wants to play soccer at a time when there isn’t a girls’ squad at her school. Couple the sexism Gracie faces with the tragic death of her brother, and you’ve got the stuff that sports movies are made of, right? Well, critics say that \"Gracie\" can be rousing and touching in spots, but it’s ultimately undone by its predictable story arc and a lack of nuance.

What do the critics have to say?Lewis, the main character in \"Meet the Robinsons,\" joins a long line of orphaned Disney protagonists that includes Bambi and Mowgli. And while \"Robinsons\" may not be up to the level of those Disney animated spectacles of old, critics say it’s a fun ride nonetheless. In his quest to find a family that will take him in, Lewis is instead whisked away to the future, where he encounters singing frogs, dinosaurs, and flying cars — all in three dimensions! The critics say the action in \"Meet the Robinsons\" is so frenetic that it makes the antics of Tigger seem positively sedate, but it’s also witty and touching. At 76 percent on the Tomatometer, the pundits are sending a warm coo coo ca-choo to \"Meet the Robinsons.\"Say hello to the American family Robinsons.For those of you who’ve long wondered what the nexus between \"The Cutting Edge\" and \"Elf\" would look like, wait no longer: \"Blades of Glory\" is here. Will Ferrell and Jon Heder star as rival figure skaters who, after an embarrassing throwdown at the World Championships, team up for a shot at redemption. Critics say \"Blades of Glory\" has its share of laughs and an air of transcendental silliness, but it’s not disciplined enough to ensure that those moments translate into a successful whole.

Critics say screenwriter Scott Frank (\"Out of Sight,\" \"Minority Report\"), in his directorial debut, does a terrific job creating believable characters, sharp dialogue, and an engrossing storyline, while Gordon-Levitt continues to prove he’s a talent to watch.

Critics loved the first two, how do they feel about this one?Shrek’s third outing finds our green antihero in an unusual predicament: the king has died, and Shrek is next in line to ascend to the throne. Typically, he wants nothing of it and must set off to find a replacement. Hijinks, fart jokes, and ironic postmodern deconstruction ensue. But critics say \"Third\" has gone too far with the \"Shrek\" formula: it relies too heavily on pop culture references and fairy tale spoofs, marginalizing the heart and charm that made the first two classics. Also, the sheer amount of new and returning characters has given the best characters – Shrek, Donkey, and Fiona – the least screen time in any \"Shrek\" yet. \"Shrek the Third\" is at 42 percent, a far cry from \"Shrek\"’s and \"Shrek 2\"’s 89 and 88 percent Tomatometers, respectively.\"I…am not right-handed.\"And opening in limited release: \"Once,\" a crowd-pleasing drama about two street musicians (check out our interview with director John Carney), is at 100 percent; \"Severance,\" a British import of shock horror and droll comedy, is at 74 percent; \"Brooklyn Rules,\" a drama set in the titular borough circa 1985, is at 56 percent; \"Flanders,\" the new art pic from festival fave Bruno Dumont, is at 50 percent; \"The Wendell Baker Story,\" a light-hearted drama featuring possibly more Wilson Brothers than we’re equipped to handle, is at 40 percent; \"Fay Grim,\" the new action/thriller/comedy from quirky auteur Hal Hartley, is at 40 percent; \"Even Money,\" a cautionary tale about the ills of gambling, is at 20 percent; and \"The Last Sin Eater,\" the second release of Fox Faith’s Christian parable, is at 20 percent.In \"Flanders\" field.And medals, commendations, and accolades to unbreakable_samurai and SplendidIsolation who both came closest to guessing \"Delta Farce\"’s three percent Tomatometer last week.

We know who’ll take the box office, but who emerges victorious with the critics?Another week, another money-printing franchise closes its first trilogy. Johnny Depp returns as Jack Sparrow in \"Pirates of the Caribbean: At World’s End,\" along with his army-sized supporting cast, boundless CGI, and about a dozen unresolved plot threads left over from \"Dead Man’s Chest.\" Sound awesomely excessive? The critics think so too. Except for the awesome part. They contend that when it’s not exhausting the viewer with over-the-top action sequences, \"At World’s End\" is boring the viewer with talky scenes of exposition and strained dialogue. At 53 percent, \"At World’s End\" is on par with \"Dead Man’s Chest,\" but a far cry from the original’s Certified Fresh 79 percent.\"Here’s a trick I learned from the Vulcans.\"Ignoring 1990’s obscure \"The Guardian,\" \"Bug\" represents director William Friedkin’s first major foray into horror since \"The Exorcist.\" Ashley Judd stars as Agnes, a depressed waitress who holes up in a seedy motel (is there any other kind?) with an unstable war veteran who sees creepy crawlies everywhere. The critics are calling this a return to form for Friedkin. Though \"Bug\" descends into incomprehensibility at the end, they’re nevertheless impressed by \"Bug\"’s cinéma vérité camerawork and palpable dread.

What do the critics have to say?Written by Nick Hershey and Alex Vo\"Arthur and the Invisibles\" is a partially animated children’s film from director Luc Besson. Ten-year-old Arthur must find a passage to a magical world populated by tiny little beings called Minimoys in order to save his grandfather’s home. Critics say that the story tries to do too much, and the film wastes the big-name voice talent on a predictable script (including Robert De Niro, Madonna, and Snoop Dogg). In addition, they note that while the animation is interesting, it doesn’t hold up to the current CG standard. At 28 percent on the Tomatometer, \"Arthur and the Invisibles\" may not be something to see.\"Look how you’ve grown! You’re as tall as my ex-boyfriend now.\"Two rival fraternities compete for the allegiance of a street dancer from Los Angeles in \"Stomp the Yard.\" \"Stepping\" is the latest dance, and \"Yard\" has plenty of pep, thanks to appealing performers like Columbus Short and Meagan Good. But critics say that while \"Stomp\" contains impressive musical and dance numbers, it loses its momentum during the intervening soap opera-style subplots. At 27 percent on the Tomatometer, \"Stomp\" doesn’t quite go the extra yard.\"Let’s stomp the desert!\"You wouldn’t expect it from a Yimou Zhang movie, but \"The Curse of the Golden Flower\" is something not to be over-thought, but simply watched. Critics say the film goes to great lengths to visually mesmerize the audience, with enormous sets lavished in gold and silk, jade and brocade, and exquisitely bloody swordfights. But they also say the story is melodramatic. Really melodramatic. At 63 percent on the Tomatometer, this one’s both a blessing and a curse.Apparently they had Jell-O shots in the Tang Dynasty.Like a Hollywood remake of a Larry Clark movie, \"Alpha Dog\" is a glossy yet unflinching look into a violent and hedonistic teenage community. Bruce Willis and Sharon Stone play scene-chewing figures of authority, but critics say it’s Justin Timberlake who’s noteworthy, and the relationship his and Anton Yelchin’s character develop is the emotional tether that holds \"Alpha Dog\" together. The scribes say that while some of the techniques director Nick Cassavetes employs are a bit over the top, he’s able to draw good performances out of the cast. At 63 percent on the Tomatometer, this \"Dog\" has bite.\"Step 1: Cut a hole in a box.\"Looks like we’re starting the year off right: we’re just two weeks into 2007, and already we’ve got a movie that wasn’t screened for critics.

What do the critics have to say?In \"Smokin’ Aces,\" Jeremy Piven plays a soon-to-be government snitch, leading a cavalcade of seedy characters who’ve been sent in to kill, or save him. Or maybe just settle with killing each other. This overstuffed movie features a huge list of cool people doing cool action scenes, but fails to give anybody any semblence of identity. It’s one vapid, bloody sequence after another, though critics are distressed over how long the movie takes to set up the convulted plot and action. At 28 percent Tomatometer, \"Aces\" may be smokin’, but it’s not on fire.\"All we need now is the girl and a pizza place.\"Kevin Smith is certainly full of surprises. First the rumor he’ll do a scary flick, and now his apperance in \"Catch and Release\", a gooey romantic dramadey starring Jennifer Garner as a woman coping with a close death. Kevin Smith is the goofy yet lovable lug, the comic relief in a movie where everyone plays some kind of stock character. It’s a shallow, contrived treatment of a serious subject and with 24 percent on the Tomatometer, \"Catch and Release\" isn’t reeling in the critcs.Worst. Survivor. Ever.We’re going to have you work overtime for this week’s Guess That Tomatometer game. \"Epic Movie,\" which somehow confuses Paris Hilton and \"Borat\" as part of the genre, is the latest of those spoof movies and the latest movie to not be critic screened.\"I neither deny nor confirm that the snozberries taste like snozberries.\"Whenever I hear \"Blood and Chocolate\", it makes me think Elvis Costello, not babes and werewolves. Maybe the title’s signifcance is explained somewhere in the movie, but it’s hard to tell right now since \"Blood and Chocolate\" also isn’t being screened for critics. Guess those Tomatometers.This movie bites.Speaking of guessing Tomatometers, congratulations to mizzoucritic for coming closest last week to guessing the Tomatometer of \"The Hitcher.\"Also opening this week in limited release: \"Seraphim Falls\", a violent Western starring Liam Neeson and Pierce Brosnan, at 54 percent.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"diversity, guild, 99%, politics, marvel, Winners, Mindy, unscripted, bond, e., franchise, canceled","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Critical-Consensus-Smokin-Not-Hot-Release-Hardly-A-Catch-Epic-and-Chocolate-Not-Screened"},{"id":"47508805001121","title":"Critical Consensus: \"911\" Is A (Mildly Funny) Joke; Count \"23\" Out","content":"Critics Consensusvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Incredibles 2 Is Certified FreshPlus, Tag is mildly entertaining and Superfly is more style than substance.by Jeff Giles | June 14, 2018 |  CommentsThis weekend at the movies,&nbsp;we have a belated sequel to a Pixar classic (Incredibles 2, featuring the voices of&nbsp;Holly Hunter&nbsp;and&nbsp;Craig T. Nelson), some of Hollywood’s funniest fellows trying to touch one another without permission (Tag, starring&nbsp;Ed Helms,&nbsp;Jeremy Renner, and Jon Hamm), and a remade blast from the blaxploitation past (Superfly, starring Trevor Jackson&nbsp;and Jason Mitchell).&nbsp;What are the critics saying?Incredibles 2 (2018)  93%If you’re going to try and follow up an acclaimed blockbuster, you might as well take your time getting the sequel right — and in animation, where time can stand still forever, you have the added benefit of not needing to rush your cast back in front of the camera. Still, after waiting nearly 15 years for a second installment of The Incredibles, fans can be forgiven a certain amount of impatience; while the creative teams at formerly franchise-averse Pixar dreamed up new stories for the characters in Toy Story, Cars, Finding Nemo, and Monsters Inc., the ability to return to theaters continued to elude the superpowered Parr family. All that waiting has finally paid off with Incredibles 2, which reunites the original voice cast for a new adventure serving up more of the domestic turmoil, superhero satire, and brilliantly animated action that made the first one such a hit. It’d be tough to improve on the original Incredibles, and critics say that while this sequel doesn’t quite pull off that feat, it comes impressively close, adding yet another acclaimed entry to Pixar’s already estimable filmography. If you were a kid when The Incredibles&nbsp;came out, you might have kids of your own now — and like all the best stuff the studio has put out, the whole family can look forward to enjoying Incredibles 2.Tag (2018)  56%On one hand, it’s easy to believe Hollywood has long since exhausted most of the reasonable possibilities for comedy that exist in movies about grown men acting like boys. On the other, when you’ve got the Wall Street Journal writing about a real-life group of guys who take a month off every year to continue the game of tag they’ve been playing since they were kids, well, it’s awfully hard to resist the temptation to turn that into a film. Enter the descriptively titled Tag, starring Hannibal Buress, Jon Hamm, Ed Helms, Jake Johnson, and Jeremy Renner as the fellows in question — a talented bunch whose commitment to the story was reflected in the set injury Renner sustained, breaking both of his arms and necessitating some last-minute CGI limb replacements in post-production. It would be wonderful to report that Renner’s suffering came in service of one of the year’s best-reviewed action comedies; alas, the truth is that critics are kinda meh on Tag, which reviews describe as funny and engaging in fits and starts, but ultimately not consistent or committed enough to fully deliver on its premise. Still, this is one talented cast, and even the critical pans say the movie isn’t without its moments, so if you’re in the mood for some arrested development laughs, you may want to check your local listings.Superfly (2018)  51%Released in 1972, the original Superfly&nbsp;helped lead the blaxploitation wave with a thoughtful Harlem-set drama about a drug dealer looking for one last big score; the movie’s trappings may look somewhat dated today, but thanks to Ron O’Neal‘s performance as main character Youngblood Priest — not to mention a killer Curtis Mayfield soundtrack — it still feels fresh. It’s easy to understand why music video veteran Director X wanted to take a shot at updating the story, and its themes are just as relevant as they were more than 45 years ago; unfortunately, critics say those themes have mostly been lost in this new version, which is far more focused on style than substance. Starring Trevor Jackson as Priest, the 2018 edition moves the action to Atlanta, but the basic contours of the story remain the same — which is part of why a number of reviews have outlined pundits’ disappointment with the lost social subtext. This Superfly&nbsp;will make its fortune by and by, thanks to Director X’s way with an artfully arranged scene or set piece, but as is so often the case with remakes, the original still reigns supreme.What’s New on TVThe Bold Type: Season 2 (2018)  100%The Bold Type presents an aspirational yet refreshingly realistic portrait of young women’s careers, friendships and love lives in a big city.Strange Angel: Season 1 (2018)  71%A beautiful slow burn, Strange Angel shoots for the stars, but gets a little lost in its own orbit.Also&nbsp;Opening This Week In Limited Release Eating Animals (2018) , a documentary about the commercial factory farming industry and its various impacts, is at 100%.

What do the critics have to say?Eddie Murphy’s searing, Oscar-nominated performance as a James Brown-esque soul singer in \"Dreamgirls\" may be the venerable star’s best work to date. So, what does he do for an encore? \"Norbit,\" a film that critics say is as lowbrow as the day is long. Murphy plays three roles (a nerdy guy, his incredibly brash and obese significant other, and his Asian-American adoptive father), a strategy that paid off in the \"Nutty Professor\" movies. Does it work this time? Not really, say critics; though Murphy gives it his all, the material is crass and largely unfunny. At 21 percent on the Tomatometer, \"Norbit\" is not phat.Eddie Murphy gets in touch with nature.As Hannibal Lecter, Anthony Hopkins created one of the most iconic villains in the movies, a character so morally repugnant and yet so brilliant that audiences could only imagine what was going on inside his head. \"Hannibal Rising\" is an attempt at explanation. As it turns out, young Dr. Lecter (Gaspard Ulliel) went through a lot: he was orphaned, his sister suffered a horrible fate, and he became hell-bent on revenge. The problem with \"Hannibal Rising,\" say critics, is not the direction, as Peter Webber creates an eerie, sinister mood throughout. The scribes say that explaining Hannibal’s motivations reduces the character to a collection of dime-store psychological traits. At 16 percent on the Tomatometer, \"Hannibal Rising\" isn’t much of a cinematic feast.Underage drinking will lead to other problems in life.Also opening this week in limited release: \"The Lives of Others,\" a thriller set during the paranoid days of the East German regime (and a Best Foreign Film Oscar Nominee), is at 93 percent; \"The Decomposition of the Soul,\" a documentary about the tactics of the East German secret police, is at 67 percent; \"Burning Annie,\" an indie comedy about a college kid obsessed with \"Annie Hall,\" is at 29 percent; and \"The Last Sin Eater,\" the tale of a young girl’s search for absolution, is at 17 percent.Praying for a better Tomatometer.And finally, mad props to bribios for correctly guessing \"The Messengers\"’ Tomatometer of 14 percent.

What do the critics have to say?Once upon a time, in the land of make-believe (better known as Hollywood), there was a brand new formula for making dazzling kiddie movies. It was called CG, and children all over the world rejoiced when such fare as \"Toy Story\" and \"Shrek\" hit the theaters. But then an evil curse plagued the land, as a string of mediocre stories threatened to make CG stale. The latest: \"Happily N’Ever After,\" a postmodern \"Cinderella\" spoof. Critics say this is a pretty charm-free affair, with less-than-dazzling images and a bland storyline. At six percent on the Tomatometer, this is a pretty grim fairy tale. And among CG features, only \"Doogal,\" at five percent, is lower-rated.\"Sure, magic will do the dishes, but can it make my movie funny?\"Cedric the Entertainer is a funny guy, and as a supporting player he’s stolen scenes in everything from \"Lemony Snicket\" to \"Be Cool.\" Sadly, he’s yet to have a starring vehicle that has utilized his comedic talents to the fullest, and it appears \"Code Name: The Cleaner\" is no exception. In this action/comedy, Cedric plays a janitor who stumbles into the middle of a government conspiracy, from which he tries to extricate himself with the help of Lucy Liu. The critics say the weak script does none of the actors any favors, playing up absurd thriller elements to leaden effect. At a big fat zero percent on the Tomatometer, this one’s in dire need of a \"Clean-\" up.\"Yes, I’ve always enjoyed the sophisticated yet robust taste of Xtreme Fruit Skittles.\"Liberal and conservative education experts both have it wrong. What our inner city schools need is neither greater funding nor vouchers. In order to save the impoverished students of America, we need an unconventional, no-nonsense teacher to instruct students in ballroom dance, football, or poetry, preferably in the guise of Antonio Banderas, The Rock, or Michelle Pfeiffer. In \"Freedom Writers,\" Hilary Swank plays a fresh-faced teacher who gets her students in touch with their creative writing side, and — wonder of wonders — it’s getting reasonably good reviews. The critics say the film may be clichéd, but it’s earnest and features strong performances. At 64 percent on the Tomatometer, this may be one to \"Write\" home about.\"Remember, Bagels for Complacency Day is next week.\"Director Alfonso Cuaron may have made his best movie yet with \"Children of Men,\" continuing a hot streak that began with \"Y Tu Mama Tambien\" and \"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban.\" This time, Cuaron has envisioned a world where women have become infertile and every country has become a dystopia or slipped into a fascist state.

What do the critics have to say?If there’s one thing critics can agree on with \"Charlotte’s Web,\" it’s how much they all loved the children’s novel. If there’s another, it’s how much they like the big screen adaptation, about a bunch of talking farm animals and a pig saved by a very literate spider. Though some feared that the simple story would be modernized with the ironic and brash attitudes afflicting recent kid flicks, the pundits are in awe of the quiet, humble replication of E.B. White’s genteel and distinguished prose. Also, they really like Robert Redford doing the voice of Ike the wussy horse. At 89 percent Tomatometer, this is some movie, indeed.\"How about you and I cruise in my Power Wheels sometime?\"Will Smith has been in pursuit of an Oscar for a while, and with \"The Pursuit of Happyness\" the critics think this could be where he catches up with the Academy. Smith, as a homeless single father trying to climb the corporate ladder, is garnering widespread praise for his performance, though said praise isn’t quite being doled out upon the film itself. The critics are calling \"Happyness\" a slick Hallmark card of a movie, a bit too obsessed with the desire to inspire. At 56 percent on the Tomatometer, the critics are split on whether \"Happyness\" is worth it for Smith’s heartfelt presence alone.\"Once upon a time, in the Kingdom of Periodic Stock Dividends…\"Scribes have posited several excuses as to the overwhelming awfulness of \"Eragon\" (the movie’s source books were written by a teenager, it’s being directed by a first-timer, etc.), but few critics are terribly forgiving of the derivative plot. \"Eragon\" spins a tale of a peasant boy (Speleers) who is suddenly entrusted with a dragon and must, with the help of a mentor (Irons), train, grow strong, and defeat an evil emperor. The way the critics describe it, the makers of the \"Star Wars\"-esque\"Eragon\" should soon be expecting an annoyed phone call from George Lucas, though the movie’s current nine percent Tomatometer might be insult enough.

What do the critics have to say?It may be based on The Greatest Story Ever Told, but critics say \"The Nativity Story\" is hardly the greatest movie ever made — or even a particularly good one. In case you need a refresher on the origins of the upcoming holiday that may be the occasion for you to receive a Playstation 3, \"The Nativity Story\" tells the tale of a teenager named Mary (Keisha Castle-Hughes) who is to give birth to the savior of mankind — all the while dealing with political persecution and lousy hotel service. Critics say the film is too safe (strange, given director Catherine Hardwicke‘s previous films about remarkable young people, \"Thirteen\" and \"Lords of Dogtown\"), adding little spark to the most inspirational (and familiar) of sagas. \"The Nativity Story\" currently stands at 26 percent on the Tomatometer.Mary, don’t you weep.\"Turistas\" continues a mini-trend in slasher films that began with \"Hostel\": arrogant Americans getting their comeuppance in foreign locales. In this case, a group of youngsters are terrorized in Brazil after they fall into the clutches of a mad organ harvester. While some critics have praised the film’s political undertones and better-than-average tension, most say \"Turistas\" adds little to a stale genre. At 38 percent on the Tomatometer, this tourist trap may be worth avoiding.\"Turistas\": Return I won’t to old Brazil.\"Van Wilder: The Rise of Taj\" was not screened for critics, which may indicate that it has the potential to sink like a stone with the scribes.

What do the critics say?It’s an election year, so it seems like a pretty good time to satirize our cherished democratic process, right? Perhaps, but the critics don’t believe \"Man of the Year,\" starring Robin Williams and Laura Linney, is the movie to do it. Williams plays a late night talk show host who runs for president as a joke — only to find the electorate is more receptive to his campaign than he thought. Critics say the film benefits from some good performances — including Linney and Christopher Walken as Williams’ manager — but writer-director Barry Levinson‘s script doesn’t know whether it’s a satire, a thriller, or a romantic comedy. Worse, this political send-up lacks bite when it comes to, well, politics. At 21 percent on the Tomatometer, \"Man of the Year\" is dipping in the polls.Watch as sparks fly between Linney and Williams in \"Man of the Year.\"It seems it is a momentous time to be a wide-release movie. This week, not one, not two, but three films were not screened for the scribes!First up, we’ve got \"The Grudge 2,\" starring Amber Tamblyn and Sarah Michelle Gellar in a sequel to director Takashi Shimizu‘s 2004 remake of his own Japanese-language horror flick, \"Ju-On.\" The first \"Grudge\" garnered 40 percent on the Tomatometer; go ahead and guess how the pale-faced little ghost boy and his frighteningly hirsute mother will fare this time around.The Grudge does everything in her power to prevent critics from screening her latest.Next, there’s \"The Marine,\" WWE Films’ fourth release starring pro-wrestler John Cena as an Iraq vet who must rescue his kidnapped wife from bad guys. The last WWE release, \"See No Evil,\" scored a miniscule Tomatometer of 6 percent. If it helps to Guess The Tomatometer for \"The Marine,\" the freestyling Cena was known back in his WWE days as the \"Marky Mark of wrestling.\"Not screened for critics — it’s hard to believe, I know.And finally, completing the trifecta of this week’s releases not screened for critics, we have \"One Night With The King,\" Fox Faith’s second theatrical release geared toward the Christian set. In this retelling of the Book of Esther, a young Jewish girl (newcomer Tiffany DuPont) grows up to save her people; screen greats Omar Sharif, Peter O’Toole and John Rhys-Davies fill out the cast.

We’ve got a school for Coast Guard rescue swimmers (\"The Guardian,\" starring Kevin Coster and Kutcher again). And we’ve got a school…for scoundrels (\"School for Scoundrels,\" starring Billy Bob Thornton and Jon Heder). Which of these flicks will get a passing grade from critics?\"Open Season,\" Sony Pictures Animation’s first picture, features the voices of Martin Lawrence and Ashton Kutcher as a grizzly bear and a deer, respectively, who must team up after getting stranded in the woods at the start of hunting season. Critics say that despite some impressive visuals and funny sequences, \"Open Season\" does little to distinguish itself from the recent glut of CG kiddie films. At 43 percent on the Tomatometer, you should turn, turn, turn away from this middling \"Season.\"Martin Bear: \"Say it, Ashton. Say I was funny on Martin!\"Ashton Deer: \"I’m Ashton Kutcher! I was on That 70’s Show!\"Kevin Costner makes a hopeful return to the action genre in \"The Guardian,\" in which he plays a veteran U.S. Coast Guard officer who must mentor a cocky young upstart played by Ashton Kutcher. The film features intense training sequences, dramatic rescue scenes, and the requisite love story. Sound familiar? Critics seem to think so, calling it a cliched mix of \"An Officer and a Gentleman\" and \"Top Gun,\" with a predictable storyline. At 40 percent on the Tomatometer, \"The Guardian\" needs rescuing.\"Oh, man… Finally, a funny ‘Waterworld‘ joke!\"Director Todd Phillips brings us his latest comedy \"School for Scoundrels,\" about a nerdy meter maid (Jon Heder) who takes confidence building classes from a smarmy instructor (Billy Bob Thornton). When the student gains the confidence to ask out his longtime crush, he discovers he must compete with the teacher for her affections. Most critics are in agreement that the real scoundrels are the screenwriters who couldn’t devise a script worthy of the considerable acting talent involved.

What do the critics have to say?Jagshemash! Here in U.S and A., what do critic say about \"Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan?\" They like! In fact, the scribes are almost universally pleased with the film, and some are going as far as calling it one of the funniest comedies ever. Part satire, part shockumentary, \"Borat\" follows the gleefully sexist, homophobic, and anti-Semitic title character (Cohen) on a cross-country trek to learn more about our strange nation; along the way he dredges up the seamy underbelly of American prejudice and ignorance. At 95 percent on the Tomatometer, \"Borat\" is not only Certified Fresh, it’s the best reviewed wide release of the year, topping such acclaimed movies as \"Dave Chappelle’s Block Party,\" \"The Departed,\" and \"United 93.\" That’s a good thing, since Borat himself has said if the movie doesn’t do well, he will be execute.Borat loves the U.S. and A.It doesn’t sound like the most auspicious subject for a film: mice and rats are flushed down a toilet, where they find a bustling municipality in the sewer. However, in the hands of Aardman Productions, the endlessly imaginative company responsible for \"Chicken Run\" and \"Wallace and Gromit,\" anything is possible. And so it is with \"Flushed Away,\" which tells the upstairs-downstairs tale of a coddled mouse who finds action and adventure after a trip through the plumbing. Critics say that while \"Flushed Away\" may not achieve the dizzying heights of \"Wallace &amp; Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit\" (which scored 95 percent on the Tomatometer), it’s an eccentric, inventive family film with plenty of laughs. At 76 percent on the Tomatometer, \"Flushed Away\" is critically sanitized for your viewing pleasure.Dive in! It’s fresh!\"The Santa Clause 3: The Escape Clause,\" was barely screened for critics, much like star Tim Allen‘s last flick, \"Zoom.\" The big difference is that \"Clause\" at least has a couple good reviews, whereas \"Zoom\" had none. The story of Santa’s duel with Jack Frost for control over Christmas, \"Clause\" hasn’t exactly enchanted the critics who have seen it; they say the movie is labored and mostly mirthless.

What do the critics have to say?The sheer awfulness of South Africa’s apartheid system has been grist for Hollywood’s mill in recent years, but Phillip Noyce’s \"Catch a Fire\" may be one of the subgenre’s strongest entries to date. \"Fire\" tells the true story of Patrick Chamusso (Derek Luke), a dedicated family man falsely accused of terrorism who in turn becomes a radical rebel fighter against the apartheid government. Critics say the film works as both a political thriller and as a potent history lesson, and it features a particularly strong performance from Luke. At 77 percent on the Tomatometer, you may want to \"Catch\" this one. (Check out RT editor Jen Yamato’s review from the Toronto Film Fest here.)\"If you are the big tree/ We are the small axe/ Ready to cut you down (well sharp)/ To cut you down.\"Augusten Burroughs’ memoir \"Running with Scissors\" struck a nerve as a bizarre depiction of dysfunctional families and a culture of therapy among the privileged. Unfortunately, it doesn’t appear the movie adaptation will do the same. The film is a coming-of-age story about a young man whose unstable mother sends him to live with her therapist’s family, at which point his life only gets weirder. The critics say the film features some sharp performances — particularly by Annette Bening — but also note the film is too awash with mannered eccentricity and cartoonish caricatures rather than fully developed characters. At 33 percent on the Tomatometer, this one’s \"Running\" on fumes.\"Listen doc, let me start off by saying I hate your socks.\"They say the first cut is the deepest. And if the fact that it hasn’t been screened for critics is any indication, it appears that in the case of \"Saw III,\" the blade’s gotten pretty dull.

What do the critics have to say?Is America a great country? Yes. Do the soldiers who fought in WWII, the Greatest Generation, deserve our utmost praise for their sacrifices? Without a doubt. Is the truth often more complicated than the myth? Definitely. Clint Eastwood‘s latest, \"Flags of Our Fathers,\" tells the story of that famous photo of the servicemen raising the flag atop Iwo Jima, and the trials and tribulations their celebrity caused. Critics say the film is so rich with historical information and inherent drama that it’s occasionally a little too much, but strong performances and Eastwood’s sure directorial hand keep things on track. At 69 percent on the Tomatometer, \"Flags\" may not reach the heights of Eastwood’s last film, \"Million Dollar Baby\" (92 percent), but it’s still flying pretty high. (Check out our feature on Clint’s filmography here.)Clint Eastwood pays tribute to the Greatest Generation.With \"Memento,\" Christopher Nolan made a name for himself by holding his secrets close to the vest to the bitter end. Now comes \"The Prestige,\" in which the director again serves up a brain-teaser, this time involving a pair of public manipulators in their own right. Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman star as bitterly competitive magicians in turn-of- the-century London who play a deadly game of one-upmanship. While some scribes say the movie is uneven in spots, \"The Prestige\" is winning praise for its remarkable production design, sharp performances, and more than enough cinematic sleight-of-hand to keep audiences interested. At 68 percent, this is Nolan’s worst reviewed film, and it’s still getting its share of prestige.\"Headlines don’t sell papes. Newsies sell papes.\"There is no shortage of stories involving adolescents and their beloved equine friends, from Steinbeck‘s \"The Red Pony\" to \"The Black Stallion\" to last year’s \"Dreamer.\" Critics say \"Flicka,\" itself a remake, is a strong and affecting entry into this sub-genre. The film stars Alison Lohman as a 16-year-old who loves her untamed horse and the freedom of the open range, and Tim McGraw as her father, a man with different ideas about her future. Some critics say \"Flicka\" is an old-fashioned, solid family drama with a notable lack of schmaltz, but others say the material is too well-trodden to really hit home. At 60 percent on the Tomatometer, \"Flicka\" ain’t Secretariat, but it’s not ready for the glue factory, either.\"Flicka\": Full of horsing around!In the song \"Natural’s Not In It,\" the socialist British post-punk band Gang of Four sarcastically lamented \"the problem of leisure / what to do for pleasure,\" words that are especially resonant if you’re a teenage monarch ruling a country you know little about, and your subjects are calling for your head. Sofia Coppola‘s long-awaited (and already controversial) \"Marie Antoinette\" tells the story of the queen (Kirsten Dunst), her inattentive husband, Louis XVI (Jason Schwartzman), her gossipy, silver-tongued court, and all the empty fun she had before she gets her head chopped off. Critics say Coppola’s film offers a wealth of visual riches and makes Marie’s hardships somewhat empathetic, but they’re split over its apparent lack of substance, as well as the anachronistic use of music by the likes of New Order, the Strokes, and Siouxsie and the Banshees. At 64 percent on the Tomatometer, this is definitely a cut (pun intended) below Coppola’s last feature, \"Lost in Translation\" (95 percent), but it’s still a pretty tasty piece of cake.\"A new royal family / A wild nobility / We are the family.\"Also opening this week in limited release: \"51 Birch Street,\" a documentary exploring the hidden lives of the filmmaker Doug Block’s parents, is at 100 percent on the Tomatometer; \"Requiem,\" a German tale of epilepsy/demonic possession, is at 100 percent; Tim Burton‘s stop motion anti-holiday classic \"The Nightmare Before Christmas,\" getting a re-release, is at 96 percent; \"Sweet Land,\" a sweeping tale of the American immigrant experience, is at 93 percent; \"Jonestown: The Life and Death of Peoples Temple,\" a documentary about cult leader Jim Jones and his flock, is at 92 percent; \"Hair High,\" a perverse animated comedy about a strange high school, is at 63 percent; \"Sleeping Dogs Lie,\" Bobcat Goldthwait‘s sweet, taboo-busting rom-com, is at 59 percent; and \"Running with Scissors,\" a tale of therapy and growing pains starring Annette Bening and Gwyneth Paltrow, is at 17 percent.Recent Clint Eastwood-Directed Movies:————————————————-92% — Million Dollar Baby (2004)86% — Mystic River (2003)56% — Blood Work (2002)78% — Space Cowboys (2000)50% — True Crime (1999)Recent Kirsten Dunst Movies:————————————–28% — Elizabethtown (2005)62% — Wimbledon (2004)7% — Kaena: The Prophesy (2004)93% — Spider Man 2 (2004)93% — Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (2004)Recent Christian Bale Movies:————————————59% — The New World (2005)84% — Batman Begins (2005)85% — Howl’s Moving Castle (2005)72% — The Machinist (2004)68% — Laurel Canyon (2003)","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"hard, children's, rotten, aapi, Fox, SundanceTV, stand-up, scorecard, Tumblr, Netflix, technology, indiana, Fox, Geographic, BAFTA","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Critical-Consensus-Flags-Flies-High-The-Prestige-Is-Magic-Flicka-Is-A-Pretty-Good-Ride-Marie-Antoinette-Spared-Critical-Guillotine"},{"id":"47508808030137","title":"Critical Consensus: \"Crank\" Is Well-Ranked;  \"Illusionist\" Is Magic, \"Crossover\" Is An Air-Ball, \"Wicker Man\" Gets Burned","content":"Critics Consensusvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Critical Consensus: \"Crank\" Is Well-Ranked; \"Illusionist\" Is Magic, \"Crossover\" Is An Air-Ball, \"Wicker Man\" Gets Burnedby Tim Ryan | August 31, 2006 |  CommentsThis week at the movies, we’ve got hoopsters with big dreams (\"Crossover,\" starring Anthony Mackie), scary goings-on on remote islands (\"The Wicker Man,\" starring Nicolas Cage), fast, fast vehicles (\"Crank,\" starring Jason Statham and Amy Smart), and magic (\"The Illusionist,\" starring Edward Norton and Jessica Biel). What do the critics say?If you want realism, go rent \"The Bicycle Thief.\" Critics say \"Crank\" is a ludicrously over-the-top action flick with nary a moment of probability. And that’s a good thing. The story involves a hit man (Statham) who must stay awake to complete his mission and get out of the business. The critics say the film makes precious little sense and eschews both the laws of physics and political correctness. They also note that it is a lot of fun, with terrific action sequences and a knowing sense of humor. Why this movie wasn’t shown to critics beforehand is beyond us, since at 75 percent on the Tomatometer it’s the best reviewed unscreened film of the year, beating out \"Snakes on a Plane\" (69 percent).It appears Jason Statham’s alarm isn’t working again.\"The Wicker Man\" wasn’t screened for critics either, and this time, it looks like there was a good reason for that. Critics say Neil LaBute‘s remake of the 1973 cult classic subtracts most of the subtext of the original and replaces it with tons of unintentional laughs. Cage stars as a cop who gets ensnared in sinister rituals on a remote island while searching for his girlfriend’s missing child. Scribes say the film was misconceived from the get-go and contains a startling amount of sexism. At 11 percent on the Tomatometer, this \"Wicker Man\" is getting burned. It’s also well below the original (89 percent).Movie critics tried a bunch of disguises in an attempt to sneak into screanings of \"The Wicker Man.\"One of the reasons streetball is so much fun to watch is its sheer unpredictability. The critics say the opposite is the case with the hoops drama \"Crossover.\" The film tells the story of Noah (Mackie), a talented kid who hopes to get to med school with an assist from his hoops scholarship, but must deal with the full court press of some of his relationships. The critics are treating \"Crossover\" the way Dikembe Mutombo would handle a shot in his direction. They say the film is too by-the-numbers to be dramatic. At zero percent on the Tomatometer, \"Crossover\" is tied with \"Zoom\" (each of which have 46 rotten reviews) for the title of worst reviewed film of the year.\"Run, Anthony Mackie! Run for your life! Get help!\"\"The Illusionist\" goes wide this week, and the critics are largely under the spell of this Sundance-approved period mystery. The film tells the tale of Eisenheim (Norton), a magician who runs afoul with the authorities for his feats of illusion and his romance with the prince’s fiancée (Biel). The scribes are praising \"The Illusionist\" for its remarkable set design, sweeping romance, and its twisty plot. It currently stands at 75 percent on the Tomatometer, good enough for Certified Fresh status.In \"The Illusionist,\" Ed Norton plays a man outstanding in his field — or is it out walking? (Thank you.

What do the critics have to say?“Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl” was a delightful left field surprise: a funny, rollicking, swashbuckling adventure (as well as the greatest film ever based on an amusement park ride). So what does director Gore Verbinski do for an encore? According to critics, more, more, more. And that’s not necessarily a good thing. In “Dead Man’s Chest,” Johnny Depp is back as the scoundrel Jack Sparrow, with Keira Knightley and Orlando Bloom along for the ride, this time aboard a craft containing the cephalopodan Davy Jones and his crew. The scribes say that while there are plenty of interesting effects and exciting set pieces, there’s just too much in this “Chest,” and it lacks the easygoing, organic charm of the original. At 55 percent on the Tomatometer, this “Pirates'” life may or may not be for you. And it’s well below the high watermark set by the original (at 79 percent).“Dead Man’s Chest”: Rated ARRRGH!The writings of Philip K. Dick have inspired a bunch of good-to-great movies (“Blade Runner,” “Total Recall,” “Minority Report“) and it’s easy to see why: Dick spun futuristic, Orwellian sci-fi tales that are chock full of paranoia and multilayered plot points. With “A Scanner Darkly,” Richard Linklater adapts Dick’s novel with the rotoscoping techniques he applied to “Waking Life.” The story involves a cop (Keanu Reeves) who is so far undercover in a drug investigation that it’s unclear he’ll ever find his way out. The critics say this one’s a visually arresting head trip, but some say it’s not quite as compelling as it wants to be. At 63 percent on the Tomatometer, this one may be worth a “Scan.”“You’re sayin’ the FBI’s gonna pay me to learn to surf?”Also in theaters, albeit in limited release: “Once in a Lifetime,” a documentary about the New York Cosmos soccer team of the 1970s, is at 90 percent on the Tomatometer, and “Heading South,” starring Charlotte Rampling, is at 62 percent.Recent Johnny Depp Movies:————————————31% — The Libertine (2005)83% — Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (2005)83% — Corpse Bride (2005)84% — Finding Neverland (2004)47% — Secret Window (2004)Recent Richard Linklater Movies:—————————————-47% — The Bad News Bears (2005)94% — Before Sunset (2004)90% — School of Rock (2003)75% — Tape (2001)79% — Waking Life (2001)","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"It","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"critical-consensus-dead-mans-chest-is-overstuffed-scanner-shines-darkly"},{"id":"47508808037308","title":"Critical Consensus: \"Descent\" and \"Talledega\" Leave \"Listener\" and \"Barnyard\" in the Dust","content":"Critics Consensusvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Critical Consensus: \"Descent\" and \"Talledega\" Leave \"Listener\" and \"Barnyard\" in the Dustby Jen Yamato | August 3, 2006 |  CommentsThis week in movies, we’ve got tough chicks fighting for their lives (\"The Descent\"), a redneck racing saga (\"Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby\"), a psychological thriller starring Mork from Ork (\"The Night Listener\"), and farm animals who just wanna have fun (\"Barnyard: The Original Party Animals\"). Which flicks will get the critical seal of approval?\"The Descent\" — Certified Fresh!Two constants in Hollywood are that (A) foreign flicks generally don’t have widespread appeal and (B) horror flicks don’t get critical praise, like, ever. \"The Descent,\" about six female spelunkers whose weekend cave-diving adventure turns deadly, has defied these tenets — a low-budget import from Scotland, of all places, this female-driven frightener has critics on the edges of their popcorn-strewn seats. The scribes say that director Neil Marshall (\"Dog Soldiers\") has masterfully created a claustrophobe’s nightmare, and has added a compelling meditation on morality, vengeance, and the depths to which we might go for human survival. High marks also go to the cast of relatively unknown actresses, who manage to balance sex appeal and strength as believable adventuresses. At 90 percent, this gory thriller has earned RT’s Certified Fresh stamp — and is on track to becoming the best-reviewed horror film of the year!\"Talladega Nights\" — sponsored by Wonder Bread and Old SpicePerennial jester Will Ferrell stars as hard-driven, bumbling NASCAR ace Ricky Bobby in \"Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby,\" a high-octane comedy set in the all-American world of race car driving. Inescapably drawing comparisons to 2004’s \"Anchorman\" (which, like \"Talladega,\" starred Ferrell and was co-written by director Adam McKay), there’s no doubt that Ferrell is on his comedic game in this sweet-natured send-up of the NASCAR world. Critics also agree on the strength of Ferrell’s supporting cast (including John C. Reilly as Ricky Bobby’s steadfast racing buddy, and British comedian Sacha Baron Cohen (\"Da Ali G Show\") as his scene-stealing gay French rival). But is it funny? While the largely-improvised laughs are occasionally uneven, critics say the highs are indeed hilarious and worth the ride. At 73 percent on the Tomatometer, go ahead and buckle up for \"Talladega.\"Robin Williams in the JT Leroy-ish thriller, \"The Night Listener\"\"The Night Listener\" marks another revisiting of comic genius Robin Williams to that oh-so-foreign milieu — dramatic acting — in a psychological thriller adapted from Armistead Maupin’s story of the same name. Williams plays Gabriel, a lonely nighttime radio host who forges a relationship with a young abuse victim named Pete (Rory Culkin), but begins to question the truth behind Pete’s story; eventually, he wonders if Pete really exists at all. The critics say that, despite a real-life relevancy in light of such fictitious media sensations as J.T. Leroy, any suspensefulness built up by Patrick Stettner‘s creepy, atmospheric direction fizzles out with muddled storytelling; perhaps, too, funnyman Williams has been slightly miscast in a sad-sack role that requires more believable misery. However, many scribes are quick to point out the film’s unusually brief 81-minute runtime, if that gives you any more incentive to buy a ticket, but at 45 percent on the Tomatometer, you probably want to tune out this \"Listener.\"When the farmer’s asleep, the cows cut loose in \"Barnyard\"Are you in the mood for an animated tale of farm animals who party when the humans aren’t looking? How about one with a rebellious boy cow as the hero? \"Barnyard\" offers up such fare with the story of Otis (voiced by Kevin James), a fun-loving cow who would rather carouse about the farm than protect its denizens from ravenous coyotes, a duty that his father (Sam Elliott) tries in vain to impart to him. With a voice cast that includes Wanda Sykes and Courteney Cox, \"Barnyard\" aims for comedic targets in the form of anthropomorphized animal laughs, gross humor, and sight gags (courtesy of \"Ace Ventura: When Nature Calls\" director Steve Oedekirk) — lowbrow humor that, critics moan, appeal only to the senses of children under the age of eight. Unfortunately for the chaperones of the target demographic, aside from some spontaneous musical numbers and a few adult-oriented jokes, there’s not much here to entertain grown-ups. At 33 percent, \"Barnyard\" is only for parents who love their kids enough to sit through it.Also opening this week, albeit in limited release: \"My Country, My Country,\" a political documentary about the Iraq 2005 election, is at 100 percent; French romantic thriller \"The Bridesmaid\" is at 83 percent; the coming-of-age tale (and Sundance fave) \"Quinceanera\" is at 81 percent; retiree rom-com \"The Boynton Beach Club\" is at 55 percent; the prison cell drama \"Jailbait\" is at 14 percent; and gay teen drama \"Vacationland\" is at — gulp — 0 percent.Recent Will Ferrell Movies:—————————————————————————–Curious George – 69%Winter Passing – 41%Melinda &amp; Melinda – 51%Kicking and Screaming – 43%Bewitched – 25%","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"RT21, Cannes, Walking, books, Reality, CBS, nfl","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Critical-Consensus-Descent-and-Talledega-Leave-Listener-and-Barnyard-in-the-Dust"},{"id":"47508808046529","title":"Critical Consensus: \"Superman\" And \"Devil\" Are Certified Fresh","content":"Critics Consensusvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Critical Consensus: \"Superman\" And \"Devil\" Are Certified Freshby Tim Ryan | June 29, 2006 |  CommentsThis week’s wide releases both involve publishing. In \"The Devil Wears Prada,\" the setting is a fashion magazine, and in \"Superman Returns,\" it’s The Daily Planet. So maybe that’s why the critics like both these movies so much…While there has been some debate over the quality of Lauren Weisberger’s novel \"The Devil Wears Prada,\" there’s less divergence over the movie adaptation, particularly because of the presence of Meryl Streep in the titular role. Anne Hathaway plays an earnest small-town girl who hopes to write high-minded stuff for the New Yorker, but is little match for the Cruella De Ville-esque Miranda Priestly (Streep). The scribes say the film ultimately works because of Streep’s excellent performance, but \"The Devil Wears Prada\" is also an incisive examination of workplace politics. At 76 percent on the Tomatometer, this \"Devil\" wears a Certified Fresh badge.After a long, arduous trial, Meryl Streep was acquitted by the fashion police, but convicted by the sunglass police.You may have heard that there’s a new Superman movie out. It’s called \"Superman Returns,\" and it stars a relative unknown as the Man of Steel (Brandon Routh), an actress who was in that Bobby Darin movie (Kate Bosworth), and the guy who played Bobby Darin himself in that same movie, this time playing Lex Luthor (Kevin Spacey). (Dude, he was probably Keyzer Soze as well) The critics say \"Superman Returns\" is able to pull off the neat trick of sticking closely to the age-old particulars of the Superman myth, while making them fresh. \"Superman Returns\" is at 76 percent on the Tomatometer, and it’s Certified Fresh.\"I’ll have a root beer float, hold the kryptonite.\"This is a week of well-reviewed releases in general.

What do the critics have to say?I’m sure I speak for much of humanity when I say that each time I see Jack Black in a wrestling outfit on the posters for \"Nacho Libre,\" I chuckle to myself. Heartily. The critics, who’ve actually seen the movie, have been a little less charitable. Black stars as a man who becomes a wrestler to raise money for orphans who live in the monastery where he grew up. While some critics say the film has its share of laughs, others say the sophomore effort of Jared (\"Napoleon Dynamite\") Hess is the very definition of sophomoric. At 49 percent on the Tomatometer, this \"Nacho\" is only sort of tasty. And it’s nowhere near \"Dynamite\" (71 percent).\"Nacho Libre:\" Let’s get ready to rumble!In the third installment of the \"Fast and the Furious\" franchise, a new collection of thrill seekers head to Japan to engage in \"drifting,\" that exciting brand of motorsport that values oversteering. Let’s be honest: Nobody is going to this one for anything but action, nifty driving, and other assorted cheap thrills (this ain’t \"Two-Lane Blacktop\"). And even utilizing those limited criteria, \"The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift\" only attains a modest amount of success. The critics say that while the driving sequences are reasonably cool, the characters are about as well-crafted as a pinewood-derby cart that ends up in a ditch. It’s currently at 41 percent on the Tomatometer, trailing the original \"F&amp;F\" (at 50 percent).\"Tokyo Drift\": Faster and furious to an even greater degreeThere are a lot of reasons relationships don’t work out. Sometimes couples live too far apart, or have vastly different schedules. But what about a couple communicating across a two-year time difference — can this relationship be saved? Unfortunately for \"The Lake House,\" starring Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock, the answer appears to be no. The critics say the film’s premise (it’s a remake of the 2002 Korean film \"Il Mare\") is not necessarily a bad idea, but the execution is off; the film is neither effective as a romance or as a metaphysical puzzle. At 32 percent on the Tomatometer, this \"House\" looks like a fixer-upper. And how does it compare with \"Speed,\" the last Reeves/Bullock collabo? Do you even need to ask?\"I should probably tell you that I’m taking the bus because I had my driver’s license revoked.\"The scribes’ response to \"Garfield: A Tale of Two Kitties\" has prompted Critical Consensus to paraphrase from Charles Dickens‘ \"A Tale of Two Cities\": \"[The critics] looked at [Garfield] sideways with a stronger concentration of keenness, closeness, and dislike, than was comportable with its wearer’s assumption of indifference.\" The operative words here are \"indifference\" and \"dislike,\" as critics say \"Garfield\" wastes a talented voice cast (Bill Murray, Bob Hoskins, Tim Curry) in a dull, relatively laugh-free plot. At 17 percent on the Tomatometer, the scribes have one thing to say: Bad \"Kitties!\" (By the way, the original was at 13 percent.)\"Garfield:\" Let’s get ready to rumble… again!Also this week, in limited release: \"Wordplay,\" a doc about New York Times crossword puzzle editor Will Shortz, is at 89 percent; G.W.

An average Joe tries to play pro football (\"Invincible,\" starring Mark Wahlberg), the new kid in school tries to ward off bullies by consuming soft-bodied invertebrates (\"How to Eat Fried Worms\"), a ragtag bunch tries to win an international keg-tapping contest (\"Beerfest,\" starring Broken Lizard), and two struggling 1930s musicians try for a big break (\"Idlewild,\" starring Outkast). What do the critics have to say?Pity the poor Philly football fan. Despite some recent success, the Eagles haven’t had a championship season since 1960. I’ll bet a lot of residents of the City of Brotherly Love think they could do better themselves. Well, \"Invincible\" tells the true story of a guy who felt that way… and was right. Mark Wahlberg stars as an over-the-hill substitute teacher and bartender who shows up at an open tryout and wows coach Dick Vermeil (Greg Kinnear) with his speed and skills despite never playing ball in college. The critics say what could have been another clichéd sports drama is elevated by strong performances by Wahlberg and Kinnear, as well as a palpable sense of time and place. \"Invincible\" is at 74 percent on the Tomatometer.\"I am a star. I’m a star, I’m a star, I’m a star. I am a big, bright, shining star.\"Despite a title that conjures images of a pre-teen \"Fear Factor,\" the critics say \"How to Eat Fried Worms\" is actually quite tame — or quaint — compared with much of contemporary family fare. Although its youthful cast contribute solid performances, the critics say \"Worms\" doesn’t quite live up to the standard set by the classic children’s book of the same name. Still, they also say the film is good-natured fun for the kids. At 61 percent on the Tomatometer, \"Worms\" is a reasonably appetizing item on the cinematic menu.Well, in France they eat snails….Those Broken Lizard folks are at it again, with another gleefully juvenile movie that should appeal to their cult audience while confounding the critics. Sort of like \"Dodgeball\" for the pub set, \"Beerfest\" tells the tale of a group of misfits who take on the world in an international beer drinking contest. While critics concede that there are more than a few moments of boozy, tasteless fun, they also say the film, at 111 minutes, is a little too hit and miss to justify its running time. At 51 percent on the Tomatometer, \"Beerfest\" is a little too sudsy. Still, it’s the best reviewed Broken Lizard film, beating \"Super Troopers,\" which scored 36 percent.\"Beerfest\": More subtle, sophisticated humor from Broken LizardAin’t nobody dope as Outkast — in the studio. The silver screen may be a different matter. Big Boi and Andre 3000 bring their Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik to a story set in the Depression era south in \"Idlewild.\" Critics say that with the musical scenes, the cast are the type of people make the club get crunk. But, ah ha, what’s that fuss, then? Well, the scribes say there’s too little of Outkast’s power music electric revival, and the plot gets bogged down in clichés. At 52 percent on the Tomatometer, critics don’t love the way \"Idlewild\" moves — but don’t hate it either.\"Idlewild\": \"Crocodile on my feet/ Fox fur on my back/ Bowtie ’round my neck/ That’s why they call me the gangsta mack/ In the Cadillac.\"Also in theaters this week in limited release: \"Old Joy,\" an exploration of friendship starring indie darling Will Oldham, is at 100 percent; \"LOL,\" a no-budget tale of hipsters and technology, is at 100 percent; \"Princesas,\" a story of friendship between prostitutes in Madrid, is at 70 percent; \"Rolling Family,\" sort of like an Argentine \"Little Miss Sunshine,\" is at 63 percent; the Spanish sex comedy \"Queens\" is at 57 percent; and the Elisha Cuthbert/ Camilla Belle psychological thriller \"The Quiet\" is at 27 percent.Recent Mark Wahlberg Movies:————————————–52% — Four Brothers (2005)60% — I Heart Huckabees (2004)73% — The Italian Job (2003)33% — The Truth about Charlie (2002)52% — Rock Star (2001)Recent Big Boi and Andre 3000 Movies:—————————————————62% — ATL (2006)52% — Four Brothers (2005)29% — Be Cool (2005)","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"bad, york, Reality, Calendar","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Critical-Consensus-Invincible-Worms-Score-Idlewild-Beerfest-Mixed"},{"id":"47508808047554","title":"Critical Consensus: \"Click\" Doesn’t, Ahem, Click; \"Waist\" Isn’t Deep Enough","content":"Critics Consensusvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Critical Consensus: \"Click\" Doesn't, Ahem, Click; \"Waist\" Isn't Deep Enoughby Tim Ryan | June 22, 2006 |  CommentsThis week at the movies, we’ve got a magical remote control (\"Click\") and a father who’s trying to rescue his son (\"Waist Deep\"). Will the critics dig \"Deep?\" Will they pick \"Click?\"Adam Sandler‘s latest, \"Click,\" traffics in a premise that most of us have probably considered at one point or another: Wouldn’t it be cool if we could control everything around us with the push of a button? And would that necessarily be a good thing? But lemme tell you something about Hollywood, kids: good ideas are a dime a dozen. And the critics say \"Click,\" like an aimless round of channel surfing, is pretty inconsistent, veering from yuks early on to goopy sentiment toward the end. It’s at 22 percent on the Tomatometer, but we know that Adam Sandler is pretty critic-proof; his average Tomatometer is 29 percent, and we love him anyway.Adam Sandler \"Clicks\" with the Fonz! Heyyyy!\"Waist Deep\" is an attempt to cross gritty urban action with a story of redemption; unfortunately, according to critics, it’s not terribly successful. The plot involves an ex-con, played by Tyrese Gibson, who must venture outside the law in order to recover his kidnapped son. While a number of critics say the film is well-made and well-meaning, others say it’s too violent and far-fetched to be truly compelling.

We also have lighter fare in \"RV,\" \"Stick It\" and \"Akeelah.\" What do the critics have to say?Is it too soon for the studios to make movies about the terrorist attacks on Sept 11, 2001? Directed by Paul Greengrass (Bloody Sunday) with a cast of unknowns, \"United 93\" re-enacts the hijacking of United Airlines flight 93 and its eventual crash into a field in Pennsylvania, killing everyone on board. Critics say, while difficult to watch, \"United 93\" is made with skill and treats the subject matter with respect, never resorting to the aggrandizement Hollywood is known for. As of this writing, \"United 93\" is Certified Fresh with a Tomatometer reading of 93%, the best-reviewed drama of 2006 for movies with at least 50 reviews.If you’ve been to a Starbucks lately, you’ll notice that you’re seeing more on the walls and chalkboards than art decor and beverage suggestions. It’s hard to miss those \"Akeelah and the Bee\" note cards and stickers. That’s because besides making caffeinated beverages, Starbucks is dabbling in movies as well. The movie centers on Akeelah who, through the tutelage of a mentor played by Laurence Fishburne, rises above the odds to compete in the Scripps National Spelling Bee contest. Despite its predictability, \"Akeelah\" is doing quite well with the critics, scoring 84% on the Tomatometer. Critics say its star Keke Palmer‘s winning performance makes it easy to forgive the film’s flaws.If \"Stick It\" does well at the box office, will we see the writer of \"Bring It On\" pen a movie about sychronized swimming? For all we know, that script is probably done, just waiting for a greenlight from studio execs. While that movie may hold promise, \"Stick It\" fails to score well with the critics with a reading of 21% on the Tomatometer. Filled with teen speak and shopworn cliches, the movie may appeal to teenage mallrats, they say.In Robin Williams‘ latest comedy \"RV,\" his family dreads the prospect of taking an extended road trip with him in a Winnebago, and with a reading of 32% on the Tomatometer, so do the critics. The reason? The movie’s not that funny.

The good news: Who cares? The third time’s a charm for the espionage/explosion series, and the scribes say \"Alias\"/\"Lost\" creator J.J. Abrams brings a fresh, loopy energy to the proceedings. Tom Cruise is back once again to save the world, this time from Philip Seymour Hoffman. With absurd-but-exhilarating action sequences and interesting supporting players, \"M:I:III\" is the best reviewed film of the series, and at 78 percent on the Tomatometer, it’s Certified Fresh.\"An American Haunting\"…like \"Casper,\" only…not.Recently, the makers of horror films have found that adding a \"based on true events\" handle gives their fright-fests an added jolt of heft. \"The Exorcism of Emily Rose\" tried it, and now comes \"An American Haunting,\" a ghost tale set in 1820s Tennessee. The critics say the film has an atmospheric gloominess and some solid performances (particularly from Sissy Spacek and Donald Sutherland), but its scares are pretty rote. It currently stands at 29 percent on the Tomatometer.These kids give a \"Hoot\"…but will audiences?Despite the deep divisions wrought by divergent political leanings in recent years, I think we can all agree on several things. It’s a bad idea to pave the wetlands in order to build a pancake house. Luke Wilson is pretty cool. And \"Margaritaville\" is darned catchy.

Will \"Vendetta\" live up to the hype? Can a girly \"Man\" make teens swoon for Shakespeare? The scribes will tell us!Ah, the hype. \"V for Vendetta,\" arguably the year’s first event movie, has been generating the loudest buzz for months — and critics say it’s justified. Produced by the Wachowski brothers (masters of the Matrices), and starring Natalie Portman and a fully masked Hugo Weaving, \"Vendetta\" tells the story of a near-future dystopia, where a lone freedom fighter named V (Weaving) plots a series of revolutionary bombings to bring down a shady, secretly policed government. Along the way, V recruits young, frightened Evey (Portman), shaves her head, and turns her into a proper young revolutionary. The scribes say this political thriller is high on politics as well as thrills, with a few stunning set pieces augmenting an austere, yet stylish, mise-en-scene; however, the incendiary tone of its politics — which have been labeled terrorist-like by some — is more than a bit difficult for some to stomach in this post-9/11 day and age. Nevertheless, \"V for Vendetta\" is enjoying Fresh status with a 68% score on the Tomatometer, and the critical mass urges at least one thought-provoking viewing.Faring worse at the hands of the critics, \"She’s The Man\" is a teen-oriented take on Shakespeare’s gender-bender \"Twelfth Night,\" from two of the writers of a better Bard treatment, \"10 Things I Hate About You.\" TV teen queen Amanda Bynes stars as Viola, a prep school tomboy who decides to impersonate her twin brother Sebastian in order to play on his soccer team. Donning a short wig and boy’s clothing, Viola infiltrates Illyria Prep, but soon falls for her dreamy roommate, who’s crushing on a pretty blonde, who has the hots for the undercover Viola; hilarity and sexual confusion ensue. Unfortunately, the scribes say this comedy of errors is just that, with an erratic comic timing, unbelievable plotlines, and too-broad jokes that make you feel embarrassed for Bynes — the actress, not her character.

What will the critics say?\"The Shaggy Dog\" is a remake of the 1959 Fred MacMurray family comedy. This one stars Tim Allen as a district attorney who is accidentally injected with a chemical that periodically turns him into a dog; family togetherness ensues. Critics say this family fare is not sharp on its own modest terms, and despite some decent moments (many of them courtesy of Robert Downey Jr.), it lacks, ahem, bite. At 36 percent on the Tomatometer, this \"Dog\" could use a trip to the vet; it’s not as healthy as the original, which stands at 75 percent.Listen up, Hollywood, because I’m only going to say this once. Don’t you know that you’re asking for trouble from movie critics if you put negative descriptors in your title? It’s like a red cape in front of a charging bull. \"Failure to Launch,\" starring Matthew McConaughey and Sarah Jessica Parker, tells the story of a regular 30-something dude whose parents want him to move out, so they hire a woman to try to go on a date with him. Scribes say the leads have an acceptable level of chemistry, and that the film benefits from quirky supporting players, particularly Zooey Deschanel. But they hasten to add that the title is a bit too apt, for the setup and the script are too contrived for the material to really achieve liftoff. At 34 percent on the Tomatometer, this one’s a… never mind.Wes Craven‘s \"The Hills Have Eyes\" gets the remake treatment from Alexander Aja, the director behind the recent slasher fave \"High Tension.\" The film tells the story of a family road trip that comes to an abrupt halt, thanks to a clan of bloodthirsty genetic mutants. Critics say it’s a pretty gruesome experience, and one of the better horror remakes of recent years; whether those are compliments depends on your taste. At 53 percent on the Tomatometer, this one’s a slight notch below the original (63 percent).Recent Matthew McConaughey Movies:————————————————20% — Two For the Money (2005)86% — Magnificent Desolation: Walking on the Moon 3-D (2005)38% — Sahara (2005)19% — Paparazzi (2004)42% — How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days (2003)","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"It, Purge, television, Lifetime, National, Masterpiece, Pride, movies, Rocky, independent, of, Heroines","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Critical-Consensus-Mangy-Dog-Rom-Com-Failure-Evil-Eye"},{"id":"47508809170898","title":"Critical Consensus: A Swinging \"Party,\" A Sweet and Sour \"16\"","content":"Critics Consensusvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Critical Consensus: A Swinging \"Party,\" A Sweet and Sour \"16\"by Tim Ryan | March 2, 2006 |  CommentsThis week’s wide releases will take us on a journey. We’ll walk a couple blocks (\"16 Blocks,\" \"Dave Chappelle’s Block Party\"), take a dip in the ocean (\"Aquamarine\") and feel the rays of the sun (\"Ultraviolet\"). And the critics will be our guide.With the first two \"Lethal Weapon\" films, Richard Donner perfected a certain kind of action-buddy template, and he gives it another try in \"16 Blocks.\" Bruce Willis and Mos Def star in this tale of a cop who must transport a witness across town to testify in court, but must make it past a bunch of bad guys first. Critics say the film is a solid action picture with interesting characters, but it’s still a little too formulaic. It’s currently at 49 percent on the Tomatometer, well below Donner’s best-reviewed action film (\"Superman,\" 94 percent) and Willis’ (\"Die Hard,\" 92 percent).We’ve missed you, Dave Chappelle. We were deeply concerned when you went on hiatus. We were afraid we’d lost the comedy voice of a generation. We needn’t have worried, say critics. \"Dave Chappelle’s Block Party\" is a raucous return to the spotlight, and Dave’s incisive, observational wit appears to be as sharp as ever. Directed with style by Michel Gondry and featuring exceptional musical performances by some of hip-hop’s heaviest hitters (including — will wonders never cease — the reunited Fugees), this is one swingin’ \"Party.\" It currently stands at 93 percent on the Tomatometer, and if that number holds, \"Block Party\" will be the best reviewed wide release of the year. It’s also nearly 50 points higher than Chappelle’s career Tomatometer of 44 percent. Heck, even he makes fun of \"Half Baked.\")\"Aquamarine\" tells a fish-out-of-water story — or, better yet, a mermaid-out-of-the-ocean story. A couple of teenage girls discover a mermaid who, like Ariel before her, is looking for love, preferably on dry land. As you can probably guess, the target audience for this movie is ichthyologists. Sorry, I meant teenage girls. Critics say that demographic will dig it to an acceptable degree, but their parents and the fellas will be feeling a bit seasick. At 50 percent on the Tomatometer, \"Aquamarine\" is a tad soggy.Extensive exposure to ultraviolet rays can be very harmful, particularly to the eyes. So the people behind the futuristic action flick \"Ultraviolet\" did the critics a favor by not screening the film for them. Whether it’s harmful for audiences, we can’t say at this point. Just be warned.Speaking of which, it’s time to announce the winners of last week’s Guess the Tomatometer contest. Mizzoucritic was one point off in his/her evaluation of \"Tyler Perry’s Madea’s Family Reunion,\" which landed at 32 percent, and lovelykeira came the closest to \"Doogal\"’s score of six percent. So the next time we’re in Mizzou’s neck of the woods, we’ll get dinner at Shakespeare’s Pizza to celebrate.

A cute pooch battles the forces of evil (\"Doogal\"). The irrepressible Madea holds a family reunion (\"Tyler Perry’s Madea’s Family Reunion\"). It can only mean one thing — this week’s wide releases!Paul Walker has spent 2006 getting out of tight spots. In \"Eight Below,\" he and a pack of sled dogs had to escape the cold of Antarctica, and now in \"Running Scared,\" he has to find a lost firearm used in a hit or face the consequences from his Mafioso bosses and the cops. It’s a pretty cool setup; heck, it made for a tense, involving picture when Kurosawa tried it in \"Stray Dog.\" But critics say director Wayne Kramer, who debuted with the kinetic \"The Cooler,\" is on shakier ground with this one; they say it’s got a weak twist and far too brutal violence. \"Running Scared\" currently stands at 37 percent on the Tomatometer.Speaking of running scared, apparently the people responsible for both \"Tyler Perry’s Madea’s Family Reunion\" and \"Doogal\" are terrified that critics will poison the coveted opening weekend box office with bad reviews. These two films weren’t screened for critics, joining an infamous list that includes last week’s \"Date Movie.\" So without further ado, Critical Consensus would like to give mad props to Roadhg67, who correctly guessed that \"Date Movie\" would have a Tomatometer of 10 percent.

What do the critics say?It’s a scenario Hollywood loves to (\"Stand and\") deliver: A tough-but-fair new teacher helps a ragtag bunch of teenage troublemakers learn to be better citizens and believe in themselves through a disciplined approach to basketball/martial arts/poetry/feng shui/tiddley winks, etc. Add ballroom dancing to the list. \"Take the Lead\" stars Antonio Banderas as a professional dancer whose old-school approach melds with the students’ hip-hop sensibilities. (If this sounds familiar, it’s because there was a documentary called \"Mad Hot Ballroom\" that told the same tale, albeit with elementary school kids, and uh, it was real.) Critics say the movie is fine, if a little shopworn; while the performances and dance numbers are stirring, we’ve kinda seen this one before. It’s currently at 45 percent on the Tomatometer.From its inscrutable title to its labyrinthine plot, the scribes are pretty split on \"Lucky Number Slevin.\" Is the screenplay smart? Yes, critics say. Too clever for its own good? Perhaps, they concede. Josh Hartnett stars as a regular dude who falls into a web of intrigue after a case of mistaken identity. The film has a stellar cast (Morgan Freeman, Bruce Willis, Lucy Liu, Ben Kingsley) and a plot with more twists and turns than a marathon session of Chutes and Ladders. So, is \"Lucky\" any good? Depends on which critic you ask. At 55 percent on the Tomatometer, \"Slevin\" is either pulp heaven or an overplotted purgatory.Like a utility infielder hitting well below the Mendoza line, \"The Benchwarmers\" probably deserves to ride the pine, since the scribes weren’t allowed to see it. And likewise, \"Phat Girlz,\" which was also not screened for critics, is probably not all that, uh, phat. So kiddies, it’s time for our new national pastime: Guess the Tomatometer!

Which of these movies will score with critics?As the Oscar-winning theme of \"The Poseidon Adventure\" put it, \"there’s got to be a morning after.\" In this day and age, there’s got to be a big-budget quasi-remake. The latest is \"Poseidon,\" Wolfgang Petersen‘s third boat movie (\"Das Boot\" and \"The Perfect Storm\" are the others.) Josh Lucas and Kurt Russell star as the leaders of a group trying to escape an overturned, sinking cruise ship. The critics say the film has some decent action scenes, but virtually no character development or good lines. At 36 percent on the Tomatometer, \"Poseidon\" is all wet.Jacinda Barrett and Josh Lucas run from the critical tide.There’s a Lou Reed album called \"Growing Up in Public,\" and few embody those words like Lindsay Lohan. She’s the star of \"Just My Luck,\" a screwball comedy about how a kiss reverses the fortunes of the world’s luckiest girl and the unluckiest guy. The film marks the end of Lohan’s teen queen phase; with this (and Robert Altman‘s \"A Prairie Home Companion\") she’s now playing adult characters. But critics say \"Just My Luck\" is still pretty juvenile, a lightweight rom-com that isn’t nearly sprightly enough. At 25 percent on the Tomatometer, the scribes say this one’s \"Just\" not that good.More excitement than a Friday night at Bungalow 8.We love inspirational sports flicks. We must, as the studios keep making them. The latest entry is \"Goal!,\" the first in a trilogy about a kid from East L.A. who ends up in Britain’s Premier division. The scribes say this is a better-than-average, utterly predictable film with a good performance by Kuno Becker as the up-by-the-bootstraps (or is it cleatstraps?) footballer. At 54 percent on the Tomatometer, this one’s a draw.\"Goal!\" is the best movie about kicking things since \"Kickboxer 4.\"Recent Wolfgang Petersen Movies:——————————————55% — Troy (2004)48% — The Perfect Storm (2000)77% — Air Force One (1997)56% — Outbreak (1995)97% — In the Line of Fire (1993)Recent Lindsay Lohan Movies:————————————–100% — A Prairie Home Companion (2006)42% — Herbie: Fully Loaded (2005)13% — Confessions of a Teenage Drama Queen (2004)86% — Mean Girls (2004)83% — Freaky Friday (2003)","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"of, Searchlight, anime","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Critical-Consensus-Poseidon-Sinks-Luck-Is-Lacking"},{"id":"47508811710435","title":"Critical Consensus: \"Domino\" Topples, \"Elizabethtown\" Disappoints","content":"Critics Consensusvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Critical Consensus: \"Domino\" Topples, \"Elizabethtown\" Disappointsby Tim Ryan | October 13, 2005 |  CommentsThis week, the wide releases regale us with tales of beautiful bounty hunters (\"Domino\"), existential romance (\"Elizabethtown\"), and masses of deadly condensed water vapor (\"The Fog\"). Which films will connect with the critics?The life of the late Domino Harvey would seem custom-made for a film. She was the daughter of a legendary actor (Laurence Harvey), she was supermodel-beautiful, and she worked as a bounty hunter. A story like that would make for a good movie, right? Well, according to the critics, that’s half correct: Tony Scott‘s \"Domino,\" starring Keira Knightley, is certainly more a movie than a biography, but it’s also not terribly good. The scribes say it’s simply a slam-bang, senses-assaulting action flick that gives off little indication that its heroine was a real person. At 18 percent on the Tomatometer, this \"Domino\" is getting knocked over. It’s also the worst-reviewed film of Scott’s career.When \"Elizabethtown\" was screened at the Toronto Film Festival, it didn’t get very good reviews. Director Cameron Crowe told audiences and critics that it was still a work in progress, that more cuts would be made. Well, the new version is now in theaters, and it isn’t faring much better, either. Orlando Bloom and Kirsten Dunst star in this you-can-go-home-again romantic comedy about a man returning to his hometown in Kentucky for his father’s funeral. The critics say Crowe never establishes a coherent tone, and despite the cuts, it’s still overlong. At 29 percent on the Tomatometer, \"Elizabethtown\" may not be worth a visit.In a development more ominous than dark clouds on the horizon, \"The Fog,\" a remake of the John Carpenter classic starring Tom Welling, Maggie Grace, and Selma Blair, has not been screened for critics.Recent Cameron Crowe Movies:—————————————39% — Vanilla Sky (2001)89% — Almost Famous (2000)85% — Jerry Maguire (1996)77% — Singles (1992)100% — Say Anything (1989)Recent Tony Scott Movies:——————————–39% — Man on Fire (2004)67% — Spy Game (2001)71% — Enemy of the State (1998)39% — The Fan (1996)89% — Crimson Tide (1995)","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"universe, VICE","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Critical-Consensus-Domino-Topples-Elizabethtown-Disappoints"},{"id":"47508810691548","title":"Critical Consensus: Lions And Witches And Wardrobes, Oh My!","content":"Critics Consensusvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Critical Consensus: Lions And Witches And Wardrobes, Oh My!by Tim Ryan | December 8, 2005 |  CommentsThis week’s sole wide release is the highly anticipated \"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe.\" Will the film garner the lion’s share of accolades?Once \"The Lord of the Rings\" became a hot cinematic property, it was inevitable that Hollywood would turn to Tolkien’s friend and fellow fantasist C.S. Lewis and give his \"The Chronicles of Narnia\" for epic big screen treatment. It’s got a built-in fan base, fantastical lands and creatures, and a grand quest. Critics say that although this is no \"Lord of the Rings\" (what is?), Andrew Adamson‘s film is largely a winner, filled with wondrous, phantasmagoric images, and deft acting. Though there are some complaints about the film’s length (140 minutes) and some quibbles about the CGI effects, the scribes say fans will be pleased with \"Narnia\"’s adherence to, and in some cases improvement upon, the source material. At 78 percent on the Tomatometer, it’s looking like the season of the \"Witch.\" The \"Narnia\" series is off to a good start, as the first film is Certified Fresh.In a completely unrelated note, I want to congratulate both almeisan and Galaxyfilms22 for their correct \"Aeon Flux\" Tomatometer predictions of 10 percent. As promised, you do indeed win props from Critical Consensus. However, a word of warning: Don’t let the studios know about your Tomatometer crystal balls, because they might go to sinister lengths to get their hands on them. Additional props to rockstarfrank (who I assume is male) for his astute, insightful assessment of \"Flux\": ‘This will clearly be one of the greatest movies in the history of mankind.

We have a man and his dog (\"Wallace &amp; Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit\"), sisters (\"In Her Shoes\"), disgruntled restaurant employees (\"Waiting…\"), and men who bond over gambling (\"Two for the Money\"). Which of these films will get some love from the critics?Is Wallace and Gromit the funniest duo in animation history? The critics say their feature film debut, \"Wallace &amp; Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,\" is powerful evidence for that claim. The quirky, cheese-loving inventor and his remarkably sentient and competent canine companion became popular in their Oscar-winning shorts, but critics say this film is something else altogether: funny, wild, eccentric, but also touching. At 95 percent on the Tomatometer, this \"Curse\" is a blessing. Or, more to the point, it’s the best-reviewed wide release of the year so far. Director Nick Park is batting a thousand; his first feature, \"Chicken Run,\" was another runaway critical success, scoring 97 percent on the Tomatometer.Sometimes you look at siblings and wonder how they could possibly be related. \"In Her Shoes\" tells the story of two sisters who are polar opposites except for their shoe size; it also describes Curtis Hanson‘s involvement in the film, as his last was \"8 Mile.\" But the critics say it’s a good fit. The performances by Cameron Diaz, Toni Collette, and (especially) Shirley MacLaine help elevate what could seem clichéd into a warm and involving drama. At 69 percent on the Tomatometer, \"In Her Shoes\" is a good fit.Gross-out comedy is tricky business. If you cross the line, a movie can just end up being disgusting. The critics say that’s just one of the problems with \"Waiting…,\" a film that covers similar ground as \"Office Space\" and \"Clerks,\" but with a greater focus on gags than people. Ryan Reynolds stars as a deeply jaded chain restaurant employee dedicated to high jinks, not customer service. Many of the pranks can’t be described in family newspapers, and the scribes say that’s the problem, they’re too over-the-top to be funny. At 25 percent on the Tomatometer, critics say you’ll be \"Waiting\" for laughs.Al Pacino stars as the head of a sports betting agency, with Matthew McConaughey as a once-promising quarterback with an almost preternatural ability to pick winners in \"Two for the Money.\" While the scribes say Pacino is his usual high-strung, compelling self, the rest of the movie is something of a fumble. Like a prima donna wide receiver who never makes the big play, this one’s a bit more flash than substance. At 15 percent on the Tomatometer, the critics say \"Two for the Money\" is a losing bet. But Pacino should be fine; his combined Tomatometer is at 71 percent.Recent DreamWorks Animated Films———————————————-54% — Madagascar (2005)35% — Shark Tale (2004)89% — Shrek 2 (2004)88% — Shrek (2001)97% — Chicken Run (2000)","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"Comics, documentaries, Hulu, Society, disaster, Bros., Infographic, golden, facebook, IFC, Year, Warner, comedy","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Critical-Consensus-Curse-Is-A-Blessing-Shoes-Fit"},{"id":"47508810673113","title":"Critical Consensus: A Regal \"Holiday,\" A Well-Trodden \"Road,\" A Tepid \"Tristan\"","content":"Critics Consensusvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Critical Consensus: A Regal \"Holiday,\" A Well-Trodden \"Road,\" A Tepid \"Tristan\"by Tim Ryan | January 12, 2006 |  CommentsThis week at the movies brings us films about a risk-averse woman cutting loose (\"Last Holiday\"), a groundbreaking underdog basketball team (\"Glory Road\"), and an ancient folktale of grand passion (\"Tristan &amp; Isolde\"). What do the critics have to say?There are some actors and actresses who are so likable, they can pull off nearly anything, no matter how predictable. Queen Latifah is one of them. \"Last Holiday,\" a remake of the Alec Guinness classic, tells the tale of a woman who, upon hearing dire medical news, decides to live every day as if it’s her last. Critics say a movie that could be a moderately entertaining rom-com about the virtues of believing in oneself becomes something altogether greater in the hands of Latifah, who brings a winning charm to every scene. At 68 percent, this is a \"Holiday\" to celebrate.The Kentucky Wildcats were among the dominant programs in college basketball during coach Adolph Rupp’s 42-year tenure. But in 1966, an all-African American starting lineup from Texas Western defeated Rupp’s all-white squad. There is no doubt that this is an inspiring, true-life underdog tale, and many critics say \"Glory Road,\" the big-screen adaptation starring Josh Lucas and Derek Luke, delivers the visceral thrills of our favorite sports flicks without skimping on the social commentary. But others say that inspiring true-life tales don’t necessarily make for exciting cinema; at 53 percent, this \"Road\" may be a little too well traveled.Speaking of inspiring, there’s a Celtic folktale that has inspired some of the world’s most monumental artistic works, from \"Romeo and Juliet\" to one of Wagner’s most influential operas. But critics say the movie treatment of \"Tristan &amp; Isolde\" isn’t poised to join the pantheon. A tale of romance in the war-torn aftermath of Roman control over England, critics say the film is too tepid and slow to pull off a sweeping romantic vision. At 32 percent on the Tomatometer, this is one love story that could use a little more passion.Recent Queen Latifah Movies:————————————40% — Beauty Shop (2005)33% — The Muppets: The Wizard of Oz (2005)70% — Barbershop 2: Back in Business (2004)3% — The Cookout (2004)10% — Taxi (2004)Recent Joshua Lucas Movies:————————————13% — Stealth (2005)51% — An Unfinished Life (2005)27% — Around the Bend (2004)57% — Undertow (2004)60% — Hulk (2003)","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"animated, TBS, comiccon, venice, Games, historical, 2018, godzilla, Academy, jamie","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Critical-Consensus-A-Regal-Holiday-A-Well-Trodden-Road-A-Tepid-Tristan"},{"id":"47508810716127","title":"Critics Consensus: Zathura‘s Got Game, Get Rich Dies Tryin’","content":"Critics Consensusvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Critics Consensus: Zathura's Got Game, Get Rich Dies Tryin'by Tim Ryan | November 10, 2005 |  CommentsThis week’s wide releases raise a number of questions. Is “Zathura” a game worth playing? Is 50 Cent‘s movie debut, “Get Rich or Die Tryin’,” the cinematic equivalent of a trip to the candy shop? Is “Derailed” a speedy locomotive, or is it true to its name? What do the critics have to say?“Zathura” is the third story by Rhode Island-based children’s book author Chris Van Allsburg to make the leap from the page to the big screen (the other two were “Jumanji” and last year’s “The Polar Express“). And critics say it’s the best of the bunch. “Zathura” tells the tale of a pair of squabbling brothers who must learn to work together after they are transported into space while playing the titular board game. According to the critics, the movie is solid family entertainment, with a real sense of adventure and wonder, emphasizing characters over the (not at all shabby) special effects. At 71 percent on the Tomatometer, “Zathura”‘s got game. And it beats “The Polar Bear Express,” which scored 56 percent on the Tomatometer, and “Jumanji,” at 48 percent.Curtis “50 Cent” Jackson has a life story that seems ready-made for cinematic treatment: he was a drug dealer, he survived a shooting, and he eventually became one of America’s biggest musical stars. But the critics say the semi-autobiographical “Get Rich or Die Tryin’,” which features 50 in his acting debut, still feels like the stuff of many other rags-to-riches dramas. The scribes say even veteran director Jim Sheridan can’t make it fresh, despite an excellent supporting cast that includes the always-dependable Terrence Howard. At 16 percent on the Tomatometer, “Get Rich or Die Tryin'” can’t make a dollar out of 50 Cent. And it’s the worst-reviewed film of Sheridan’s career (beating out “The Field,” at 46 percent).As the old saying goes, what a tangled web we weave, when we make a thriller about adultery and betrayal with lots of plot twists. “Derailed” tells the story of an extramarital affair gone terribly awry, after a very bad guy threatens the two trapped philanderers. The critics say the title is all too apt; the plot twists become more tangled as the film goes along, and Clive Owen and Jennifer Aniston, in spite of their considerable skills, are miscast as, respectively, a schlubby family man and a fundamentally decent femme fatale. At 19 percent on the Tomatometer, the critics say “Derailed” has jumped the tracks.Movies Starring Musicians Playing Musicians:——————————————————–5% — Undiscovered (2005) – Starring Ashlee Simpson81% — Hustle &amp; Flow (2005) – Starring Ludacris15% — Raise Your Voice (2004) – Starring Hilary Duff76% — 8 Mile (2002) – Starring Eminem7% — Glitter (2001) – Starring Mariah Carey14% — Crossroads (2002) – Starring Britney Spears24% — Duets (2000) – Starring Huey Lewis32% — Black and White (1999) – Starring Raekwon81% — Selena (1997) – Starring Jennifer Lopez11% — Cool as Ice (1991) – Starring Vanilla Ice70% — Purple Rain (1984) – Starring Prince","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"of, spain, History, Spike, Premium, VOD, rotten, Certified, TCA, 4/20","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"critical-consensus-zathuras-got-game-get-rich-dies-tryin"},{"id":"47508810704862","title":"Critical Consensus: \"Harry Potter,\" \"Walk the Line\" Both Certified Fre","content":"Critics Consensusvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Critical Consensus: \"Harry Potter,\" \"Walk the Line\" Both Certified Freby Tim Ryan | November 17, 2005 |  CommentsThis week’s wide releases find us within both a goblet and a burnin’ ring of fire. We’ve got legends, both fantastic (\"Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire\") and musical (the Johnny Cash biopic \"Walk the Line\"). Will these heavily anticipated films generate warmth, or be scorched by the critics?As the Harry Potter series progresses, the decision to cast actors who would literally grow into their roles is paying bigger dividends each time out; it’s becoming the fantasy equivalent of the \"Up\" documentaries. \"Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire,\" the fourth installment, is complete with the sorcery and effects that marked the earlier films, but this time, critics say, it generates the most drama and excitement when it focuses on the characters’ (achingly real) adolescent pains. At 87 percent on the Tomatometer, this \"Goblet\" is on fire, so hot, in fact, that it’s Certified Fresh. It’s only slightly below the best reviewed film of the series, \"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,\" which scored a lofty 89 percent. And it’s the second best-reviewed wide release of the year, behind only \"Wallace &amp; Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit\" (Tomatometer: 95 percent).There aren’t a lot of people who had both the Rev. Billy Graham and Glenn Danzig in their rolodexes. But there weren’t a lot of people like Johnny Cash, whose polarities are explored in \"Walk the Line,\" starring Joaquin Phoenix as the young Man in Black, and Reese Witherspoon as his wife and musical partner June Carter Cash. Critics say this one’s hotter than a pepper sprout, with great musical and thespian performances, and while \"Walk the Line\" may fall prey to many of the problems that plague movie biopics, you won’t cry, cry, cry about it in a film this well acted. How high’s the Tomatometer, mama? Seventy-eight percent, and while the wheat and the oats may be a washout, \"Walk the Line’s\" crop is Certified Fresh.Harry Potter Movies:—————————89% — Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (2004)82% — Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (2002)78% — Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone (2001)Recent Biopics:—————–92% — Capote (2005)89% — The Aviator (200481% — Ray (2004)89% — Kinsey (2004)74% — Auto Focus (2002)","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"Star, disaster, hollywood, Nickelodeon, Company, Yoda, Christmas, justice, Islander, FXX, motion","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Critical-Consensus-Harry-Potter-Walk-the-Line-Both-Certified-Fre"},{"id":"47508810664920","title":"Critical Consensus: \"Spear,\" \"New World\" Are OK, Not Great","content":"Critics Consensusvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Critical Consensus: \"Spear,\" \"New World\" Are OK, Not Greatby Tim Ryan | January 19, 2006 |  CommentsThis week at the movies brings us three culture clashes: Native Americans and Europeans (\"The New World\"), the Waodani people of Ecuador and a group of missionaries (\"End of the Spear\"), and, uh, werewolves and vampires (\"Underworld: Evolution\"). What will the critics say?Ever since the huge success of \"The Passion of the Christ,\" Hollywood has been looking for movies for religious folks that will cross over to the non-devout as well. \"End of the Spear\" tells the tale of an Ecuadorian warrior who, by tribal tradition, adopts the family of a missionary he has killed. While some critics have praised the film’s visuals and redemptive message, others say the message is a little too ham-fisted. It’s currently at 58 percent on the Tomatometer.Like the return of Halley’s Comet, director Terrence Malick‘s films are so rarely in theaters that it’s cause for celebration when they appear. With a career that began with the brilliant \"Badlands,\" Malick is a master, but a reclusive one. His latest is \"The New World,\" a meditative, evocative take on the Pocahontas/John Smith tale. The critics are pretty divided on this film; for some, it’s lyrical, visionary, and poetic, but for others it’s a slow, pretentious bore. At 58 percent on the Tomatometer, it’s well below Malick’s 79 percent career rating.One of the main principles of Darwin’s theory is survival of the fittest. It appears the studio didn’t think \"Underworld: Evolution\" was all that fit, since it wasn’t screened for critics. (Or maybe it wasn’t a work of intelligent design, either. Just covering all the bases.)Recent Colin Farrell Movies:———————————-71% — Intermission (2004)14% — Alexander (2004)49% — A Home at the End of the World (2004)72% — Phone Booth (2003)44% — The Recruit (2003)","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"Best, Sneak, rings, review, films, Games, sequels, camera, technology, Disney, leads, Reality, CBS, nature","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Critical-Consensus-Spear-New-World-Are-OK-Not-Great"},{"id":"47508810684379","title":"Critical Consensus: A Sly \"Family Stone,\" A Towering \"Kong\"","content":"Critics Consensusvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Critical Consensus: A Sly \"Family Stone,\" A Towering \"Kong\"by Tim Ryan | December 15, 2005 |  CommentsThis week at the movies, we have a giant ape {\"King Kong\"} and some yuletide dramedy (\"The Family Stone\"). Will the critics go bananas for these flicks?It seems that virtually every holiday film is set in New England (where it snows), and revolves around the eccentric and conflict-prone but otherwise loving family members who are meeting the protagonist’s significant other for the first time. \"The Family Stone,\" starring Diane Keaton, Sarah Jessica Parker, Rachel McAdams and a host of other likeable actors, has all these elements, but that doesn’t mean it’s a bad movie. Rather, critics are split on the matter; some feel that \"The Family Stone\" is sly, sharp, and funny, but others say it’s a bit too clichéd to fully register. Like the Christmas turkey on the 27th of December, \"The Family Stone\" is currently fresh, but at 60 percent on the Tomatometer, it’s not the freshest.Oh, and you may have heard about this movie involving a big ape, that was based on this other movie about a big ape that everyone likes. It’s called \"King Kong,\" and it was directed by this guy named Peter Jackson, who did some movies you might have heard of. Anyway, \"Kong\" is Certified Fresh, at 84 percent on the Tomatometer, which means that a lot of critics think it’s really good. Just so you know.Holiday Movies:——————-4% — Christmas With the Kranks (2004)8% — Surviving Christmas (2004)84% — Elf (2003)73% — Bad Santa (2003)87% — It’s a Wonderful Life (1946)","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"Ghostbusters, Disney, war, Pixar, dragons, MTV, TIFF, Games, Family, Day, movies, romantic, Stephen, Fresh","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Critical-Consensus-A-Sly-Family-Stone-A-Towering-Kong"},{"id":"47508810679258","title":"Critical Consensus: \"Hostel\" Worth A Stay, \"Casanova\" Getting No Love","content":"Critics Consensusvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Critical Consensus: \"Hostel\" Worth A Stay, \"Casanova\" Getting No Loveby Tim Ryan | January 5, 2006 |  CommentsThis week at the movies, we’ve got a bunch of madmen (\"Hostel\"), a notorious lover (\"Casanova\"), a dhampir (\"BloodRayne\"), and a dude who lives with his grandma (\"Grandma’s Boy\"). Which of these movies will score with critics?It’s a story that’s been told a thousand times: a group of young people stray off the beaten path, only to fall into the clutches of bloodthirsty crazies who inflicts torture upon them with sadistic glee. Heck, it was told a couple weeks ago (\"Wolf Creek\"). So what? Sometimes it’s how you tell it, and the critics say \"Hostel\" is told very well. Yes, scribes say, Eli Roth‘s film is grisly, but it’s also terrifyingly exciting and makes for some incisive social commentary. At 88 percent on the Tomatometer, this \"Hostel\" may be worth a stay, if you like this sort of thing.Giacomo Casanova was the world’s greatest lover, a man of endless appetites who led an impossibly colorful life (which was probably embellished in his autobiography, but is a classic nonetheless). So you couldn’t go wrong with a movie about the notable rake, right? Right? Well, the critics say this period comedy romp, starring Heath Ledger and Sienna Miller, isn’t quite as romping as it should be, and despite noteworthy visuals, the film is frothy without being particularly ribald. Worse, the man whose name is synonymous with cad-dom chooses monogamy! At 41 percent on the Tomatometer, this \"Casanova\" is getting no love.The people behind both \"BloodRayne\" and \"Grandma’s Boy\" must have made a new year’s resolution to not screen their films for critics. Here at Rotten Tomatoes, we feel it’s admirable to stick to your guns, when so many of us end up breaking our resolutions almost immediately. Unfortunately, the strategy sends a message to the world that perhaps these movies aren’t very good.Recent Heath Ledger Movies————————————-88% — Brokeback Mountain (2005)67% — Two Hands (2005)39% — The Brothers Grimm (2005)53% — Lords of Dogtown (2005)54% — Ned Kelly (2004)","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"TV, Fox, green, critic, Masterpiece, wars, universal, Dates, medical, HBO, satire, unscripted, australia","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Critical-Consensus-Hostel-Worth-A-Stay-Casanova-Getting-No-Love"},{"id":"47508813425643","title":"Tahar Rahim’s Five Favorite Films","content":"Five Favorite Filmsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Tahar Rahim's Five Favorite FilmsThe recently Golden Globe-nominated star of A Prophet and The Mauritanian loves the New Hollywood of the 1970s and wants to work with the Safdie brothers.by Ryan Fujitani | February 24, 2021 |  Comments(Photo by Stephane Cardinale - Corbis/Getty Images)French-Algerian actor Tahar Rahim first rose to international acclaim with his performance in&nbsp;Jacques Audiard’s 2009 crime thriller&nbsp;A Prophet, which debuted at Cannes to rave reviews and went on to earn an Academy Award nomination for Best Foreign Film. It wasn’t his first feature film, but it was the one that opened the doors for him to work with an eclectic mix of filmmakers&nbsp;that includes Asghar Farhadi (The Past), Fatih Akin (The Cut), Kiyoshi Kurosawa (Daguerrotype), and Kevin Macdonald (The Eagle).Rahim’s latest project reunites him with Macdonald for a challenging role in a based-on-true-events drama,&nbsp;The Mauritanian. In it, he plays the titular character, Mohamedou Ould Slahi, who was kidnapped from his home country in 2002, transported to the U.S. military prison at Guantanamo Bay, and detained there without being charged with any offense for 14 years before he was ultimately released. The film details not only Slahi’s harrowing experiences at the facility, but also the efforts of ACLU attorney Nancy Hollander (Jodie Foster) to afford him due process and the shocking discoveries made by the U.S. government’s own military prosecutor, Stuart Couch (Benedict Cumberbatch). Working alongside a star-studded cast that also includes Shailene Woodley and Zachary Levi, Rahim’s standout performance&nbsp;recently earned him a Golden Globe nomination for Best Actor.Rotten Tomatoes had the opportunity to speak with Rahim ahead of the Globes to talk about the new film, describe what it was like to meet and spend time with the real-life Mohamedou Ould Slahi, and drop a wish list of directors he’d love to work with (somebody please get him a meeting with the Safdie brothers). Before that, though, read on for Tahar Rahim’s Five Favorite Films.Taxi Driver (1976) 96%I’m a big fan of the New Hollywood wave, a very big fan of this period. I think it’s the best period of movies ever. This one is a very specific one because it’s an incredible story of someone who is an antihero. He’s got all the flaws, when you think about it. It can read as a racist, in a way, who could be in love with young girls and totally crazy, who’s trying to kill the president. So he’s got all the flaws, and yet he’s still an ordinary man, you see.It tells a lot about the way society can create heroes, because at the end of the movie, he’s saving this young girl from evil, from the streets of New York. He wants to clean the streets of New York; that’s his obsession. He finally does it, but you don’t know if he does it for him, for her, whatever. He does it. He quenched his thirst&nbsp;for violence. At the end of the movie, he turned out to be an American hero. It’s crazy what it tells about the media, about society.And the performances are stellar. The movie is incredible, the way it’s shot. We get to see New York in the ’70s. Because I always say that movies are testimonies for the next generations when they’re well-made classics like this one. When I discovered it — I might have been 17 or 18 — and I could tell my friends what New York looked like in the ’70s. It was right. It was true. They were in the streets, shooting people, the random people who were walking in the streets and buildings and cars and the way they would talk. The whole thing blew me away.Plus, the script is incredible, the way it’s written. You know, it’s this new period that that looks like a little bit of the New Wave in France. They met the concept of going out there to film reality and people. The way the New Hollywood turned it, it’s better for me, because they weren’t afraid to create antiheroes, to write bigger stories, and to make an x-ray of American society.I could talk about this movie for hours. You know, the first time&nbsp;I discovered Jodie Foster starting her career; she was absolutely awesome. And of course, Robert De Niro, who stays the best actor ever for me, to me.&nbsp;The ’70s, in a way, they created some codes of acting that never moved from there.Scarecrow (1973) 77%Number two, still New Hollywood. It’s Scarecrow&nbsp;by Jerry Schatzberg. I love what we call here in French kind of a… I don’t know if it’s the same expression in America, but buddy movies.&nbsp;But in this one, I remember when I first watched it, there’s this opening with this road, empty road, windy, and two guys who are hitchhiking, and they’re waiting for someone to pick them up. What’s happening is they talk without a single word. This might be the most beautiful encounter of two characters I’ve seen.At this moment, they don’t even talk. There’s not a lot of action, but you can tell who’s who, what type of character they are, their identities, in a way. You see Gene Hackman is grumpy. He doesn’t really want to watch him. You can feel that he is ready to jump on him and beat him. The other one’s trying to just, in a way, find a father. That’s sort of the whole movie, to me. He’s trying to make him laugh, using his own skills, all he’s got to communicate. To go from The Godfather to this character, Al Pacino,&nbsp;it’s crazy what he’s doing in this movie. It’s the opposite of The Godfather.At some point, they start a story together. I remember that they walk through life, and yeah, they have a purpose and they’re going to help each other. It’s about being dependent on someone, but in a good way, because they became friends. I think that Al Pacino’s character is looking for a father. He’s very interesting, but he’s still a kid. He’s a kid that has to be an adult, because he’s got a son, and he’s going to meet him for the first time. He doesn’t know what to do. He just bought a present that he keeps with him all the way along. The poetry of this present is amazing.The ending, when he finally meets his ex-wife and sees his son, and she’s like, “You’re not going to tell him that you’re his daddy.” She starts to ruin him. You see a mother being rude with her kid. That’s where he fell into despair, into madness. The arc of his character is sad, but incredible.The 400 Blows (Les Quatre cents coups) (1959) 100%I think in English it’s 400 Blows. What an incredible movie.&nbsp;Classic. I mean, I saw it a long time ago when I was a kid. It was beautiful. I liked it, but I didn’t really know what it was talking about. Then I watched it again 10 years ago. When you put it back in its context in the ’60s or ’70s — I don’t know exactly — it’s so brand new. Watching a kid wandering in the streets of Paris and making his own 400 blows, and being a young adult. It was pretty amazing. It brought me back to my childhood. It felt good to watch this movie.And it tells a lot about French society at that time — working class people; how a relationship between a man and a woman was, in a way; what people know, but don’t say, between the lines. There’s a lot of this in this movie, between the mom and the son and the dad and the son. It’s incredible. I loved it.&nbsp;There’s this pure innocence in this movie as well. The ending on the beach with fireworks… It’s beautiful.Memories of Murder (2003) 94%What a great movie.&nbsp;I saw it at the video tech, not in a movie theater. I didn’t know what I was about to see. I didn’t expect that this movie would be so good. I remember I discovered Oldboy, and I was like, “Okay, we got real movies over there.” I wanted to know more, and I watched this movie.It starts like a… You see two detectives that don’t really seem clever, and then the guy from the street, from the big city, is going to meet people from the countryside. The shock, culturally, between those two different roots, in a way, is very interesting. It’s like, “Okay. Whether it’s in America, France, or Korea, it’s kind of the same thing.”The ending is so unexpected. I was like, “What?” And it’s the first time ever&nbsp;that I saw that in a movie, in a thriller like this. The whole movie is built on this investigation — the structure of the movie, as well — so when you reach the climax, you need an answer, and it doesn’t give you an answer. It’s not meant to have a sequel.&nbsp;But I think it’s so clever to do this. Plus, the movie’s protected by its own true story. They never found the right guy, the perpetrators, the killer.I remember the cinematography is so good. So good. Do you remember the scene when the cops are arresting the young man, thinking that he’s the killer? The father comes and he’s like, “No, it’s my son. He did nothing.” And they start to fight and there’s the cops and this father and his son being arrested, and it’s all in slow motion, except for the sound; the sound runs normally, which is incredible. You’re like, “Oh, it’s the first time I see it.” Usually it’s slow motion music, silence. Now you’ve got the slow motion shot, and the sound is a direct sound. People are screaming and you hear them fighting. It’s incredible.&nbsp;Like, “Okay, wow. What a director.” He did that before [David] Fincher.Also, in this movie, it’s very serious, but at the same time, there’s a comic layer. It’s funny, sometimes. It’s a lot of poetry.The Truman Show (1998) 95%The Truman Show, Peter Weir, because man, it was ahead of its time, like crazy. I think this movie came out in the ’90s, 10 or 15 years before social media, before reality shows. I mean, that’s&nbsp;so avant garde. He understood so many things, Peter Weir, about the world at that time, what would be the outcome. If you just watch it again, for example, tonight or tomorrow, whatever, you’re going to go crazy. You’re going to go like, “Okay. I mean, did he time travel?”Plus, you see the innocence of Jim Carrey, who’s got an amazing part, and see his deception. It’s kind of a coming-of-age movie as well, in a way. He’s a kid, very innocent. At some point, he’s going to have to get to the real life, life of adults. No more fantasy, no more lies. It’s just the cruelty of the world.(Photo by ©STX Entertainment)Ryan Fujitani for Rotten Tomatoes: The Mauritanian is not the first time you’ve portrayed a real person on film. Do you find that it’s more freeing to play a character based on a real person because you have a template to follow? Or do you enjoy more getting to collaborate and infuse a fictional character with your own ideas?Tahar Rahim:&nbsp;I think right now, I’d say it’s, in a way, easier to portray someone who is a real life character, because the range of liberty you have is limited. They don’t go all over the place. The main answers you need to know for questions about your character, you have them. And you don’t have them in 100 pages, you have them from someone who’s been living for years, decades, so he knows exactly what he’s talking about. You don’t even have to, “No, you know, I think the character would answer this way.” You don’t have any conversation about who the guy is. He is who he is. It helps a lot.But on the other hand, the problem is that you have a responsibility to not, in a way — let’s use this word, and I don’t know if it’s the right one — but to not betray that person and his identity and his personality, his life, what he’s been through. You still have some freedom because he’s&nbsp;not a famous person, but not a lot. I don’t know if it feels better to play someone who’s a real life character or just a character. I don’t know if it feels better because it’s a whole thing. It’s not just about a performance, it’s about your relationship with your partners, with the director, the story, the script, and the whole thing.Rotten Tomatoes: I know you met Mohamedou Ould Salahi before you shot the film. Was there anything about him that surprised you, or anything unexpected about him? Something you were able to work into your performance?Rahim:&nbsp;I knew about him because I read the book, I talked with [director Kevin Macdonald],&nbsp;I had his recordings. So I had enough materials to make my research. But I needed to meet him for other reasons, to know him and to understand the way he moves, he talks, whatever. But I was so surprised to see how funny the guy was.&nbsp;Everybody would say it, but I couldn’t expect that he would be that funny, because sometimes he was sarcastic, sometimes just funny.&nbsp;That surprised me a lot.But you know, it was not just a joke. He likes to joke around. But instantly he can find a good joke that is connected to the context. It’s not just written jokes;&nbsp;he’s taking advantage of the situation and turning it into something funny. You need to be very talented to be able to do that, because it’s like improvisation. It’s like asking a comedian on stage to improvise. They need to improvise between their jokes, the things that are written. It’s a real job. This guy has it naturally.But also, the fact that he was full of life, full of life.&nbsp;Very nice. When you know what he’s been through, it’s almost impossible to believe. The trauma is still there; he manages in some ways to control it, so you don’t see it.(Photo by Graham Bartholomew/©STX Entertainment)Rotten Tomatoes: This is a difficult role for anyone, and I would ask how you would normally decompress or de-stress during shooting, but you’ve said that you basically didn’t, because you were afraid you would lose everything you had put into the character. Doesn’t that take a bit of a toll on you?Rahim:&nbsp;Of course, of course. But I was lucky to shoot that abroad, to shoot this movie abroad. I was alone, with just one of my best friends. Otherwise, if this movie was shot in Paris and I had to see my family and my wife, my kids every day, it wouldn’t have been possible to portray Mohamedou the way I… to give my all.I got really lucky. I didn’t want to be disturbed. It’s such a difficult part that once I caught him, I didn’t want to let him go. I know myself. I’m almost 40; I know if I start to get relaxed too much, I’m getting out of my character, and then to get back in, it’s hard.Rotten Tomatoes: You obviously take your work very seriously, and you’ve been able to work with a wide variety of filmmakers from all kinds of backgrounds across different genres to build a really eclectic resume. But you’ve also expressed in the past that there are some Hollywood directors you’d love to work with. If you had to name the top three on your wish list, who would they be?Rahim: Of course, Martin Scorsese. Paul Thomas Anderson. Who else? There’s so many great directors. I’d say [Alejandro González] Iñárritu. You know what? from the new generation, definitely the Safdie brothers.Rotten Tomatoes: I could absolutely see you in a Safdie brothers movie.Rahim: You know,&nbsp;Good Time was a beautiful surprise. I was like, “Oh, man!” You can feel the New Hollywood references, but it’s not copying. It’s not about that. They’re talking about their time, the people they met, their life, their New York, and it’s incredible. It reminded me of New Hollywood, without copying them. I found it so clever and so brand new, in a way, in the way they shot, in the way they direct their actors, and the last film they did, Uncut Gems, the last 13 minutes… It’s like a James Brown concert. It’s like James Brown saying, “We’re going to shake them. Shake them ’til the end.” I was like, “Whoa. Okay, these guys are great.”The Mauritanian&nbsp;was released on&nbsp;February 12, 2021.Thumbnail images:&nbsp;Everett Collection,&nbsp;©NeonOn an Apple device?

It doesn’t describe the trailblazing path she’s carved out for herself in the entertainment industry against all odds. It doesn’t describe the racism and sexism she faced throughout her career, the struggles she dealt with when casting directors would only slot her into pan-ethnic supporting roles, or the bittersweet victory of winning an Oscar for her performance in West Side Story and the fallow period that followed when she was only offered stereotypical parts. The term legend doesn’t quite encompass her award-winning theatrical or television work, her decades-long dedication to activism, or her influence on generations of fans and actors alike. A word can’t quite capture it, true, but a new film released this week and featuring the woman herself manages to do her justice: Rita Moreno: Just a Girl Who Decided to Go For It.The documentary traces Moreno’s life story back to her childhood in Puerto Rico, which was interrupted by her mother’s move to a cold island very different from the one she was used to: Manhattan. Moreno’s love of performing led her to pursue acting, and after landing a contract at MGM Studios, she was off to Hollywood. Unfortunately, it was not all red carpets and plum acting jobs. She ran into men who tried to control her, men who looked down on her because she was Puerto Rican, at least one man she says assaulted her, and another, Marlon Brando, who she says almost drove her to suicide. Yet, despite the personal and professional hardships, she persevered, making it to a point in her life where she can savor her accomplishments, reminisce about the past, and share some hard-earned knowledge and life advice.Ahead of the documentary’s release on Friday and months before her appearance in Steven Spielberg’s re-imagining of West Side Story, Moreno spoke with Rotten Tomatoes about some of her favorite movies. She said it was difficult for her to rank her favorites – so it’s more a selection of old and recent titles she’s enjoyed through the years, from Citizen Kane to Promising Young Woman.Rita Moreno’s Five Favorite FilmsCitizen Kane (1941) 99%The first movie that comes to mind to me always is Citizen Kane, for many reasons. The camera work was extraordinary in it and it was way ahead of its time, I thought. I’m going to ask you a question about it: Who overheard the word “Rosebud” just before Kane dies? They forgot to shoot it. And I know this because Robert Wise was the editor and he directed West Side Story. And he told me that. He said, “No, no, no. Nope. Nope. Nobody was in there when he said Rosebud.” Isn’t that a great movie story?&nbsp; I saw it on a rerun obviously in one of the art theaters in New York City. So that must have been in the, I guess, in the 1950s. It’s a great movie.E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial (1982) 98%I adore E.T. I can never get enough of E.T. It has all of the elements. Number one, it has superb child actors, which can really only happen because of Steven Spielberg. He is just great with children because he’s like a child himself. It’s a very interesting phenomenon. So I can never not love E.T. for all of those reasons. The children are just enchanting, and of course the voice that they found for E.T. [Moreno imitates the “E.T. phone home” line.]So at first, Steven didn’t quite accept it [when I told him I loved the film]. I said, “No, no, no, no, no. You don’t understand. I’m not kissing your behind. I love this movie. It has all of the elements of a wonderful movie that you don’t forget because it’s filled with so much love.” And you don’t get that too often in films. Isn’t that interesting? You get lots of drama. You don’t get love that way.Promising Young Woman (2020) 90%I was hoping that Carey Mulligan would win [Best Actress at the 2021 Academy Awards]. No offense to the lady who won, because she’s just fabulous, and she certainly earned it. It’s not that. But Carey Mulligan did, too. She’s such a controlled actress. She can really hang on and there’s something about somebody who’s playing a bad guy or girl who doesn’t give it all out. That’s very impressive. That’s hard to do, because I remember one of the scenes, one of the first guys, when he says, “You know what happened? Can I apologize?” Or something like that, and she says, “No.” It’s not, “No, you can.” It’s, “No.” She’s marvelous. I think she’s a fabulous actress, but there’s lots of those.The French Lieutenant's Woman (1981) 81%I love The French Lieutenant’s Woman. What a great movie. She [Meryl Streep] looked exquisite in it, the photography was amazing, and there was nothing wrong with that movie at all. It was a fabulous movie and so different and so unusual. I even love the title for its originality. Great movie.Singin' in the Rain (1952) 100%I love to show them [her grandchildren] my movie Singin’ in the Rain. I’ve always looked younger for my age. I just have. And then at the point I was about, I don’t know, 20-something, and I looked like I was 12. And they kept looking at me and looking at the movie and looking at me, and they were saying, “Is that you?” And I said, “Excuse me: Yes!” And one of them actually said, “Are you sure?” Anyway, that’s one of my favorite movies by the way – of all the movies and the genres, I think Singin’ in the Rain is just one of the great movie musicals. “Dignity, always dignity.” And when he’s in a little airplane as a stuntman, goes crashing through a barn, I swear to God, I thought I would pee.Monica Castillo for Rotten Tomatoes: Since you mentioned Singin’ in the Rain as one of your favorite movies, do you have a favorite memory from the lot?Rita Moreno: I was under contract to MGM, young, very young. I think I was 18, and I was told that I might be doing it, but Gene Kelly had to talk to me first. He met me in the makeup department, and the first thing he said was – he was kind of a bit off-putting – and he said, “Zelda Zanders is this and that and that and this.” And he said, “You need to cut your hair.” And I said, “No.” He literally said, “Excuse me?” I said, “No, I won’t cut my hair.” “Why?” I said, “Well, we just don’t in my family. We don’t cut our hair.” And he literally said, “Nobody’s ever said that to me before.” I really got nervous. I said [to myself], “You and your big mouth, you thought you were showing off how independent you are” – which I wasn’t.And he said, “Well, we’ll see. We’ll talk to you later.” I thought, “S–t, I really did it.” But he did, and I got that funny red-haired wig. Actually the wig he wanted to put on me, I mean, the ‘do he wanted to do on me was the one that eventually Cyd Charisse did, which was the little bangs and the little chopped-up one, which would have probably looked adorable. But there I was.There’s so many things because I was on that set almost every day, watching, learning, observing. I literally lived on those sets in Singin’ in the Rain. I saw him [Kelly] do that Singin’ in the Rain number with a fever. I saw Donald O’Connor do “Make ‘Em Laugh,” which is an amazing number. What’s interesting about that, it’s a little tiny bit of movie lore, he had to shoot it all over again after he did it because something was wrong with the camera. I don’t remember what it was. And he killed himself on that. And I remember he got a carpet rub on his arm. Those are the things you’re going to remember forever. Judy Garland said somewhere, “Being at MGM was just a dream come true for a young girl,” especially a little Puerto Rican girl.(Photo by Courtesy of Roadside Attractions)Rotten Tomatoes: That’s a chapter of your life that’s featured heavily in the documentary. I’d like to hear more about what your experience was like moving from Puerto Rico to New York City to Hollywood.Moreno:&nbsp;It was unbelievable because MGM was the studio that I always wanted to be with, assuming I had a choice, which is hilarious. But when an MGM talent scout approached my mom after seeing me perform at a dance school recital – because talent scouts really did do things like that – he came backstage and he handed her a business card and said, “It can’t happen now, but I think Rosita would be a wonderful candidate for MGM studios.” I just about passed out. Like six months later, he called my mom, and he would call her now and then just say, “I haven’t forgotten.”One time he called her, and we had just gotten a phone. I keep remembering details like that because phones were expensive. He said, “Louis B. Mayer is coming to town and I would like him to meet Rosita. And this is the day and this is where you go,” and all that. I about died. We literally went shopping, and I got a cincher because I wanted to be Elizabeth Taylor, [who] was my role model. I didn’t have any role models that made sense because nobody like me had them then.What’s interesting is that when we got to the Waldorf Astoria, first of all, my mother goes to the desk and she says, “We are going to meet Louis B. Major – how do we find Louis B. Major?” And the girl said, “Who?” They said, “Go to the special elevator and press P for penthouse.” I went in, met him, and the first thing he said – if not the first, one of the first – “Why she looks like a Spanish Elizabeth Taylor.” And before the meeting was over, he was like, “How would you like a contract with MGM, young lady?” So, everything that’s interesting and important in my professional life has been fortuitous. You know how we all say we struggle? My struggles have been monumental, but somehow when big things happen, they usually happen like that. Go figure.Rotten Tomatoes: In the documentary, you don’t just revisit these memories. You return to them and offer life lessons you picked up from these experiences. Was that intentional?Moreno:&nbsp;Well, it does come out, but it’s also intentional in the sense that I made a promise to myself that if I was going to do this documentary, I was going to be as truthful as I could possibly be. I’ve seen other documentaries, especially with actors, and I always see a lot of little shifting and stuff, and I always know when they’re doing that. I thought, I’m not going to do that, and I didn’t. It was a promise that was hard to keep sometimes because I was asked some tough questions, and I mean, you can almost see it sometimes when I just hesitate: “Dare I answer this?”I thought: “You have to. You made a promise to the most important person in the world: you.”(Photo by Courtesy of MGM Media Licensing)And yes, to answer your question in a light manner, I think it’s very important to point out the lessons and what I’ve learned because I’ve learned a lot. I was a very, very ignorant young woman. I knew almost nothing. Like in this scene where I talk about my agent sexually abusing me. I didn’t even know the word “rape.” I mean, I was really very innocent. What I said to myself was, “He attacked me.”&nbsp;I didn’t know words like that. I was truly, truly a very pure young woman, and going to Hollywood, being that kind of young woman, was really shocking and hard on me. When I talk about that cocktail party, it’s brutal. I almost want to say it’s not fair, but what is? I think one of the lessons of the documentary with respect to women is you just have to get tough without becoming a tough, hard person. That is not an easy task. You have to learn to bounce with the horrors and the insults to your humanity and to your femininity and yet not get bitter. That is really difficult.I think it’s what psychotherapy really brought to my life. I will always talk about it in the most positive way because it helped me immensely. I really grew up with no sense of self. I really despised myself. I did not like myself, but that’s because I learned very early on that I was a “spic.” That’s what I learned as a very young girl. And what’s a spic? They’re nothing. They don’t mean anything. They don’t have value. It takes a very, very long time to understand that, to find where you are worthy. I think only unless you were immensely lucky, I think the only way to find that when you’ve lost it or never had it, is to be in psychotherapy.Rotten Tomatoes: One of the things that the documentary also touches on, and I feel like you could talk so much more about, is your history and activism because you got into activism fairly early on in your career.Moreno:&nbsp;I had a roommate here in California when I was in my late teens, I guess 19, 20, who was very political, a girl named Phyllis. She was the one who really introduced me to that world, to the world of caring for others and doing for others. I think actually she was a real lefty. I’m guessing now because I didn’t use those words then, but she made me understand that it isn’t enough to help yourself, but that you really, really have an obligation, if you’re a human being, to help others in any way that you can. And that really turned me around. I thought she was an extraordinary one and still do.Rita Moreno: Just a Girl Who Decided to Go For It&nbsp;is in theaters Friday June 18, 2022.&nbsp;On an Apple device?

He’s worked with Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansson (Marriage Story); Julianne Moore and Billy Crudup (After the Wedding); Winona Ryder, Zoe Kazan, and John Turturro (The Plot Against America); Ethan Hawke and Rose Byrne (Juliet, Naked); and more. But his latest co-star might be the most impressive yet – or, at the very least, the most intimidating. In the new horror film, Come Play, Robertson plays Oliver, an autistic boy who becomes the target of a mysterious (and very lanky) being known as Larry who begins to appear on –&nbsp;and ultimately emerge from –&nbsp;TVs, laptops, phones, and tablets. The film is an expansion of writer-director Jacob Chase’s short, Larry, and co-stars Gillian Jacobs and John Gallagher Jr. as Oliver’s bereft parents, struggling with their own marital problems and the terrifying new presence in their house. Ahead of the movie’s release, self-confessed “scaredy cat” Robertson shared his five favorite films and told us what it’s like sharing a set with mega stars and monsters.Amélie (2001) 89%I really like it because I feel like it’s really goofy and wacky. I’m not usually one for romance movies, but I feel like this is my favorite.Do you watch a lot of foreign films?&nbsp;Actually, not really. Other than Japanese films and anime, I usually don’t, but I feel like this is one of my favorite foreign films – right after Parasite.Parasite (Gisaengchung) (2019) 98%Number four is, coincidentally, Parasite. I watched it with my parents. I saw it at home. I feel like it’s a thriller without being scary in the traditional sense. I’m still just a kid, so I don’t get some of the deeper meanings behind it, but I really enjoyed it. The last part where – spoilers! – the guy in the basement goes crazy on everyone and kills everyone, it’s just crazy.Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse (2018) 97%Oh, I’m sharing some really great ones now. Number three is probably Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse. The animation style is one of my favorites of all time – and I’ve seen a lot of animated things. The story is great. I’m a huge comic book nerd, and I’m a sucker for alternate-universe shenanigans. I really liked how they brought in alternate versions of Spider-Man. The fight choreography was great. The animation style was great. I can’t really point out a flaw in the movie.You said you’re a comic book nerd. Do you have a particular favorite comic book or favorite hero?&nbsp;I have no idea. There are so many good ones. I’m a Batman guy. I’m not a huge fan of the character, but I love his comics. I think either Dark Night Returns or The Killing Joke are some of my favorites. If you ask me to pick my favorite character, probably the Joker, honestly.Paprika (2006) 84%There’s this movie, I don’t know if you’ve heard of it, it’s a Japanese animated film called Paprika. I think it’s like Inception, but it came first. It’s very confusing, very weird. I like movies that are really wacky and strange. Honestly, I couldn’t make sense of it at all, but I feel like that’s the magic of it. I don’t think you’re encouraged to want to make sense of it. I think the movie just wants you to enjoy it without having a clue what’s going on. If you like those kinds of movies, Paprika is great.Are you someone who, when you have that kind of movie, you like to re-watch it and try and work it out?With some things, I feel like I want to re-watch it, maybe with a lot of shows I watch that are weird, but I think, for movies, I feel like they’re meant to be seen only once. I only see them once.Except for Come Play, right?&nbsp;Yeah, everyone should watch Come Play multiple times. It’s common sense.Mad Max: Fury Road (2015) 97%Number one is –&nbsp;drum roll! –&nbsp;Mad Max: Fury Road. It’s my favorite. Its Oscars were very well deserved. The action’s great. The story is amazing. The characters are incredible. The aesthetic and atmosphere are great as well. Then, we get into cars. My favorite car, to this day, is the Cadillac Eldorado, I think it’s called, because, in that movie, the main antagonist has a car that’s two Eldorados stacked on top of each other. I just thought that was the coolest thing ever.Do you have a favorite sequence from Mad Max: Fury Road?I think the final battle with everyone, where everything erupted into chaos, was one of my favorite scenes from the entire movie.Joel Meares for Rotten Tomatoes: I was reading that you didn’t actually see Larry, the monster in Come Play, until the first time you interacted with it on set. What was your reaction to first seeing the creature?Azhy Robertson: It was pretty terrifying. The puppet looks a lot like it does in the movie. There was a scene where Gillian [Jacobs] and I were hiding under the bed and Larry just jump scared us! The first few takes, it really scared me. It was so surprising.For viewers who haven’t seen the film yet, what is so terrifying about the look of Larry?&nbsp;Robertson: He’s basic, he’s not super detailed or anything, but I think that makes him a little scarier. He’s just this huge tall lanky dude. He’s actually humanoid, and I feel like that reflects into the message of the movie about loneliness, and how he just wants some friends. That was very interesting to me.(Photo by © Focus Features )You watched Poltergeist in the lead up to this at the director’s suggestion. Were there other movies that you watched to get the vibe of what the filmmakers were going for? What did you think of Poltergeist and those films?Robertson: I didn’t really watch any other films, because I’m literally a huge scaredy cat, so I didn’t want to watch any more horror films. But Poltergeist is pretty similar to Come Play, because they both involve an invisible and mysterious entity-slash-ghost, and they’re doing strange and horrible things to a family.Right. And both involve entities coming through screens – in Poltergeist through the TV, and in Come Play&nbsp;Larry’s coming from iPads, phones, TVs… anything around.Robertson: Yeah.Speaking of… do your parents have strict rules for your laptop and iPad usage? They might get stricter after seeing this movie!&nbsp;Robertson: Now, in quarantine, I really don’t have anything to do other than that, so I don’t really get very many limits, but they stop me if I’m on it for way too long. Before quarantine, it was only four hours a week. Playing with my friends doesn’t really count, though, only playing by myself.Preparing for this role, you also spent some time in New York being with kids with special needs and autism to get a sense of your character. How did that experience help prepare you to play Oliver?Robertson: I sat in on some classes and observed some of the common characteristics between some of the kids, because, if you’ve met one kid with autism, then you’ve only met one kid with autism. They’re not all the same. I just wanted to see some common things that they do. For example, “stimming” was one, where you just do something with your body, your hands, your joints, because if there’s too much sensory detail, then you focus on what you’re doing with your hands or your joints or your body. [Editor’s note:&nbsp;Oliver does a version of this in the film.](Photo by © Focus Features )You’ve worked with some really incredible&nbsp;actors in your very short career. Obviously, Adam Driver and Scarlet Johansson in Marriage Story, and then Winona Ryder and Zoe Kazan in The Plot Against America, and here with Gillian Jacobs and John Gallagher Jr. What did you learn from your co-stars in this movie?Robertson: I’ve learned a lot. Gillian, she taught me that if you need to be emotional… She gave me a lot of space to be emotional, and she told me how you can help get teary and sad: You isolate yourself. That’s something that I use to this day. When I need to be very sad or emotional, I isolate myself from everyone else to concentrate.One last question before I let you go. There’s one sequence that really stands out in the movie, a terrifying scene set in a parking booth that&nbsp;is also in director Jason Chase’s short. The invisible monster attacks. It looked incredibly intense and wild. What was that like to shoot?It was both scary and fun. Playing with that laser thing, that was pretty cool. Getting picked up by an invisible ghost – that was really intense and terrifying. Using the sticky-hand thing, without going into too much detail, that was pretty insane as well. That whole sequence of scenes was really cool.Have you seen the finished film?Robertson: Yeah I have.Scary?&nbsp;Robertson: Very.Come Play&nbsp;is in theaters October 30, 2020.&nbsp;On an Apple device?

The acclaimed director&nbsp;has been producing quietly devastating&nbsp;portraits of&nbsp;life on the economic margins of American&nbsp;society for the past 25 years; her films move quietly, slowly, centering on economic anxieties and reveling in the vistas of the American wild, whether on the frontier or in the country’s densest woods. For her latest,&nbsp;First Cow, she returns to the forest (echoes of Old Joy)&nbsp;and to the 19th Century&nbsp;(echoes of&nbsp;Meek’s Cutoff), adapting a portion of her co-screenwriter Jonathan Raymond’s novel,&nbsp;The Half Life.As ever with Reichardt, the&nbsp;story is simple: It’s the Oregon Territory, and Chinese immigrant King Lu (Orion Lee) and traveling cook Cookie Figowitz (John Magaro) embark on a scheme to steal milk from a wealthy landowner’s cow in order to sell baked goods&nbsp;at market and save up enough money to rise above their station and pursue their dreams. But, as ever, the resonances are deep – the film’s imagery may be of docile cows and muddy paths and broke-down huts and silver pieces, but&nbsp;First Cow&nbsp;feels urgently of our time.Ahead of the movie’s release, Reichardt spoke with Rotten Tomatoes about five films that were on her mind as she made&nbsp;First Cow, and which she feels are a piece with the new film’s look and feel, its characters, and its message. The movie will be digitally released Friday, July 10, 2020, giving people a new chance to see one of the most acclaimed films of the year.Editor’s note: This interview took place before the Coronavirus outbreak and subsequent lockdown and was originally published ahead of the movie’s limited theatrical release.Ugetsu (Ugetsu monogatari) (1954)  100%I mean the thing with Ugetsu, and the whole Apu Trilogy [discussed next], that I was really looking at when I was making First Cow, was that they are super low-to-the-ground films. You get to the ambition of the potter in Ugetsu, and the sort of dream sequences of it. I love the way it’s filmed, in the way the small villages are filmed, and the way you’re in this hutch all the time and everyone is super low-to-the-ground. I mean everyone’s sitting on the floor all the time and you’re wandering through these small towns and you’re inside these hutches, and I liked that Cookie [in First Cow] is sort of a down-to-the-ground guy – he’s a forager.There are caste systems in both Ugetsu and the Apu Trilogy, and both of the protagonists are sort of at the bottom of the food chain and surviving hand-to-mouth. In the case of Ugetsu, I found that character relatable as far as King Lu [in&nbsp;First Cow] goes – he really wants to get a toe hold in the next level, and he’s very seduced by getting there; he just has kind of a narrow vision of like, “I’ve got to get to this place.” He also knows&nbsp;that he has to find a backdoor into it. And they’re all craftspeople in Ugetsu, and in First Cow&nbsp;Cookie is a cook and they’re constantly making things, and King Lu is sewing his slippers – it’s a life of just endless making of things because it’s how you’re surviving.Pather Panchali (1955)  97%Ultimately, there is ambition in the Apu Trilogy – he’s leaving his village and he marries into a different class. But there’s also that incredible friendship that runs through the Apu Trilogy. I return to&nbsp;the Apu Trilogy constantly. I saw it first in art school and I felt overwhelmed by it; as someone coming from Miami and who hadn’t seen anything of the world, I was just like, India, it’s too much for me. But for some reason it really resonated and I have returned to it so often. I find Satyajit Ray’s filmmaking so lyrical and there’s a real economy to the way he shoots the film. It’s all just pans; there’s no kind of dual camera movement ever going on. [Cinematographer Christopher] Blauvelt and I had a similar rule, except for when we’re in the&nbsp;Chief Factor’s house, when there’s like this more expressive kind of filmmaking going on and it feels a little grander. We had this really economical way of shooting; people moving in the frame and&nbsp;we pan one way or the other. But there were no parallel moves happening at once.The Gleaners and I (2001)  93%In Gleaners And I, what’s around you is what you survive on – it’s a kind of contemporary foraging that they’re doing. I thought of that, and Agnes [Varda, the director] was on my mind because, A) she passed away when I was making a film, and B) they brought back a print of Vagabond before I was shooting. I was in New York and I saw Lady Bird and the theater was packed and there was so much hype about Lady Bird at that time. Then I walked up and I saw Vagabond in this not-so-full theater and saw a print of it. I thought, “Oh my God, the inventiveness of that film and the sort of circular motion of it and how she just decides to let people talk to the camera at a point, even though she’s in this narrative!” Anyway, just her confidence to be so inventive with narrative form. She’s so inspiring. How she moved in and out of documentary and narrative and how her docs have such narrative threads in them and her narratives… she just opens the door, and it’s like, “OK, now you’re going to talk to these real people that aren’t actors,” and she is just very fluid between those two. I admire those things about her work so much.Happy as Lazzaro (Lazzaro felice) (2018)  91%I hadn’t seen that movie when I made First Cow, but then I went to Cannes and was on the jury. I had just finished editing, and when I got back from Cannes, I was going to do my sound mix. I met Alice [Rohrwacher, director of Happy as Lazzaro]&nbsp;– she was on the jury with me&nbsp;– and so I watched her film before I went, and I love this film and I thought, “Oh my God, there are some similar things to First Cow as far as, like, Lazzaro wakes up in some other house and you don’t know how much time has passed…” I put that on my list because it was very important to me to let Alice know I found her so inspiring and great, and I felt a real simpatico with her filmmaking. It feels in the world of my memory of making First Cow.The Tree of Wooden Clogs (L'albero degli Zoccoli) (1979)  94%I was working on a film with another writer friend that didn’t happen. It was going to happen in Europe if it happened, and I had been scouting for it, and I saw this film when I was thinking about that movie, and that maybe kind of bled into First Cow. Suddenly First Cow did come together, and they were both in the same period, and they both were sort of films of peasants in their little hutches. [In Wooden Clogs], this is like a little community of workers who are working on the property of their landlord; the Chief Factor in First Cow isn’t really a property owner, but he’s more like the CEO of Firestone going to another continent and using all the resources; he’s holding this kind of power in the region. There were some thematic things, but again, it’s people in their little houses working all day – always sewing, fixing things, feeding the animals – and then around the candlelight at night telling stories and cooking in their fires and everything is very tactile. All the hay, the thatch roofs, the wooden floors, all those things – the chores, the chores, the chores.Joel Meares&nbsp;for Rotten Tomatoes:&nbsp;We are seeing you return to the 19th century, to the early, early stages of this country. I’m wondering what is it that draws you to that period and interests you?Well it was Jonathan Raymond’s novel, The Half Life, which has kind of been hovering around us, he and I, for a couple of decades, and we’ve been trying to think of how we could ever sort of get our arms around it, because the novel spans 40 years and there’s a ship ride to China and it’s this very big [story]. So part of it was that and that I had my head in this time period for this film that I ended up not making, and I had been sort of steeped in just some paintings from the 19th century, in images I didn’t really want to lose hold of. Some of it made its way into First Cow – things I had been living with for a while.First Cow&nbsp;is&nbsp;available to rent or buy digitally from July 10, 2020.#1First Cow (2020) 96%#1Adjusted Score: 104.5% Critics Consensus: First Cow finds director Kelly Reichardt revisiting territory and themes that will be familiar to fans of her previous work -- with typically rewarding results.Synopsis: Kelly Reichardt once again trains her perceptive and patient eye on the Pacific Northwest, this time evoking an authentically hardscrabble...

At the time, Clark was&nbsp;anticipating the&nbsp;imminent&nbsp;openings of two films&nbsp;that would go on to reap great acclaim:&nbsp;The Personal History of David Copperfield,&nbsp;based on the much-adapted Charles Dickens novel and in which she plays&nbsp;two pivotal supporting roles, and as the lead in psychological horror film&nbsp;Saint Maud. She had also garnered attention for piercing performances in films, as disaffected Frederica in the Jane Austen adaptation&nbsp;Love &amp; Friendship, for one, and as the young Jane&nbsp;in Craig Robert’s Eternal Beauty, for another. On TV, she’s appeared as emotionally-lobotomized Sister Clara in His Dark Materials, based on author Philip Pullman’s trilogy, and, in yet another literary adaptation, as Mina in Mark Gatiss and&nbsp;Steven Moffat’s&nbsp;Dracula.Director Armando Iannucci’s Dickens adaptation would finally find release in theaters in August and then on streaming in November, but A24’s Saint Maud, the debut film of&nbsp;writer-director Rose Glass, has&nbsp;experienced fits and starts in its&nbsp;journey toward&nbsp;its limited release this month. The film, which had been screened on the festival circuit and is Certified Fresh on Rotten Tomatoes, was simply waiting to dazzle a wider audience.“In sight and sound, every second of this film is alive with art and agony, making Saint Maud a righteously haunting horror offering that deserves to be worshipped,” wrote IGN Movies critic&nbsp;Kristy Puchko.Clark’s Maud is a newly converted religious fanatic who works as a&nbsp;live-in&nbsp;nurse&nbsp;to dying Amanda (Jennifer Ehle). Maud also adopts the task of saving Amanda’s soul, but the young caregiver’s piety slips into delusional obsession&nbsp;— or does it? Filmmaker Glass leaves audiences guessing whether Maud is having a mental health crisis and hallucinating&nbsp;or viewers are simply too quick to pass judgement on her visceral faith.Variety critic Guy Lodge observed: “Maud is like Carrie White and her mother Margaret rolled into one unholy holy terror; as played with brilliant, blood-freezing intensity by Morfydd Clark, she’s a genre anti-heroine to cherish, protect and recoil from, sometimes all at once.”So 2020 should have been Clark’s breakout year, but 2021 may have to do. The actress also has a major role in Amazon’s upcoming&nbsp;The Lord of the Rings series, which is set in the Second Age of&nbsp;J. R. R. Tolkien’s fantasy world of Middle-earth, before the events of Peter Jackson’s film adaptions of The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings. The setting&nbsp;during that period suggests a younger Lady Galadriel&nbsp;(the royal Elf played by Cate Blanchett in Jackson’s films), her husband&nbsp;Celeborn, the founding of&nbsp;Lothlórien, and the forging of&nbsp; Rings of Power will all be featured. Clark’s role in the series hasn’t been officially announced, but fans have their suspicions.In a March phone call from New Zealand, where&nbsp;The Lord of the Rings&nbsp;is filming, Clark spoke to Rotten Tomatoes about Saint Maud, Copperfield, and her favorite films. Here’s what the BAFTA Rising Star nominee said:Groundhog Day (1993) 96%I just love Bill Murray so much.&nbsp;Granted, I think he’s like perfect, because he’s Bill Murray. I just find it so funny, and there’s something about a film that’s all set on the one day, that happens again and again and again, for some reason you want to watch again and again and again — I kind of love the irony of that. I started watching it when I was really little with my dad, because he loves it, and it was one of those films that every time that I watched it, every year or so, and would get more and more of the jokes, and I still feel that every time I watch it there’s something else that I haven’t noticed. And it made me fall in love with Bill Murray, and that has lasted all my life.Pan's Labyrinth (2006) 95%So this is one that definitely “favorite” is the wrong word for it, because I find it so horrendous and I’ve only watched it three times and I don’t know if I could watch it again, but Pan’s Labyrinth.&nbsp;I think it was the first super-adult film I watched, and I remember watching it on my own, just being awfully devastated. I don’t know if you’d describe Pan’s Labyrinth as horror, but it was the first horror film&nbsp;… that I’d seen shine light on the horrifying things that people do, and kind of also [include] fantasy with that. There was lots in Pan’s Labyrinth that I thought was kind of childish until I saw Pan’s Labyrinth. It was the sort of things that I liked that kind of weren’t adult or grown-up, and Pan’s Labyrinth kind of opened that to me and just devastated me in a way that no film ever has.Do you think&nbsp;Pan’s Labyrinth is a movie you should watch alone or would you recommend watching it with other people?No, I shouldn’t have watched it alone, but I also hate crying in front of other people at films. I find I love going to the cinema, but there’s something about the intensity of feeling you’re having with all these strangers that sometimes I find totally overwhelming. I’m like, Ahh I’m so exposed, I’m feeling so much. But I definitely should have arranged to see someone straight after; it was the aftermath that was awful, just lying there, staring at the ceiling, just gutted.Strictly Ballroom (1992) 93%The next one is&nbsp;Strictly Ballroom. It makes me so happy … I love all of Baz Lurhmann’s films — that&nbsp;Moulin Rouge has got the&nbsp;all of these grand sets,&nbsp;and Romeo &amp; Juliet has the language of Shakespeare, and then&nbsp;Strictly Ballroom has the dancing. I love that. And that scene where he’s dancing on his own was very sexy to me as a 12 year old. I was like, Oh my gosh, what are these feelings I’m having for this man dancing&nbsp;in his little vest&nbsp;…&nbsp;Strictly Ballroom is something I’ll watch if I’m feeling — well, kind of any mood, but particularly if I’m feeling a little blue. It’s like injecting happiness into my veins. And I just love the colors.&nbsp;I can see the color palette so clearly in my mind and it brings me such joy — and also just the dancing is amazing.Sense and Sensibility (1995) 97%The next one is Sense and Sensibility, the Emma Thompson&nbsp;film.&nbsp;I have a sister and I feel the dynamic of them — it was a film that made me understand myself and my world. I struggled to pick an Austen that I like the most because I just love them all, but I think that film is so perfectly adapted, and they’re wonderfully acted and so gorgeously shot.Twin Town (1997) 46%My final one, I would say is Twin Town, which is a Welsh film, with Rhys Ifans and his brother Llyr set in Swansea with Dougray Scott as a very nasty guy. I watched it&nbsp;alone from home and what, was really wonderful about Twin Town&nbsp;is that — it’s kind of the great thing about being Welsh, is that it’s so small, you go on nights out and you see rugby players, and then I watched Twin Town and then realized that one of the actors in it walks his dog on the same old railway line as us, I was like, Oh my gosh, this guy is an actor.&nbsp;I’d say Twin Town is hilarious, it’s kind of grim, and it’s Welsh, and I love all those things&nbsp;— and Rhys Ifans.Debbie Day for Rotten Tomatoes:&nbsp;It’s interesting what you said about Pan’s Labyrinth gutting you and then Strictly Ballroom bringing you absolutely absolute joy, because it reminds me of Saint Maud and David Copperfield;&nbsp; they’re&nbsp;complete opposites, and Saint Maud very much gutted me, and then with David Copperfield, I couldn’t keep the smile off my face.Clark:&nbsp;Yay, that makes me so happy, [to hear] people talk about Copperfield like that because that’s what Armando wanted to do, he wanted give people a film that would just make them love everyone and everything and make them really happy and that kind of stuff. It seems to be what’s happening and it is just so lovely.You played two roles in that.Clark:&nbsp;I did. Which I only auditioned for one of them and then had lunch with Armando before he cast me just to kind of meet me, because he likes to meet people and see if you connect with them&nbsp;— not only just send a tape — and then he’s like, “So we want you to play Clara as well.” And then&nbsp;I had to go through this whole meeting kind of being like, I need to scream. Ahhhh! I can’t believe this has happened. But yeah, that was really lovely, and it was also meant that I acted with Jairaj [Varsani], he played young David Copperfield. He was just wonderful.That was a beautiful beautiful relationship on screen. Did Armando make that choice to have you play both roles so that it gives Dev’s David Copperfield more reason to connect with Dora?Clark:&nbsp;Yeah, in the book he says that Dora is a lot like his mother and kind of reminds him of his mother, but also it’s kind of the idea that he’s constantly trying to kind of find what he’s lost and what he once had, and so when he meets Dora it and there is like big similarities, he’s like, I must grab that because that’s something that was gone from me. And then you kind of obviously realize that doesn’t mean that it’s right. I think David’s constantly trying to get back what is now gone instead of trying to make a new world, and Dora represents that kind of stuff&nbsp;and is amplified by being played by me.(Photo by A24)I know you’ve done horror before, but can you tell me what drew you to Saint Maud?Clark:&nbsp;I am really obsessed with the health&nbsp;service. I have lots of family who work in it, but also just kind of constantly was watching 24 Hours&nbsp;on A&amp;E, 999: What’s Your Emergency, and One Born Every Minute. I find the idea that the people who want to care for people most are in a situation&nbsp;— because of money, stress, and work hours — are kind of being broken and that is so sad and just wrong. And so immediately when I started reading it and realized she was a nurse and she just kind of experienced burnout, I was like, I care about this, I care about her, and it shouldn’t have happened, but I want to protect her. So it kind of immediately made me care about her.Did you read the script and think, Oh my God, I have to play this role?Clark:&nbsp;I think it’s more that I read scripts am sometimes like, Oh my gosh, I have no idea what to do with this. I would be really bad at that.&nbsp;When I read Maud I was like, Oooo, I think I could do this actually. I think I’d know why she did these things. I think I’d understand her. There’s so many moments that you’re like, Oh my God, I can’t believe that has happened, but equally like, Of course that happened. So this is happened to Maud, then this and this and this, and this has happened to Amanda.&nbsp;And so I found the kind of amazing juxtaposition that Rose manages to get in terms of … kind of making the extreme mundane and ordinary and normal and make perfect sense is really kind of interesting to me.And I also read it being like, Oh, there’re no scenes in this that I’ll be terrified to film. Because the ones I’m terrified to film are always ones that I just can’t quite make sense of or quite understand, and there was huge clarity of who the woman was and why this story happens. So I think that’s what it was: I kind of felt that I wouldn’t be terrible.Is the horror supposed to be real or is it supposed to be in her mind?Clark:&nbsp;Rose did a lot [of research] about how saints possibly had mental illnesses, like Joan of Arc. There’re those really interesting podcasts about it. There’s a particular type of thing that can happen in the brain that you get these very vivid hallucinations.So my last question is: Are you as excited to be in The Lord of the Rings as fans are to see it?Clark:&nbsp;Oh my gosh, I’m such a Lord of the Rings fan, I can’t tell you. I have this really clear image of telling everyone to leave me alone while I was reading The Hobbit at year six. And then I’ve watched those films so many times, and I think that it’s been very hard to reconcile this with the idea this is actually happening, because it’s just crazy to me that I am in it, because I’d have been so excited just to watch it.Read More: “Everything We Know About The Lord of the Rings Amazon Series“I’m just thrilled for you. It’s a really exciting time with these films and your role in Lord of the Rings. It seems like a wonderful time in your career.Clark:&nbsp;Thank you. I am starting to kind of allow myself be like, It’s all kind of working out. Enjoy it.Thank you so much for taking the time to talk to me. Keep healthy and safe.Clark:&nbsp;I know. It was making me think of all these cool nurses and doctors working so hard. I just really want them all to be OK.Saint Maud releases in U.S. theaters today and will be available on Epix starting February 12; The Personal History of David Copperfield is available to rent and buy through most major streaming video-on-demand services; The Lord of the Rings will stream on Amazon Prime Video.On an Apple device?

Oxygen, a long-in-development sci-fi thriller from France, sees a young woman (Melanie Laurent) waking up in a strange, futuristic-seeming medical cryo unit, trapped and alone with no idea how she got there or who she is, and oxygen in short supply. Her only company and source of information is the pod’s computer, voiced by iconic French actor Mathieu Amalric; like most Artificial Intelligence in movies with a premise like this, he cannot be trusted.\nAhead of the movie’s release on Netflix, Aja shared his five favorite films with Rotten Tomatoes, and spoke about his passion for science-fiction, the challenges of shooting in a confined space – and making the material compelling – and his desire to get back to his brutal career beginnings.\n\n\n        \n            \n            \n                \n            \n        \n            \n                \n                    The Shining (1980)\n                    \n            \n                \n                84%\n            \n        \n                \n                \n                    \nI’m going to start with the most obvious for me: The Shining. For one reason, it was my first real cinematic shock when I was a kid. I accidentally watched The Shining at age seven and it was the most traumatic experience and maybe one of the reasons why I’m doing what I’m doing today. Then, year after year, it’s that movie that I can watch again and again. I’m obsessed with every shot that they cut, every bit of dialogue, every emotion. I think there is a perfection for me in this movie.\nJoel Meares for Rotten Tomatoes: Is there a particular scene or shot that you love the most?\nYes, for me it’s that moment when Jack is entering the ballroom and sitting at the bar and everything is empty. The camera turns around after he says he would like a glass of… I don’t remember, some beer or whatever, and the bartender, Lloyd, appears. It’s that Faustian deal that I think is the most beautifully made and elegant deal with the devil that has ever existed on camera or even in literature. In that one scene, everything is said from the reason why Stephen King wrote the book in the first place – because he wanted to kill his son, because he drew on the manuscript – to everything in that scene; what Jack is going through is talking about creation, talking about who we are as humans. It’s just that devilish figure that just watches over him. It’s just maybe one of the most beautiful scenes in cinema.\n\n                   \n            \n        \n    \n\n        \n            \n            \n                \n            \n        \n            \n                \n                    Sunset Boulevard (1950)\n                    \n            \n                \n                99%\n            \n        \n                \n                \n                    \nIt’s very different but also something about creation, about Hollywood, about human nature, about the darkness of the spirit. For me, obviously there are so many amazing shots, from the first one to the last one, but for me, that ending, I remember the first time I discovered it – it’s just so insane and twisted. The addiction of fame. The addiction of that city. You know, I’m from Europe and there is a fascination for America but also for Hollywood. You know, I’m working there but that movie has this kind of echo. You see that maybe this movie would have been completely different made by another American filmmaker and not someone coming from Europe. I think it delivers a really broad European view on what Hollywood means.\n\n                   \n            \n        \n    \n\n        \n            \n            \n                \n            \n        \n            \n                \n                    Alien (1979)\n                    \n            \n                \n                98%\n            \n        \n                \n                \n                    \nThe whole Alien franchise! Can I say a franchise? The big one, the one that ends with Covenant – I was kind of blown away by it. I know that people might have some frustration and stuff [with that film], but I thought it was so crazy that he managed to close, to go back to the first one. That first film may be the best survival film of all. Her character, Ripley, for me is that one character that I always go back to in every movie. She represents everything I feel as a human being. You see a character that is not a superhero, that’s not a super human being, but is someone who managed to get that instinct to fight and keep fighting and find the resources to always stand again and defeat what is the most perfect enemy.\nRT: It’s interesting you say that because when you look at the films you’ve made, particularly the last two, Crawl and Oxygen, you also have amazing women, strong and almost Ripley-esque, having to tap into that survival instinct. Do you think that Ripley had an impact on your choice in projects?\nYes. I mean I’m sure that when I did Crawl, beyond the character, obviously, that crawlspace for me was like somehow I was thinking about an alien spaceship. It is not, it’s just a crawlspace. There is always an exploration. I think the Alien fascination, growing up watching it, brought me to have a real fascination for mythology and especially the whole Minotaur and the maze, and that led me to a certain kind of movie where I really like to… You have that journey where you have to find the way out. Where you have to be with the character. In High Tension, the quest is to survive to the morning. In Crawl, it’s just survive the storm and get out of the house. There is always a maze that you have to escape from.\n\n                   \n            \n        \n    \n\n        \n            \n            \n                \n            \n        \n            \n                \n                    Once Upon a Time in the West (1968)\n                    \n            \n                \n                95%\n            \n        \n                \n                \n                    \nI mean, I could put Once Upon a Time in the West or The Good, The Bad and The Ugly. I feel that there is something visually so groundbreaking with Sergio Leone’s style and directing. Something that almost reaches perfection shot after shot, and the use of the music. I say this is one of the most surreal and at the same time hyper-real immersive cinema, if that can exist. Everything is hyper, everything is bigger, everything is kind of like a version of the West that I think never really existed. At the same time, it just gets to your gut and you really feel that you are sitting at that table. Then that long silence, with the shot going from extreme close-up to super wide, and bringing in with the music… I don’t know, there is something quite powerful, at least for me, in this one.\n\n                   \n            \n        \n    \n\n        \n            \n            \n                \n            \n        \n            \n                \n                    Jaws (1975)\n                    \n            \n                \n                98%\n            \n        \n                \n                \n                    \nLet’s stay classic. Jaws: it’s obvious what effect it has had on my cinema. I think Jaws, at the same time, from the behind-the-scenes, from the creativeness that’s behind-the-scenes, it’s almost like a cautionary tale for every filmmaker. Just the perfection of the directing… I could have said Raiders of the Lost Ark as well, I could have talked about E.T. or Close Encounters of the Third Kind. I mean: Kubrick and Spielberg. I can never stop being surprised by where he finds a way to put his camera, where he finds a way to tell the story – from his storytelling to his use of every tool in the toolbox to create the perfect grammatical syntax of images. So Jaws is maybe like the one, the first perfect one, from a very long list of masterpieces.\n\n                   \n            \n        \n    \n\nJoel Meares for Rotten Tomatoes: When you were talking about where to place the camera, I thought, that’s a good segue into asking about Oxygen because you have a single location here, and it’s a tight location. In Crawl, at least you had the whole area under the house, right? Here you have just this tight pod that’s essentially as big as Melanie. What was the greatest challenge of shooting in what appears to be a tiny space – and keeping things interesting for the audience?\n\nAlexandre Aja: So I think the biggest challenge was obvious, because it was a very small cryo unit, almost like the size of a coffin. We took that challenge and we turned it into, I think, an advantage. I realized early on in the script that I had an obvious continuity of locations in that pod and I had a continuity of character with her, with Melanie, who was in every single shot and was so fun to direct, and who is carrying the emotion. So I thought about this as, okay, I’m going to in fact do something that I never even think about doing in other movies. I’m going to list down on a piece of paper all the different styles of directing, styles of framing, styles of effects, of types of lenses, of types of gadgets…\nIn fact, that kind of continuity with her and the location gave me the opportunity of going completely in different places scene after scene. So I avoid repeating myself and, most important, ensure that the audience doesn’t get bored of the same location. Also, not only to avoid repeating myself, but also trying to underline in better ways every single emotion. I think in another movie, if you do that, it becomes like a very bad taste or bad style, because you will just get out of the experience and you stop watching because you will see the camera movement every time. But because we had that perfect storytelling inside the box, I don’t think that you feel it. Then the camera becomes more like something that comes to underline every feeling or every new obstacle or nightmare that she’s going through.\n(Photo by Shanna Besson, © Netflix)\nRT: It’s interesting too that you mention Spielberg and Kubrick in your film selections, because watching this, just design-wise and also in some of the framing, I couldn’t help thinking of the Precogs in Minority Report and the tentacle things in War of the Worlds. And then obviously there’s the voice of HAL 9000. Were they direct influences on you?\nAja: I love science-fiction, and grew up reading a lot. I still read a lot of science-fiction, I’m watching a lot of science-fiction. I unfortunately didn’t have the opportunity until this movie to work on a science-fiction movie. I did develop many of them that either didn’t get made or will get made at some point – I hope. But yes, all the references that you were talking about, they all were in my mind. Of course, when you read a script and you have an AI talking, and it’s going to be a really important one, you cannot help but think about HAL 9000. And the same with Minority Report. I would say Philip K. Dick in general. There is not a real link between Oxygen and Philip K. Dick. But it was really in mind as I was doing it for a strange reason. But yes, I definitely love sci-fi. I think sci-fi at its best has a mission to think about the world we’re living in and what our position is within it and what we’re supposed to be doing or not. There is a very big “cautionary tale” aspect of sci-fi. I think it’s one of the things that really got me in and interested in the script when I read it the first time.\nRT: Just finally, you mentioned sci-fi as a genre you love, but I think I fell in love with your work, and many others did, with your sort of hardcore slasher material like High Tension and The Hills Have Eyes. I loved Piranha 3D as well. I’m wondering: will you return to that genre? I think a lot of fans would love to see a really terrorizing horror film from you at some point in the future.\nAja: I have them. I have a lot of them! With the traffic jam created by the pandemic, suddenly I have no idea which one is going to get done first. I still love the more extreme survival experience as well. I have a couple [of those films] that I’m developing that I really want to make. Going back to Alien –&nbsp;Alien is the perfect mix between very smart and sophisticated sci-fi, and is a very brutal film as well.\n\nOxygen is available on Netflix from May 12, 2021.\n\n\nOn an Apple device?

Twice.by Joel Meares | June 9, 2020 |  Comments(Photo by Alberto E. Rodriguez/Getty Images for Disney)Josh Gad is fast becoming Disney’s go-to man&nbsp;when the Mouse House&nbsp;finds itself in need of a hilarious sidekick. He’s played everyone’s favorite sun-loving snowman, Olaf, in the&nbsp;Frozen&nbsp;films, and stole the live-action&nbsp;Beauty and the Beast&nbsp;as Gaston’s bumbling buddy, LeFou. Now, he’s back to steal more scenes as kleptomaniac, over-gown dwarf Mulch Duggins in Disney’s adaptation of Eoin Colfer’s&nbsp;Artemis Fowl, an action-packed fantasy about a child criminal mastermind, a world of fairies, and the bond between a father and his son.The movie was supposed to hit theaters this year but is going straight to streaming service Disney+ following disruptions to the release schedule on the back of COVID-19, something Gad has mixed feelings about: on the one hand, this spectacle-filled family flick will bring some joy to people at a time when they need it, but on the other hand, “nothing will ever replace the cinema,” he told Rotten Tomatoes.Ahead of the movie’s digital release, Gad shared his five favorite films, with a big caveat. “I want to preface this by saying I have my five favorite movies to watch of all time, which are Back to the Future, The Goonies, Groundhog Day, The Wizard of Oz, and probably Ratatouille,” he said. “Those are the five movies that I watch over and over again.”&nbsp;He says the movies below are the ones that opened his mind about film: “These are&nbsp;the movies that I think really gave me a perspective on what cinema can be.”There Will Be Blood (2007)  91%Number five, I would say is&nbsp;There Will Be Blood. I was in a SAG [Screen Actors Guild] screening. The movie had gotten no attention at that point. I saw it before it had come out. I was a massive fan of [writer-director] P.T. Anderson. Obviously, anybody who goes to conservatory – like, Daniel Day-Lewis is core curriculum. I sat there and I watched as this movie began with 20 minutes of silence, basically. And I have never, in the modern era, I have never felt so mesmerized watching a contemporary film in my life. It was so unbelievably daring and brave and phenomenal, and the performances were so bizarre that I couldn’t understand what I was watching. So I would say that would be number five for me.Pulp Fiction (1994)  92%Number four would be – it’s almost cliché to say this now – but Pulp Fiction. So 1994&nbsp;was an insane year for cinema. As a kid, I probably saw Lion King&nbsp;six times in the theater that year; as a son, I probably saw Forrest Gump five times in the theater, because my parents kept taking me to it. But as a person coming into my own and realizing what moviemaking could be, that movie was a movie I snuck into and it was called Pulp Fiction. I had never seen anything like it before. It just completely blew my mind wide open with the possibilities of storytelling and introduced me to a filmmaker that wasn’t yet on my radar because, frankly, my parents never allowed me to watch Reservoir Dogs at that time. I remember walking through the looking glass and just having this jaw-dropping experience.You mentioned you snuck in to see Pulp Fiction. Was that because you were underage? And how did you get in?Oh yeah, I was under age, and I was with a couple of friends of mine and we were at the AMC theater in Hollywood, Florida, where I grew up, and we bought tickets to another movie and we snuck in. We were bad; we did that a couple of times. I actually got kicked out of Demolition Man for doing that, but Pulp Fiction, somehow I didn’t get kicked out. And I think I did it twice, because I was just so like, “What the hell did I just see? This is incredible.” So that definitely rocked my world.The Wizard of Oz (1939)  99%Number three is a movie that I think is a perfect film and it’s a film that it doesn’t matter whether I saw it for the first time at 2, or revisited again at 10, or 22, or 32, or this past year when I took my kids to see it on the big screen. And that’s The Wizard of Oz.The&nbsp;word “timeless” is thrown around a lot, and very rarely does it actually feel like it applies to as many motion pictures as are branded with that title. But The Wizard of Oz is one of those films that it truly doesn’t matter when you see it, it’s still timeless. It remains timeless. And that experience is proven by the fact that my own children, seeing it in a movie theater after seeing it on the small screen when they were very young, are still as awestruck by every single moment of that film as they were the first time they saw it. And it’s a movie that was made during the Great Depression. So that is a testament to great cinema. That’s a testament to the power of film.Have you done The Wizard of Oz on stage yourself?I’ve never done The Wizard of Oz on stage. Man, wouldn’t that be great? No, never had that opportunity.We’ll just put that out there into the universe for now.We’ll put that out there. We’ll will that into the universe. I don’t know that I’m going to be doing any stage anytime soon, but one day.The Godfather (1972)  97%The Godfather and The Godfather: Part IISo, then you get into the top two, which is just so damn hard to pick two movies that you can share to be the most perfect films of all time, but I’m going to do my best. I was 12 years old. and I had only been told in passing about this “saga,” these films that had been&nbsp;described as perfect. Then I went to Blockbuster Video and took a deep breath and grabbed a large case of two VHS tapes called The Godfather. And I took it home and I watched it and I was so unbelievably mesmerized that I made my mother drive me to the Blockbuster the next morning and I got Godfather II. And I put that in and watched it and then went and got Godfather III, which I wish I hadn’t gotten because I would have loved to have just kept it at those two films.But it was this moment of, again, an awakening where you realize the power of cinema – you realize what true moviemaking is. I’m going to cheat and say that Godfather&nbsp;1 and II are in my number two spot together because they are just so absolutely perfect and brilliant and almost act as one piece. And the level of filmmaking, the level of acting, the level of craftsmanship is just on another level that I don’t know will ever be surpassed. It really is just something to behold.Lawrence of Arabia (1962)  93%Up until recently, I would have told you that Godfather I&nbsp;and Godfather II would probably be number one for me. And I have to go back and revisit them because frankly, it’s been about five years since I’ve done so. But I had an experience right before COVID that was pretty remarkable.It was a movie that I’d seen plenty of times, in all the wrong ways. And frankly, it wasn’t even in my top 10. I found it a little boring, I found it a little hard to muster through, and I found it difficult at best. And then I went to the ArcLight Cinerama Dome, and I sat down, and for the next four hours I watched Lawrence of Arabia with an audience, the way that it was meant to be seen. And I’ve got to tell you in this moment right now, that movie is the movie that I would probably put number one on my list of most influential films for me as an artist.It’s haunting. It’s absolutely crazy to think that it came out when it came out, and that it takes the kind of risks it takes with its lead character. It was so unbelievably complicated and not easily digestible in terms of some of the choices that are made. And the complexities of his character are stripped away in real time, against the backdrop of some of the most incredible cinematography to ever be captured on a lens. It just really slayed me.Joel Meares for Rotten Tomatoes: You mentioned seeing Lawrence on the big screen… What are your feelings about the fact that Artemis Fowl, because of what’s happening, isn’t going to premiere on the big screen, but is going direct to Disney+?&nbsp;Josh Gad:&nbsp;My feeling is that it is rising to the moment and I couldn’t be more grateful. I would so much rather the audience get to experience this movie than sit at home and wish that they could have the opportunity to see something right now. I think, frankly, the fact that we get to share it with people at a time that is so difficult to find any joy, to find any light, to find any hope… There are millions and millions of families that are stuck between four walls right now, trying to not lose their minds, and if we can give them a two-hour respite from that, a break, then I absolutely support this decision to give a movie like this to families who so desperately need it.Does it hurt that I can’t celebrate this film with others on the big screen? Absolutely. Nothing will ever replace the cinema – nothing. Movie theaters have been a part of our collective experience for so long, and it binds us together. And it’s why even in this most desperate time, people are still making a trek to drive-in theaters, because they want that communal experience. So yes, it is, to some extent, a mixed bag, but I’m eternally grateful that we have an opportunity to share what I think people need most.Artemis Fowl&nbsp;is&nbsp;available to stream on Disney+ on June, 12 2020.&nbsp;#1Artemis Fowl (2020) 8%#1Adjusted Score: 15.003% Critics Consensus: A would-be franchise-starter that will anger fans of the source material and leave newcomers befuddled, Artemis Fowl is frustratingly flightless.Synopsis: Based on the first two books in author Eoin Colfer wildly popular children's fantasy series, Walt Disney Studios' Artemis Fowl...

What else do they need to know?” The line, spoken by a defense attorney to her client, Steve Harmon (Kelvin Harrison Jr.), sums up the tension at the heart of Anthony Mandler’s Monster. On trial for allegedly having served as lookout during a bodega robbery that turned deadly, Harmon finds himself face to face with the ugly reality so many young Black boys before him live with every day. Dubbed a “monster” by the prosecution, he’s called to prove not just his innocence but his humanity – to the jury, to the judge, and, yes, even to his lawyer.An adaptation of Walter Dean Myers’s critically acclaimed YA novel by the same name, the film first premiered back in 2018 at the Sundance Film Festival. Had it come out shortly after its festival premiere, the gripping legal drama would have marked the arrival of a major talent. Harrison Jr.’s first foray into leading man territory is electrifying. The young actor captures Steve’s despair with aplomb as the cinephile teen watches his carefree life slip away when he’s entangled in a Rashomon-like trial where his version of the truth may not pass muster. As it turned out, audiences first got to see Harrison Jr. shine in films like Luce, Waves, and, most recently, The Trial of the Chicago 7, where he played Fred Hampton. Less an introduction, then, Monster nevertheless further establishes the New Orleans-born actor as one of the most exciting actors of his generation.Ahead of the movie’s release on Netflix this May, Harrison Jr. spoke with Rotten Tomatoes about his Five Favorite Films. Despite coming up with them on the spot, his collection of women-led stories feel like a cohesive canon that reveals what thrills the young actor the most, namely the chance to watch performers at the top of their game expertly bringing to life complicated characters caught between who they are and who they wished they could be.We Need to Talk About Kevin (2012) 75%I just love the visuals. I think Tilda [Swinton]’s performance is so sick. It’s insane. The choices she makes are so great. There’s something about seeing her internalize her situation and her relationship with her son, and kind of take the brunt of her not knowing how to love a child the way she thought she would, that motherly instinct she thought she had not kicking in, and how that affected the child. It also plays into my interest in parent-child dynamics. I feel like in every movie I’m always interested in, like, who are my parents? And how did they either win with me, or really mess up? And how has that affected how I behave in return? But really, it’s just Tilda’s performance – and, you know, Ezra [Miller] is also amazing, John C. Reilly is amazing, the little girl’s amazing, and the visuals are sick and dope, so, yeah.American Hustle (2013) 92%First of all, I love Amy Adams in this movie. I love the whole switching up the two personalities thing. Like, I love that everyone’s playing a part. You could tell there’s just a lot of improv and a lot of on-the-fly realizations. They feel so rough and so raw and so alive. That was exciting to me. I love the line where she goes, “The key to people is what they believe and what they want to believe, and I want to believe that we were real.” That always stuck with me because I really do kind of carry that to every movie. Like, people really do believe what they want to believe. I always found that fascinating. So yeah, I love the “hustler” aspect of American Hustle.Blue Jasmine (2013) 90%I mean, Cate Blanchett! Her performance is unmatched. I really do kind of look at that and go, whoa! What a master class! I also just love the Blanche DuBois of it all. I love, love, love it. I think it’s so good and it’s fun to watch her spiral. I think it’s a master class in a spiral, in watching someone just like deny, deny, deny, deny, deny, deny — and I think we do that so often in life. She just does a really good job of showing it, and trying to smile through it, and also just spilling out and shooting out her privilege. I also think that’s interesting about the performance, just being like, “This is what I am.” But it’s also becoming who you want to become and convincing yourself that you’re that person again, the whole American Hustle of it all.Closer (2004) 68%I don’t know that I have much to say with that movie. I really just love the writing of that film. I just think the way the stories kind of intertwine, and it’s so messy. It’s so messy! I watched it recently with someone and they didn’t really like it, they weren’t vibing with it, and it really upset me, to be honest. I don’t even know if I can really explain why it upset me. I guess this is getting very vulnerable at this point but I, personally, in my life, I truly think I’ve been very messy in my relationships. And I think it’s hard not to be. And I think the movie does a really good job at kind of highlighting how much we don’t know what we want and how we want everything, and just the games we play, and the power games and power dynamics we kind of subscribe to. I don’t know, it’s just exciting. And the performances! Natalie Portman at the strip club! That whole scene. It’s just so good. And Clive! I don’t know, we’d have to sit down and just talk about the movie beat by beat.Dreamgirls (2006) 78%That movie I just love. I grew up in music, so I love the music. But I also love the drama. I love the girl group drama. The fact that somebody was over there doing something she wasn’t supposed to, and somebody was in love, and somebody thinks they’re supposed to be a star, and somebody thinks it’s funny. I also love the underdog story. I love the idea of someone having a gift and the business trying to get in the way of the gift. It’s what I learned, too, in this business; like, everybody’s trying to play. Everybody wants something, everybody’s trying to level up in some way, everyone has some dream, and everyone’s gonna leave some legacy behind. And I love the idea of Effie just being like, “What? Like, I know I’m gifted and I just want to sing, period.” That’s it. It’s not that deep. Like, I want to get what I deserve. And I think that’s the thing: this is a story about deserving. And it’s a story about friendship and not allowing the hype of the industry getting the best of you and kind of turning you into something else. Because it’s just not that deep. I think that’s the thing about all of these films, too, is people are going crazy over stupid s–t. And everyone starts to believe the hype and start reading their own press and believe in their own press and start thinking that they’re something that they’re not. And that is not the key to happiness. It is not for any of them.Manuel Betancourt for Rotten Tomatoes: Hearing you talk about all these movies, it strikes me that you are very fascinated with characters who are straddling the line between what they want to tell other people and the stories they’re telling themselves. That feels like what’s going on with Steve in Monster. Is that what drew you to the part?Kelvin Harrison Jr.: Yeah, I think, it’s the search for identity. I think that’s the thing about those characters. They’re in a moment where they’re trying to really figure out what they want and, I mean, that’s every movie, that’s everyone in everything — we’re always trying to figure out what we want, what we need, and how do we get it. [Steve]’s 17 and his particular circumstances are: he’s privileged, he’s Black, and he’s curious. And now suddenly everyone’s sitting there trying to tell him who he is, what he can do, and that, because he’s Black, he suddenly is grouped in with a bunch of other guys. And now he’s on trial and it doesn’t really make sense to him. He’s just like, “Dude!” I’m just trying to figure out, like, what sneakers look like. I’m trying to figure out where he got jewelry from, or if he likes that girl, just stupid s–t. And it’s very simple. It isn’t that deep. And now he’s supposed to be really serious and tough to try to convince people of his humanity. He’s not innocent until proven guilty, he’s guilty until proven innocent. And he has to determine that based on somebody else’s standard of humanity.And that’s such a wild bag to fit in. I also found that when I first started working. I was sitting there (and I even find myself in this trap now) with people telling me who I am and why I need to be a certain way and what people will accept and what people won’t accept and what people will think is, you know, too crazy: You need to do this part or you can’t do this and you can’t dress this way, you can’t say that, you know? I’m just kind of like, “What? I’m 26. Let me decide that.” I think that was the case when I first got the job. I was exploring that then, and I’m still exploring it now. I think we do that for the rest of our lives.(Photo by Netflix © 2021)RT: A film like Monster feels like it’s part of a constellation of projects, alongside Luce, Waves, and Monsters and Men. What are the things you’re looking for in these parts and in the projects?Harrison: I think it’s something that the films are drawn to me and I’m drawn to them because of the path that I had gone on. One kind of serves the other, in a way. I don’t know if I want to say it’s a typecast thing because I don’t really think it’s like that, to be honest. It’s kind of more like chapters. I’ve always seen my career like that. When I first started, my first job when I got my SAG card was on 12 Years a Slave. And then after that, Roots came. And then, after that, Underground came, and then after that, Birth of a Nation came in. That’s the “Understanding My History” chapter. And then I feel like I got into like this “Black Lives Matter” chapter: Monster happened and then Monsters and Men happened. And then Luce happened, and Waves happened. And I think all of those talk about young Black men dealing with the trauma from slavery. The origins of their trauma started then.And it’s interesting because now, with Godfather of Harlem and BB King [in Baz Luhrmann’s untitled Elvis project], I’ve been dealing with the ’60s now, the Civil Rights era. And, I think, you know, it’s unpacking what blackness means for me and for everyone in this moment as we really start to pull back the curtain and go, let’s take a look at the systems. Let’s take a look at that because we’re not standing for it anymore.So I guess the movies have been an examination, finding the nuance that these directors and writers and performers are all trying to unpack based on the knowledge they’ve attained over their time on Earth. And if that’s what I end up doing for the rest of my career, that’s cool. That stuff means something to me, you know? It means something from me.Monster is available on Netflix from May 7, 2021.On an Apple device?

Celebrity fans Lin-Manuel Miranda, Mark Hamill, and Guillermo Del Toro decided to band together to kick off a tweetstorm of support for the show. That spark ignited the “Nine-Niners” (the internet name for fans of the show) to plead with another platform to save the beloved&nbsp;series from cancellation. And it worked. Brooklyn Nine-Nine trended on social media for several days and was eventually picked up by NBC.Two seasons later, the show is still going strong and set to shoot its eighth season (the third on NBC) as soon as TV production is allowed to continue. This die-hard support is why Terry Crews (who plays Sgt. Terry Jeffords) and the entire cast feel such a special affinity for the fandom. No one is quite sure when production will be approved to continue, but until then, fans can hear the NFL star-turned-actor in the animated adaption of&nbsp;Lois Lowry’s&nbsp;children’s novel The Willoughbys.The children’s dark comedy, which is currently Certifed Fresh at 89% on the Tomatometer, follows an eccentric family whose children think they’d be better off raising themselves and devise a plan to send their parents on “vacation.” They then embark on a harrowing and humorous adventure while left alone and eventually discover what “family” truly means. The cast includes&nbsp;Will Forte, Alessia Cara, and&nbsp;Sean Cullen, who voice the kids, while Maya Rudolph plays the kids’ nanny and&nbsp;Ricky Gervais&nbsp;hilariously narrates the film as the voice of the family cat.&nbsp;The selfish parents are voiced by&nbsp;Martin Short&nbsp;and&nbsp;Jane Krakowski,&nbsp;and Crews plays Commander Melanoff, the affable owner of a candy factory.Read below to see our chat with Crews about&nbsp;The Willoughbys, in which he breaks down&nbsp;his love for animation, explains when we can expect more Brooklyn Nine-Nine, and gives us his Five Favorite Films — including one with an Oscar snub he’s still not over and&nbsp;one from his own filmography that holds special meaning.Do the Right Thing (1989)  93%Number one is Do the Right Thing. Do the Right Thing changed my life in so many ways. Spike Lee and the cast&nbsp;of that movie. Actually, when it came out back in 1989, I saw it in the theater probably 25, 30 times. This was way before we could just download anything. I’m in that era. I’m in the analog era. Pre-cell phone. You know what’s strange? At the time, Do the Right Thing, once it hit the video stores, was listed as a comedy. [laughs] That blows my mind. It was nowhere near a comedy, but that’s exactly where they felt black films that dealt with any subject matter needed to be. Right now you would never think of Do the Right Thing&nbsp;as being&nbsp;a comedy — it dealt with police violence, it dealt with xenophobia, it dealt with all kinds of stuff. It’s very encouraging on many levels.Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope (1977)  92%Star Wars was my number one before Do the Right Thing came out, but it basically changed everything. It created the tent pole. I saw it in 1977 at a drive-in with my aunt. It was one of the first movies I was able to see because my mother was super religious. It changed the game for me. It let me know I was going to be in entertainment. I didn’t care what it would be. I didn’t care how I was going to do it, but once I saw Star Wars I was hooked. That just changed everything in many, many ways. The science-fiction part. The artistry. Everything about it was incredible, and to this day when I hear that John Williams score, it’s like, “Ahh.” I hear those horns, it fuels me and makes me remember why I’m in this business.Aliens (1986)  97%Next is Aliens. Alien&nbsp;was incredible but Aliens just took me out. James Cameron’s Aliens is&nbsp;crazy.&nbsp;The [Xenomorph] is still the most perfect movie monster ever created. You’ll never get better than the alien in Aliens. James Cameron actually one-upped the first movie with the Marines, the twists and turns, and Sigourney Weaver being this femme fatale who destroyed everyone. That’s&nbsp;the other thing. It had a feminist view. It had just so many viewpoints that were actually introduced in the movie that had never been there before. Everything else was all male-oriented and superstar, the guy who could never get beat and all that stuff. This movie turned that on its ear. Loved it.Training Day (2001)  73%Next is Training Day.That was your first “real” role in a film&nbsp;right?&nbsp;Yeah, Oh my God! I was an extra in Training Day. I didn’t have a chance to read the script, didn’t know what it was about. I just said, “I’ve got to be on this set.” I didn’t even get paid for that movie. I remember I showed up every day. A friend of mine was working on it, and he was like, “Hey man, Denzel’s shooting down in the jungle. You want to come?” And I was like, “I’m there.” And the director, Antoine Fuqua, put me in the movie as I was standing there. He said, “Hey man, you want to be in this movie?” I was like, “Yep.” He said, “Take your shirt off, go to the roof, and we’re going to be flipping pigeons.” I was like, “Let’s go!”I came back every night, but when I saw the film it was on a psychological level. It just let you know the nature of what evil really is, and it plays on your good intentions. I thought of how many times in my life… I [got] tricked into&nbsp;things. You start out with great intentions, you try to do good things, and then you kind of open up and you realize, “Oh man, it’s not what I thought it was.” I had that moment 50 million times in my life, and when I look at Jake versus Alonzo, I say, “This started out good. He had great intentions, and he didn’t know what he was getting into.” I look at my whole career in the NFL like that.Pulp Fiction (1994)  92%Finally, Pulp Fiction. I still believe Sam Jackson should have gotten an Oscar for that film to this day. It was one of the most brilliant performances I have ever seen. It informed everything. It was funny, it was scary, it was sad, it was beautiful. My God, it was just a tour de force in filmmaking. Anytime it’s on, I cannot stop watching. What a beautiful, beautiful piece of artwork. It had all my favorite genres. It had blaxploitation, it had mystery, it had gangster.Jacqueline Coley&nbsp;for Rotten Tomatoes: You have done a lot of voice work.&nbsp;What made you want to get involved with this one?Terry Crews:&nbsp;You got to understand I’m an artist. I was going to be an animator when I first moved to LA. I had my portfolio in at Disney, at Dreamworks, Hanna-Barbera, the whole thing. My whole mood was to get behind the scenes, and acting was a mistake. That was an accident. I love animation. Animation is the holy grail for me. Ralph Bakshi has been one of my favorite guys. I remember American Pop back in the day. That early, early animation was just groundbreaking to me. The fact that you could draw these characters and do this thing, and then Pixar took it to another level.So when I look at any opportunity to be in animation I never, ever turn it down. Kris Pearn, who was one of the directors of Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2, I got a chance to work with him there and just had a ball. When he was putting this together, because he’s one of the writers and the director of The Willoughbys. Another thing I loved about The Willoughbys is that it had a darker tone, much more heavy than you would normally see in animation, which kind of mirrors me. It’s funny because I’m very big, and I love comedy, but to me, I’m a very dark personality. The darker you are, the funnier you can be.I thought this is a worldwide turn for animation, whereas in the typical Western animation, it’s like, “Yeah, we’re happy, and here’s another joke. Here’s another joke.” People kind of got formulaic about it, but with this, it’s Ricky Gervais’ tone where it’s just like, “Whoa!” I think it’s just so fresh, and so perfect. Martin Short, Will Forte, they’re all friends of mine. Maya Rudolph from my Idiocracy days. Jane Krakowski. I’m just honored to be amongst such great talent, because I’m a fan first. I’ve never considered myself this actor dude. I’m just a fan, and I enjoy great animation.RT: Any Brooklyn Nine-Nine updates to give us during the quarantine?&nbsp;Crews:&nbsp;Oh my God! First of all, we are more popular than ever. The Brooklyn Nine-Nine Instagram just hit two million today, which is strange for a show like that. To have people actually want to see you and be interested in your show when there’s so much out there, this is the payday of entertainment. You will never get more, and it’ll never be easier to just kind of flip from one to the next. But&nbsp;people are watching 100 episodes in a row. Whole families are now Brooklyn Nine-Niners.I can’t wait ’til we come back. To see that this has really become a worldwide phenomenon is not lost on me, and I can’t wait to give people more. I’ll be honest with you; this season 7, it’s too short. We did 13 episodes, and I’m going, “Damn it! We could’ve done more.” I really do. We did 18 last year. We only did 13, but we did get picked up for season 8. When this pandemic settles, I can’t wait to see my Nine-Nine family. We’ve been all communicating with each other, and we can’t wait to get back and give the fans more.RT:&nbsp;What’s next for you?Crews:&nbsp;I&nbsp;did Rumble, which is coming out. It was supposed to come out in January of 2021. The trailer was on Sonic the Hedgehog film. That’s an animated character I played called Tentacularis. What’s so weird is that we don’t know if the movie is actually going to be in the theaters by that time. It may have to go straight to VOD&nbsp;just like all the other movies are right now. It’s kind of weird. It’s a very uncertain time. Everybody’s like, “Will the next James Bond actually be in theaters?” We don’t know.RT:&nbsp;What do you think will happen on the other side of this?&nbsp;Crews:&nbsp;I truly believe this is the deal. A lot of people are saying, “Oh my God, everything is going to&nbsp;change.” But you cannot do away with human interaction. You just can’t. And first of all, the world has seen pandemics before, and eventually, everything went back. I don’t know how long it’s going to take, is the real question, but the fact that it will go back is inevitable. Comedy shows to concerts to film, there’s no way we can all do this forever.The Willoughbys is streaming now on Netflix.","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"21st, star, adaptation, Grammys, show, independent, Travel, Sabrina, spanish","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/05170021/Terrylead.jpg","slug":"terry-crews-five-favorite-films"},{"id":"47508814569471","title":"Cynthia Erivo’s Five Favorite Films","content":"Five Favorite Filmsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Cynthia Erivo's Five Favorite FilmsThe star of Harriet talks about the films and performances that influenced her, from a Judy Garland classic and a blockbuster superhero movie to an unsung remake.by Jacqueline Coley | November 8, 2019 |  Comments(Photo by Taylor Hill/Getty Images)Cynthia Erivo is poised to make history this awards season. The 32-year-old British actress, whom many will remember from&nbsp;Bad Times at the El Royale or her supporting role&nbsp;alongside Viola Davis in Widows, is currently in theaters playing arguably the most famous Black woman in American History, Harriet Tubman, and she is getting a ton of Oscar buzz.&nbsp;Harriet is Erivo’s first starring role, but theater fans will instantly recall her as Ms. Celie from the musical adaptation of Alice Walker’s The Color Purple. For her work on the Broadway hit, she won a Tony, an Emmy, and a Grammy – and if you’re counting letters, she is only one O(scar) away from the prestigious and elusive&nbsp;EGOT. Luckily for Erivo, many&nbsp;awards pundits are betting on her, putting her&nbsp;on track to become the youngest EGOT winner ever. We recently sat down with Erivo to discuss the film, her friendship with co-stars Leslie Odom Jr. and Janelle Monáe, and why Meryl Streep’s pursed lips are a big part of one her&nbsp;Five Favorite Films.The Devil Wears Prada (2006)  75%First is The Devil Wears Prada, which I watched a million times over. I’m a fashion fanatic, and I love how it’s like a character in the film. I think it’s one of&nbsp;Meryl Streep‘s most amazing performances. I don’t know, there’s just something about it, the subtleties like the little purse of her lips that she does. I think it’s just really cool, and it’s a bit of a guilty pleasure. And the soundtrack on it is fabulous. I loved watching the way in which they used fashion through it, the dedication to keeping it very fashion-forward. I loved it. I thought it was brilliant.Polly (1989) The original was called Pollyanna, and then they did a remake of the film, called Polly, and it had&nbsp;Phylicia Rashad&nbsp;in it. It was probably one of the first musical films I had ever seen that was fully… Pretty much almost fully cast of Black men and women and children. And I think it was one of the reasons I was like, “Oh, I can do musicals. I can be in them. This is cool.” And I love the music. I still remember the songs, and it’s been a while since I’ve watched it. I have the VHS of it. I don’t even know if they do it on DVD. I don’t know if you can even get it on iTunes. But I loved it.A Star Is Born (1954)  98%The 1954 version of A Star Is Born. Judy Garland in that role is unbelievable. She is heartbreaking, and that scene where she sings “The Man Who Got Away”… Just so gorgeous. It’s at that time in her life where really the role could’ve been reversed between her and her partner. It glazes heartbreak over the whole entire thing. It’s just beautiful, and she’s beautiful in it.The Color Purple (1985)  81%Next is The Color Purple, for obvious reasons. The first way I came to it was the film, a bit before I read the book. And it has some of my favorite people in it. And I think I’ve met them now, strangely enough, most of those people from the film.I mean, Whoopi Goldberg and Oprah Winfrey, of course.Yes, I’ve met Whoopi. I’ve met Oprah. I have also met&nbsp;Akosua Busia&nbsp;–&nbsp;she’s Nettie. I met Whoopi; she was at the premiere. She’s so kind and cool. And I have also had the pleasure of meeting Oprah. Then I met Akosua. But that film was the beginning, I guess. And in watching it, it changed my life. I watched that movie and was inspired. I read the book, and then the musical came along, and I got the musical, and here I am. So, that film is always going to be one of my favorites.Black Panther (2018)  96%Lastly, I am gonna have to say&nbsp;Black Panther. My favorite scene of Black Panther –&nbsp;it’s not really even a scene, but it’s towards the end when they’re at the United Nations, and just the image of&nbsp;Danai Gurira&nbsp;in that beautiful, black dress, that’s got that crazy neckline, and she just looks regal. And then, obviously, there’s the scene in the big battle, where&nbsp;a rhinoceros that comes towards Danai, and it stops right in its tracks,&nbsp;inches from her face. There’s just something. Oh, it’s so powerful, it’s so good, so good. And such a delectable moment.&nbsp;I can’t even tell you how much I loved that film.Jacqueline Coley&nbsp;for Rotten Tomatoes:&nbsp;Talk about taking on such an iconic person from American History. A lot is known about her, but a lot isn’t.&nbsp;Cynthia Erivo:&nbsp;Preparing for her&nbsp;all of us, myself and&nbsp;Kasi [Lemmons, the director], we both needed to do character research. Kasi did about seven months’ worth of reading, and I was doing the research as well. Kasi and I spent a lot of time together, deciding what it was that we wanted to bring to her. I made sure I was physically ready for her, because I knew it was going to be a completely physical role. And I made sure that I made my mind ready so that I could be emotionally available for the things that needed to be done with her story. I knew the work that she did. I knew that she was married to John. I knew that she ran a hundred miles&nbsp;to freedom. I knew that she came back and brought other enslaved people to freedom. But being able to work on this, read the script, and learn about her was really fun because it filled in the blanks.You mentioned the physical preparation. Talk to us about that. You did a ton of running.[Laughs] I did. But for me, I think it’s&nbsp;all the same, because I was taught that you always get ready for the performance; you don’t let the performance get you ready. Whenever I’m about to get into a role, I try to prepare physically for it. Some require more work than others. Harriet needed a lot of physical work beforehand, so I really had to put myself through training. It was a lot of cardio and running and biking and horse riding. I needed to be able to lift myself up, climb on things, climb over things, and run. And I did all my stunts, pretty much. Maybe two stunts I didn’t do. The rest was me. I wanted to make sure I was ready for all of that. I didn’t want to have to concentrate on whether or not I was ready to do something because I hadn’t trained. So I trained to make sure that I could get on set and be ready. And then everything that came up that was new was the only thing I needed to handle.Let’s talk about this incredible cast —&nbsp;Leslie Odom Jr.,&nbsp;Janelle Monáe, and&nbsp;Joe Alwyn. It’s such a dream cast. Tell us about working with them.Beforehand, Janelle and I knew each other. I begged for Janelle to be a part of it. I asked her if she would do it, then I asked Kasi, and I asked Debra [Martin Chase, the producer]. I was like, “Please, can we have Janelle be in this, please, because I think she’d be perfect for it?” She’s this beautiful soul. It just felt right. It felt like she was right for that, and she was. She was a wonderful, wonderful addition to the cast, just because she’s such a caring, gentle personality, but there’s a real fight in her, which I absolutely adore. For Leslie, he and I have known each other for a really long time. We both won our Tonys the same year. His daughter is my goddaughter. So we already had a rapport with each other. And it always just feels great when he’s on set with me, because I feel safe. And I just met Jennifer [Nettles] and Joe, who are lovely, lovely people, and they were there for the right reasons.&nbsp;I was really lucky to have an incredible group of people to do this with, because it could’ve been far more difficult. But because Kasi and Debra are wonderful people, they also pick wonderful people to be around.Harriet&nbsp;is in theaters now.Like this?

Kojima saved a troubled project at Konami called Metal Gear by reducing the game’s combat and emphasizing avoiding detection, pioneering the stealth genre. When it was ported to the Nintendo Entertainment System, it sold over a million copies in America.Kojima returned to the series in 1998 with Metal Gear Solid for the PlayStation, a groundbreaking hybrid of intense stealth action dressed with stylish cinematic flair that went on to move six million units. He designed and directed four more direct Metal Gear sequels, piecing together a complex and occasionally bizarre tale of nanotechnology, nuclear proliferation, military conspiracies, and, yes, love blooming on the battlefield that has found wide appeal beyond core gamers.That explains the cast Kojima was able to put together for his latest game, Death Stranding. Through motion capture, Norman Reedus stars as as Sam Bridges, a cargo carrier tasked with connecting a post-apocalyptic America back online, outpost by outpost. Reedus is joined by Lea Seydoux, Mads Mikkelsen, Margaret Qualley, Lindsay Wagner, Guillermo del Toro, and Nicolas Winding Refn in an audacious boots-on-the-ground epic, which emphasizes collaboration with other players online over violent shootouts in rebuilding America, featuring Kojima’s signature maximalist storytelling.He’s always worn his inspirations in the open, and the way they weave into his games is part of their crossover charm and fun. You can get a sense of what movies Kojima watches through playing his games: Blade Runner is all over cyberpunk graphic adventure Snatcher, there’s plenty of Escape From New York‘s DNA in Metal Gear Solid, and Death Stranding even has a major character named Die-Hardman. So when Kojima stopped by for a tour of Rotten Tomatoes HQ on the eve of The Game Awards — where Death Stranding won Best Game Direction, Best Score/Music, and Best Performance (Mads Mikkelsen) — we had to sneak in a Five Favorite Films.2001: A Space Odyssey (1968)  92%It’s like a monolith to me, that movie. Every time it’s re-shown in theaters, I always go. Star Wars was a big hit in 1977 which created a big sci-fi boom. So 2001 came to Japan, and I saw it in theaters when I was in middle school. Before experiencing that, I was just listening to radio dramas. I read the original novel, but the movie was totally different. I didn’t really understand it the first time. Now, I have a different interpretation every time I watch it. As a creator, I have periods of difficult times, but whenever I feel particularly in need of a pick-me-up, I watch 2001. It’s a perfect movie for me.It was a real space experience. Exploration even before man went to the moon. I always wanted to be an astronaut when I was a kid, but Japan doesn’t have NASA. You had to go either to USSR or China. Although I felt like I had to give up on the dream of becoming an astronaut, when &nbsp;I saw 2001: A Space Odyssey, I felt like I really went to outer space. It’s a life-changing movie because it made me feel like I accomplished a dream.Did you see Christopher Nolan’s 70mm restoration of 2001 last year? Did your interpretation of it change?Yes, I went to see it with my son. &nbsp;I was more interested &nbsp;about what my son would think. It seems it was quite shocking for him, like something he has never seen or experienced before. Something not really predictable. It’s really difficult to find something that’s created by man which is unpredictable. These days it’s all set.Taxi Driver (1976)  96%Taxi Driver. Martin Scorsese. Growing up, most of my friends were interested in becoming bankers or working in a company. I, however, wanted to become a movie director. This was something that I couldn’t be open about with my friends and oftentimes I felt lonely because I couldn’t share those aspirations. I lost my father when I was quite young. My mother was working and I was a latchkey child. Even if I talked to a lot of people, I always felt a little lonely. I thought maybe I’m sick, maybe I’m ill. There was no counseling, or there were no therapists. It was not a trend at that time. So I thought maybe I’m really strange.After watching Taxi Driver and seeing Travis, I felt this immense similarity between the character and myself. He lives in New York, surrounded by so many people, but he still felt lonely. This surprised me, and I thought “Here is this guy, living in America, who is like me.” Seeing his character, I felt relaxed and realized there are others like me. I felt I was okay.And I wanted to put that feeling in Death Stranding. Like, you’re all alone, trying to connect the world. Everything has been connected by the internet recently. In so many ways, everyone is battling each over the internet. If you play online, you get head shots, but, like, you don’t know who you actually shot, right? To connect is a very positive concept. But there are people who don’t want to feel connected anymore, and I think a lot of people play games that don’t offer human connection. I can’t tell anyone that I feel lonely or I’m in solitude, and I have this big problem which I couldn’t share with my friends. It’s a big load to carry, just like Sam Bridges. And you’re kind of traveling, you’re sent orders, you go to this place, you trip over, and drown in a river.But at one point, you have this indirect connection system where you know you’re not alone. It’s not an isolated, lonely planet. There is someone who creates a road. There is someone who has made the coffee. It’s not just me, and I wanted to put that in a game.&nbsp; This is the same feeling I got from Taxi Driver.Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior (1982)  94%Mad Max. George Miller is my ultimate mentor. I went to see Fury Road 17 times in the cinemas.I can’t really express in one word of how good Mad Max 2 is. There’s hardly any dialogue in that movie, right? But the character stands out so much, visually, how he moves. Usually, you express through dialogue, but with George, it’s totally different. Like how a character throws a boomerang: No dialogue, but all character. I’m also influenced by where Geroge places the camera. It never goes away, far from Mel Gibson. Even looking through the telescope, usually the camera jumps to that location, but here you’re always looking at Max. It’s kind of basic, but George Miller keeps it basic in a way no one else can.It was tough when I had to leave my previous company. George came to Japan, and that was the first time we met. He cheered me up in my darkest time. After I became independent, &nbsp;and opened my&nbsp;studio, I went to Australia in 2017.&nbsp; I had two trailers at that time, but there was no gameplay revealed yet of Death Stranding. I explained what Death Stranding would be over an hour — the system, the story, the world. George told me, “What you’re doing is mathematically, philosophically, and physically correct.” He said: “Congratulations; it’s a guaranteed success.”George is a very kind gentleman. He is really into computer graphics and technology, and he also knows game technology. It’s really rare that a director of his generation knows all of these. He’s even older than me, but he has a lot of energy. There are game producers who are much older than me. But, as for creators who actually write scenarios or game designs, I think I’m the oldest in the industry. Sometimes I feel lonely because of that. But then there’s George; he’s over 70, and he’s still wearing this leather jacket, still young. That cheers me up.High and Low (Tengoku to jigoku) (1963)  95%Stanley Kubrick, Hitchcock, Kurosawa: My father always showed me these directors’ movies, whether I liked it or not. I’m selecting Kurosawa’s High and Low because it’s a little different.It’s based on a story by Ed McBain, and it’s about a kidnapping. During those times in Japan,&nbsp;if you kidnapped someone, you weren’t penalized too much. To have a harsher sentence, other charges, like drugs, were needed. But because of High and Low, the law in Japan changed. The movie had made a positive impact in society. That’s my kind of wish when I create a game. I think entertainment has that power to change society. You don’t have to be a politician or run for a cause to create change. High and Low was, in that sense, really impactful.Entertainment isn’t really just entertainment. It leaves something in people’s hearts and that person might be moved to create something. It’s a push for that person the next day, and I think entertainment should be similar, including games. When you experience something, and then come back to the real world, I want people to feel a little influence in their world.Blade Runner (1982)  90%When it was first released, I was in university. I went to see it alone. In Japan, it only showed for two weeks. There were probably similar reactions in America after its release.Nowadays, it’s regarded as a classic, but when it was first revealed, there was a lot of criticism. Maybe Death Stranding is the same [laughs]. When Blade Runner was shown for the first time in movie theaters, it was totally different from other movies. The rhythm of how it begins and all, that’s why it catches my eyes. It’s something that’s really indigestible in the beginning and stays in me. Then we moved on to the home video era, where you can watch videos over and over in your room. In the cinemas, you see it once and it’s over. Anything else that’s not digestible and that you can’t relate to, will be criticized. But for videos, it’s different. You can watch it over and over until you digest it yourself. Blade Runner might at one time be perceived only as a “cult movie,” but turned mainstream from the ability to watch it over and over and allow the viewers to digest the content. So Blade Runner was ahead of its time for the current generation at its release.Ghost in the Shell was probably the same, because it was on video where people watched it over and over. It got really popular; everyone got it. I deliberately made the tempo of Death Stranding totally different than the current games out there. So it might not be for everyone. Blade Runner showed in the cinemas, but then it changed when it came to video. Same with games. We have a platform, we have a console, and then in the future, it will be all streaming. Everything, storytelling, and the rhythm of how you play games will totally change in the near future.Alex Vo&nbsp;for Rotten Tomatoes:&nbsp;You also made headlines recently because Kojima Productions is moving into the movie space. What can you tell us about the process so far?Hideo Kojima: I’ve already started kind of, yes, but I can’t really announce it yet. Games are primary for Kojima Productions. Of course, I have staff&nbsp;that need to work. We create games, and maybe in-between… We’re an indie company, so maybe something really punkish in a very small team sort of way, we do a smaller game, and we might do some short films too.I get a lot of offers, but I’m not really free all the time. If I do 100% movies, the staff will have nothing to do for the other projects, right? So I am doing all these things, but eventually think games and movies will all be on streaming platforms. I could just shoot normal movies and maybe that could be one project I could do. But I think other than that, doing something on a streaming platform and doing something new that no one has done before is more interesting to me.Thumbnail image: Warner Bros., Columbia PicturesDeath Stranding&nbsp;is currently available for PlayStation 4.Like this?

While collecting innumerous accolades and an impressive box office haul for his starring role in Ari Aster’s Hereditary&nbsp;opposite&nbsp;Toni ‘was-robbed-of-an-Oscar-and-we’re-still-not-over-it‘ Collette, Wolff simultaneously watched the receipts roll in for his the end-of-year smash hit Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle (he will also return for the sequel&nbsp;Jumanji: The Next Level&nbsp;this December). Our new “Crown Prince” of&nbsp;the 2019 Toronto International Film Festival, the veteran actor trekked to Toronto with not one or two but three&nbsp;Fresh features, including the HBO pickup&nbsp;Bad Education&nbsp;starring Hugh Jackman.Just days away from his&nbsp;22nd birthday&nbsp;(yes, you read that correctly —&nbsp;twenty-two&nbsp;— and no, we can’t wrap our heads around it either), Wolff will soon hit theaters both in front of and behind the camera for his&nbsp;feature debut,&nbsp;The Cat and the Moon. In the film, we follow Nick (Wolff), a teen who explores the streets and dark jazz rooms of New York City with a friend of his late father after&nbsp;his mother unexpectedly abandons him to enter rehab. We recently caught up with Wolff&nbsp;to chat about his Five Favorite Films (a series he’s a surprising expert about), give him a few recommendations, and find out if acting or directing was his first love.Taxi Driver (1976)  96%What don’t I love about Taxi Driver? Taxi Driver is my favorite performance, and it’s my favorite score — Bernard Hermann, man. I was talking to&nbsp;someone today about why it’s the greatest film of all time.&nbsp;It turns this kind of sadistic ticking time bomb of a man who’s falling apart at the seams into this dreamy, seductive, gorgeous portrait of a vulnerable person. It turns all this sadism and all that deep hatred for the world into this empathetic, Holden Caulfield-type, just deeply pained truth. Not even to mention how it ties into today’s isolation. It’s a movie made in the ’70s that’s more relevant now than ever. It’s needed to show how this sort of isolation, this sort of alienation, can lead to rage and vengeance, but can also be used for good. It’s this crazy luck of the draw — Travis Bickle could have gone in&nbsp;either direction. He could have become this horrible man who murders a bunch of innocent people, but then he latches onto the idea that he has to murder all the bad people. I find that to be such a beautiful concept. Not to mention that it’s shot with these gorgeous reds and greens that are so lush. To watch, it’s like chewing a chocolate bar. It just melts in your mouth, that film. It’s everything I love about movies. It’s the smoothest, most velvet, but also the roughest and the deepest pit of despair you could go into. It’s everything. It’s everything in one film.Are you excited for The Irishman?So excited. So excited!&nbsp;Little worried about the special effects, though. Actually very worried about the special effects, but excited.I recently saw it. They’re pretty amazing; I’m not going to lie.Yeah, I can– Wait! You’ve seen The Irishman?!&nbsp;How was it?!Al Pacino is a god in all actorly things. Pesci is just as good. I was like, “And the Oscar goes to…” It was so good. So good.That’s amazing. I’m jealous. I can’t wait.One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (1975)  94%What’s to say about One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest&nbsp;that someone else hasn’t already said? It’s perfect. Milos Forman, wow. It’s the most soulful, most heartfelt movie ever made. It’s hilarious. The most dynamic performances — Jack Nicholson’s just robust persistent optimism in that movie is so infectious. His complete lack of sympathy or empathy for anyone who wants to reject life. That character is something so unique. I don’t know if it’s ever existed in the way that it did in that. Not to mention the whole ensemble of Danny DeVito, Brad [Dourif], everyone in that movie is incredible. I find that it’s got such a sense of humor and such a light touch, but it’s also got such a deep, patient eye. I love it. I absolutely love it. I saw it in theaters the other day and just sobbed. I saw it with my dad, and we were both weeping. It’s such a nice uniting film between many generations. It’s got a&nbsp;universal, timeless quality.In terms of directing, what he does in that movie is kind of impossible. He has no real scope. He’s in that asylum, and yet it’s this delicious, not bleak movie to watch. All the greens and whites, everything is so pretty. Just the cigarette smoke, and the way he navigates the camera around that area and all the color palette and his choice of shot, it’s really a feat. Only once you’ve made a movie do you see how much you rely on your surroundings and your environment and how I was spoiled because I was shooting in New York on these rooftops. It’s not even fair. I’ve got all these buildings and these lights and these streets and the homeless people and all this crazy, vivid environment. To shoot a movie in one location essentially and make it that lush and interesting; to be fascinating the entire way through without it feeling like a play on wheels. I can’t understand it. I’ve seen it a billion times, and I can’t understand it. Like how is that possible?Ordinary People (1980)  89%Those performances. Timothy Hutton’s performance in that is probably the most directly inspiring to me, and that’s a young guy at the top of his game, emotionally raw, and brings everything that a young actor could want in a performance. I feel that that film is the most heart-wrenching and true portrait of a family maybe I’ve ever seen. To describe it well would reveal too much. That’s what’s brilliant about it. Everyone&nbsp;should watch it and watch Mary Tyler Moore with Timothy Hutton and Judd Hirsch. I can’t believe it. I just can’t believe that movie. It seems like such a simple concept, and yet Robert Redford kills it.The scene that always gets me, hits me so hard,&nbsp;is a small scene that not many people would say they love. Most say the big breakdown scene with Judd Hirsh. For me, it’s the scene where Timothy Hutton has been going to Judd Hirsch for a little bit, and he’s opening up. It’s such a journey of what it means to be vulnerable and the importance of vulnerability in your own family, especially after trauma. My character in The Cat and the Moon is very much inspired by Timothy Hutton’s character in Ordinary People. His journey of being so closed off and edgy to cracking open into this well of unmined emotion. Particularly the scene where he and Donald Sutherland, who’s amazing as well, are decorating the tree — ugh, the Christmas tree. It’s such a sweet scene. Mary Tyler Moore comes home, and she’s got this cold, dark look on her face. I’ll never get over her facial expressions in that movie. What she’s thinking versus what she’s putting on the surface is the most genius magic trick.&nbsp;It’s the most exhilarating thing ever. That movie is the best.Two Days, One Night (2014)  97%Two Days One Night, it’s perfectly directed. The way the Dardenne brothers frame her, making her kids’ bed before she goes and tries to overdose in the bathroom — it stays in that one shot. It’s this wide shot, handheld, which nobody does like the Dardenne brothers. I’ve tried to chase it; there’s nothing like it. There’s nothing like watching a scene unfold and becoming something you did not expect in the beginning of the shot. It’s like one shot can tell an entire three-course meal. Also, that movie is one of the few movies that made me uncontrollably sob at the end, because of her power, the sweetness of it. I can’t believe the sweetness; it made me so raw and vulnerable. It’s not just that it’s tragic. It’s such a small story, but I connect with it. I connect with needing people and needing for them to hear from you. I feel like getting heard at the end of the movie, or not getting heard, depending on how you look at it, is so unbelievably moving. Marion Cotillard is the god of our generation. Not a goddess, she’s&nbsp;god!Dog Day Afternoon (1975)  96%Al Pacino’s performance is connected to something deep in my psyche; he feels like a wild animal trapped in a place and running around manically. I love the mania of Al Pacino’s performance. I feel a connection to that hyper energy and burning ball of rage. It’s so great how he turns the whole movie. He becomes the hero that you wouldn’t expect, and everybody is cheering for him. I&nbsp; love that. I think in my film it does kind of the same thing. He doesn’t seem like your hero, but he becomes that. Not to mention&nbsp;the fact that this movie, it keeps the kinetic thriller energy, but at the same time, there are there these scenes that you can’t believe they’re still going on, these hilarious seemingly improvised bursts of energy. Between Al Pacino and Sidney Lumet and&nbsp;John Cazale, it’s unforgettable and beyond inspiring, to say the least. You’re rooting for both of them even though you don’t want to be. It’s perfect.&nbsp;You fall in love with them, and they fall in love with&nbsp;each other. It’s genius — perfection.&nbsp;I know that’s five but can I have an honorable mention?This picking five is stressing you out, huh? You’ve read every entry in the series, and know more than anyone else I’ve interviewed, so I will give you an honorable mention. Just don’t tell anyone one.Okay, Great!&nbsp;All the President’s Men&nbsp;is my honorable mention. The performances are the biggest inspiration in terms of pure realism. It feels like I’m watching a documentary between Dustin Hoffman and Robert Redford. That movie, more than any movie in the world, feels like I’m watching a real thing unfold. So&nbsp;bravely un-cinematic, and let me say in the most complimentary of ways, those shots are simple but very nuanced and controlled. The performances are totally free and loose, but&nbsp;you&nbsp;never feel a moment of “drama.” It’s what I look to before I do a movie. Almost always before I act in a movie or before directing a movie, I watch the performances because they&nbsp;feel like reality. That it’s next-level s–t.Jacqueline Coley&nbsp;for Rotten Tomatoes: You were recently a part of two huge films in the pop-culture consciousness, but they’re completely&nbsp;different:&nbsp;Jumanji and&nbsp;Hereditary. What was that like?Alex Wolff:&nbsp;That’s a really cool question. There were a couple of other films that I was part of that came out at that time, so I saw it more as a clump of films that I was really proud of.&nbsp; I did&nbsp;House of Tomorrow, then&nbsp;My Friend Dahmer&nbsp;then&nbsp;Jumanji,&nbsp;then&nbsp;Hereditary, and then I started developing my film The Cat and the Moon. Yeah, Hereditary&nbsp;was this crazy overnight thing. I remember prepping to shoot my film, seeing all these articles popping up on people’s phones. Everyone was like, “Hey, your movie is killing at Sundance.” I was like, “Oh, cool.” I don’t think much of it. I’ve been part of enough things that people say are going to hit and then don’t, so who knows what’s going to happen? That one was just crazy, though, because it came out of nowhere, and it just seemed to hit me in the face. Jumanji, it was like a “Phew!” because they put a lot into it, a lot of money, and a lot of people were part of it. I had such a great time doing it, but that was a huge relief; it was well-received.&nbsp;My Friend Dahmer&nbsp;also&nbsp;did way better than people thought. Hereditary was such a challenging and exciting experience. I was so proud of what we did. That’s a long-winded way of say I still haven’t really processed it. It’s kind of crazy. I know that now I can’t walk down the street without people looking at me and knowing my face. I’m like, okay….&nbsp;okay.Which one do people on the street mention most?Easy.&nbsp;Hereditary, and they make the clicking sound. [Laughs] And a&nbsp;lot of people say they hate me and that I traumatized them for life, but I just take that as I’m doing a good job.The Cat and the Moon&nbsp;is your first feature as director. Was this the goal from the beginning?Acting was always number one. It’s still number one. It’s the love of my life. It’s the thing that I do. It’s my job and the thing I’m the most obsessed with. I believe that writing, directing, and acting are all part of the same sphere of creativity. They’re all achieving the same thing for me, just in different ways. Writing and directing is this cool way of expressing it. I find that they’re unfortunately separated somehow when people talk about them. We’re all trying to make a great movie. That’s what I love. I love good movies, and I love the artistry around all of it. Writing, directing, and acting, to me, are part of the same world. It’s like you’ve got the tricep and the bicep and the elbow, and it’s all making your arm.Was there anything that you saw from working with Ari Aster, Cory Finley, or some other director that made&nbsp;you say, “Okay, I want to apply that my directing?”Yeah.&nbsp;Peter Berg, who’s an executive producer on The Cat and The Moon. Peter Berg and Ari [Aster]&nbsp;and Corey&nbsp;Finley, whom I’ve worked with twice, and all these other amazing directors that I’ve gotten to work with, were fully responsible for easing my nerves. They talked me through what it’s going to be like and what to prepare for. What I learned from them was to have full confidence in what I was trying to make. Ari, Peter, and Cory are all bold filmmakers in their own right and specific filmmakers. They&nbsp;make&nbsp;films that are personal to them.&nbsp;I knew I would hate myself forever if I tried to put in complex steady cam shots, because that’s not what this movie called for. Maybe I’ll do that in the future, but I knew this movie was fully in the heart of the Dardenne brothers. A patient character study that needed the camera to be still and patient to feel like this beautiful eye was watching what was going on.&nbsp;They told me&nbsp;to have full conviction in what it was, what I was doing, and try not to create something that was bulls–t.As a working actor, was casting the film easier or more difficult, and is your brother in any way mad that you didn’t cast him?My brother has got enough going on; he was so busy. He helped me produce it,&nbsp;but yeah, he’s really mad. [Laughs] No, I’m just kidding. He is in it, though. You’ll not notice but it’s his voice in the background of a scene. I won’t tell anybody which. We recorded on an iPhone, and we ended up using it because it was so funny. I’m screaming at him on the street.And the casting?&nbsp;It was easier than I thought it would be. It was really easy to audition because I was so excited that people were reading my dialogue. I loved seeing them improvise, and that was part of what made me cast them. I cast people who could improvise great stuff. Getting kids or teenagers who can do that is kind of few and far between. For this film, there’s a lot of different types of things that demand personal magic and demand a certain type of spontaneity that can make this type of film work, that if it doesn’t have it, the film falls flat. Most of the people didn’t audition. I knew Tommy Nelson, who plays Russell. He was in the film called My Friend Dahmer with me. Stefania Owen, I’d done Come through the Rye with, and she was amazing. Actually, no, Julian did an audition. I made my friend audition. I’m a terrible person. But it was because I hadn’t seen him in that type of part. Mike Epps, I just offered it to him because I saw him in these two amazing movies. I saw him in this film Bessie&nbsp;and in&nbsp;Sparkle.&nbsp;I thought he was amazing in both of them. I didn’t even remember that I’d seen him in The Hangover — lots of New York actors. There’s a bunch of amazing actors in New York, and everybody brings something really interesting to the table. It was hard choosing honestly.You said giving a log-line is a bit stressful, so how about you give us the three films you’d recommend to&nbsp;watch before or&nbsp;have same the vibe of your film?You Can Count on Me, Oasis, and&nbsp;The Kid With a Bike,&nbsp;and maybe Blue is the Warmest Color as an honorable mention.You love those honorable mentionsYeah, well I love these movies; it’s so hard to choose.The&nbsp;Cat and the Moon&nbsp;is in&nbsp;theaters October&nbsp;25th.&nbsp;&nbsp;","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"Acorn, Television, Disney, One, Universal, DGA","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/11125202/Alex_Wolff_FFF_Rep.jpg","slug":"alex-wolffs-five-favorite-films"},{"id":"47508814567422","title":"Trey Edward Shults’ Five Favorite Films","content":"Five Favorite Filmsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Trey Edward Shults' Five Favorite FilmsThe director of It Comes at Night and this week's Waves on P.T. Anderson, Terrence Malick, Scorsese, and his own new film.by Jacqueline Coley | November 12, 2019 |  Comments(Photo by Stefanie Keenan/Getty Images)In&nbsp;his short, albeit impressive filmography, up-and-coming director&nbsp;Trey Edward Shults has made his mark on the indie landscape. With his twisted take on the traditional Thanksgiving drama, Krisha, and his atmospheric horror follow-up It Comes At Night, he has shown himself to be a filmmaker unbeholden to traditional&nbsp;genre limitations. Shults’ deeply personal third feature,&nbsp;Waves,&nbsp;features&nbsp;Kelvin&nbsp;Harrison Jr.,&nbsp;Sterling K. Brown, and newcomer&nbsp;Taylor Russell,&nbsp;and all have Oscar pundits buzzing, as&nbsp;does Shults’ gripping and original screenplay. With all three of his films to date Certified Fresh, the 31-year-old writer/director has joined some illustrious company, including the Coen brothers, Steve McQueen, Jason Reitman, and Ryan Coogler, all of whom also earned the distinction for their first three features.We chatted with&nbsp;Shults just hours before the Waves premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival, about&nbsp;the&nbsp;love story at the heart of Waves and how he convinced the notoriously selective musician Frank Ocean to license songs for the movie soundtrack. He also&nbsp;gave us his Five Favorite Films,&nbsp;and like many subjects of this column, was quick to point out that the list could change depending on what day of the week it is.There Will Be Blood (2007)  91%The first one is&nbsp;Paul Thomas Anderson and There Will Be Blood. I had seen that movie at a very crucial point in my life. I had just torn my shoulder in wrestling, and it was like the world had fallen away from me. Like a lot in the movie is autobiographical. So yeah, I was really kind of lost. And then I saw There Will Be Blood in the theater, and it rocked my world. It blew my mind.&nbsp;The first Paul Thomas Anderson movie I saw was Boogie Nights at a really young age, and it was perfect for an adolescent. But it also made me realize there’s a creator behind all this. I was transported and inspired. That was when I started getting back into filmmaking and loving movies again. Because I couldn’t do sports. That movie was really huge for that.The Tree of Life (2011)  84%Next, I’ll go with The Tree of Life. Terry Malick – I’ve had the pleasure to work for him on a few things, and that changed the course of my life. But seeing The Tree of Life in a cinema was like one of the most humbling and beautiful experiences I’ve had. It’s cosmic, you know? It’s intimate but cosmic. It’s family but everything bigger. I had a religious experience in the theater watching that. There are shots in it that I worked on, and I know where we were for that, but it was bizarre to be having this religious experience and think, “Oh my God. I was involved, in a small capacity, with making it.” That movie, it’s just one of my favorite movies of all time. I loved working with&nbsp;Terrence Malick. I love his other films in that I don’t even know how to talk about him. Honestly.Barry Lyndon (1975)  91%Next, I’m going to go with Barry Lyndon. It’s next-level filmmaking. It blows me away what he’s doing with narrative in his camera, the curated detail, and look of that story. Also&nbsp;with the intermission in the half, it becomes this two-part epic. When I watch it again, I’m transported in awe. And I do feel like that’s an underrated [Stanley] Kubrick&nbsp;film.Raging Bull (1980)  93%I’m going to go with Raging Bull.&nbsp;I love Raging Bull. That’s another one I saw at a young age, and I didn’t love it at first. I didn’t know what to think of it. I was like, “This isn’t Rocky.”&nbsp;[Laughs] I was compelled and disturbed&nbsp;by what it was doing, stuff I didn’t get at the time. But that movie struck me at my core. I didn’t know if I liked it, but then I had to come back to it, and then I became obsessed with it and his whole career.&nbsp;It’s very hard to pick a favorite movie of his. Raging Bull is one I go back to, and there’s something between the expressionistic filmmaking of those boxing matches. There’s just a neo-realism in the dynamic between him, his brother, and his wife. It’s really powerful and incredibly inspiring.Persona (1966)  91%One more. Let me say&nbsp;Persona, one of my favorite movies of all time. That’s another one that I saw later. I saw it in my twenties, like 20 to 21 or something. It&nbsp;feels like it wasn’t made by a human being, because what it does is like magic. I could never imagine making something of that level. It’s just a beautiful thing of its own, and it blew me away. I don’t know how to talk about it. I love a lot of his stuff, but that one –&nbsp;man&nbsp;– it’s one of the greatest movies of all time.Jacqueline Coley&nbsp;for Rotten Tomatoes: We chatted about Waves&nbsp;while you promoted It Comes At Night,&nbsp;and you said it was a love story. Having seen&nbsp;the film, I’ve got to ask, how is this a “love story?”Trey Edward Shults:&nbsp;It is a love story.&nbsp;I mean, there are love stories in it, no?Yes, but it’s certainly not a rom-com or a romantic drama.&nbsp;Yes, but familial love is a kind of love, no? Love is the thing connecting everything in the movie. It’s romantic love. It’s the love of a brother and sister. It’s the love of your partner. It’s the love of parents and children. I think, too, with the last movie, like you said, it was so brooding. If anything, death was the center&nbsp;of that, and then this movie, it was like life and love. It was about the positive. I know the movie gets very dark, but I wanted to show the end of a relationship and the beginning of one, but then link it through familial love. That’s what’s running through it. It’s all very broad, abstract stuff. I don’t know if I can be more specific.&nbsp;It’s also a hard movie to talk about without spoiling.Agreed. So let’s talk about the casting, particularly Sterling K. Brown, because he’s&nbsp;kind of got the world at his feet, right?Honestly, regarding Sterling, it was literally a dream come true to have him in this movie. I can’t imagine anyone else besides Sterling playing this part. I didn’t know Sterling’s work until The People v. O.J. Simpson and he blew my mind. I’ve been following him ever since, but following him as a human being – his interviews, the way he talks.&nbsp;He’s a magical human being and a magical presence. It was also crazy when he came on [to the film]. It started with&nbsp;Kelvin and then came Lucas [Hedges], then&nbsp;Alexa [Demie]&nbsp;and Taylor, and then it kept going. The hardest thing was working out&nbsp;Sterling’s&nbsp;schedule with This Is Us. We set it up to where we shifted our whole work week. We worked Saturday to Thursday. So he was doing the show in LA during the week, and then he’d take a red-eye and fly to Florida to be&nbsp;on set the next day. I remember one day, he was lifting weights, then fighting with his son [Kelvin] that night, and then having this incredibly heavy, emotional scene with his daughter [Taylor] later that day. I don’t know how he had the stamina, physical strength, or capacity to do it.&nbsp;He blew my mind. He just showed up as this beautiful man, but then he would get in the zone with his headphones, study the script all day, and then it was like “Take one. Done. Call it.” He just delivered.This film is semi-autobiographical, but when you cast Kelvin, you had to make adjustments to make it feel authentic. Talk about how you did that.Well, I hope it does feel authentic. I’m a freakin’ white dude, so I can’t speak to its authenticity. All I know is there’s stuff in it from my past, but I think the larger credit goes to the actors, especially Kelvin. He’s like a brother to me, and I wanted to work with him again [after It Comes at Night],&nbsp;and I wanted to give him a great role, because&nbsp;I cut some amazing acting out of the last one. So I sent him the script, and he wanted to be Tyler, so we sort of rebuilt Tyler, Ronald [Brown], and the family from the ground up. I can’t speak for Kelvin because he’s not here, but it almost feels like a combination of both of us. And a lot of the depth – the father and son stuff – is from Kelvin and his father. His father pushed him like that, but with music. That’s why they’re my collaborators. I just tried to&nbsp;listen, understand, and talk about it with him, Taylor, Renée [Elise Goldsberry], and Sterling. It was really was a collaboration. That made it what it is, and hopefully, if it feels special, it’s because we all came together to built it that way.We also have to talk about Taylor, who plays the sister. She’s an incredible discovery.&nbsp;I’m so, so, so lucky. We saw an audition tape from our amazing casting director, Avy Kaufman, and it was her.&nbsp;They just got scenes. The first one was like the diner scene, and you couldn’t take your eyes off her. There’s so much going on internally. She doesn’t have to say anything, and I’m so compelled. There’s a beautiful subtlety in her performance that’s an inherent natural thing that an actor either has or they don’t. I saw her audition, and she blew my mind. And then she met Lucas, they hit it off, and then that was it. We became&nbsp;a great, big, messy family. But I love that girl. I just hope she shoots off from this, because she deserves it.Let’s talk about the awkward love story you gave her.&nbsp;It’s just sort of where it naturally went with the writing. I still see the first half as a love story, but it’s a relationship at its end. That couple had magnetic energy like combustible balls of fire. They love hard and they fight hard. Then the movie shifts, and it’s all about rebirth. In my mind, the greatest tragedy that could happen happens midway through the film. I was crying like a baby writing, shooting, and editing it. It’s just sheer devastation. And then, when everyone’s at rock bottom, they go through a rebirth and evolve again. I wanted the movie to give you a hug with&nbsp;that second love story. You’ve gone&nbsp;through some of the worst stuff in the world, and then it’s like, “what a difference a day makes.” Because love can be the hardest thing in the world and it can be the most beautiful thing.How did you get Frank Ocean to let you use two of his songs? He’s very particular about where he licenses his music.I just feel incredibly, incredibly blessed. Frank’s one of my favorite living artists. His music, especially Channel&nbsp;Orange, Blonde, and Endless, they kind of changed my life. It’s a bit intense. So I wrote a letter, and we sent him the movie, but it’s not like I ever talked to Frank. Like, my people sent stuff to his people, so I’m assuming he got that stuff. But it was funny because it was going on like a month or two, and I was still editing. I sent him a rough cut of the movie because I edited for a long time, and then his people were like, “Yeah, it’s not looking good. There are so many songs he won’t just sign off on. Maybe you can reduce it to one song.” But they came back, “You’re approved for all the music. You’re good.” And that’s it. Like, I don’t know if he watched the movie, read my letter. I don’t know anything. I’m just so&nbsp;blessed and grateful. I don’t&nbsp;know how, but it happened.Finally, you must be the king of the ambiguous title. Krisha, It Comes At Night, now Waves;&nbsp;the narratives of each film are carefully&nbsp;hidden within the titles. So what do you want people to think about when&nbsp;they hear Waves, because the film is not about surfing.&nbsp;[Laughs] No, it’s definitely not about surfing. It sounds cheesy, but it’s really about highs and lows, the&nbsp;highs and lows of life and of love. There’s some ocean stuff in it, but it’s really more about the spirit of what the movie is. And that’s what&nbsp;I hope people connect with.Waves&nbsp;opens in&nbsp;select theaters this Friday.Like this?

Yet, it’s a risk that’s paying off. Reviews out of Sundance for&nbsp;Downhill&nbsp;have singled out Louis-Dreyfus as one of the Alps-set dramedy’s biggest assets, lauding her performance as Billie,&nbsp;a mom of two&nbsp;idling by in a stale marriage until&nbsp;an almost-tragedy on a ski trip&nbsp;forces open some of the growing fissures in her relationship. When the avalanche came rushing down the mountain, did her hubby Pete (Will Ferrell)&nbsp;really&nbsp;just grab his cell phone and run to save himself?Ahead of the movie’s release, Rotten Tomatoes got on the phone with Louis-Dreyfus to talk about her five favorite films, and, like many who have sat down for this column before, she started with a caveat: “First&nbsp;of all I just want to say from the onset that I object to five favorites,” Louis-Dreyfus told us. “I wish that this was like 10 or 15, because there are so many beautiful films that have kind of changed my life. So then maybe another time we do it again and I’ll give you the other five. How about that?” Still, when pressed, Louis-Dreyfus managed to narrow it down to five films, all classics, which have stuck with her for their masterful use of tone, their sweeping romance, and for being “so f–king funny.”The Wizard of Oz (1939)  99%I’m an absolute lover of The Wizard of Oz. I adore that film from start to finish. It never gets old. I think it has a beautiful, tender tone of both real drama and huge comedy, and I adore it. I don’t remember the first time [I saw it]; it’s part of my brain. I mean, I saw that film along with The Sound of Music, Mary Poppins. I still watch it every couple of years, and it brings me great joy every single time. I love Bert Lahr [as the Cowardly Lion], and his performance really gets me where I live. When they go to meet the Wizard and he’s doing his big speech and he says, “I just want you guys to do one thing….” –&nbsp;I’m butchering this! – and he goes, “Talk me out of it,” because he didn’t want to go in… I adore that moment in the film, as well as countless others.Life Is Beautiful (La Vita è bella) (1997)  80%The next one would be Life Is Beautiful. I could barely speak after seeing that film. I was so moved by it. And again, actually, come to think of it, it’s a very dramatic and comedic film all at once. It’s a true mash-up. The drama of it, though, is the driver, and it’s done so skillfully, and it is so heartbreaking. And the relationship between father and son is so moving and the lengths to which the father will go to try and protect his son under the absolute worst of circumstances is so valiant and catastrophic, really.Were you at the Oscars when Roberto Benigni won Best Foreign Language Film and Best Actor?No, I wasn’t. But I do remember that moment when he leapt up onto the chairs. Do you remember that?Yes! I thought he might’ve been climbing over you to get to the stage.Oh, I wish. I would have done anything to have witnessed that.A Room With a View (1985)  100%That to me is the most romantic film of all time, and it makes me cry whenever I watch it. I think that I can credit that film for my hairstyle on Seinfeld&nbsp;back in the day, because I thought Helena Bonham Carter was so exquisite – because she was. And those costumes and that love story, which was so restrained, which made it feel so much more romantic. It’s a very moving story about the love between two people, and I just adored it. And Daniel Day-Lewis gave the most remarkably comedic performance. If you go back and watch that film, which I encourage you to do because it truly holds up – I watched it recently and I was bawling my eyes out – but Daniel Day-Lewis is so f–king funny.Hoosiers (1986)  91%Next up is going to be Hoosiers. Did you ever see it?No, it’s one of my blind spots. And I grew up in Australia where I don’t think it’s as big a thing culturally as it is here.OK, but guess what? It doesn’t matter that you’re Australian. You need to watch it, because you’ll be completely sucked in. First of all, it’s Gene Hackman. Need I say more? Gene Hackman is the best American actor living today, in my view. And it is a sports story, but it’s so much more. It’s about an underdog team and beating the odds. It’s about teamwork. And I am a basketball fan, but I will tell you that before I was a basketball fan, I was a fan of Hoosiers. That’s why I’m saying I think you should watch it, because you’ll really, really enjoy it.Dennis Hopper kills it. It’s heartbreaking, his performance. And there’s a scene at the beginning of Hoosiers&nbsp;— it’s going to sound crazy, but Gene Hackman is driving and he’s drinking from a takeaway cup of coffee, and the way he’s drinking the coffee is so real and so authentic. He just gives an accurate… such appreciation for every gesture… every movement of that man.One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (1975)  94%Jack Nicholson is extraordinary in it, but that is an ensemble movie where everyone carries the story. And it’s a movie about social injustice and inequity and the disenfranchised, and it will kill you. It will sway you with its sadness, but in a way that is appropriate, and there is a glimmer of hope at the end, I would say.And, I mean,&nbsp;Louise Fletcher in that film is so…Forget about it. What a performance is that. Oh, my God in heaven.Joel Meares&nbsp;for Rotten Tomatoes: Downhill&nbsp;is a remake of a movie a lot of&nbsp;people have seen and love, but it’s got a very different perspective from the original. I’m wondering why you felt it was important to see this story through the lens of an American family and an American mother?&nbsp;Well, of course I’m a massive fan of the original, which I think is a work of art. But when I heard that Ruben [Östlund, director of&nbsp;Force Majeure]&nbsp;was eager to have it adapted, I wanted to sink my teeth into it, because I thought that an American point of view on this story would be a really interesting way to retell the bones. The DNA of the original is absolutely there, but it would be a new way to retell this story that explores many themes of relationships.The fact that it’s an American family in a foreign country, I think that gives a new level to the storytelling. And we did want to open up the world for the character of the wife, because we thought that would be an interesting way to tell the story, and to make sure that she was an active participant, I would say, in the bad behavior. Because there are moments in this film where she really makes some bad decisions on the heels of the big bad decision that her husband has made. The&nbsp;sort of unraveling of the sweater of this story, we wanted to tell from both points of view and to show good people – fundamentally good people – doing bad things, and how do they recover from that, and can they recover from that?The other thing I should say is it’s a story, a movie, about truth-telling and taking responsibility for your actions, even when they’re not good actions. And I think that is a particularly apt theme for today’s climate.Something else that’s striking about the film is that it’s a movie with a decent budget, with two big stars, being released by a major studio, that’s about relationships and human interaction. We don’t see a lot of that in the blockbuster age. Was it important for you to be a part of that kind of project?Totally. Are you kidding? I mean, these are movies that I like to see. I think this movie is food for thought. I think it gives you something to really, really talk about afterwards. Lots of things to sort of take apart.Downhill&nbsp;is in theaters February 14, 2020Thumbnail images by Miramax, Cinemcom, Orion courtesy Everett CollectionLike this?

The Witch hit those “elevated horror” notes: An original, slow-burn plot that expects film literacy and attention from viewer, which typically flies in the face of the average horror watcher expecting jump scares and constant loud noises.Eggers’ second movie, The Lighthouse, is set on a wind-battered and isolated New England island at the turn of the 20th century, practically a jump into modern times compared to The Witch‘s 1630 setting. Robert Pattinson and Willem Dafoe star as two “wickies” assigned to maintain the remote lighthouse, setting the stage for a blackly comic ascent into madness involving farts and angry monologues, questionable plates of food, menacing birds, and a light at the top of the stairs that one man refuses to let the other look at. It’s like Step Brothers if it were written by Algernon Blackwood.After a successful second-week expansion that saw the movie crack the top 10 box office without a wide release, we talked to Eggers to congratulate him on another Certified Fresh effort, and to get his Five Favorite Films.Fanny &amp; Alexander (1982)  100%I’d like to say that the television version that’s longer is better than the version that was in movie theaters. Bergman’s my favorite filmmaker, if I had to choose. It’s very much a culmination of most of the themes and motifs of his career that appears as a physical personification in the very beginning of the film, similar kinds of ghosts that Bergman explored in the past. He has his love for the theater and puppetry and there’s moments of hope and joy, but it also just reminds you that humans have certain demons that they can’t ever escape. It’s really rich and it touches on so many things about what it is to be human that it’s really quite remarkable. And as with every Bergman movie, there’s not a moment of bad performance to be found.But I think that the first episode, if you were to watch the TV version, is just Christmas with a family. A long episode of getting to know a family at Christmas. And I was talking with [Home Alone director] Chris Columbus about Christmas in movies and he was explaining how it’s just a time of heightened emotions for everyone. So that’s a really clever way to learn about this family and all of their dynamics super deeply, by beginning at Christmas. And the first time you watch it, you’re kind of like, “Where is the story? What is this? This is just Christmas.” And then the next episode, the plot begins but you’ve gotten to know this family incredibly closely and so then you’re just so invested with them through the rest of the film.Also, like The Lighthouse, it has some fart jokes.Mary Poppins (1964)  98%Another movie that takes place in the Edwardian era, but in the country where Edward was actually reigning. It was an important movie for me as a kid and it continued to be something that I revisited again because it’s just good. Good storytelling, quite beautiful. You’ve got to love the matte paintings of the London rooftops. You’ve got to love a movie where a witch is your nanny. Obviously, no challenge to Dick van Dyke’s Australian Cockney accent, but his performance in that movie is really incredible. He is such a good physical comedian and when they’re in the chalk painting — which is also just lovely, the live action mix and the animation — he often has the same dance choreography as Julie Andrews. And he interprets it incredibly differently. It’s not that he can’t do them, it’s that he’s interpreting them in a different way, for humor, with his body type and so cleverly.It’s a movie where kids have power. They understand some things that their Edwardian dad doesn’t. And we use a Mary Poppins-esque weathervane shot in The Lighthouse. And then also, as much as it is a very, very satisfying narrative, the movie’s not without mystery. What is Mary Poppins’ backstory? What is her relationship with Bert? She creeps me out. Like when her reflection in the mirror keeps singing after her. The way she’s a little bit austere with the children and then the next minute she’s super cuddly, it is a little creepy. And then it just isn’t her, but when the kids get lost in East London, and there’s the dogs barking, and the old beggar woman who’s like, “Come here, children” or whatever. That was incredibly terrifying as a child.Andrei Rublev (1973)  95%I feel like talking about Mary Poppins all day. Okay. Andrei Rublev, spelled ‘Rublev’ but pronounced ‘Rublov’. It’s because we don’t use the Cyrillic alphabet. I really do love Tarkovsky’s Mirror as well. But the last act, or the last movement of Andrei Rublev is probably just the best thing in cinema history. That bell casting sequence is just so powerful. In some ways, it’s kind of the same thing that Fanny and Alexander does where you’re not even sure who Andrei Rublev is for quite a while the first time you watch the movie, and this is the episode that makes sense together and works together [in a film that doesn’t have] this super linear, aggressive plot. And then the last movement is very linear, that is incredibly cathartic once you’ve been marinated in this world. It really knocks you out. But in general, the movie is so well-staged and beautiful and stunning and inspiring. It’s completely mind-blowing.Nosferatu, a Symphony of Horror (Nosferatu, eine Symphonie des Grauens) (Nosferatu the Vampire) (1922)  97%I’ve seen the Herzog one a good many times too, but the Murnau film… Murnau is neck to neck with Bergman as my favorite director. He’s responsible for some of the best images in cinema of all time, from Nosferatu to Faust to Sunset. His work was so influential that filmmakers generations later can be referencing Murnau without knowing it. But Nosferatu is an interesting movie. It was produced by Albin Grau, an occultist who started an independent film studio to make occult-themed movies. Nosferatu was his first endeavor. And he hired the screenwriter, and he hired Murnau, and he was the production designer and did a lot of concept art. Very much part of the authorship of this film. And Max Schreck, as much as he is a folk vampire and a reinterpretation of Stoker’s literary gothic vampire, he’s also influenced by Albin Grau’s early 20th-century occultist views on vampirism. But in many ways — there’s horror movies before it, obviously — Nosferatu invents horror movies. The editing of the parallel story together in some ways invents cinema.Shadows of Forgotten Ancestors (Tini zabutykh predkiv) (1967)  100%I don’t always love Parajanov’s roaming camera in this movie, but he settled down from Color of Pomegranates onwards. Parajanov’s love for the folk culture is quite infectious. The way that he loves everything on screen, I relate. And the winter mummers are so mysterious. He makes this Hutsul culture come alive and it’s so exotic. Now I know a lot about Carpathian culture and Slavic folklore so the movie doesn’t have a lot of mystery to me anymore. But the first time I saw these images that I couldn’t understand, I was completely conquered because he so clearly understood them [and] they were infused with some kind of meaning that just felt essential to me.The Lighthouse&nbsp;is currently playing in select theaters.","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"Countdown, cancelled, dramedy, Reality, black, Watching, Opinion","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/28135456/600EggersFFF.jpg","slug":"the-lighthouse-director-robert-eggers-five-favorite-films"},{"id":"47508816154627","title":"Jacqueline Stewart’s Five Favorite Films","content":"Five Favorite Filmsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Jacqueline Stewart's Five Favorite FilmsThe professor, archivist, author, and new host of TCM's Silent Sunday Nights reaches way back in time for her picks and provides a little cinematic history lesson.by Jacqueline Coley | October 21, 2019 |  Comments(Photo by TCM)Launched in 1994, Turner Classic Movies has become the premier destination for classic film lovers. But in the 25-year history of the channel, it has yet to employ an African-American host to introduce the films (a signature feature of films curated on the channel). That is, until Jacqueline Stewart was introduced as the new host of&nbsp;Silent Sunday Nights&nbsp;— a series that concentrates on the silent film era — during which the author and archivist will introduce films and provide historical context. Stewart is also a professor in the Department of Cinema and Media Studies at the University of Chicago, specializing in the history of African-American cinema. We recently sat down with Jacqueline — or Professor Stewart, as her twitter handle affectionately reads — and she graciously gave us a mini-film lecture as she broke down her Five Favorite Films, including a few newly unearthed gems that exemplify why she is such a welcome addition to TCM.Within Our Gates (1920)  100%Because that’s what I’ve got on my mind, at the top of the list is an Oscar Micheaux film. Oscar Micheaux&nbsp;was just a legendary figure, especially among African-Americans. And fortunately, because we’ve been able to recover his silent films, he now has a place in general film history. Within Our Gates, like many of his films, really deliberately and explicitly takes up questions of racial politics in America. The film is about a woman named Sylvia Landry (Evelyn Preer) who is a teacher and she goes up north to try to raise money for this small black school, the Piney Woods School, which was an actual full black school that still exists. We experience what she does in terms of the feeling of isolation that many people who moved from the south to the north felt. She’s escaping a really traumatic family history of violence in the south. The film represents lynching and the attempted rape of black women. Micheaux was just really out there in terms of showing the ugliest aspects of racism in America. He had very clear ideas about the way forward and how education uplifts the right living. These are the things that he felt were keys to black success. He’s a filmmaker whose films still spark really powerful debates today.Amazingly, this film had been lost for decades, and it was found in an archive in Spain.&nbsp; It had been there for decades. It was a title that just wasn’t recognizable to scholars who know Micheaux’s work. In the 1990s, the film was repatriated to the United States and restored. The inner titles had to be translated back from Spanish into English. In addition, it’s just the visual and the narrative power of film itself. It’s a real lesson for us to work hard to try to recover these lost works.Favorite moment from the&nbsp;film?Oh, my gosh. There is a scene where there’s this black preacher, Old Ned. He’s preaching a sermon&nbsp;and&nbsp;he’s pretending he’s talking to the black congregation, but really he’s giving a sermon that the white leaders in the town will approve of. Micheaux was really critical of African-American preachers who did not have the best interests of the race at heart. He gives this really bombastic sermon and then the white town fathers come in and congratulate him on doing his job to keep everybody in line and he’s bowing and scraping to them. Then we get this moment when he steps outside and he’s smiling and nodding and then his face just becomes distraught and you see that he recognizes that he’s putting on a show that is really damaging his people, that he’s just caught in this trap of being disempowered and not being able to be a true leader. It’s a moment that really gives you pause. It really gets me to think about the problems of black leadership that persist, even to this day.The Passion of Joan of Arc (La Passion de Jeanne d'Arc) (1928)  98%The next one is a&nbsp;Carl Theodor Dreyer&nbsp;film, The Passion of Joan of Arc, which is just an astounding film. Another film that is so powerful in its representation of human emotions. The film traces the trial of Joan of Arc, but it does so in a way that really gets us to focus on the ways that she’s processing this experience and transcends it through her feeling of connection to God.&nbsp;The lead actress in the film, Maria Falconetti, delivers a performance that… I don’t think anyone has ever delivered a stronger cinematic performance than this one. Dreyer is relentless in his closeups on her; I think 95% of the shots of her are in closeup. The nuances of facial expression that she manages to perform in itself, to give us a sense of all these things that she is feeling that you can’t really say out loud, absolutely remarkable. He does lots of other things in terms of really candid camera angles and disorienting kind of editing patterns that make us feel what her consciousness is experiencing. It’s just one of the classics of world cinema.Man With a Movie Camera (1929)  97%The next one is a Soviet film, Man with a Movie Camera, made by Dziga Vertov and, I hasten to add, his wife Elizaveta Svilova. She was his creative partner. She edited the film. She appears in the film. They both do. Same with the cameraman. Just the sequence where we see her editing and then see the results of the editing process. It’s a film.It’s a movie about making a movie. How meta.Yeah. Right. It’s about, like, what’s the role of the camera in modern life? It opens with the cameraman setting up the tripod and then we go on this journey. Actually, it’s like a city symphony film, which was a popular genre at the time, where you get a portrait of the life of the city across the day from sunrise to dark, but actually Vertov gives us shots of four different entities. But his editing, her editing process, they get combined into one synthetic city, but it becomes more of a meditation on the dynamics of urban life, experiences of workers, of mechanization. They used a variety of, at the time, really innovative camera techniques, so there are freeze frames and slow motion and fast motion and there are multiple exposures and tracking shots.It was a film that is constantly, as you just said, reminding us that it’s a film and it’s really encouraging audiences to think about how it is that this new medium is really reflecting the new seed of modern life and also how they’re experiencing their sense of life through interactions with the film. It is just really remarkable work.&nbsp;We see her hand cutting and slicing stuff together. We never think about the editor’s work when we’re watching a film and I suppose we think if it’s done well, we’re not aware of it, right? But in this case, we’ve seen across the film a bunch of different kinds of workers, factories, and so on and then we get to see the work of making the thing that we’re actually watching. It’s really significant that we see a woman doing that work because many, many of the most important film editors have been women. That’s an aspect I think of film production that’s been lost. Maybe one of the reasons we’re not aware of editing is because, for a long time, it was women’s work and just wasn’t valued in the same way that we think about the work of the director.Lime Kiln Club Field Day (1913)  100%The title is like an artificial title, but it’s Bert Williams, Lime Kiln Club Field Day. It’s actually a film that was never completed. MoMA found it in its vault in reels of production from 1913 featuring Bert Williams, who was the most important entertainer of his era. He’s the first crossover African-American star. He was a recording artist, Vaudeville performer, and he made a number of films with the Biograph company. Some shorter ones survived, but this was a longer production. Fortunately, MoMA discovered his material. They actually put together a cut of it, so that we get a sense of the story.Bert Williams plays this kind of town comic idea, down on his luck a lot of the time, and he and two other guys who are much more sophisticated are competing for the top affection of the local beauty. It’s a lot of comic sequences where they’re trying to take each other out of the running. The film features all of the most important black theatrical performers of the day. It’s just been a revelation to see this, because now we get to see the performance styles of these figures that up ’til now, we’ve only had still images of them and, maybe in some cases, some of the scenarios that they performed in. It’s incredible.Do you know how they found it?It had been in their vault since the ’30s actually. Then, a few decades later, another archivist there did a little bit more research on it. But fortunately, there’s been such an astounding growth of interest in scholarship on early African-American cinema that I think the staff there now, the archivists there, recognize that there was a real public need and desire to learn more about this particular film. I know that the curator there, Ron Magliozzi, worked so hard on recovering the names of the performers.&nbsp;It took deep historical research to do this. He’s traveled around the country and around the world with the assembly that they fit together, and MoMA will be releasing it on DVD I believe next year.Fieldwork Footage (1928) The last one I think might be the most unusual one and this is footage shot by Zora Neale Hurston, who we know as a writer, a novelist, the author of Their Eyes were Watching God (the basis for the eponymous film),&nbsp;which is her best-known work. [She] was also a playwright, short story writer, and screenwriter for a while in her career. Really a Renaissance woman. When she was a student, she was studying anthropology with France Boulez at Columbia, and she was doing her fieldwork as an anthropologist on the kinds of communities that she grew up in, in Florida. In the late 1920s, she had a car and a 16-millimeter camera and she drove down to Alabama and Florida and she shot footage, ethnographic footage, as a part of her research. We featured some of this material on the Pioneers of African-American Cinema box set that I co-curated that was released by Kino.The footage is not narrative and it’s not exactly documentary either, in the sense that she never put together a work that then she was sharing with other people — it was for her research purposes. But she shows men who are logging, for example. My favorite passage of the footage was when she shows children playing games. The can game, and games when they’re in a circle or square and trading off movement and those kinds of things. We can see she’s capturing information that she’s going to use to talk about these cultural practices in her academic writing.&nbsp;It’s also really clear in the attention she pays the children and the attention that she pays to the movements of women, the way that she captures, even in the silent films, the rhythm and the musicality of church service. We can see visually the style that she’s developing that then she folds into her writing practice. We can say, because we know about this work that Zora Neale Hurston seems to be one of the first African-American women filmmakers, and so it gives us a deeper sense of her creative practice and her intellectual practice as well.Jacqueline Coley&nbsp;for Rotten Tomatoes:&nbsp;How did you get involved with TCM?&nbsp;Tell us about the process.Jacqueline Stewart:&nbsp;Sure. I mentioned this Kino box set. Two summers ago, I think the summer of 2017, I was invited to present some of the films from the Pioneers of African-American Cinema Kino Box set on TCM. When I arrived, I learned that I would be talking about the film with Ben Mankiewicz, and they were devoting two Sunday nights to show a range of these films that were made for African-American audiences during the first half of the 20th century. It was really thrilling that TCM was going to be showing this work that most of his audiences would not have been familiar with, and yet this is a really rich and robust film production, film culture, that was coexisting with the classic films that TCM focuses on. These are the films that were showing in segregated black theaters.I was really thrilled to find when I sat down with Ben that he was really interested to dig into these films and the cultural histories and the political histories that they represent. The conversation went really well on camera. Off-camera, we were talking exactly the same way, and we were just really getting into the different directors and stars. I think, on both sides, TCM and I were really happy with how that went, and we stayed in touch. They invited me to event films at their last couple of classic film festivals in Hollywood, and then the invitation to join the team as a host came from there.You had your first Sunday night not that long ago. What was that moment like, watching yourself on screen?I was really nervous. I think anybody would be nervous who hasn’t done that kind of TV work before. I think that I was even more nervous because I just feel a real sense of responsibility. This is an opportunity for me that is not just about expanding my own audience or the next phase of my own career, but it’s a really important moment to demonstrate that expertise about film exists in all of our communities.&nbsp;I know that there is an African American audience that is really rooting for me and want to see that I’m bringing the expertise and the unique perspective that I have to discuss the work that we’re presenting there. I feel a real privilege and an honor and a responsibility to be true to those values. So that also makes it feel like the stakes can be higher for some of us in some of these situations, you know?When did you first fall in love with classic film, or film in general?Well, that’s really easy; [it was] when I was a kid. When I was a girl, I spent a lot of time with my auntie Connie, and she loved these classic Hollywood films, and every night we’d watch Johnny Carson. I’m dating myself. [laughs] Then we’d watch, like,&nbsp;The Tomorrow Show, and then there was always a movie that came on TV, and we would stay up well past midnight watching these old movies, and since this was not a TCM presentation of the films, there were commercial breaks. During the commercials is when she would really break these things down for me and talk about various actors and themes.&nbsp;Just her enthusiasm about all of that. I don’t know if watching them by myself if they would have been compelling to me, but it was something about the interest that she had in it and her desire to teach me something, not just looking at the films themselves, but how this film is connected to a whole bunch more. It was almost like when you are learning about the constellations of stars in the sky and somebody points out to you, “Oh, there’s the Big Dipper. There’s the Little Dipper.” She made it possible for me to see all these kinds of systems at play, and so when I had the opportunity to study film history as an undergrad at Stanford, and then I think about graduate school. I do think, like, on a lower frequency, even though film studies was not like a huge part of my undergraduate education — I was an English major — but I became really curious about film and thought, “Oh, maybe you can write about films and how they’re made, how they tell stories in much the same way that you would talk about novels.” That’s what I’ve continued to do over all these years.Jacqueline Stewart is currently hosting&nbsp;Slient Sunday Nights&nbsp;every Sunday night on&nbsp;TCM.&nbsp;&nbsp;","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"screen, crime, DC, TruTV, E!, TLC, News, indiana","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/22152011/Jacqueline_Stewart_FFF_Rep.jpg","slug":"jacqueline-stewarts-five-favorite-films"},{"id":"47508816160774","title":"James Gray’s Five Favorite Films","content":"Five Favorite Filmsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})James Gray's Five Favorite FilmsThe Ad Astra director expresses his love for Eastwood, Fellini, and pre-Code cinema.by Brian Formo | September 17, 2019 |  Comments(Photo by Pablo Cuadra/Getty Images)James Gray has won the affection of international film critics with New Hollywood throwback offerings like&nbsp;Two Lovers, The Immigrant, and The Lost City of Z, but with Brad Pitt suited up for space in Ad Astra, Gray gets his first major studio project off the ground. Like many of Gray’s films, there is a family story at the heart of his Heart of Darkness-esque space movie, with Tommy Lee Jones playing Pitt’s astronaut father who’s been missing for 20 years but might have just made contact from Neptune. Pitt embarks on a mission not just to find his father, but also to stop the electrical surge from an outpost near the distant planet, which has caused thousands of deaths on Earth.The film debuted at the Venice Film Festival with high accolades for its thrilling sequences, Pitt’s performance, and the astounding visual effects (which the Fox-Disney merger granted Gray a few more months&nbsp;to fine-tune). Ahead of Ad Astra’s nationwide release — it’s&nbsp;Certified Fresh at 81% on the Tomatometer — Gray told us his Five Favorite Films and spoke about the gestation of his current film. That his choices come from Russian, Austrian, and Italian filmmakers, in addition to Hollywood, should&nbsp;surprise no one familiar with his work as&nbsp;a filmmaker who’s keeping the ’70s maverick spirit alive in modern American cinema.The Road (La Strada) (1954)  98%Well, let’s go one, La Strada, which is Federico Fellini’s movie with Anthony Quinn and Giulietta Masina. When was the first time I saw it? Oh, my God, I was in high school. To me, it felt like a fable, and it was beautiful and so moving, and I cry every time I see it. I’m almost crying thinking about it. How both broadly drawn and subtle the characters are, and how much sympathy Fellini has for the people in the movie. Have you ever seen it?I have. I haven’t seen that one in years, also probably since my first time in high school. Around the same year as La Strada, I really like Nights of Cabiria from Fellini, which I’ve seen multiple times.Also right up there. I mean, I have to say, I’m very, very pleased that you know both films, because if had to pick, it would be either one or the other, and I kind of can’t stand picking one or the other, but it’s almost like a random choice, which it was either La Strada or Nights of Cabiria. By the way, the middle one that he did — between the two — which is much less famous, called Il Bidone, with Broderick Crawford, is also a really good movie. Much darker than the other two. It’s got a great ending.It’s almost impossible to imagine a film with more love in it than the ending of Nights of Cabiria&nbsp;— oh, my God. And the ending of La Strada, he does that perfect thing where Anthony Quinn looks up to the heavens. Fellini knew what to do.I Am Cuba (Soy Cuba) (1995)  100%Number two would be, let’s say, I Am Cuba. Ever see that movie?Yes. It’s one of the most beautifully shot movies ever.Oh God, yes. Cheers. It teaches you that the camera is a weapon that can be deployed brilliantly. What is beautiful about I Am Cuba is that, as showy as it is, it’s not style for no point. It’s an expansive vision of the rot that we brought to Cuba. Whether you agree with its politics or not, it’s not really the issue; it’s really human, and you understand… Well, a poet wrote it. Yevgeny Yevtushenko wrote it. You understand the humanity of the people in it. Whether they are subject to humiliation, or to the humiliation of capitalism, well, that’s almost secondary to their own inner lives. The movie validates their inner lives, and the camera is a weapon in doing so. Beautiful.I Am a Fugitive From a Chain Gang (1932)  96%I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang, 1932. This is excellent. It was pre-Code. Ferocious movie. Paul Muni, incredibly intense. It was really the best picture I think Mervyn LeRoy ever did, by far. Maybe the production code got in the way after that. He made another movie called They Won’t Forget, which is supposed to be great, but I don’t love it. I think it’s probably because the production code got in the way and it sort of neutered him a little bit. No spoilers, but the ending of Chain Gang, I couldn’t forget about it for days.This one I also saw way back when I was in high school. I didn’t even know what the Production Code and pre-Code cinema was then; now I know it and find the distinction fascinating, but for this title, I can’t place what LeRoy did that he wouldn’t have been able to do after Fugitive…I just think it’s so hard-hitting. I don’t know if you remember — I mean, he’s got this scene with this woman who’s blackmailing Muni, and the sexually frank conversations they have, and the toughness, the brutality of the film. I mean, it’s something they really scrubbed cleaner, 1934 onward.The Scarlet Empress (1934)  86%Scarlet Empress, with Marlene Dietrich, directed by Josef von Sternberg. That’s also pre-Code, just barely, I think, and it’s the greatest of their collaborations. Morocco is amazing, too, and I love Blue Angel. Morocco has that incredible ending where she can’t resist but follows him off, and you hear the wind sound and all that. Anyway, Scarlet Empress is so singular; there’s nothing like it. It’s almost like a new cinema is being created; he’s creating a new language for cinema. Not just the way that it looks, but the light, the use of light, and the use of production design becomes, almost, a sensory part of the experience and informs her character. It’s all about her character’s sensuality, and he uses all these other elements beyond just herself to sell that. The way the film looks, the way the film feels, and it’s where the style completely informs her identity, which is an amazing idea.Unforgiven (1992)  96%One more. Let’s go with Clint Eastwood’s movie Unforgiven. I think that’s a brilliant movie. The acting in it is totally brilliant. I’ve always been a big Gene Hackman fan, but who isn’t? I love Eastwood and Morgan Freeman in it. Richard Harris is hilarious. I think the movie has an unbelievable sense of myth, and a great sense of undoing that myth. I’ve never been in a movie theater where I had that experience where the end of the movie, you have the hero say, “Yeah, I’ve killed women and children. I’m gonna kill you.”Yeah, it was before the anti-hero truly became chic.Oh, he kills everybody, and he shoots the man who’s moaning on the ground that presents no threat as he’s walking out. He pumps the guy full of lead, and the audience was applauding when I saw that in theaters. And you get the sense that’s like, “I’m not sure Eastwood was endorsing that behavior.” It kind of says the character goes to hell, and I love the subversiveness of it. He got away with it, because the myth, his myth, is so powerful.You made your first film, Little Odessa, soon after that?I did, actually. Maybe six months later, I started working on it. It did have an impact on me; I’m sure it did. I hadn’t thought about it consciously, until now, until you just said it, but I had also seen Lorenzo’s Oil, which I thought was beautiful. George Miller movie. I thought it was just beautiful and very emotional, and I remember both of those films coming out while I was writing my first screenplay. Then, a year after that, there was a Merchant/Ivory movie, Remains of the Day, where I thought Anthony Hopkins’ performance was just incredible. I remember being very excited about this group of films, and they informed a lot of what I’ve being trying to do ever since.I can see that as a little bit of a trinity within your filmography, when you were cultivating your voice, since there’s parenting in Lorenzo’s Oil, the character violence of Unforgiven, and the prestige sheen of Merchant Ivory.You’re right. I had never focused on it before, but now that we’re talking about it, that period, I remember seeing some really interesting movies around that time, in the early ’90s, and it was a great time to make independent film after. The Eastwood movie, I mean, I just am aghast at what he accomplished. “I ain’t like that no more.” Just a very powerful idea about what it means to maintain order, and what’s the price of maintaining order. You don’t know how to feel about that sheriff. He’s awful, but he does what he needs to do, and that’s pretty complex. That’s a great screenplay.Brian Formo&nbsp;for Rotten Tomatoes: Something that’s constant through your work is family expectations and the suffocating weight of that. So I’m wondering, with Ad Astra, did you start with a father-son story in space, or did you want to make a movie in space and have these big set pieces, but then it became more natural to tether it to a father-son relationship?An excellent question. I wish I could tell you that I came up with the story first, but it’s not how it happened. I was thinking very seriously about a childhood memory that I had. I grew up in New York, and you couldn’t see the stars. The sky had this kind of dull orange at night, because the city was so lit up. I remember there was a blackout that hit the city — this was 1977, in the summer of 1977 — and I remember, as all the lights went out, you could see the stars for the first time.All of a sudden I had this weird memory back to that feeling — it was, like, 2011 and I thought, “Wouldn’t it be great to make a movie about what is out there?” I talked about it a lot with my friend and co-writer, Ethan (Gross), and I asked, “What it means to be out there, and are there aliens, or are we alone?” Well, there are a lot of movies about aliens, and good aliens and bad aliens. (Steven) Spielberg’s done incredible work about that, but his movies, they play like fables. E.T. is like a fable;&nbsp;Close Encounters, like a fable. Beautiful, beautiful films. (Stanley) Kubrick made a beautiful film, of course (in 2001). The alien is a black slab of granite, whatever it appears to look like. Is that a good alien? A bad alien? What does that mean? You can project anything you want on it. So he beats the trap of false gods, you know?(Photo by 20th Century Fox)But we thought, “Well, what does it mean if you find that there’s really nothing out there? And if there’s nothing out there, that poses its own set of existential questions.” So it started from that, really, and that was the chain of events. Then I tried to start getting the story as personal as I could, and we wanted to steal from — as pretentious as this sounds — we wanted to steal from The Odyssey, and tell the story, really, from Telemachus’ point of view. His father, Odysseus, goes away for 20 years; he doesn’t know what happened to him. What that would mean, and that sense of abandonment that Telemachus must have…Now, of course, Homer’s story ends very differently. But that’s where that came from, a kind of mythic idea. Then, of course, you start to personalize it, you start to include things in your own life, and before you know it, you’ve got this tiny little story about a father and a son against the huge canvas, where you’re going out there, it’s the vast infinite. That’s really how it formed.So, the opening in the film, and I’m not a take-a-notepad-to-the-film person, mostly because High Fidelity scarred me for life…Oh when his girlfriend clicks her pen throughout the movie to take notes?Yes!Ha, what a nice aside.So I’m not sure if I got the two words correct, but the movie opens with something like, in the near future, there’s hope and fear about humanity’s future. In presenting the future, what is something that you discovered in your research that gives you hope about the future, and what is something that terrifies you?It’s an easy question to answer. Easy. Hope: the mapping of the human genome, hospital cures for diseases, the specialized treatment of things like different kinds of cancer, that’s fantastic. And fear, I think, is obvious. The fear is climate change and the end of civilization, the civilized world.If you look at Mars… By the way, the NASA people I’ve worked with on this film, who are great, their hair’s on fire. The f—ing world is ending and, I mean, I understand that it’s a slow burn, but it’s not that slow. In fact, the permafrost is going worse up there than we think, you know? Greenland, large sheets are melting faster than we think, or we thought — now we know. Already parts of New York are uninsurable.And lots of Los Angeles, for fires.Yeah. I’m extremely concerned. So, I think progress is a beautiful thing. I think that we’ll be able to do things that we couldn’t imagine in terms of human longevity. Maybe we’ll figure out what it means in the future, to maybe find an answer to not just longevity, but market economics, where five people don’t control all the wealth on the planet. That’s a problem.If we could solve that, that would be great, but I have hope that we do, because the world moves in cycles, strange cycles. I feel like we’re itching for a new path forward on how to handle some of our problems. But climate change, that’s a tough one. That’s a tough one. There are things like taking CO² and making it into oxygen. Apparently, technologically, there are ways to do it, but it’s ridiculously expensive.&nbsp; But we’re going to have to do it. I don’t see any other way around it. I hope I’m completely wrong.Ryan Fujitani[Note: Mild spoilers below]We can get morose for the whole interview, but this movie has a lot of very fun, thrilling sequences.I hope so.Like the moon pirates, the underground lake, or even just the opening, falling from space, et cetera. The mayday call for help and where that goes…All of that was supposed to be thematically relevant, more than narratively relevant. The idea that, basically, unexpected horror is around every turn when you’re that far away from Earth. So we felt that it had thematic unity, if not narrative unity. Anything earthbound, it’s not meant to live out there. It’s not meant to be there. That’s not our friend, it’s different to us. We felt that the mayday response was an important sequence. Do people want to know about that beforehand?I loved the surprise, so I think, where we’re at for filmgoers is people just want to know that there’s blood, there’s a confrontation, there’s excitement.Well, there is blood. There is blood.There are deaths and surprises.We tried to do that. We wanted to deliver that stuff. The fall from the tower, the lunar-rover sequence, the [mayday] thing, the underground lake, certainly; he climbs up a rocket, he has a zero G fight, he flies through the rings of a planet. I mean, we wanted to deliver some red meat. We absolutely did. By the way, there is no shame in that. Shakespeare was broad and subtle; that’s good stuff. So, we tried, and we tried to do it in our own way, of course, make it weird, unique, strange; in the lunar rover you can only hear what’s inside his helmet. It’s very weird for a chase sequence.Yeah, you have meat and potatoes, but you also have some asparagus.Exactly. That’s what we’re trying to do.Ad Astra&nbsp;is in theaters September 20.Thumbnail image:&nbsp;(c) Warner Bros.","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"thirty, movies, sports, Comics, horror","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/17164837/James_Gray_FFF_Rep.jpg","slug":"james-grays-five-favorite-films"},{"id":"47508816179217","title":"Terry Gilliam’s Five Favorite Films","content":"Five Favorite Filmsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Terry Gilliam's Five Favorite FilmsThe director of Brazil, Monty Python and the Holy Grail, and this week's The Man Who Killed Don Quixote is a big fan of classic cinema.by Ryan Fujitani | April 10, 2019 |  Comments(Photo by NurPhoto/Getty Images)Terry Gilliam is best known for writing and directing a number of celebrated classics with cult followings, including Brazil, Time Bandits, Twelve Monkeys, Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, and perhaps his most beloved film, Monty Python and the Holy Grail, which was also his feature debut. One project he was never able to get off the ground — until recently, that is — was an adaptation of Miguel de Cervantes’ novel Don Quixote, which suffered a couple of ill-fated false starts and languished in development hell for 25 years. Gilliam’s struggle became one of the go-to examples of doomed passion projects, and a 2003 documentary about his experiences, Lost in La Mancha, met with widespread acclaim.Eventually, after numerous rewrites, multiple cast changes, and several starts and stops, Gilliam was able to complete his movie, though it ultimately became something much different than he had originally imagined. Set in the present day,&nbsp;The Man Who Killed Don Quixote follows a commercial director (Adam Driver) who returns to the small Spanish village where he shot a student-film version of Don Quixote. There, he discovers not only that his production has left several lives in shambles, but also that the unassuming local cobbler (longtime friend and collaborator Jonathan Pryce) who played his Don Quixote has taken on the persona in real life. The&nbsp;new film opens in theaters for a one-night Fathom Event on April 10, and ahead of the release, Gilliam spoke to RT about the film’s long, arduous journey and gave us his Five Favorite Films… plus one extra. Read on for the full interview.Pinocchio (1940)  100%Let’s go to Pinocchio, Disney’s Pinocchio. That was a truly, utterly magical movie. The world was so beautifully detailed and so fantastical, and yet believable at every point. I love that movie. It’s really stuck with me, because it was at a level of craftsmanship that was so unbelievably high, and it’s maintained that position in my head for all the years. Great songs, great everything. Great characters. I don’t know what else one can say about it. It’s just a great story.I think the first film I saw was probably Snow White.&nbsp;That’s the advantage of being old. You get these films when you’re at the right age. But those two in particular really, really stuck with me because I just hadn’t seen anything so beautifully crafted. The great thing, it made me a big fan. It took me years to discover that Cliff Edwards was the voice of Jiminy Cricket. I always loved “When You Wish Upon a Star,” and he was singing that. Now I’m a great fan of Cliff Edwards. His music is brilliant, but most people have forgotten him. I just think he was known as a singer, and he played the ukulele. He just ended up with a wonderful voice. I think his voice was also used in one of the other Disney films, which I can’t remember. But it was his singing that is just right. I think that’s Pinocchio.I saw Pinocchio&nbsp;maybe 20 years ago again, and what amazed me about it is how, as a child, I remembered this vast universe, huge world. In fact, it’s tiny. You go from Geppetto’s workshop and the little village to the bad boys’ island just like that. Bing.&nbsp;It’s so tight the way that they do it. The next thing, you’re in Monstro’s belly. It’s a great one to watch just to see how succinct you can be and still create a universe. It’s a lesson I’ve never learned, the succinct part.Paths of Glory (1957)  95%I’m just trying to do ones that really stuck with me.&nbsp;Paths of Glory.&nbsp;I was, I don’t know, probably 13 or 14, and it was a Saturday matinee at the local cinema, and all the kids were dumped there by their parents to keep them out of the way on Saturday afternoons. I was sitting there, and this black-and-white thing came on. I was utterly blown away, because it was the first film that I really appreciated the injustice in the world that’s waiting for all of us, and just the tracking shots through the trenches. My version in Brazil in the Clark’s Pool was all about the shots from Paths of Glory.I remember going to school on Monday, telling everybody, “You’ve got to go see this movie.” Nobody did, because it was too serious. Everybody was basically normally going to see Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis movies, which I also loved. That’s the&nbsp;pratfall side of my nature.Citizen Kane (1941)  99%Probably somewhere along there,&nbsp;Citizen Kane reared its head. Once you see that, either you want to be a movie director, or you just want to give up, one of the two. He got it right. He did everything right. Then when you think he was only, what, 25 years old at that time?&nbsp;Extraordinary. I think that’s when I became obsessed with wide angles and deep focus. That was a new world for me. It’s probably those two films, that and Paths of Glory, really pushed me into wanting to tell stories on film, because they had such an effect on my life.The Seventh Seal (Det Sjunde inseglet) (1957)  93%The next one, I think we got to go to Bergman. We go to go to Seventh Seal. Seventh Seal just knocked me dead. On many levels, it’s such a simple film. You’ve got Mary and Joseph, the young people with their little traveling theater, and then you’ve got the knight. I think it was the way he dealt with the Middle Ages and intrigued me with Death there at playing chess. Those were images that just stuck in my head.It was funny. When I was doing Parnassus, I went back and looked at it, because I was trying to remind myself what Mary and Joseph and their little traveling theater was like.&nbsp;I had forgotten so much detail. That was just a really important film, and Max von Sydow was something… The first time I had seen basically a non-American actor at work.&nbsp;He looked different. He behaved differently. Because, you know, I grew up with Dean Martin, Jerry Lewis, Doris Day, Rock Hudson — shiny teeth and beautifully combed hair and all of that nonsense. Something profound was going on in that movie without pointing fingers at anything. It just did it. The squire&nbsp;— that was Gunnar Björnstrand, I think — was just a great character, the cynic in the midst of it all. I remember when he was talking, when he was in this church, and all the frescoes are there, and it’s just profound filmmaking.Seven Samurai (Shichinin no Samurai) (1956)  100%I think I’ll probably have to go to from Seventh Seal to Seven Samurai. With Kurosawa using the tracking shots, the way he… the energy, just the kinetic energy on screen was amazing, especially with Japanese-style acting, which is very structured and very formalized, which then breaks out, and you’re slashing somebody in half. That is pure filmmaking. I just thought, “It’s just beautiful.” Again, another movie that’s about texture, and it’s a very different texture than you get growing up in America. That began my love affair with things Japanese.8 1/2 (1963)  98%Then we leap to 8 1/2. Boom.Just classic after classic here…I steal from only the best. [laughs] There’s Fellini with a whole new world opening up, a whole new way of using the camera, and people suddenly looking into the lens and smiling as if the camera is another character in the piece, and all those faces, the worlds he created. It was the first film I saw that I felt, “This is what a director’s life is like.” I know later Truffaut did his Day for Night, which was a very sweet film, but it didn’t capture the pressure that directing is. I suddenly felt that’s what film directing is like, what’s going on in that movie. It’s always stuck with me and has proved to be true.It’s like with Marcello going down the corridors doing his silly little dances, anything to avoid these people that are wanting things from him. It’s exactly what film directing is about. For anybody who wants to direct a film, they must just watch that film again and again. The last shot, when he’s being dragged towards the incomplete set that he could never afford to build in reality — he’s being supported by a couple of his aides, then he breaks free, and they grab him again. He’s forced to go and finish his film. It was that beautiful, circular dance that goes on with the little boy in his white outfit conducting it all. It’s sublime filmmaking, is all I can say.RT: This movie is pretty widely known as one of those projects most people thought would never be completed. How does it feel, now that it’s finally done?Gilliam: Well, it’s out of my life. I got rid of it. It was like a disease. That really is what it feels like.&nbsp;I’m relieved that I like the film. That’s what&nbsp;pleases me. It’s nice that a few other people, or maybe a lot of people — that depends — like it as well, because the horrible thing about carrying it around that long was the growing fear that whatever I did would disappoint people, because if they had been waiting 20 years, their imagination is going to have plenty of time to grow. I just knew I’m going to disappoint a lot of people. That was terrible. Luckily, I’ve read a couple of reviews that proved that I was right. I disappointed. [laughs]That is&nbsp;just cheating. I think people who went to see the film should forget that it took 30 years to get&nbsp;made,&nbsp;because it’s just a film that I finally got out. The film, the final film that’s made, is a result of a couple years of work, and that’s it. All the stuff that precedes that is kind of meaningless, to be quite honest. Once you’ve finally got the cash, you can go off and shoot it, and then you survive shooting outside for almost the entire film without nature destroying you. It is what it is.For me, Quixote has never been one idea, one script that I had 30 years ago that I’ve clung onto. It’s constantly grown and changed and shifted, depending on circumstances and who’s involved. That’s what filmmaking is about. I’m in no way a purist about anything. It’s just something I managed to get done in the last couple of years, and I’m really pleased with it.RT: Despite the hardships you endured bringing it to the screen, you must have been so excited to finally be shooting the thing. Am I completely off base about that?Gilliam:&nbsp;Completely. [laughs]&nbsp;The first couple weeks were horrible because this weight of expectations was killing me.&nbsp;It really&nbsp;limited what I was doing. I really was struggling to decide this, that, or the other thing. Luckily, after a couple of weeks, you’re just in the rhythm of things. You’re just dealing with a disaster that just occurred 10 minutes before, so you forget about all of that, but I just knew it’s going to disappoint a lot of people. Whatever they thought it was going to be, it isn’t. It is what it is, is all it is.All I know is, I think we ended up with a bit of script that we had way back when. We ended up with the best cast imaginable. It was the thing that actually carried me through most of the shoot, that whatever I felt my failings were, I just felt the cast is so brilliant that whatever happens, that will pull the audience through. I still feel that. I think Adam and Jonathan are spectacular, and Stella and Olga and Joanna and Jordi Mollà —&nbsp;every one of them is crackers. It’s just great.RT: I have to imagine that, throughout the process if filming this, part of you had to be wondering, “OK, what’s going to go wrong this time? When is this all going to fall apart?”Gilliam:&nbsp;That is the constant fear, because I know I’m getting away with murder. “How much longer can I pull this off?” Actually, here’s the funny thing that happened. The weather was good for us, because we were outside. We were exposed the whole time. We didn’t have weather cover most of the weeks, actually. We were right on the edge the whole time, and the weather held until we got to it, the biggest scene in the whole thing, which is at the end with the burning of Santa Cathartica, and the castle with all of those extras — there was 350, all in costumes — I mean,&nbsp;the most expensive part of the film, and of course, that night it rained. [laughs]&nbsp;We had to postpone, and we lost a day. But I thought, “Nature has got a sense of humor, is all I know.”&nbsp;It suckered me in, thinking it’s going to be OK. “Wait until you get the most difficult, expensive part, and now f–k you, Gilliam.”RT: When did you first realize this film was becoming your own personal windmill giant?Gilliam: I don’t know. It must have been after 2000 when it all collapsed. I went off and did something else, and then it was more about the fact that Quixote wouldn’t leave me. It was like every time I’d finish another film, I would pause, and there would be that old fart waving, saying, “Come on. Let’s get to work.”&nbsp;That’s what happened. At a certain point, you’ve expended so many years, and it just feels you’ve got to finish it. Luckily, I had Orson Welles up there as my competitor, and I thought, “He couldn’t finish his, and I’m going to f–king finish mine.” [laughs]&nbsp;I had to be better than&nbsp;him at one thing. Maybe my film was a fraction as good as his was going to be, but it doesn’t matter. I beat him on one thing.No, it’s a very funny thing. Tony Grisoni, we were talking about this, because we knew the comparison between Gilliam and Quixote would keep coming up. He said, “Really?” His feeling is the film is Quixote; Gilliam is Sancho Panza. I’m the guy who kept plodding along to&nbsp;keep the lunacy alive&nbsp;somehow.&nbsp;I tend to think there is that, because by the time we’re doing it, I’m no longer a dreamer at all. I’m not fantasizing about anything. I’m just dealing with reality, and it’s been like that for the last probably 10 years. That’s what it’s become.RT: I think it’s probably easy for anyone who’s familiar with your work to see why you might have been drawn to the story of Don Quixote, but my understanding is that you read the novel, I think, sometime around 1989, and then immediately wanted to turn it into a film. If that’s true, what was it about the book that spoke to you so powerfully that you just felt that intense need to adapt it?Gilliam: It was actually slightly backward from that.&nbsp;I think I had finished Munchausen, and what am I going to do next? Quixote has always been in the zeitgeist — there’s Quixote, one of the great iconic figures, and I’ve always been partial to madmen and fantasists. I literally just called up Jake Edwards, who was the executive producer of Munchausen and said, “Jake, I got to two names for you. One is Gilliam, and the other is Quixote. I need $20 million.” He says, “You got it.” It was as simple as that.&nbsp;I had the guarantee of $20 million before I read the book.Then I sat down and read it, and several weeks later, I realized, “What the f–k have I done? This is crazy. I don’t know how to even begin here because it’s such a massive work.” But I started working with Charles McKeown, who had written Munchausen with me, and we started throwing it around. It was a very different idea back then. It was really basically about several old men sitting around in a plaza in some little village in Spain, and all they were saying to each other, “If only I had done this here. If only I hadn’t done that.” It was the “if only” story, and one of them says, “I’ve had enough of this stuff. I’m going to die soon, so before I die, I’m going to go and do whatever it is ‘if only,’ that we’ll throw the ‘if only’ out of the equation.” That’s how we started writing it. That’s where it started.But then I realized the problem was going to be, how do you convince a modern audience that a guy from the 17th century is completely enthralled with stories from the 12th century? Because your period costumes, a modern audience wouldn’t be able to distinguish between the two. That then led to the next step, which was, let’s have a modern guy who becomes the Sancho Panza, the man who we can all identify with, who takes us through. Then I went into Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur’s Court. End of story, bonk on the head, you end up in the 17th century. That’s where we were with the Johnny Depp/Jean Rochefort version. I don’t know how many years ago we made the leap to keep it modern, because that would be cheaper. Planes could fly over, and they wouldn’t f–k up the film for us. [laughs]Then it was this idea that we see what he was like before he’d become a cynical, corrupted commercials director, when he was young and innocent, and he made a film, as we do in the movie. That seems to be a much more interesting way of approaching it, and then it also made the character of Toby more tied in with a sense of guilt, because he’s created this monster in Quixote, and so they’re trapped together. That helped. All of these things started developing.It was always just this balance game of trying to keep it fresh and be true to the heart of the book, the essence of the book. We’d pick bits that we liked from the original stories and use them, and yet we weren’t trapped in that. We didn’t have to ever become pedantic about it. It freed us up, because you spend your time always trying to escape from those great authors, whether it’s Hunter Thompson or Cervantes. It all was quite step by step. It makes sense when I look back on it. At the time, we were just trying to keep it fresh in our own minds and trying to solve enough problems.RT: You’ve said that the way the narrative shifted over the years, it came to be about the way movies can damage people, and I’m wondering if that was directly influenced at all by what you went through, trying to get the movie made.Gilliam:&nbsp;No, it wasn’t.&nbsp;What it was about was our experience making Holy Grail in Scotland.&nbsp;Because we had come up to Scotland, and we were working in this little village called Doune, where they had a castle and all. We really f–ked up a lot of people’s lives, because girls trailed the crew back to London, marriages broke up, all sorts of things happened&nbsp;as a result of a film crew coming to a small village. So that’s what was in my mind, not my own experiences necessarily.It was also the other idea of what films do, is that films replace those books that Quixote was reading, which were about knights and heroics and maidens and blah, blah, blah. That’s what movies do now. I find I don’t know how X-Men&nbsp;or Avengers are affecting young people’s lives. Do they believe any of it? Do they want to be like that? I don’t know.RT:&nbsp;This isn’t the only film project of&nbsp;yours that ran into problems during the development process. What made&nbsp;you stick with this one more so than any of the others?Gilliam: Well, it was probably Orson Welles again. It’s the idea that even Orson Welles couldn’t finish his.&nbsp;[laughs] But I feel a bit more responsible when I take on a great book that somebody else has written, and I feel, “Is there a way I can actually bring this to life again for a modern audience?” I want to encourage people to read. When I think about Munchausen, it was the book. Fear and Loathing, it was the book. It’s really what triggers me a lot, taking on something that I think is important, make a film about it, and maybe it’ll lure a few people back to actually look at the original material to see what it does to&nbsp;them.RT: Does The Man Who Killed Don Quixote hold any sort of special significance to you?Gilliam: I don’t think so, no. Now that I’ve managed to pull it off, that seems to be enough. It’s still too close to me, as well, because always the last film is your favorite film. It always works that way with me, and I can’t wait to see it in theaters to see what I really think about it. But it really is like that. I don’t watch my films because I really want to get to the point that I’ve forgotten what they are or what happens, so I can be like a normal audience and judge them as somebody who knows nothing. I’m waiting for that moment on Quixote. I’m still too busy. My problem with Quixote is I have become that character in the scene where Jonathan is in the back of the truck with the dirty sheet, and the film is playing again and again and obviously having to retell the tale.&nbsp;That’s what I’ve become.

Just a few years after making her TV debut at the age of 19, she landed the plum role of Amy Pond, the companion to Matt Smith’s Doctor Who, in 2009 and stuck with the series for three years. In 2014, Gillan joined the Marvel Cinematic Universe as Nebula in Guardians of the Galaxy, cementing her place in the overarching Infinity Saga storyline and playing an integral role in some of the franchise’s most beloved films. In between all the Marvel movies, she also found time for smaller acclaimed films like The Big Short and In a Valley of Violence, another blockbuster success in Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle, and her feature directorial debut, 2018’s The Party’s Just Beginning.This week, Gillan stars opposite another MCU alumnus, David Dastmalchian (Russian computer wiz Kurt from the Ant-Man movies), in All Creatures Here Below. The drama, which Dastmalchian also wrote, centers on a desperate couple driven to crime who flee Los Angeles for Kansas City in hopes of starting their lives over. Ahead of the film’s release, Gillan chatted with Rotten Tomatoes about her remarkable career, her love of horror, and what it was like to transition from an Avengers movie to something smaller. But first, she gave us her Five Favorite Films, revealing that her lively, cheerful disposition hides a fascination for some dark and twisted entertainment. Read on for her full list.The Shining (1980)  84%My first favorite film is The Shining by Stanley Kubrick.&nbsp;I am a huge horror film fan. I love them so much. I’ve always loved them. Ever since I was a kid, I’ve been attracted to scary stuff; I don’t know why. When I was younger I would watch a lot of the cheesier process-of-elimination slasher ’90s films. And then I feel like, as my tastes matured a little bit as I got older, I found The Shining, which is a movie that my dad had always spoken about with this weird fear, because he’d never finished the movie. He’s like, “The one film I’ve never been able to finish in my life is The Shining.”So I grew up like, “What is The Shining?” And then, finally I watched it, and it was just incredible. Well, Stanley Kubrick’s my favorite director, so you’ll probably see a lot of his films in the top five. I just love that movie so much, and it’s my favorite on-screen performance of all time, from Jack Nicholson. I think that he’s absolutely incredible. I’m ready to play a role like that.I was just about ask if you were interested in doing a horror film&nbsp;yourself before I remembered you did&nbsp;Oculus. Do&nbsp;you have plans to do more, then?Yeah, I think I’ll probably direct a horror film next. That might be what’s next for me, yeah. It’s time!A Clockwork Orange (1971)  86%Okay, so number two, can I choose another Stanley Kubrick? Number two is&nbsp;A Clockwork Orange.&nbsp;I just think it’s just visually an absolute masterpiece. Again, the central performance is incredible. I just love these performances that you get with these lead actors that are so on the brink of madness. They’re violent, they’re unpredictable and scary, and I just love that sequence where it’s operatic in A Clockwork Orange, when they’re beating each other up, and it’s the classical music. I love that. The Singin’ in the Rain, singing that song is deeply disturbing. I think he’s just a complete master.Jumanji (1995)  55%Going a little more lighthearted, number three is the original Jumanji, which is so&nbsp;cheesy&nbsp;because I was in the remake, but that was always one of my favorite films of all time. It’s just pure nostalgia. I think I’m right in that age bracket where it’s like a classic to anyone who’s around my age, and anyone who’s outside of that, it doesn’t seem like it’s so much of a classic to them.&nbsp;Loved it.You must have absolutely jumped at the opportunity to do the remake.Oh yeah, I was like, “What the hell?” It was a weird life moment where you’re like, “Really?” I mean, to get that role, it still blows my mind today. Like, whenever anyone would ask me socially, “If you could have any movie prop from anything, what would it be?” I would always say the original board game from Jumanji.&nbsp;Now I’m actually playing the game. It’s pretty wild.And you didn’t seek that movie out; it came to you.It came to me. I’d just wrapped on&nbsp;Guardians of the Galaxy 2. I sat down to a glass of wine like, “Oh my God, I’ve done it,” and then got the email saying, “Okay, you have an audition for the new Jumanji.” I almost spat my wine out, “What?” And then it’s like, “OK, back to work!”The Piano Teacher (La Pianiste) (2001)  73%Number four would be a movie called The Piano Teacher by Michael Haneke.&nbsp;That’s a really interesting character study to me, and that is my other favorite on-screen performance, Isabelle Huppert. I just think it’s a really, really interesting character study; again, disturbing. I guess there’s a theme here. [laughs]&nbsp;And her last frame of acting in that movie — not actually the last frame; the last frame is her walking, but the one before that is the best piece of acting I’ve ever seen in my entire life. If you don’t know what I’m talking about you have to go watch it.Funny Games (2008)  52%This is hard, because it could be many things. I mean, it could be Kubrick, it could be Haneke again. Do I need to mix it up a little bit? I feel like I’ve gone very serious. I think it’s either 2001: A Space Odyssey or Funny Games by Michael Haneke. What I like about&nbsp;Funny Games is a moment, actually, where all of it… OK, I think&nbsp;2001 is a better movie.&nbsp;However, there’s a moment in Funny Games that’s genius, that I love, which is when he turns to the audience, and suddenly turns the whole movie into this kind of study, where we are accountable as an audience. Because we like the violence that’s happening in the movie, and he’s doing it for us, so suddenly we’re culpable. And I think that’s a really cool moment in film that I haven’t really seen other than that.&nbsp;Yeah, I thought that was really clever.Also, I’m talking the American remake, not the original, because he remade it shot-for-shot for the American audience, which is really interesting, because he made it in German and then it only had so much reach, and then was like, “I want to make this for a society where violence maybe is a little more glamorized.” And I’m not just saying that about Americans; I think we’re the same in the UK, where we really like watching that on-screen. It’s just a really interesting study into that, and so, for that reason, I’m going with that. And one time I hosted a screening where all of our friends came down and watched it, and I have never seen a more depressed group of people in my life, and it was a huge mistake. [laughs] Everyone left immediately. No one hung around after.I do have to say, this whole time I thought&nbsp;you were talking about the original, and then&nbsp;you dropped, “By the way, I’m talking about the remake.” You don’t hear that too often with that movie. Is it specifically because of what&nbsp;you saw as Haneke’s intent to reach certain audiences?Yes, I mean, that’s part of it. I like this, because that adds to the whole meta experience, where it’s redone for an audience where it might mean a little more. However, I also prefer watching it, just there.&nbsp;It’s just easier to watch, because I understand the language. I’m not reading subtitles, and I don’t mind reading subtitles; I’ve chosen other films in the list where the subtitles are required. But this movie, I just find it slightly more palatable.&nbsp;I think it’s a really good remake basically. I don’t think it lost too much in the remake and I think the performances are really good.Ryan Fujitani for Rotten Tomatoes: All Creatures Here Below is, of course, decidedly different from a Marvel movie. Do you find it difficult to switch gears between something as large-scale as Avengers and something smaller and more intimate like&nbsp;All Creatures?Karen Gillan: No, not really. I think, ultimately, when it comes down to it, when the director shouts, “Action,” it’s exactly the same job. It’s just everything else surrounding it.&nbsp;On the Marvel movies, we’re so taken care of, it’s amazing. And then you go onto another movie, and there’s no budget for that, but that’s absolutely fine, It’s not an issue; it certainly wasn’t an issue for me or David [Dastmalchian], and we both work in Marvel movies.David is the guy who wrote it, and is also acting in it.&nbsp;It was just amazing. It didn’t feel too much like shifting gears. It felt like the same job, different character, really.RT: You’re from Scotland, but in this film, you’re portraying a down-and-out woman from the American Midwest, which is a very specific thing. What was your preparation like for the role?Gillan:&nbsp;Well, I’m always reading psychology essays anyway. That would be what my fun hobby is. [laughs] And so that is the kind of thing that I would do for this character. I also have a dialect coach that I really like working with, and we’ll really nail down what the accent is.&nbsp;A huge part of what I love doing is doing different accents and voices. And then, I just went to Kansas City and kind of immersed myself in being there, and feeling what it’s like in 100-degree heat, which, as a Scottish person, I don’t function well in. I don’t think I’ve ever experienced that before. [laughs]And just spending time with David. He drove me around to all the spots where these two would go and we’d talk, and he told me about his life growing up there. So it felt like an immersive experience, for sure. I ate a lot of fast food, which I was happy about, because we do that in Scotland.RT: You’ve had quite a run these past several years. You’ve been in a bunch of big hits and acclaimed smaller films, not to mention Doctor Who a few years ago. What is this secret power you have to recognize when a project is going to be a good one?Gillan:&nbsp;I mean, I think it’s just deciding what I think is good and not. [laughs]RT: You just happen to be a little better at it than most people.Gillan: I don’t know, maybe I’ve just been really lucky with the people I’ve gotten to work with. It’s been a really exciting thing, because I feel like I got to be involved in some things where they were kind of new and exciting and we didn’t exactly know how they were going to go over. It felt at the time when we did the first Guardians film, the tone was so new at that point for a Marvel movie that it was like, “What is this? This is new.” And then it became really exciting and kind of carved the way for the tone of the rest of the rest of the Marvel movies, I would say.Same with Jumanji, this feeling of, “How is this going to go across?” And then people really responded to it. It just feels incredibly lucky to get to work with the directors, because really, it’s all down to them. They’re steering the ship and calling all the shots. So, I don’t know, maybe luck or just responding to things.RT:&nbsp;You’ve directed a feature film already, and you mentioned that you’re interested in possibly doing a horror film next. I take it you enjoyed that experience behind the camera.Gillan: It was incredible. I loved it. I’ve loved filmmaking always, and I love acting so much, whether it’s me doing it or I’m watching another person do it really well, and I get to collaborate with them. I just love it, and I love the visuals of filmmaking. So to combine all of that just made me really, really happy. And yes, definitely have multiple directing projects in the pipeline, which is exciting. Probably going to be a horror film next, I think, just because I really want to get my hands on the genre.All Creatures Here Below&nbsp;opens in&nbsp;select theaters on&nbsp;May 17.","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"Kids, See, archives, Talk","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/08101829/Karen_Gillan_FFF_Rep.jpg","slug":"karen-gillans-five-favorite-films"},{"id":"47508816169995","title":"Neil Gaiman’s Five Favorite Films","content":"Five Favorite Filmsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Neil Gaiman's Five Favorite FilmsThe Sandman graphic novel series writer and author of Good Omens – now a streaming series – chooses classics, including If…, His Girl Friday, and All That Jazz.by Debbie Day | May 30, 2019 |  CommentsDebbie DayBeloved novelist Neil Gaiman — Coraline, American Gods, Stardust, and The Sandman&nbsp;graphic novel series — took charge of the book-to-screen adaptation of the 1990 novel Good Omens: The Nice and Accurate Prophecies of Agnes Nutter, Witch&nbsp;to fulfill a promise to his good friend and collaborator Terry Prachett, who died in 2015. Now that the series Good Omens has arrived as an Amazon Prime offering, we caught up with Gaiman&nbsp;to talk about the new comedic fantasy series and his favorite films.The limited series boasts a stellar lineup of acting talent, including Michael Sheen (Frost/Nixon) as angel Aziraphale, who botches his gig as Garden of Eden chief of security by allowing demon Crowley, played by&nbsp;David Tennant&nbsp;(Doctor Who), to tempt Eve with an apple from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. In the subsequent millennia, the two find themselves repeatedly at odds, and form a friendship of a sort that only two mutually admiring adversaries can. Their bond transcends the modern bromance and is more celestial in nature, with Crowley regularly tempting Aziraphale into small transgressions on his path, and Aziraphale occasionally coaxing out Crowley’s better angel. Their friendship meets the ultimate test when the Antichrist arrives and is promptly misplaced. The duo must work together to stop End Times lest humanity, good wine, and fine cuisine perish in the Apocalypse.Mad Men’s Jon Hamm is a brash, Americanized Archangel Gabriel, who is captain of Team Heaven, while Anna Maxwell Martin (The Bletchley Circle) appears as Beelzebub, leader of the forces of Hell. Josie Lawrence (Enchanted April) appears as 17th century witch Agnes Nutter, who produces the only accurate book of prophecies ever written. Adria Arjona (True Detective) is Anathema Device, a witch and Agnes Nutter’s descendant, while Miranda Richardson appears as part-time medium and prostitute Madame Tracy, who cares for her righteous neighbor, Witchfinder Sergeant Shadwell played by Michael McKean. Frances McDormand is the voice of God, Benedict Cumberbatch voices Satan, and Sam Taylor Buck is reluctant Antichrist Adam Young.The series, a coproduction of Amazon Studios and BBC Studios, is directed by Douglas Mackinnon (Doctor Who) and also features Jack Whitehall, Mireille Enos, Brian Cox, Nick Offerman, Ned Dennehy, Ariyon Bakare, Nina Sosanya, Steve Pemberton, and Mark Gatiss.Gaiman, whose Starz&nbsp;adaptation of American Gods&nbsp;was recently renewed for a third season, shared his five favorite films and another fantasy he’s working on: retirement.Debbie Day for Rotten Tomatoes: We’re doing a feature called “Five Favorite Films.” Were you able to give that any thought?Neil Gaiman: You know I really wish somebody had said, “They are doing a feature called ‘Five Favorite Films,’ please have five films ready.” Then I could have just had it for you, rather than what I’m going to have to do now which is grab a piece of paper and a pencil and scribble. Just give me a few seconds, I’m just going the scribble. The nice thing about lists of favorite films is … they always change. Let’s see, there’s four and … OK, there we are, there’s five favorite films jotted down. Don’t know that they’d be the same five favorite films that I would come up with …Tuesday next. But, they’re a good start.If.... (1968)  92%The first one would be Lindsay Anderson’s If… It’s a film that I love because it allows me sometimes try and explain what it was like to be a kid at an English Public School — I was a scholarship boy in the early 1970s — late ’60s where you were in&nbsp;— even though it’s set earlier than that and was made earlier than that — you were in a culture that hasn’t changed.I remember just watching it and suddenly feeling understood. Which was a completely new one for me. I’d be, you know, This is my world.&nbsp;It was like, OK, here is something Malcolm McDowell–starring, the idea of kids — while we didn’t actually shoot up the school in rebellion, it was the kind of strange stuffy environment that needed to come tumbling down, and I’d never seen that before depicted on film. For years I wondered about why some sequences were in black and white, and many years later I was reading an interview with Lindsey Anderson and discovered it was because they ran out of money for color film, so they just went over to black and white stock, which works in several places through the story.All That Jazz (1979)  86%Second film: All That Jazz, Bob Fosse. It’s an incredibly hopeful, uplifting art journey and you know, on the one hand it’s about a man who is killing himself through over-work and who is over-extended and miserable and is going to die of a heart attack, and on the other hand, it’s Bob Fosse’s celebration of the fact that he didn’t die of a heart attack. He came through, and now he’s going to take the events that precipitated him into his heart attack, create a roman à clef around them, and build something magical, which he does. There’s a sort of strange and lovely honesty to it that, the first time I saw it when I was about 15/16 and it was on television, I found arresting, and it’s magic.Drowning by Numbers (1988)  92%A third film I’m going to list is Peter Greenaway’s film Drowning by Numbers. And Drowning by Numbers, a few years ago my wife and I at the Brattle Theater in Cambridge, [Massachusetts,] got to show each other films that we loved, and the one that was the hardest for the Brattle to get hold of was a cinema print of Drowning by Numbers. I really wanted to see it on a big screen again; I’d seen it on a big screen when it first came out, and in the intervening years, seen it on video, but loved it. It’s a film about games, it’s a film about numbers, it’s a film about murder, men being murdered by women, who may all be the same woman, but are, at least the way that I read it, aspects of the triple Goddess — the maiden, the mother, and the crone — but all of them are having the same relationship with men. All of them are profoundly killing off these rather abusive and appalling men in their life, and it’s a strangely beautiful and absolutely surreal film that plays by its own rules.And one of its rules is it makes you in the audience count. You start noticing numbers showing up on screen and realize they are counting to 100. So when you are at number 50 on the screen and a character is explaining to you the rules of the game, you realize that you have another 50 to go and you’re exactly halfway through. Beautiful performances and beautifully filmed, and just one of those places where, as far I am concerned I wish there was so much more cinema like that, but there doesn’t seem to be.His Girl Friday (1940)  98%No. 4, I’d go for His Girl Friday. There’s just that Howard Hawks rapid dialogue, the glory of Cary Grant [at his] most Cary Grant-ish. It’s funny. It moves, it actually has huge social responsibility, and they did a thing where they gender-swapped the lead. Hilly, in the play The Front Page and in other films made of The Front Page, is a guy going off to get married and having that be sabotaged by his editor. Howard Hawks’ twisting things, so that Rosalind Russell played Hilly and was the ex-wife of Cary Grant’s, her abusive and appalling editor who was also determined to get a story and have her get the story and have her not leave. There was brilliance in that, and it’s feisty, and it’s funny, and it’s something that I can watch over and over again and never get tired of.Beauty and The Beast (La Belle et la bête) (1946)  95%And then you get into the contentious fifth film, and I’ve jotted down a bunch of things I thought, well Ran&nbsp;is a possibility. I love Akira Kurosawa‘s take on King Lear, I love what he did to it. I love the movement, the battles. You know, there’s nothing about that film I do not enjoy. Laurel and Hardy’s&nbsp;Way Out West, because I thought that would be a wonderful choice, and it does have, to my mind, the finest dance in the whole of film. But, I thought about A Matter of Life and Death, which was a film that was enormously inspirational when making Good Omens. I felt like that was of the same DNA as the thing that we were doing … Also Bedazzled, the original Peter Cook and Dudley Moore Bedazzled, which again has a lot of the DNA of Good Omens in it.But eventually I came down on Belle et la bête, [Jean] Cocteau’s Beauty and the Beast. I remember watching it and feeling transported. For me, it’s like dreaming. It does the same that Bride of Frankenstein does, where I can never quite remember the plot when it’s over, I’m just aware that it’s finished now and this wonderful place that I went has gone away.My children do not like black-and-white films, and once, for Father’s Day, my daughters asked what I wanted for Father’s Day, and I asked, “Will you watch this film with me? It’s a foreign language film, so you won’t like it, and it’s black and white, so you won’t like it, but will you watch it with me?” They said, “Well yeah, for Father’s Day we will.” And what I loved was that after 10 minutes, they had forgotten that it was a foreign language film, and they had forgotten that it was a black-and-white film, and they were entranced by this retelling of Beauty and the Beast, made by Cocteau not even on a shoestring; he’s in post-war France, immediately post war, and they had no money for anything. Everything is being improvised. Everything is being created on the fly, and yet what they come up with is something that is so much cooler than any infinite amount of CGI.Speaking of heart attacks and artists, how’s TV development treating you? I mean you seem extraordinarily busy.Gaiman: I am, although, you know, a week from now on the 31st of May, Good Omens comes out and happens, and I get to retire as a showrunner. I guess I might have to come out of retirement if we get nominated for awards — just turn up at award dinners and things. But basically as far as I’m concerned I made this thing that I promised Terry Pratchett I would make and now I’m done. I don’t have to be a showrunner anymore. I love talking all the things that I’ve learned in the four years I’ve been making Good Omens and getting to apply them to other things and getting to help other people make things.So you know, it’s nice to be a producer of Gormenghast, for example, and I’m very actually looking forward to seeing and helping Toby Whithouse along and looking forward to Toby going out to the world with his Gormenghast. I’m looking forward to being more involved in adaptations of my own stuff coming up in the future, but I don’t really want to write them again, I don’t want to showrun again. I would really like to become a writer, and possibly even a novelist again.I hear you have some talent for that.Gaiman: As I’ve said, I will become a retired showrunner, and in my retirement, I may take up writing.(Photo by Amazon Prime)Good Omens looks like it was a blast to film. What was that experience like?Gaiman: It was a blast to film. Good Omens was fascinating because it was an incredibly long shoot. We were making Good Omens, I think we shot altogether for about 120 days, and it’s a lot like making a 6-hour-long movie. And when we finished, it was then followed by 11 months of post-production, so that was long, long days, hard work, making something huge, but also — more by luck than anything else, because it just came down to me and director Douglas MacKinnon so much of the time — we wound up making something that feels very, very handmade and feels pretty personal. We got to make personal choices, and there wasn’t anybody leaning over our shoulders saying, “No you need this. You can’t do that.”Is that one of the joys of working with a streaming company?Gaiman: I think Amazon trusted us, which was great, and the BBC who were technically our producers, nobody had ever done anything like this before, and they didn’t really know what it was, and they just left us alone to get on with it.Well, you can’t argue with the result – it’s a joy to watch your work come to life with such talented actors.Neil Gaiman: Thank you. I’m so proud of it. I made the show for Terry Pratchett, he asked me to make it before he died, and then he died. I wanted to make a show that Terry would have loved, and make a show that Terry would have laughed at, but also that contained all of the ideas and the textures of Good Omens, and I think we did it.May I ask, what is going on with The Sandman? That’s one I’ve been really looking forward to.Gaiman: Sandman has been interesting, because for the last 30 years … people have failed to make all sorts of versions of Sandman because the time was not right. In the ’90s people were going, “We don’t know how to make a $70 million R-rated film that would have any CGI in it … that doesn’t work for us,” and all of this kind of stuff. What’s great about now is we’ve reached an era in which the fact that there are well over 80 Sandman stories becomes a feature, it becomes an advantage, rather than a problem with how you cram all that into 120 minutes.So, we now have the CGI, we now have the technology, and we now have an adult audience, and we have millions upon millions of people who love Sandman&nbsp;and would love to see it. So I would be very, very surprised if we do not actually get some cool Sandman thing happening in the next two or three years. But then again, there have been many things over the years with Sandman where I’ve gone, “Ah, OK. Well, they’re going to make this. And this is going to be great then.” And it has never happened. So anything is possible.Good Omens&nbsp;debuts on Friday, May 31 on Amazon Prime.","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"VH1, chucky, Mary, books, horror, ViacomCBS, romance, of, Pop, CBS, award","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/30172331/RT_FiveFavoriteFilms_neil-gaiman_600X314.jpg","slug":"neil-gaiman-s-five-favorite-films"},{"id":"47508816166921","title":"Aldis Hodge’s Five Favorite Films","content":"Five Favorite Filmsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Aldis Hodge's Five Favorite FilmsThe Brian Banks star has a love of assassins, bridesmaids, and Iko Uwais.by Joel Meares | August 7, 2019 |  Comments(Photo by Rachel Luna/Getty Images for Film Independent)After making a big impression in a string of standout small&nbsp;roles – in films like&nbsp;Hidden Figures,&nbsp;Straight Outta Compton, and&nbsp;What Men Want – Aldis Hodge is about to have his breakout moment. Hodge plays the title character in&nbsp;Brian Banks, out this week, the true story of&nbsp;a high-school football star whose career is seemingly over before it even gets started when he is wrongly convicted of rape, but who finally gets to realize his dream when he works with the California Innocence Project to clear his name. Early reviews for the inspirational film from director Tom Shadyac are singling out Hodge’s performance as the singularly focused Banks, describing it as “career-defining” and lauding his “intensity and grit.”&nbsp;The actor is earning similar praise for his work in the upcoming&nbsp;Clemency, which debuted to rave reviews at Sundance – it is currently at 100% on the Tomatometer – and in which he plays a death-row inmate. Ahead of&nbsp;Brian Banks‘ release, Hodge shared his Five Favorite Films with Rotten Tomatoes (actually six, given an unbreakable tie!), and how his passion for writing, comedy, and martial arts (he’s been practicing various forms since he was a kid) have informed his tastes.Léon: The Professional (1994)  74%The first film would be The Professional. I think in France it’s called Léon. Natalie Portman, Gary Oldman; it was one of the first films I saw with Jean Reno and man, it just had this cool vibe and assurance. It was about this assassin with a heart of gold trying to take care of young girl he doesn’t even know – and Gary Oldman is giving this insane performance [as the villain]. [It was] the first time I discovered Gary Oldman, and I was like, “Damn, he’s like a dope actor. I’d like to be on that level one day.” Plus, it was shot in New York, and I was raised in New York and in Jersey as a young boy, up until I was 10, so that’s an element of familiarity to it. I grew up fighting, and both my parents were Marines, so I’ve always been into this element of super-spying and assassins stuff; and there were so many just cool, chilled-out moments in there where Reno was just so cool, man. He was the man. I just loved what he brought to it. I loved the whole film, and again, I loved the way Gary Oldman played this role, because he was the villain, yes, but he wasn’t any typical villain; you believe that he thought what he was doing was absolutely right. That performance was great.Crash (2004)  74%My second choice would have to be Crash, because of the way they roll the stories together. That was my first time really being exposed to that kind of writing, and then just seeing this major talent [involved]. I’m midway through the film trying to figure out how other people are connecting, my brain playing this little game of, like, who’s-who, right? I think the performances were spot on. I was young and been an actor forever — I started writing when I was 12 or 13 — so it gave me some tools to figure out how to write something in a very different, nuanced style. That counted for me.Man on Fire (2004)  38%I have got to say Man on Fire. Again, it’s another assassin movie, but Denzel…that was one of my favorite performances from him. And I think the film was shot really stylistically; I don’t know what kind of filter they had on the camera, or what they used, but it just had this really cool element to it.It’s interesting you chose Man On Fire, because there’s a relationship between a badass man who’s committing a lot of violence and this sort of younger kid, like The Professional.&nbsp;I know, The Professional&nbsp;and Man on Fire&nbsp;are quite similar, almost identical, in certain ways. But again, it’s just one of those things where the way Denzel played it, who his character was, how he was in command. You know, he knew what he was walking into and still owned the room. That, to me, was awesome. I have a lot of respect for Denzel’s work. I mean, there are definitely a whole slew of actors I would like to work with, and he is definitely somebody I would like to work with one day, just to see what there is to learn from him. Denzel is always consistent; he has a very specific style that he does. You can understand why he is who he is.The Raid: Redemption (2012)  87%The Raid. Come on, man, THE RAID! It’s insane. I’m a fighter, and I love and grew up on fighting movies. I mean, Jet Li, Donnie Yen, those are my guys; Jean Claude Van-Damme, those are my guys. But this new cat, Iko Uwais, I mean, he’s fantastic. He is a great actor, but at the same time a great martial artist. They had so many great martial artists, so many great athletes, in this film, and what I loved about it was the raw nature in which they shot it. The fight scenes were done so well we believed all of it. You know, there’s not too many high-flying wire tricks. As a fighter I can appreciate when somebody does a scene so perfectly that it looks like a tangible fight, because I know what it’s like to be in the ring with somebody. First of all, fights don’t last that long, and when people fight there’s a lot more getting beat up and weary than we see often times in film. But this one made it so cool. I said, “Wow, here’s something that teaches me how to do this in a new way, something that teaches me how to perfect the idea of action.” I think it’s one of the best action films. Hands down.Life (1999)  50%My fifth, my fifth, my fifth. That’s a hard one, man. That’s a hard one. I love Bridesmaids, I will say that. But I was also watching Life&nbsp;the other night, and Life is one of those classic joints. I don’t know if it really got the love that it deserved but Life,&nbsp;was damn good.You can do both –&nbsp;call it a tie.Yeah, if we could do a tie between Life&nbsp;and Bridesmaids, I’m good. [In Life], you’ve got Eddie [Murphy] and Martin [Lawrence] going at it, back and forth, and they’re out there – damn. The thing about&nbsp;Life&nbsp;that’s crazy is – not because I’ve been in the position, but now, having been in Clemency&nbsp;and Brian Banks&nbsp;– I was watching Life&nbsp;and I was low-key kind of sad, because I mean, wow, people really do go through this and, you know, try to laugh through the pain. It hits a little different now, but it is still really fantastic.I used to do stand up; I did stand up for a number of years. I love comedy. Bridesmaids&nbsp;was funny, and they had some slapstick funny moments that were not silly. It had caricature-y moments, but it didn’t make a mockery of who these people were. There was an element of reality to who these loud personalities were, and they harmoniously just fit together, and it was hysterical to me. There are so many things I used to quote from that movie, especially when she’s tripping on the plane, talking about sitting in first class and drinking champagne. Everyone was just on their game, and when it comes to a film like that, especially a comedy, it’s such a gamble, because every comedian has their own flavor and it’s so hard to get everyone singing the same song, harmonizing. Trying to put all these types of comedians in the same box, I think they knocked it out of the park.Joel Meares for Rotten Tomatoes: It was really interesting watching this film and then having also recently watched When They See Us, Ava DuVernay’s piece on Netflix, and seeing both projects focus on post-prison life in a way we don’t often see. Was there something in doing this film that you learned that you didn’t know about what happens people leave prison and have to navigate the systems and rules outside?Just how difficult it is in every element and every aspect. It seems like that world is working against you. Brian has a book now called What Set Me Free, and there you’ll learn a whole host of things he went through in terms of dealing with a parole officer who was not very kind to him. And him actually trying to make it; it’s like they work to put you back in prison. They don’t really have a good start, they don’t have help; they’re out, but it seems like the prison system is working as hard as it can to get them back in, cutting off any sense of the opportunity at a real life as much as possible.Before we started shooting, I had to wear an ankle monitor, the same one Brian wore, for about a month. Tom Shadyac, the director, asked me if I would be willing to just wear it without taking it off and I only took it off when we got to shooting a scene where I had to take it off. When you wear it and you’re so self-conscious, you realize this thing now is part of your identity – you have to shift how you do everything. The fact that you can’t go within a certain distance of a park — and parks are everywhere — you start noticing parks are everywhere. So that means you can’t live in certain places, you can’t even eat in certain places, you can’t be around certain people. It shifts your entire idea of what the world is. People are still in a cage when they’re on parole. Just because they’re outside, they’re not free.So you weren’t just wearing it, you were wearing it and abiding by the rules?Yeah, brother, it’s not fun. You have to charge that thing at night or else it starts beeping and will wake you up. You have to figure out how to shower with it. You do not wear shorts for anything; you wear thick socks to cover it. It was a real process. I appreciated that Tom asked me to do that because it was something to get into the mindset. It really put me in the state of mind of what it means to be self-conscious in a different way. I just did a month; Brian had to do five years.How much time did you spend with Brian, and what was your biggest take away from your time with him?We met about a month-and-a-half prior to shooting in Memphis. The moment we had a conversation, right off the bat, I started asking him about his whole training regiment, so I could get a trainer, but I was like, “Why don’t you train me yourself?” We started training together in the gym and we were basically together every single day; we were either together physically in the gym or we talked every single day until we got to Memphis. When we were in Memphis we were still together every single day, even on the days off. It was just me and him. We formed a great bond. We’re still friends today. I had a chance to meet his little son a few months ago back in New York. He gave me such a great opportunity to really execute my art and show what I can do and be effective in a different way; hopefully more effective towards a progressive conversation about change.So, he’s taught me a few things, but he’s a great guy, and the very first time we met, that was what it was about for me. Do I like this guy? Do I respect this guy? I asked him if he was still angry and bitter. He said, “Nah, the anger had its time. I let it go. I just want to be happy.” I was like, this man is elevated, so I can respect that, I can learn from that. That’s my dude right there.You’ve done this film and Clemency&nbsp;and played a D.A. in&nbsp;City on a Hill.&nbsp;What draws you to these kinds of stories – about prison and issues in the justice system? And why do you think we are seeing a number of prominent stories like this at the moment?I can’t answer why they’re getting told at the moment outside of just serendipitous timing, because Brian really started trying to pioneer this project back in 2012. I think the first script was written by 2014. We shot this film in 2017, so it’s years in the making before finally getting to a place where I think the universe was just like, “Now is the time.” You couldn’t work out the time better between When They See Us&nbsp;and this movie coming out. I think it’s the universe saying, “We really do have an issue. Let’s really focus on the conversations that need to be had, and actions that need to be taken when it comes to this.”Nothing really drove me directly to Brian Banks. He came to me and I answered. I kind of leave myself open these days; I’m trying to just not control or live in the illusion of control when it comes to what I’m doing. If something feels right, I’ll hit it and, you know, the&nbsp;Banks&nbsp;audition came across, I believed in the story, I was personally inspired, so I was like, “Please let me be an asset.” And I was lucky enough to book the job.Thumbnail image:&nbsp;Rachel Luna/Getty Images for Film Independent, Universal Pictures,&nbsp;Lions Gate,&nbsp;Twentieth Century Fox Film Corp,&nbsp;Akhirwan Nurhaidir/©Sony Pictures ClassicsBrian Banks&nbsp;is in theaters August 9, 2019.","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"movies, and, Paramount, King, biography, Tarantino","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/06132435/FFF-Aldis-Featured.jpg","slug":"aldis-hodges-five-favorite-films"},{"id":"47508817646617","title":"Karina Longworth’s Five Favorite Films","content":"Five Favorite Filmsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Karina Longworth's Five Favorite FilmsThe creator of podcast 'You Must Remember This' shares her love for five oft-forgotten Golden Age gems.by RT Staff | November 13, 2018 |  Comments(Photo by Emily Berl)Few “Best Podcast” lists fail to include You Must Remember This, Karina Longworth’s deep dive into the forgotten corners of Hollywood history. Across 134 episodes, with a handful of bonus “flashback” editions, Longworth has produced fascinating looks at the Blacklist years, the rivalry between Bette Davis and Joan Crawford, MGM’s glory days, the tragically short lives of a number of young starlets, and, most famously, the Manson murders and their relationship to Hollywood. The podcast is produced with a deliberately noir-ish tone, and has featured guest voice actors including John Mulaney and Patton Oswalt. Longworth, a writer and film critic, told Rotten Tomatoes that when she started the podcast in 2014, she had little idea it would blow up to be as big as it is today. “I had this idea in my head and I just knew that I could do every aspect of it to make it happen, and so I thought of it as a calling card that might lead to something else. Then it did become a job.”This month, with new episodes of the podcast still being produced, she releases a new book, Seduction: Sex, Lies, and Stardom in Howard Hughes’s Hollywood. Hughes is the book’s title character, but as with her podcast, it is often those who orbit the biggest names who fascinate Longworth. “I was more interested in some of the actresses he was involved with,” says Longworth. “I figured I could kind of use him as the spine of a book that’s about all these different actresses’ experiences; have it be about what their lives were like before they encountered him and how being involved with him, either professionally or personally, or both, changed their life and career.”Ahead of the book’s release on November 13, Longworth spoke about five of her favorite films from those she discovered, or rediscovered, in her research on Hughes and the people in his life.Souls for Sale (1923) The first one would be Souls For Sale, which was actually written and directed by Howard Hughes’ uncle, Rupert Hughes. It was based on a novel that Rupert Hughes wrote. He had been an author and a playwright and he had been brought to Hollywood in 1918 as sort of an effort that Samuel Goldwyn did to bring famous authors into the movies to try increase the qualities of movies.Rupert Hughes had just fallen in love with Hollywood and once it started being attacked after the scandals of the 1920s, he wanted to defend what he felt was an industry that was getting a bad rap. He wrote this novel and they made a movie out of it called Souls For Sale, and it’s about the daughter of a fire-and-brimstone preacher who escapes her brand new husband, who she has a bad feeling about, and ends up in a movie and immediately becomes a huge star. It basically tells the story of this girl encountering the movie industry, and at every moment where something sort of dirty or scandalous could happen, she actually finds that the people in Hollywood are really hard-working and upstanding citizens and are a higher quality of human than – for instance – her treacherous husband.It’s a really interesting movie. It’s definitely an artifact of its time and place – and you could say that more literally about it than many other movies because it has kind of a documentary element about it. The director really goes out of his way to show you what the studio lots looked like in 1923, and he films other directors like Charlie Chaplin working. It’s a movie that I had never heard of before as I was doing research [for the book], and I think it’s probably the earliest sort of Hollywood movie about Hollywood.Christopher Strong (1933)  80%This is Katharine Hepburn’s second movie, and it’s directed by a female director, Dorothy Arzner, who’s one of only a couple of prominent female film directors during the sound era of the 20th Century. It’s just a really interesting film about a supposedly liberated woman, and how she navigates a professional life and a personal life, and how she kind of stays trues to her ideals in a world where – while there may be rhetoric supporting the idea of a new woman – really what the world values is women being domestic.Katharine Hepburn plays basically an Amelia Earhart-type aviatrix who has never had a romance, and she ends up meeting and falling in love with a married man who has never been unfaithful to his wife, and disaster ensues. The name of the film is the name of the man that she falls in love with, but it’s definitely her story.Kitty Foyle (1940)  80%Next would be Kitty Foyle, which is the movie that Ginger Rogers won her Oscar for. She is obviously mostly remembered for a singing and dancing star from the Astaire and Rogers musicals, but this is a melodrama – there was no singing or dancing. It basically tells the story of a girl who grows up on the wrong side of the tracks and falls in love with a wealthy heir to a big Philadelphia fortune, and has to navigate romance and class and all of these different issues.It’s a very conservative film and it’s very didactic. It’s extremely problematic in a lot of ways, but I find it fascinating. The performance that she gives, though… I think a lot of times, some of these great stars, they win an Oscar for a movie that’s not their best work, or it’s sort of given as a consolation prize for them not winning for something that is a classic. I think people think that about Kitty Foyle because nobody watches it any more, and people only remember Ginger Rogers as a dancer, but her performance in this movie is stunning.The character she’s playing has to sort of take on different personas over the course of her life and with different people in her life. The way that Ginger Rogers performs those unique and distinct versions of the same person is just really incredible. Obviously, there’s a huge degree of difficulty to a career based on singing and dancing. I wrote about this in my book, but there’s that old line about Ginger Rogers that “She had to do everything Fred Astaire did, but backwards and in heels.” The whole idea of her stardom is about how much harder it is for a woman to do the same things that a man does. But all of that said, I think there’s a degree of difficulty to this performance that is the kind of thing that is really, true great acting and great stardom, but it’s the kind of thing where the labor doesn’t show, and so people don’t talk about it in that way.Where Danger Lives (1950) This is a film noir that was produced by RKO Studios while Howard Hughes was the controlling owner of it. It stars Robert Mitchum and a woman named Faith Domergue, who was Hughes’ discovery and girlfriend who he basically became involved with when she was a teenager, really, and kept promising that he was going to make her a big star – and didn’t. But this movie is the finest showcase she ever got for her unique talents, which – I don’t know that she was a great actress – but she’s really good in this film as a femme fatale who you would initially think is sort of a vulnerable victim. Then, slowly, over the course of the movie, she reveals that she’s actually running the whole show and is incredibly devious.Did you discover a number of RKO gems like this in the course of researching the book?Oh, yeah. I mean, I think that Howard Hughes definitely ran RKO Studios into the ground. There was a lot of bad press while he was running it for basically just not knowing how to make a studio succeed. But at the same time, I think with the distance of time, we can look at the output that he made or he approved the making of, [and see there is] an enormous amount of genre films that are considered sort of B-movie classics. Two of the other ones that I talk about in the book that I really like also star Robert Mitchum: His Kind Of Woman and a film called Macao. They both also star Jane Russell.Caught (1949)  100%It was was directed Max Ophuls and it stars Robert Ryan as a character who was intended to be based on Howard Hughes. Max Ophuls had been hired by Hughes’ production company, RKO, early to make the film that was actually supposed to be Faith Domergue’s big starring vehicle, and that movie just turned into a disaster. The production of it dragged along over five or six years with many different directors.After Ophuls got fired from it, he got hired to make an adaptation by another company of a novel called Wild Calendar. He told the screenwriter that he was paired with that he didn’t want to actually adapt the novel; he wanted to use the structure of the novel to make a film about how terrible he thought Howard Hughes was. They basically culled the notes of everything that they’d ever heard about Howard Hughes and Ophuls’ personal experiences, and the screenwriter, Arthur Laurents, went out and he met women who had had encounters with Hughes and then put it all together in this film which is about a shop girl who gets involved with a mysterious millionaire.The mysterious millionaire’s played by Robert Ryan, who was an actor who made a lot of different kinds of movies, and to a lot of film noir fans and B-Movie, genre film fans, he’s considered a great star, but he really looks like Howard Hughes in a lot of ways. They’re both very tall and lanky and have kind of a similar jaw. Even though Hughes knew this movie was being made – he insisted that he be sent dailies – he asked for some changes so that people wouldn’t think it’s him. The character and the performance are a lot like him. Nowadays, especially given everything we know about Howard Hughes, the similarities are impossible to ignore.Seduction: Sex, Lies, and Stardom in Howard Hughes’s Hollywood is available November 13.&nbsp;","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"movie","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/12175037/Karina-Longworth-FFF-rep.jpg","slug":"karina-longworths-five-favorite-films"},{"id":"47508817637398","title":"Gaspar Noé’s Five Favorite Films","content":"Five Favorite Filmsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Gaspar Noé's Five Favorite FilmsThe director of Irréversible, Enter the Void, and Climax loves 2001, Kenneth Anger, and Luis Buñuel.by RT Staff | March 11, 2019 |  Comments(Photo by Stephane Cardinale - Corbis/Getty Images)Ever since his 1998 debut, I Stand Alone, filmmaker Gaspar Noé has consistently courted controversy with his ambitious, adventurous, and decidedly provocative features. Whether it was the exploration of sexual violence in Irréversible, the hallucinogenic out-of-body experience of Enter the Void, or the unscripted scenes of explicit sex in Love, Noé has never shied away from subjects that more squeamish directors might avoid.Noé’s latest film, Climax, is his best-reviewed film since I Stand Alone, and it’s&nbsp;arguably his most accessible, though no less challenging. It centers on a troupe of dancers who, after an exhilirating rehearsal, succumb to the effects of LSD-laced sangria and gradually explode into hysterical, writhing fits over the course of one night. Noé shot the film in several long, virtuosic single takes punctuated by candid conversations between his cast of largely non-professional actors, and the effect is like a fever dream that transforms into a nightmare. Before the release of&nbsp;Climax, which hit theaters on March 1,&nbsp;Noé spoke to RT about his Five Favorite Films, noting that in his previous interview with us, he focused on the five films that changed his life. It’s a subtle difference, but one that yielded quite interesting results.The Mother and the Whore (La Maman et la putain) (1973)  96%It’s a movie from 1973, directed by Jean Eustache, and it’s a three hours and thirty minutes movie based on his personal life. He tried to do a documentary about his relationship with his girlfriend and his lover and how they tried to have a threesome, and he was noting everything that was going on while it was going on and he was noting the dialogue, he was taking notes.And then he decided he wanted to do a documentary of his emotional, personal life just after it happened, and it’s the best depiction on screen of dysfunctional passion that I’ve ever seen, because it’s so true, everything that he said. He put all his closest friends and ex-lovers in the movie. His wife was next to the camera where they were shooting with Bernadette Lafont playing his wife, and they shot the movie is in his girlfriend’s house.But the whole movie concept is so good, because the end the movie is really emotional. It’s all about three people who cannot manage to love each other, and drama, drama, drama. It’s so close to watching his experience in life, that how could he manage to&nbsp;do this? He was obsessed with shooting the scenes of him and his lover in the real location where he had his relations with his lover. But it was great doing a documentary about his life with actors playing his part and his girlfriend and his lover’s part, but also his ex-lovers who were playing the part. The whole concept of the movie is such a puzzle. And he was someone who was very tormented since he was young, and he ended up committing suicide some years later.But, that movie actually is very hard to find, because for rights reasons it’s kind of in the closet, but you can find it on the net sometimes. I watched one year ago, I watched it three times in a row. I’m obsessed with that movie. When people say to go to an island, which movie would you bring, I guess I would bring 2001: A Space Odyssey, The Mother and The Whore, and Un Chien Andalou. That’s an absolute masterpiece that should be rediscovered, like transferred to 4K or Blu-ray. It’s one of the biggest movies that I know that is not being released as it should nowadays.Un Chien Andalou (1929)  100%I’m obsessed with 2001: A Space Odyssey, but I’m not jealous of the director who directed it because it was so much work. I’m sure he was working 20 hours a day for five years, with the very best people he could find on this planet to create a cathedral of cinema. The movie is a cathedral itself. And also when you read about how the reception to the movie was, how much he suffered, everybody was picking on the movie besides the young audience, that you don’t envy Kubrick. You envy his talent. But if there’s one director that I really envy, it’s Buñuel.I wish I was in his head when he had shown the movie he co-directed with Salvador Dali, because it’s just a short movie, a 17-minute movie, but that still is his most famous movie after a huge career of fabulous movies. And it’s the first movie that I know that really used the language of dreams and nightmares.The opening scene of the movie, of the short film, with Bunuel cutting the eye of a woman — even if the close-up, they replaced the eye of the woman by the eye of a cow — is so shocking that I wish I could have been in the audience, if I could not be behind Bunuel. If I could see the reaction, I’m sure there’s never people turning more crazy in the history of cinema, than the first audience that that movie had.Really it was not as banned as his first feature,&nbsp;L’Age d’Or, that was more anti-religious than this one. But yeah, there’s so many documentaries about the Second World War, about the First World War, about the things that happened in the trench, but why didn’t anybody film the opening day, or that first premiere of Un Chien Andelou? I’m sure that it was a general state of shock.And the movie is so beautiful, so political, that it’s a real piece of art. There’s not many directors you can consider as artists. Of course, Kubrick’s like an architect, the most famous architect in the history of cinema, but as a poet or painter, Bunuel is an artist. Also, he was co-directing a movie with Salvador Dali, which makes sense. You can say Kennith Anger is an artist. But there are not many filmmakers that you can consider artists.2001: A Space Odyssey (1968)  92%My first memory was being in the&nbsp;movie theater — the strongest one up to this date, 60 or 48 years later. I still remember the shock of being transported into another dimension. Also, going through the gate of light like if I’d taken a huge dose of acid, like discovering other dimensions. But when you discover dimensions in a safe context as a movie theater, it looks even better.When I came out from that movie, I felt someone had injected me with something in the brain.&nbsp; I was obsessed with going to see the end of 2001. I liked the ape scenes, I like the beginning, but I just wanted to go again and again to see the movie, to go through the Stargate.And I’m happy, I met lately&nbsp;Douglas Trumbull [who did the visual effects on 2001], and we discussed Love,&nbsp;and he’s&nbsp;seen Enter the Void. For me, Douglas Trumbull&nbsp;was one of the very best partners in crime in this masterpiece, and just meeting him for me was just like discovering what was happening behind the curtain of the movie. This is the guy who like opened my mind when I was six years old.Day of Wrath (1948)  100%Day of Wrath, for me, is another kind of perfection. It’s mature themes for mature people. It’s about inquisition and war, and no wonder why, after doing that movie about inquisition during the invasion of the Nazis in Denmark, then he was recommended to move away from Denmark just to save himself and family. It’s a very cruel movie about a cruel historical time, but in which some people are put in positions that they have to behave cruel against others, and all the characters are changing.It’s very weird. Even the young girl who is very nice at the beginning, then she starts to turn to a witch, and you know that she’s going to die also, but the weak characters are touching. It’s a very complex movie in terms of the multiple faces that every human has in their life. You have the nice face when the situations are nice, and when the situations turn dramatic and there’s no way out, some people just become evil. What I like about Dreyer is he was studying movies about religion but from a very atheist approach.&nbsp;His movies are about the inside of humankind.It’s such a perfect movie. There are some movies that you see and you go, “Oh, I wish the music was different,” or “I wish the actor was funny,” but there are the movies that you watch over and over and see that there’s not one single frame to change. They’re perfect.Inauguration of the Pleasure Dome (1954) The other one that I did not talk about at the time, that’s also among the movies that I can replay over and over because it supports me, is The Inauguration of the Pleasure Dome by Kenneth Anger that he shot after trying LSD with Aldous Huxley&nbsp;in Paris. It’s the first, and one of the most&nbsp;psychotic movies ever, and it’s just a movie that puts you&nbsp;in a different state of mind. The movie itself is like a drug&nbsp;to the viewer, and it’s not narrative.&nbsp;And there’s not many movies that&nbsp;are trips, shamanic trips;&nbsp;this is an absolute shamanic trip from beginning to end.Ryan Fujitani for Rotten Tomatoes: I read that Climax is loosely based on something that actually happened.Gaspar Noé:&nbsp;Yeah, it’s an open adaptation. I was working on two other&nbsp;scripts based on true stories, and the moment you decide to make a movie about a true story you need to have the permission of the families.&nbsp;Also you can guess when you weren’t in a situation and you see it from the outside or a newspaper, it’s reduced to a situation in which people die or something.The whole movie happened quickly, although my line producer was obsessed with the story and I remember that story at the time. The movie was kind of improvised around what we had in mind for the story. So we said, like in the opening of the pitch, we can do a movie about a cult, you can do a movie about a war, you can do a movie about a couple of artists who committed suicide in their house, and you don’t know what happened. Then you can invent a story out of that couple of artists who committed suicide in the mountain. But, it’s an open adaptation.And certainly the dancers were not as good as the ones that were in the movie. I mixed the story with the dancers that I wanted to film, so you will certainly know this type of dancing.RT: Were you always interested in exploring the dance/musical format at some point?Noé: No, I did once&nbsp;a music video with filmed dancing that I really enjoyed shooting, but I had never shot choreography even two weeks before shooting. I never even thought I would work with a choreographer, hopefully secure Nina McNeely, who’s a genius, and the casting, and what she created with them. I discovered on the third day of shooting, I had the crane, and then I started playing with the crane as Nina was playing with the dancers and the dancers were playing with the other dances. That particular scene is certainly the most corrective scene I’ve ever shot, because I thought I was more like a documentary&nbsp;director shooting something that I instigated but I was not responsible for. It’s like&nbsp;being the captain of a football team — you’re inside the team, but there are eleven players trying to win. So you can shout, but dancing didn’t come from my mind. In my mind I said, “Well, I want to do the choreography,” and I found my favorite dancers around Paris. If someone has to be congratulated it’s more them and Nina than me.RT: The film’s themes are open for interpretation, though it’s easy to imagine some people will simply take the central message to be an anti-drug warning, and I don’t think that’s your intention.Noé:&nbsp;It’s like, no, some people are for abortion, some people are against abortion. Drugs are everywhere, even coffee, and even wines. The movie’s not pro or against the use of chemicals. What I know is that there are situations that are portrayed in movies that exist in real life, and I like watching serious movies that would warn you about&nbsp;things that happened during wartime or in a hippie basement, but it’s like everything. Alcohol — I like alcohol. It’s very good when you take one glass of wine, two glass of wine,&nbsp;and then a third one and fourth, and the energy is going up and up, and everything that is constructive and funny can suddenly turn totally destructive. I’ve been in situations in which there were no drugs involved, in which a happy party turns into hell. Some people can handle alcohol, some people can not. Some people can handle small amounts of plants or chemicals, and the alternate. The movie’s not a cautionary tale. Drama exists in your life even without substances.Climax&nbsp;is currently in theaters.Like this?

Anderson, and explains why movies like theirs are so rare.by Ryan Fujitani | October 22, 2018 |  Comments(Photo by Marc Piasecki/Getty Images)When Melanie Laurent joined Quentin Tarantino’s Inglourious Basterds in 2009, she was already a celebrated actress in her native France, where she began her big screen career more than a decade prior. She earned widespread acclaim for her role in that film as vengeful cinema owner Shosanna Dreyfus, and she later went on to star in other Hollywood projects like Beginners and Now You See Me, even as she continued to work in France.In 2011, Laurent proved acting wasn’t her only talent when she decided to jump behind the camera to co-write and direct her first feature, The Adopted, which she then followed with 2014’s Breathe. Last week, she made her English language directorial debut with Galveston, a crime drama starring Ben Foster as a betrayed hitman and Elle Fanning as the young woman he inadvertently rescues. Laurent took some time out of her busy schedule to speak with RT about her Five Favorite Films, expressing her admiration for Tarantino and P.T. Anderson and explaining why films like theirs are so rare.Donkey Skin (Peau d'âne) (1971)  89%I would say&nbsp;Peau d’âne, by Jacques Demy, a French musical with Catherine Deneuve,&nbsp;because I fell in love with Catherine Deneuve. I was so impressed. I think that, because I watched her being a princess in that movie, that I wanted to be an actress. She was so amazing, and I love Jacques Demy movies. It’s like a real beautiful fairy tale and, I just watch that movie again and again.Roman Holiday (1953)  97%I would say, Vacances romaines. I don’t know the English title. With Audrey Hepburn. Roman Holiday?&nbsp;I was not at all a baby girl who just wanted to be a princess, at all, but the fact is, in my movie choices, I was really obsessed with those beautiful and strong and funny and fragile women. [laughs]&nbsp;I was not wearing any princess dress or things like this, but in movies, I was very into it.Pulp Fiction (1994)  92%I would say Pulp Fiction, for sure.&nbsp;When you are a teenager, I would say, “What the hell is going on? If making movies looks like this, OK, I want to be a director.”&nbsp;Everything was kind of perfect; there was the humor. That’s why I was not just honored and happy to work with [Quentin Tarantino], but crazy happy. [laughs]&nbsp;When he told me he was doing the movie, I was dancing&nbsp;in the streets in Paris for hours. I had a sense of joy, for sure.&nbsp;So I would say Pulp Fiction, for everything we just love in that movie, like the dialogue, the shots, the lights, the actors, the craziness, the freedom of making something so freeing.Boogie Nights (1997)  93%Then,&nbsp;Boogie Nights by P.T. Anderson. I loved it, kind of like for the same reason, and also because I’m very impressed by the fact you can make an artsy movie, but also a commercial one, and a popular one. It’s so rare.&nbsp;It’s just the most difficult thing to do, and they both did that. It’s a big inspiration for me because art films and small, independent movies are so hard to exist right now, and I think it’s very hard as a director today to feel like, can I do something free? Can I do something beautiful? Can I do something also funny but also act strong, say something about the world, but also not doing something too popular, and with some cliché subject. I feel like it’s very tricky right now to give money for a director who’s gonna have different ideas and want to do something special. So, I would say those movies, because also we need to talk about that problem right now of making small movies&nbsp;that don’t&nbsp;really exist any more, and are suffocated by those big other ones. It’s kind of scary right now.Melancholia (2011)  80%To pick one last one, I would say… That’s hard, because I have many in my mind right now. I loved&nbsp;Melancholia, but I also loved Room.&nbsp;They’re very&nbsp;different. I would say those two movies, but for many different reasons. So if I have to keep one, well, let’s keep Melancholia. That was a shock because visually&nbsp;it was so interesting, but also I will always remember that first shot, my entire life. That big limousine was stuck and then it’s like, two persons, and you know it’s never going to work and that was that. Amazing cleverness in that shot. And also, talking about the fears and talking about depression and talking about how do you deal with that big world which is too big for you.&nbsp;But also a movie that’s very free. I’m just realizing I’m keeping movies that are very free. Don’t ask me my five favorite songs, please. [laughs]Ryan Fujitani for Rotten Tomatoes: I’ve enjoyed your work as an actress, and I’ve enjoyed your work as a writer and director as well. I’m wondering which of those you enjoy the most, and which of those would you prefer to have the longest, most fruitful career in.Melanie Laurent: Well, now I have the perfect balance, because writing a script takes a long time, and I can write scripts while I’m shooting as an actress because actors wait for hours on set. And this is my favorite thing, ideas coming up on set,&nbsp;and [having a place where I can]&nbsp;escape from a set. I just like to be in my mind. And, being a director is my passion, for sure, but when I’m not working as an actress, I’m missing it, and I’m not really happy.Also, for specific reasons, any time I’m an actress I’m just learning from a director, so much. And observing amazing directors obviously is the best cinema school, so I’m always so happy to do it. I’m not playing the fact, “I’m a director, I know exactly what you’re going through.” I’m just an actress, except that I know how they feel, and I’m just maybe more empathetic to them when it’s complicated because I know what’s going on here. So, I would say if I can keep those two things always, that would be a dream.Galveston&nbsp;opened in limited release&nbsp;on Friday, October 19.","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"scary, One, CBS, TCA, BET, Classic, prank, cults, Awards","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/22112152/Melanie-Laurent-FFF-Rep.jpg","slug":"melanie-laurents-five-favorite-films"},{"id":"47508817661981","title":"Rowan Atkinson’s Five Favorite Films","content":"Five Favorite Filmsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Rowan Atkinson's Five Favorite FilmsThe iconic star of Mr. Bean and this week's Johnny English Strikes Again turns it up to 11 with classic comedy choices and talks Bean vs. English.by Ryan Fujitani | October 25, 2018 |  Comments(Photo by Angela Weiss/Getty Images)For almost three decades, Rowan Atkinson has delighted audiences as Mr. Bean, an oblivious, accident-prone, mostly mute man-child who bumbles through everyday activities in hilarious fashion. But while he’s amassed a sizable fanbase of viewers who grew up watching Mr. Bean’s wacky antics, Atkinson had already established his comedy chops in celebrated British series Blackadder, and he went on to lend his talents to beloved projects ranging from Four Weddings and a Funeral and The Lion King to Rat Race and Love, Actually.In the meantime, Atkinson successfully introduced another popular character in 2003, a similarly clueless British spy named Johnny English who first came to life in a series of TV advertisements in 1992. This week, Johnny English makes his third trip to the cinemas in Johnny English Strikes Again, in which the 007 stand-in is called out of retirement to contend with a new global threat — and a digital world too complex for his analogue lifestyle. RT chatted with Atkinson to talk about the inspiration behind his characters, which one he enjoys playing more, and whether we might see Mr. Bean again. But first, here are Rowan Atkinson’s Five Favorite Films.This Is Spinal Tap (1984)  95%I’ll start with This is Spinal Tap.&nbsp;It sort of took an American perspective to show the characters and the attitudes surrounding British rock bands in the 1970s and 1980s, which, I guess, was what it was supposed to be, and I just thought the characters drawn were so excellent. And yet, it was odd, because everyone involved was American. You’d think it’d be just the kind of thing that some British writers or comedians could’ve done better, but clearly we didn’t. And I thought Christopher Guest, et al., did it fantastically well.It’s just always a kind of reassuringly funny film. The best comedy is watching humans interact, and people with their own petty ambitions, and self delusions, and all that sort of stuff. And that movie is absolutely brim full of it. If they say that comedy is essentially exaggerated truth, that was almost the perfect exemplar of it, where it’s almost a documentary. Well, it is obviously a mockumentary, but you don’t have to exaggerate much for it to become inherently comic. So that’s kind of what it is. It’s a perfect exaggeration, but exaggerated not very much.I’ve always wondered what a British person thought of that American portrayal of them.I’m a British person. I think it’s fantastic, and the accents are very good indeed. They may not be absolutely perfect, but it just shows that so much about accent is not necessarily about the detail vowel sound. It’s about the attitude. It’s the way of talking as much as the accent, if you see what I mean. It’s sort of wonderfully, sort of slovenly, sort of self conscious cool, which they did so well.The Apartment (1960)  93%The Apartment, Jack Lemmon movie. That is a great movie. Again, it’s watching humans trying to live their lives, but beautifully done. Billy Wilder generally, I’m a great admirer of his work. Some Like it Hot is perhaps the more obvious choice, but there’s a kind of extra wackiness to Some Like it Hot, which I like less. But The Apartment is a fairly proper, serious movie, but with some wonderful social observations and ironies. And of course, it’s just a fabulous performance from Jack Lemmon, one of my very favorite performers.Being There (1979)  95%Peter Sellers movies, I would have to have in on him. I’m tempted by Being There. Again, one of his more serious things, but a beautifully attenuated performance I thought he did in that. I haven’t seen the movie for a long time. I’m always nervous about saying, “Oh, that was a brilliant movie,” if you haven’t seen them for 15 years or 20 years, because you may go back to them now and think, “Oh, ah, well actually, it’s not great.” Or at least, “It’s got those great bits that I remember, but there’s a lot of stuff in between that is very unimpressive.”But I seem to remember the only thing that really spoiled it — and it was very much the fashion at the time — was the sort of bloopers edit over the end credits. And I thought that movie in particular did not suit and did not need shots of Peter Sellers cracking up. But obviously the producers or the distributors said, “Look, it’s a Peter Sellers movie and it hasn’t got a lot of laughs in it. Can we just stick something silly in the end?” And that is what they did, and it didn’t completely ruin the film, but it came very, very close, in my opinion.Toy Story (1995)  100%I think Toy Story would be one of my favorites, the first one.&nbsp;A beautifully observed thing. Really, really strong characters. It was the definitive family comedy movie. A close second would be The Incredibles. Haven’t seen the second Incredibles, but the first one was great. Again, it’s just very good, funny characters, well done.Mr. Hulot's Holiday (Les Vacances de Monsieur Hulot) (1954)  100%I’d have to include Mr. Hulot’s Holiday, a Jacques Tati movie, which I remember watching at my school when I was 17, and it was such a revelation for me as a movie, as a sort of a comedy tone and attitude which I’d never seen. Almost purely visual, for a start; no words. And like most people, in terms of comedy movies, I’d been brought up on British and American comedy movies, which tend to be fast moving, and they tend to be very verbal, with the exception of the Pink Panthers, actually. Of course, I could veer off into that in terms of the Peter Sellers…But it just had a fabulous comic tone and comic attitude which I’d never seen before, which is basically where you just sit back and watch people behaving in a slightly exaggerated way. And, again, if comedy is exaggerated truth, there it was again. It was the pace of it, the slow pace of it. That’s what was such an eye-opener for me, and taught me one thing, really, which is that comedy is not about pace. It’s about rhythm. Rhythm is what’s important, and the rhythm can be surprisingly slow and still funny. And even if you know the joke’s coming, even if you can hear the joke trundling just the other side of the horizon, and you know it’s going to come over the horizon, you can enjoy it as much as if it’s a surprise. And that was the insight that I feel I got from that.This was one of the inspirations for Mr. Bean, then?Oh, very much. Yes, absolutely. Absolutely, sorry, yes, I should’ve added that. I mean, that was the most important thing about it, at least in retrospect, because it undoubtedly told me that you could tell jokes without words, and tell a story without words — even more difficult. Although, Mr. Bean is a far less pleasant character than Monsieur Hulot. Monsieur Hulot is a very affable, generous minded individual, which Mr. Bean isn’t; he’s foul or a self-serving anarchist. So, yeah, that was very important part of it.Ryan Fujitani for Rotten Tomatoes:&nbsp;Mr. Bean and Johnny English are both cut from a similar cloth, though they’re still different in distinct ways. Which of the two characters would you say you enjoy doing more?Rowan Atkinson:&nbsp;I think I enjoy Mr. Bean a bit more, just because he’s a bit more out of the social norms. I mean, both of them, I think, are very selfish, self-serving individuals. Neither of them really care about anybody else apart from themselves, and their lack of emotional relationships, at least as depicted, is probably indicative of that.Yeah, Mr. Bean is a purer, sort of odder guy. Johnny English is not, I don’t think, particularly a nice man, but at least he is less of a child. I think, in many ways, Mr. Bean is a nine-year-old trapped in a man’s body, and Johnny English is a sort of 15-year-old trapped in a man’s body. So, in other words, neither are particularly mature in their view of life, and emotionally disconnected. So that’s probably the way I would distinguish the two.RT: Is one of them more challenging for you than the other?Atkinson:&nbsp;Well, Mr. Bean is more challenging in a way, because you really are, by and large, telling stories entirely visually. You sort of yearn to be able to speak more sometimes, but physically, they both tend to move around in a silly way, and are quite physical. But, yeah, Mr. Bean is probably the more taxing, but also the more satisfying.RT: You’ve done two&nbsp;Mr. Bean films and now three&nbsp;Johnny English films, and I know you’ve deliberately spaced them out so as not to overexpose the characters. Even though&nbsp;Mr. Bean’s Holiday served as a great swan song for the character, is there any chance we might see him on the big screen a third time as well?Atkinson:&nbsp;Well, there’s not no chance, but there’s very little chance, I would say. I’m a great believer. I was once in a movie called Never Say Never Again, and I think that’s a good maxim. In fact, that title came from Sean Connery’s wife when he was tempted back to play James Bond again, and she said, “Well, why not say Never Say Never Again,” which, of course, Sean Connery had said a number of times that he would never play James Bond again, and sure enough, there he was.So, yeah, I’m not going to say that I’ll never play Mr. Bean again, but I just think it’s unlikely. I want sort of doing “Old Bean.” I thought that’d be quite an interesting idea, where you deliberately depict him as an 80-year-old, and just see how he’s getting on later in life.RT: So we might have to wait a couple decades for that, then.Atkinson: Yeah, yeah. Well, it’s not that far away.Johnny English Strikes Again&nbsp;opens on Friday, October 26.","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"anime, Yoda, stand-up, Adult, facebook, on, killer, Films, Sematary, TCA, dceu","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/25135807/Rowan-Atkinson-FFF-Rep.jpg","slug":"rowan-atkinsons-five-favorite-films"},{"id":"47508819304481","title":"Nicholas Sparks’ Five Favorite Films","content":"Five Favorite Filmsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Nicholas Sparks' Five Favorite FilmsThe best-selling author of The Notebook expresses his affection for Clint Eastwood, Pixar, and of course, a classic romance.by RT Staff | October 18, 2018 |  Comments(Photo by Cindy Ord/Getty Images)It’s one thing to be a best-selling novelist, but it’s another to be a best-selling novelist whose books also easily translate into successful films. Nicholas Sparks has achieved both since he published his first novel, The Notebook, in 1996. While his two follow-up books, 1998’s Message in a Bottle and 1999’s A Walk to Remember, were adapted for the big screen first, it was the 2004 feature adaptation of that first novel that established him as pop culture’s foremost purveyor of romantic drama. The Notebook helped launch the careers of then up-and-coming actors Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams, and it remains a cultural touchstone for thousands of fans.This week saw the release of Sparks’ 20th novel, Every Breath, a romance about a chance encounter between two strangers in North Carolina that forces them to reexamine their lives and make some difficult decisions. He took some time out of his schedule to speak with Rotten Tomatoes about his Five Favorite Films, a couple of which might surprise those familiar with his work.Jaws (1975)  98%Let’s go with&nbsp;Jaws. I saw&nbsp;Jaws when I was about… I must have been nine years old. Of&nbsp;course, at the time it was the most terrifying film I’d ever seen. It kept me awake for days. It kept me afraid of the ocean for a while. It had me afraid of lakes in Nebraska, in case there were sharks there. I was nine years old.But there are so many amazing things about that, on a historical level. That was the very first film that opened nationwide on the same day. As far as I know, prior to that, they would roll out films big cities to smaller ones, coast to coast. But this opened worldwide, which ushered in the era of the blockbuster. So it was groundbreaking in that regard, and of course, that is something that defines the entire movie industry today.The interesting thing is that, 43 years later, the film holds up exceptionally well. The characters feel as fresh and original as they did so long ago. So well directed. The history of the making of the film and how challenging it was for Spielberg, and the broken shark and all of this, and all of the changes he had to make — none of those challenges are reflected in the quality of the film.&nbsp;So to me, that’s a fabulous, fabulous film.Forrest Gump (1994)  71%Forrest Gump.&nbsp;What I appreciated about that — I believe it ended up winning the best picture and an Academy Award for Tom Hanks, both of which were well deserved — but I just loved the interplay of putting him back into actual historical footage of meeting the presidents, and at the time it was so much fun to see that play out on screen. It captured entire eras and major issues, everything from racism in the south to the horror of the Vietnam War — the protests of the Vietnam War — to AIDS toward the end. And, of course, the theme, which is right up my alley, which is, “Hey, it’s about a guy who loves a girl forever.” [laughs] That’s a little bit like The Notebook in this regard. And yet, it was done in a way that I never would have considered doing. I believe it was Robert Zemeckis who directed that. It’s phenomenal.Unforgiven (1992)  96%Let’s go with&nbsp;Unforgiven. Again, I believe that was an Academy Award winner.&nbsp;A&nbsp;number of things were so fantastic about that film. The Western genre had died — it had gone away by that time — and here comes Clint Eastwood, who was known for Spaghetti Westerns, which were of course Westerns often with Italian directors, or whatever the reason they call it that. And whether those were good or bad, they defined an era of filmmaking, a certain type of movie that came out three or four times a year, and then they vanished. And then in walks this guy who’d done that era and was a major star, a major, major star, and I believe he directed Unforgiven.&nbsp;How entirely different from any other Western we’ve ever seen. And you care for this guy who spends the entire film telling people he’s changed. He’s not the guy he once was. And then, just when you care about this character, you realize he’s the same guy he always was. When push comes to shove. It was a bit of a surprising ending. And yet, to me, resonates to the overall quality of the film. And it’s one that stays with me.Toy Story (1995)  100%We’re going to go with number four, Toy Story. Of course, the first computer animated film. Wildly original in concept, in creation, in everything about it. And it is a kids movie that resonated with adults because you cover things like betrayal or jealousy, all set within this small, childlike world. It had me in stitches toward the end as they’re trying to catch the moving van and faces are blowing, and it all goes bad, and they light the rocket with Buzz’s helmet. They worked together to get back to Andy, get back to the box. And there was just something magical about that as a kids movie that felt entirely fresh at the time. And of course Pixar is… Have they ever done anything that’s not exceptional? Not that I know of, but this was the first. and we like to talk about computer animation, which was incredible and groundbreaking at the time, but if you look at the dialogue and the performances… Again, it’s Tom Hanks and Tim Allen, and all of the other characters. It was magical.Dirty Dancing (1987)  69%Finally, we’re going to go with a film that is so culturally relevant that as soon as I say it you’ll be able to quote at least one line from it. We’re going to go with Dirty Dancing. Because, come on, nobody puts Baby in a corner, right? Of course it’s been acted out, it’s been referenced in numerous films. It was in Crazy, Stupid, Love. This is the move that Ryan Gosling does to get the girls, right? And he and Emma Stone reenact this scene. So, you want to talk about a film that just had an amazing soundtrack, the performances were great, and it speaks to the confusion of teenagers growing up, but not in a, I feel like, a “loner” teenager way. There’s been a lot of teenage films where they feel like a loner. This is someone who liked her family, and she was a little irritated with her older sister as siblings tend to be, but she liked her dad and her mom, and when push came to shove at various points, she ran to her dad to help. There was something striking about how all of that worked together in a film that just made you feel good and want to dance and want to take someone to see, and then, how many years later, that film still holds up. And if you don’t believe me, go watch it. It still works.Nicholas Sparks’ new novel, Every Breath, is available in stores this week.","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"History, worst, Spectrum, Biopics, Acorn, song, and","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/18103851/Nicholas-Sparks-FFF-rep.jpg","slug":"nicholas-sparks-five-favorite-films"},{"id":"47508819317796","title":"Judy Greer’s Five Favorite Films","content":"Five Favorite Filmsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Judy Greer's Five Favorite FilmsThe Arrested Development and Ant-Man co-star got help from Jason Reitman and Mitch Hurwitz on her directorial debut, and had \"so much fun\" on the set of Halloween.by Ryan Fujitani | September 21, 2018 |  Comments(Photo by Noam Galai/Getty Images)Accomplished character actor Judy Greer‘s filmography is, fittingly enough, best summed up by the title of her 2014 autobiography: I Don’t Know What You Know Me From: Confessions of a Co-Star. You may recall her as the recipient of an amazing makeover in Jawbreaker, as the timid, lonely office girl from What Women Want, or in the recurring role as George Sr.’s awkward, unhinged assistant Kitty Sanchez in Arrested Development, all early in her career. That was before she moved on to stealing scenes in sitcoms like Modern Family and It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia and landing supporting roles in movies like The Descendants, 2013’s Carrie, and franchises as big as Planet of the Apes, Jurassic World, and the Ant-Man movies. Later this year, Greer will even appear alongside Jamie Lee Curtis as Laurie Strode’s daughter in Halloween.This week, however, marks another milestone for Greer, as she makes her directorial debut with A Happening of Monumental Proportions. It’s an ensemble comedy of intersecting stories that take place over the course of an elementary school’s Career Day, with an impressive cast that includes Common, Allison Janney, Jennifer Garner, John Cho, Kumail Nanjiani, Bradley Whitford, Katie Holmes, and Rob Riggle, just to name a few. She spoke with RT and offered up her Five Favorite Films, then talked about why she could never direct herself, explained how helpful Jason Reitman and Mitch Hurwitz were to her, and even gave us a taste of what it was like on the set of Halloween.Tootsie (1982)  90%I think my favorite movie ever in the world might be Tootsie.&nbsp;I love that movie. It’s just got everything. I mean, I guess it doesn’t have murder, but you know what I mean. Like, for me, it’s so smart, it’s so dry, it’s so f—ing funny.&nbsp;And the performances — every single role is so good, and so important. And it made me fall in love with the idea of New York City, and it made me fall in love with actors and what they do. I thought it was so funny when I saw it the first time, but you know, now I’m a real live actor. As I was studying acting and stuff, and started to relate to it on that level, I think it’s a great show about actors without being about the business, because it’s about an actor wanting to be an artist, and he learns how to use the business to make art. And then there’s Bill Murray,&nbsp;who could fart and just be the greatest. Everything, everything about that movie just tickles me to no end.Moonstruck (1987)  94%I also love the movie&nbsp;Moonstruck.&nbsp;I just think, again, it’s so brilliantly performed. I think Moonstruck and Tootsie are perfect movies. Like, I can’t find a flaw in them, and I’ve watched them countless times. I just think that they are perfect films. And in Moonstruck, what they’re dealing with is death, and loneliness, and loving the wrong person, and a family tie, and infidelity. And yet, it’s the most charming, uplifting, happy movie.I mean, the soundtrack, the score. There’s a makeover in it. I mean, come on, I love a makeover. And again, you have New York, you have Brooklyn, you have this wonderful city. You have this culture of this Italian family. It’s just wonderful. And Nicolas Cage gives the most insane performance I’ve ever seen.&nbsp;When he is screaming about his hand in the bakery, I’m like, “What is that? Who does it that way?” Nobody would do that.&nbsp;Only Nicolas Cage would just scream at the top of his lungs, like, “I lost my hand! I lost my bride!” I marvel at the balls, and that performance just wrecked me.&nbsp;Then her, of course, smacking him — we’ll never forget it.When Harry Met Sally (1989)  91%I love&nbsp;When Harry Met Sally. Every girl actress is like, “I’m looking for my Annie Hall.” But I’ve always looked for my Sally. That’s been my favorite.&nbsp;I prefer it, I have to say. I just think, again, it’s dry, it’s funny, the characters are layered and interesting. All the supporting characters in that film have great moments and great roles, and you remember every single one of them. It always makes me laugh, and I feel like it’s timeless. And&nbsp;who doesn’t fantasize about falling in love with their best friend? Isn’t that the whole point?&nbsp;And I loved all the intertwining stories of the old people, and their little stories of how they met and fell in love. What a great idea; it’s so cool. And, of course, Nora Ephron’s the best. And that famous scene where she has the fake orgasm — I mean, the balls of that performance. Just great, it’s really great.It’s also kind of grown-up. I remember watching it when I was younger, thinking, “God I hope I’m like them.” Now I’m so much older than they are. [laughs] But they all were moving to New York City to try to make it in Manhattan,&nbsp;so there was that element to it that I loved. And then the settling in, and realizing that life is different than you thought it would be.&nbsp;I just think it’s a perfect romantic comedy, and it is different than the usual formula, because you do have these sort of interstitial moments that are so funny, with these couples describing how they met and fell and love.The Big Lebowski (1998)  83%I would say The Big Lebowski, because I’ve always felt like John Goodman should have gotten an Oscar for his performance in that movie. He’s perfect and brilliant. And it’s so weird and so funny, and takes all these turns. And we got to meet Phillip Seymour Hoffman and be like, “Brandt? Who the f— is that guy? He’s hilarious.” So, thanks for that, Coen brothers. It’s so weird. It’s so hard to make a movie with such extreme characters and keep it tonally so grounded.&nbsp;I don’t feel like it’s ever over the top, but all the performances are over the top, but it’s just so perfectly directed.&nbsp;Plus it makes me laugh, always, even though I’ve seen it so many times. God, really, I just love it. I think there’s something in it for everyone.Singles (1992)  79%I think I’m going to go with Singles, and it’s because of a very specific time in my life. Soundtrack is really important to me, and I’m a child of ’90s grunge. That movie was Seattle, Nirvana, Pearl Jam — it’s the greatest soundtrack. My favorite band was Smashing Pumpkins and my favorite song by Smashing Pumpkins is “Drown,” and that’s on there.&nbsp;Plus, I loved all the different storylines being woven together. I love Cameron Crowe, and the idea of these people living in Seattle and looking for love.I was a senior in high school when it came out. I mean, I saw it in the theater like three times. I was like, “Oh my God, this is gonna be my life. I’m gonna move out of my parents’ house, and I’m gonna go and try to make it in the city somewhere, and it’s gonna be like this.”&nbsp;And, you know, Bridget Fonda as Janet was just the greatest character. I was like, “I’m gonna be like her. I am kind of like her. But not the pathetic parts of her, the great parts of her.” But everyone was just was trying to find themselves, find love, find a career, find a path, find their life.&nbsp;It was really aspirational for me at the time that it came out, so it really scratches that itch that I had then, and it will always be that meaningful to me.I recently made my husband watch it. I&nbsp;can’t remember if he had seen it or if he just didn’t remember it, but I just could tell, even though he loved it and appreciated it, like, it didn’t kill him the way it killed me. And you know, he was like, “Yeah, no, it’s good. I like it.”&nbsp;But he is obsessed with Almost Famous, and I love&nbsp;Almost Famous, but that was more meaningful for him. Singles is just… the movie, the music, the time, the look, the actors, the wardrobe, the backdrop of Seattle. Just all of it.Ryan Fujitani for Rotten Tomatoes: So I understand it was your manager who really pushed for you to make the jump behind the camera and move into directing. What was it about this project that made you think, “You know what? This is the one I’m going to direct?”Judy Greer: Well, I loved the script. I mean, I have to give up a year of my life to direct a movie, and not make any money doing it, and it has to be something… My manager has always said this, and he still does: If you’re not dying to tell this story, it’s not worth it. And&nbsp;he doesn’t even mean financially; he means heart and soul. It’s such an undertaking to direct independent movies, so, in that sense, it has to really be something I can’t not do.That was how I felt when I read this script, finally. I had read several, and a lot of the ones that came to me wanted me to also play roles in them, and I really didn’t want to do that. I did not want to have to direct myself. I didn’t want to have to be directing other actors but then also being like, “Yeah, but I nailed that scene, so we can move on.” I just felt so weird about it. And I’ve worked with people who’ve done it, and they do it well, and it doesn’t bother me. I just couldn’t do it. I couldn’t look at Common and say, “Can you do it again, but like, this time do it like this?” I feel like&nbsp;I would have had to tell myself my direction out loud so he could hear it.Also,&nbsp;the second answer is that I got people way more famous and cool than me to be in my movie, so it was great, because I didn’t even have to. I was like, “Worst case scenario, I could play these five roles.&nbsp;But, I don’t know, if Allison Janney’s going to do it, then why would I ever?” So they made it easy for me. I’m legit impressed by people who can, but I couldn’t.RT: You’ve also said that you’re drawn to stories that take place in “normal” office settings and things like that, because you’ve never quite had a job like that. What’s the trick to making something that’s ostensibly normal and familiar to most audiences into something that’s special and engaging, but also still relatable, if that makes sense?Greer: No, I think I know what you mean. Yeah, I think what you’re saying is, how do you not make it boring? Well, I don’t know, maybe you’re not. But Office Space, maybe if I could list a top 10 list, would maybe be on it. I loved that movie, and I was so intrigued, because I’ve always been fascinated with a schedule. Like, I’ve never had a schedule. It’s always different and changing, and I’m in different places, and I’m doing different things. I think the grass is always greener, a little bit, with having a regular job and a regular life, where I thought, “Oh, you can actually plan a vacation and take it? That would be cool. My husband would love that.”But I just thought it was cool to see the ins and outs of that world, and I hoped I made it interesting and fascinating. What I really wanted to do was, I have this fantasy about showing how these big buildings, they’re these big businesses and cubicles, and you have to walk so far to just get anything done. You have to walk so far to just go to the bathroom and to get a cup of coffee. And if you’re running to someone’s office, basically it’s like half your day is just walking around these buildings. It’s just my fantasy of what it’s like. Some of my friends have said, “No, no one has that much space.” But I’m like, “I don’t know. In my world, they do, and that’s the story I want to tell.” Direct your own movies! But yeah, I was always intrigued by it.RT: If it’s any consolation, a lot of my day is actually very much like that, so you kind of nailed it for me, anyway.Greer: Oh, I’m sorry? [laughs]RT:&nbsp;You’ve been part of some really big franchises, and you’ve worked with a lot of amazing people, both in front of and behind the camera. Specifically with regard to directors, is there one in particular who especially inspired your own approach, or from whom you felt like you learned a significant deal?Greer: Well, I learned a lot from Jason Reitman, because he is my friend and he was nice enough to go to lunch with me before I directed my movie, and sat down with me at Hugo’s for like two hours, where I had a notebook and a pen, and he told me things, and I wrote as much as I could down. He was really inspiring in that way. Plus, I love working with him. I love the way he directs, and I love his movies and the stories he chooses to tell. I have so much respect for him. I also got so much help from,&nbsp;obviously Paul Weitz, who’s an executive producer of my movie. He was someone who was a total mentor. But kind of outside the process, I should say, it was Jason Reitman, who didn’t have to ever do anything or sit down with me.Paul was great. I mean, Paul helped me all along the way, because he was a part of the process from the very beginning, and we started by just going over the script together. Then we talked about casting. Then we talked about crew to hire. Then we talked about edit, and what I should do on set. I’ve sort of taken him for granted because he’s a producer on the movie, and haven’t really spoken as much about him as I should have. But definitely him. Definitely him.And also, towards the end in the editing process, you know who I feel like I couldn’t have finished the movie without was Mitch Hurwitz. You know, he’s just always been there for me, throughout my career, when I’ve needed help or advice. With this, you know, we got to a point in the editing room where we were like, “I don’t know what else to do. And there are some things that need to be fixed.” And I sent him a link, and he watched it and gave me the greatest notes. It was really just something that was so above and beyond.&nbsp;I just wanted a new, fresh pair of eyes, someone who, I thought, was clearly a comedic genius. But the thing about Mitch that I don’t know if&nbsp;people all know is what a giant heart he has. You know, my movie ended up, I think, having a lot of heart to it. I had plenty of jokes — a lot of jokes had to end up being cut — but I wanted to make sure I was telling the right story, too. So Mitch was a real asset.RT: Speaking of jokes,&nbsp;you’ve proven how reliably funny you are in the past, and now you’re directing this kind of quirky comedy. What do you think about possibly directing in other genres? Maybe drama, or horror?Greer: Definitely, horror would be dope. That would be so fun, and I would never have said that until working with David Gordon Green on Halloween. I had so much fun on set. We had the best time. And again, that could just be him, because he just wants to have fun and laugh. He always says, “I just want to party,” and he doesn’t mean drink. He wants to just have fun all the time. Like, “Let’s party, let’s party! We have to party!” It’s so fun. He’s like, “Oh Judy, wouldn’t it be cool if you did this? What if you did that?” It was so fun. And after doing that, I thought, “Oh my God, this is a horror movie? I want to direct a horror movie. That would be cool.”I would also say that working with Peyton Reed on Ant-Man was so cool, because… Again, Paul [Rudd] is just hilarious, and he’s never not funny. But to make that kind of genre movie, and make it as fun and funny as I think Ant-Man, both of them, turned out to be, seems really fun, too. As far as drama’s concerned, I just don’t know. I love acting in dramas, and I love watching dramas, but I get nervous because I feel like I have a tendency to — you’ll never believe this, maybe — but I can go to pretty dark places, and I would be nervous about tone. Tone is so important. I’m so constantly feeling heartbroken by humanity, and especially now. But I’m never going to say no. I read all kinds of scripts.RT: You mentioned Halloween, and I feel like I can’t not ask about it…Greer: Dude…RT: Without spoiling anything, is there something like a passing of the torch going on?Greer: I don’t know, man. I don’t know what I’m even allowed to say. Let me just say that if I could do these movies with Jamie Lee Curtis and Andi Matichak, if we could make these movies, this gang of, as Jamie Lee Curtis calls us, three tall women… It was so fun. I hope we get the opportunity to go back to Haddonfield, because it was… It was major. And I feel like Jamie Lee’s love and ownership — and I don’t mean it literally — of this franchise is such an inspiration. I love how seriously she and David took the telling of this story. And while it was so fun and wonderful to do, it was, I felt, such important work to get right. For the fans, you know? It’s all about the people who love it. And people love Halloween.A Happening of Monumental Proportions&nbsp;opens in limited release on Friday, September 21.","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"Television, 2017, Black, Walking","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/21155715/Judy-Greer-FFF-Rep.jpg","slug":"judy-greers-five-favorite-films"},{"id":"47508820895795","title":"Tommy Wiseau’s Five Favorite Films","content":"Five Favorite Filmsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Tommy Wiseau's Five Favorite Filmsby Ryan Fujitani | December 7, 2017 |  Comments(Photo by Michael Kovac/Getty Images)If, like us, you’ve spent any time around film nerds and cult movie buffs in the past decade and a half, you’ve likely heard about a little gem known as The Room. A true independent film in almost every sense, the romantic drama was the passion project of a single man, Tommy Wiseau, who wrote, directed, financed, and starred in the film.Aside from a number of, let’s say, unusual directorial choices, The Room also features a collection of largely inexperienced actors, perplexing green screen usage, dangling plot points, and a curious obsession with American football. It’s also a supremely earnest creation, which is part of the reason why it’s earned such a feverish following and spawned regular midnight screenings across the country.As it happens, both James Franco and Seth Rogen count themselves among The Room‘s fans, and they recently joined forces to adapt The Disaster Artist, a memoir about the making of the film written by one of its co-stars, Greg Sestero. With the Certified Fresh&nbsp;The Disaster Artist expanding into wide release this week, we spoke to Wiseau about his Five Favorite Films, what it was like to see Franco’s portrayal of him on the big screen, and what the legacy of The Room means to him.Citizen Kane (1941)  99%The first one will be&nbsp;Citizen Kane. Orson Welles.Giant (1956)  93%The second will be&nbsp;Giant with James Dean.Sonny (2002)  23%You’d be surprised but, again, I put in parentheses, I’m not here to praise James [Franco]. Okay?&nbsp;But the reason I support his role, because we didn’t have a choice at the time. We picked him because originally… I don’t know if you knew the story here that The Disaster Artist is based on the great storybook Disaster Artist, right?&nbsp;And he basically optioned the book, optioned to produce the movie. But people ask me who are supposed to… Who would I like? Who’s supposed to play me?&nbsp;I don’t know if you heard about it, but long story short, I say Johnny Depp.But we had a conversation with James, and with Greg [Sestero]. And Greg, long story short, he said, “What about James?” I said, “Yeah, he’s good, because I like his movie Sonny.” Sonny is the movie directed by Nicolas Cage. I don’t know if you’re familiar with it or not. It’s about gigolo in New Orleans, Louisiana, etc.So we had a conversation with James, and&nbsp;Greg says, “Sure, whatever. James playing you.” I said, “That’s good idea, because he did the movie Sonny, and which, I like it.”&nbsp;And for some reason, the critics think differently, or public, whatever.&nbsp;But this is relate to my life as well, The Room, basically. Because you have all the flavors. So that’s basically your little quirky backstory.Casablanca (1942)  99%Casablanca.&nbsp;You see, Casablanca remind me what we have within The Room, some of the phrases.&nbsp;For example, I say, “Oh, you make my day,” or, “You are tearing me apart,” or whatever. I’m talking about the other movie as well, just paraphrasing some of those phrases.&nbsp;You see, The Room, people never give us credit, okay?&nbsp;And now everything turn around because people now, and especially the critic, which can be very tough as you probably… Including your company.But, again, let me explain something here. Hopefully you guys print this.&nbsp;Please don’t misquote me, but it’s nothing wrong to criticize anyone, included film, play, whatever.&nbsp;But it is wrong when people started doing not just a critique but get into sort of hatred mode. You know what I’m saying?&nbsp;So I think it’s very important to understand the structure what I present, related to The Room now, I presented 14 years ago, based on my vision, which people did not expect it, this kind of vision, because it was, basically, it was different cookie cutter from Hollywood. I said this many times, but as you know, I’ve been ignored but fans embrace that.A Streetcar Named Desire (1951)  98%A Streetcar Named Desire&nbsp;with Marlon Brando.&nbsp;I just want to put there. All these movies that I’ve listed, including&nbsp;Casablanca, you have flavors, which I like it. Drama. Comedy. And again, we may argue back and forth about what is drama, what is a comedy, right?&nbsp;What is melodrama?&nbsp;The Room&nbsp;never&nbsp;did&nbsp;melodrama.The thing what&nbsp;I listed all the movies, they’re not melodrama, they are relate to real life. Streetcar Named Desire, for example, you have, my understanding was, the time the movie was made, the main characters, Brando and… He actually raped the girl.&nbsp;And they cut this on the movie. That’s my understanding, that it was part of the script.&nbsp;So this is again saying that Streetcar Named Desire give us some evidence that people were still cautious what we present in the big screen that certain ideas or situation between two people, you cannot do it.Today’s society, as you know, we go extra miles. The Room is perfect example. We show the nudity, we show the certain stuff, because I myself, I was struggling as a filmmaker, as a director, how I present the scene.&nbsp;Same, you see, if you look at Casablanca, a relationship between two main characters, how they, you see… I love it, black and white movies. Sometimes you can educate yourself that you don’t have to physically show it, sexuality, but it’s there because you can feel it.Now, just because of our culture, I decided to say, “Hey, we go extra miles.” And I was struggling with this. You see,&nbsp;I had talked to Greg. I don’t know if he remembered but I said, “Hey, okay, is it Johnny naked or not?” I said — and I was so frustrated — and I say, “Hell with everything because I don’t know how… I want to be real as much&nbsp;I can.”Even though people say… Remember,&nbsp;The Room, and is again, The Room is supposed to be play.&nbsp;People forget that; they are short-handed. [laughs]&nbsp;I don’t want to be too negative, but that’s the history of The Room. So I will say, originally I was supposed to… I wanted to put into play, but it didn’t come out right. Actually it come out better because more people can see it. That’s basically what happen.Ryan Fujitani for Rotten Tomatoes: My understanding is that the South by Southwest premiere of The Disaster Artist was the first time you saw the movie.Tommy Wiseau: That’s correct.RT:&nbsp;As you sat there and watched it, what was your initial gut response to it? What was the first thought you had?Wiseau: I just breathe very heavily. As you know, they talked to me after the show, “Did you like it?” They don’t understand that — again, you may write this —&nbsp;that it’s a setback in my relationship with myself in the sense what I saw. And it shocked me because, actually, I approve 99 percent. Not just as a person named Tommy Wiseau — I approve because he did good job. I’ll be honest with you.It was very emotional for me.&nbsp;You see, even now it’s very emotional, as you see in my voice.&nbsp;You can feel it — I don’t know if you can feel it or not.&nbsp;But it was emotional. It still is, because he tackled something what, as I mentioned, relate to Casablanca and others. It just too bad he didn’t go forward with some of the emotional feelings, which we tackle, especially at the end of the movie, the time when Greg says, the character, he say, I’m paraphrasing, “Everything is fine. They’re laughing because they love your movie.”RT: Speaking of&nbsp;the end of the movie, I read that in the original ending, you and Greg parted ways on bad terms, but then James Franco saw that you guys were still close,&nbsp;so he changed the film to end on a more positive note. Is that true?Wiseau:&nbsp;We never did. They did good job because we never… We always been friends, even though, as you know, he wrote the book and I support not&nbsp;as I supposed to support. I don’t even put the numbers now because everybody quoting me later.&nbsp;But it is what it is. I think Greg and me and others, we even sometimes trapped in Hollywood dilemma and situation what we feel that is right to say something stop and it’s too late to turn around.But you can always correct, you know? I mean, as you know, I did the movie with Greg, Best F(r)iends.&nbsp;And also I’m working on the sitcom The Neighbors, the season two.&nbsp;So we’ve been very successful in past 14 years. Some of the stuff, it’s coming to my way in a sense as a director and actor. So I like it.RT:&nbsp;You succeeded in making a film and continuing to&nbsp;work on projects completely outside the Hollywood system, and you did it all your way. With your experiences, what piece of advice would you give to aspiring filmmakers who are trying to get their own movies made?Wiseau:&nbsp;I would say the same thing what one of the biggest directors said to me, and I don’t want to name the name, but it’s the biggest of the biggest. He’s still alive.&nbsp;Just keep going. They say keep going. And I will add something else. All negative, let them go. So don’t get involved negativeness, because film industry is very complex field, in the sense that you need a passion. If you don’t have a passion, try not to steal&nbsp;other projects. As you probably noticed, perfect example is The Room. You can see on YouTube and other platform, people just steal stuff from The Room, including actors.I’m going to mention one of the scene from&nbsp;The Disaster Artist. One of the scene, you may watch, the time when you see it, is my character — I mean James playing me — he confront the crew, the actors, and say, “Hey, I know what you say about me.”&nbsp;And then, guess what? This is what exactly happened, 100 percent.&nbsp;And I was very frustrated, but in the beginning I was making fun of them because I say, “Haha.” You know, it’s like little kids. I say, “I got you. I know what you talk about me,” you know?&nbsp;And I never said this for 14 years. Can you imagine that one?And since they released this movie, I say it now very openly, because, still today, some of my actors — I’m not mention the name — they still that negative. For example, they say, “Oh, script did not exist. This is happened by accident.”&nbsp;They have no clue about industry whatsoever. And so we can go on and write a book about it, all this stuff, but watch the scene. It’s very good scene.And one&nbsp;other thing with another advice I can give to filmmakers that, the main thing, think positive, and also have respect for others. And that’s the thing what we all lack of in the industry. As you know,&nbsp;current affairs, etc. And so if you have respect for your… Because of some of the area, when you do your art, is collective work.&nbsp;So I myself, people don’t understand, I have assistants, four or five assistant. People say, “Well, how many assistant do you have?” I say to myself, “Hey, I can use two more.”&nbsp;And all this people are extremely important. In this case, Greg, because he was keep going and he&nbsp;didn’t badmouth me — that’s the good news — except in the book. [laughs]But on the end, everything turned out the way I think it’s supposed to be. I don’t know what the formula is, but to be a good filmmaker&nbsp;[you have to] have respect for others. And have a vision, you know? Like I always say, if you don’t have a vision, you cannot be a director, as well actors.So, basically, all this advice what I mentioned — passion, respect for others, and have vision — it make you good filmmaker. That’s my take. That’s my advice. Pretty long advice. [laughs]RT: Thanks for your time, Tommy. Really appreciate it.Wiseau:&nbsp;We’ll see you at the screening of&nbsp;The Room.&nbsp;And I want to say to all the fans of The Room, have fun with The Room. And I always say, you can laugh, you can cry, you can express yourself. Please don’t hurt each other. Thank you.RT:&nbsp;Thank you, Tommy.Wiseau:&nbsp;Don’t misquote me.RT: Oh, don’t worry. We never do.Wiseau:&nbsp;[laughs]&nbsp;I know you guys. I’m just teasing.The Disaster Artist&nbsp;is Certified Fresh and expands into wide release this Friday, December 8.

It was the first in a trilogy of hilarious, wildly clever comedies steeped in pop culture geekery dubbed the Three Flavours Cornetto, and it rightly earned the trio a wider cult following.Since then, of course, Pegg has branched out and found work in a variety of genres, including the blockbuster series mentioned above, but he likes to keep busy with smaller projects in the meantime. This week, for example, he stars opposite&nbsp;Margot Robbie in&nbsp;Terminal, a stylized crime thriller that interweaves a number of&nbsp;connected stories.We should note that Simon Pegg has done a Five Favorite Films with us before, and as we began chatting with him about it this time, he admitted that “there are films which have staked their claim in my affection forever. The ones that stay with me and remain my kind of go-to cinematic events, I would imagine, stay the same.” Read on for Simon Pegg’s updated list of Five Favorite Films!Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope (1977)  92%I’d go with the first Star Wars&nbsp;just because that was the source of it all, even though Empire&nbsp;is essentially a slightly more grown-up, often seen as the better film. But I think Star Wars, really as the kind of ground zero, has to be the one. A New Hope, as we’re now supposed to call it after all this sequel bulls—.Taxi Driver (1976)  96%Also, I would say probably Taxi Driver, just as a piece of acting and just fabulous scene-setting brilliance from Scorsese and characterization from De Niro. That’s one of those films I just watch in awe of all of it, because it’s just so uncompromising.I saw Avengers&nbsp;yesterday, and it was such a fun romp and really entertaining and decently done. That’s the kind of film adults watch today, when in the 1970s, when&nbsp;Taxi Driver&nbsp;came out, that was the kind of film that adults would watch. That and French Connection&nbsp;and Godfather&nbsp;and Bonnie and Clyde. Anything pre-Star Wars, really. The preserve of grown-up cinema in those days were genuinely grown-up movies, and that goes for everything I’m doing as well, from Star Trek&nbsp;to Ready Player One&nbsp;or even Mission: Impossible. They’re pure entertainment rather than think pieces, which is what film cinema used to be in the mainstream.Why do you think that’s happened?Because of&nbsp;Star Wars.&nbsp;Star Wars&nbsp;happened and spectacle was thrust to the front of the priority list for filmmakers, and as such, we started to change our tastes more toward fantasy and stuff that required big special effects set pieces, and as such, that muscled its way to the front of our affections, I guess. For better or for worse, you know, that’s cinema now.Ex Machina (2015)  92%As a piece of modern cinema, I would love to mention Alex Garland’s Ex Machina, which I thought was a brilliant, brilliant film. I think in a year that saw Oscar Isaac and Domhnall Gleeson have another science fiction film out as well, it was such a great reminder of how smaller, more thoughtful, more intense, grown-up… It’s an example of the combination of those things, in a way, a kind of more science fiction in the vein of 2001, a more cerebral, literally cerebral kind of science fiction film that was and just how beautifully performed it is. Alicia Vikander is amazing in that film. It’s a film that I’ve watched many times because I just, I don’t seem to tire of it. I think it’s excellent.It’s a terrific film. Have you had a chance to see&nbsp;Annihilation?I have, yeah, and I thought it was brilliant, kind of everything that everyone seems to be asking for right now. It’s like, people keep saying we should have more diversity, and there should be more original ideas, and there should be more women in positions and roles where they get to have more power and strength. It was all those things, and yet it didn’t seem to get marketed that well. Not enough people saw it. It was great. It was a really, really smart movie. I love Alex Garland. I think he’s got such great ideas, and he pulls great performances from his actors. I really liked it. Ex Machina&nbsp;— I would probably go with that one just because I’ve known it for longer, so I’m more acquainted with it. I have a greater affection for it because I’ve seen it more.Annie Hall (1977)  96%Let me try and think of a comedy. At university, I wrote about Annie Hall. I know Woody Allen is currently a contentious issue, but that film as a comedy, if we can separate the art from the person for whatever reason, is such a clever, poetic film, but it’s written in the same way that a poem is… When you read a piece of prose, it’s very formal and everything follows one after the other. It’s very conventional. Poetry is different because it draws attention to itself as writing, and it rhymes and does different things, and it uses rhythm. Annie Hall&nbsp;in the same way does that cinematically. It’s kind of like a cinematic poem, and it’s just really, really smartly made. It’s one of the few comedies that ever got nominated or actually won any Oscars.Comedy, I think, is one of the most underrated art forms that there is, particularly in terms of material rewards. There is no Oscar for best comedy. There is no Oscar for best comic performance. I think that’s a shame, and I think if there was, then Jim Carrey would be laden down with scones. It’s not something everybody can do. You might dismiss Ace Ventura: Pet Detective&nbsp;as a ridiculous, goofy, throwaway movie, but it is a virtuoso performance from Jim Carrey, as often is with his work. You see a lot of so-called straight actors, serious actors, trying to do comedy, and they cannot do it. I think comedy is something which is underestimated because it is literally not serious. It’s like people think that seriousness equals serious, if you know what I mean.But Annie Hall, I think, it’s such a well-crafted film. It says a lot. Diane Keaton is just unbelievable in that movie. I got to meet her at CinemaCon. She was there promoting Book Club, and I said to the people I was with at CinemaCon, I said, “I have to meet Diane Keaton. Please, can you introduce me to her? I just need to tell her how much I love her. I won’t bother her too much.” I found a moment and I went over and I just told her I had written a thesis about her at university. She said, “Oh, I’d love to read that.” And I said, “No, you wouldn’t. It’s boring and dense.” But she was delightful. For her performance alone, that film, as controversial as it might be, would definitely be on my list.Ace Ventura - When Nature Calls (1995)  25%All right. I’ll tell you what I’m going to do. I’ll pick something completely weird and ridiculous for the very reason that I just said, and that would be Ace Ventura: When Nature Calls, specifically for the scene in which Jim Carrey births himself from the anus of a fake rhino, because it is one of the single most genius pieces of comedic writing that will never be given its due because it’s part of a ridiculous, vaguely racist, silly comedy.The setup for that whole sequence is incredible from the point you see him. He’s inside this rhino, which he’s using as a sort of eavesdropping device, and it’s so meticulously done. There’s a fan inside because it’s hot. The fan breaks, so he has to undress. All to get to this point where he literally squeezes his way out of the behind of this rhino in front of a family of tourists who just effectively see a rhino giving birth to a screaming, naked human being.The industry involved in setting that joke up, the way that it just creeps up on you, like you’ll think, “Oh, it’s funny because he’s inside a rhino. It’s funny because it’s hot. It’s funny because he’s taking off his underwear.” And then suddenly, you realize, “Oh, wait a minute, this was a long game they were playing here. This is a buildup.” And it snuck up on you. And suddenly he starts to, as only he can, emerge from the back of this rhino, and then this family pulls up, and it’s just brilliant. I think that sequence should be celebrated in no uncertain terms because it is just a genius piece of comedy executed with the extraordinary aplomb that that man is capable of displaying.I can’t disagree with you, because I remember the exact day I saw that with a buddy of mine, and we both fell off the couch laughing at that specific scene.It’s unbelievable. It’s extraordinary.&nbsp;I watched it again. I watched it with my daughter. We went through some… I try to show her lots of movies that she might not see, because she’s only eight. So without having a movie lover for a dad, she’d never see even the Amblin movies or Bill and Ted, stuff like that she might miss out on. The Ace Ventura films were on that list, and watching it again, oh my god, I was apoplectic. I was literally lying on the floor screaming with laughter. The commitment. I mean, he has the most… Nobody commits to stuff like he does. I believe that he might be a genius.Ryan Fujitani for Rotten Tomatoes:&nbsp;So I’m here talking to you because of&nbsp;Terminal. I haven’t seen the film, but it looks like a twisty tale with a lot of interlocking storylines. What can you tell me about the film and your role in it?Simon Pegg: I took it on because I was sent the script by essentially what were a group of assistant directors who had been working on various films in the UK who had decided to say, “Actually, we are producers, and we’re going to make a feature film.” We have Margot attached, which is great, which gives it some momentum. But there’s also this script, which is a really dense, almost theatrical kind of dialogue piece, which I really liked the idea of doing.I’ve done a lot of stuff where I’ve been essentially running around saving the universe or delivering exposition or whatever my British accent is required to do. I felt like I really wanted to do something that was a bit more chewy and a bit more involved, in terms of the acting. When I read it, it was just a lot of me sitting in a café with Margot’s character just talking about death. It felt like a play. It felt like a kind of a Pinter or something, and I was like, this is great.I also just loved the fact that it was a fresh idea. It was an original script, and it was made by a bunch of people who just wanted to make a movie. That really appealed to me in terms of how I started out. I never want to lose touch with that kind of filmmaking. It’s important. It’s so fun being in big films. It’s a real thrill ride. But I don’t want to untether myself from the beginnings of what I love doing, which was smaller movies.It’s very dialogue-led. It’s very character-led, particularly with my character, Bill, who’s a terminally ill English professor, who is deciding whether or not to just kill himself. It just felt like, “Wow, this is going to be a chance to actually do some acting.” Also to act alongside Margot, who is fantastic — you know, already set the world on fire with The Wolf of Wall Street&nbsp;— seemed like an exciting person to spar with. I just thought this is going to be great. I get to go to Budapest and get that feel of making a small movie, which is a lot more hard and fast than it is making a big film. There’s less room to wiggle. There’s less waste. There’s less relying on post-production. You just have to get it done. It feels like everyone is in it together. It’s like a little battle you’re fighting. I like doing that.RT:&nbsp;Knowing you’re something of a geek culture junkie, I’m wondering, between the&nbsp;Mission: Impossible franchise and&nbsp;the&nbsp;Star Trek franchise, which of them was more exciting for you to land?Pegg: That’s an interesting question. I think maybe for the sheer significance to me as a person, Star Trek&nbsp;was a big deal because the Mission: Impossible&nbsp;series was a little bit before my time. But the chance to work with Tom Cruise and Ving Rhames and J.J. was obviously a big deal. Now, I couldn’t really distinguish between them in terms of my affection. Although, having said that, having written Star Trek: Beyond&nbsp;and been that close to it, having actually gotten to generate some of the universe, I have a special affection for Star Trek. Probably Star Trek&nbsp;just because of its… It was a show that I watched from the age of eight, and then suddenly to be in it was kind of crazy. I think by the time I got Mission: Impossible, Mission: Impossible&nbsp;was a movie series. It wasn’t the TV show writ large anymore. It was such a joy to get back with the gang to do Fallout&nbsp;and have our new folks come in as well. It was great.RT:&nbsp;What were your first thoughts when you learned about Quentin Tarantino’s involvement in the Star Trek universe?Pegg: We were all like, “Wow, that’s great.” I mean, I can’t think of…&nbsp; All of Quentin’s movies, I could have put in those five films, you know? He’s such a dynamic filmmaker. He has such commitment and passion to cinema. I know he’s a huge Star Trek&nbsp;fan because we’d spoken about it in the past. He really likes our crew. He likes the new iteration of the original series crew. It was cool. They don’t tell us anything because they know we get put in this situation all the time, and we blab because we’re all just big mouths. So they don’t actually give us anything that we could possibly say. All I can tell you is that the prospect of him being involved is extremely exciting. I’d be very happy about it.RT: I saw you were attached to a project with Nick Frost called Slaughterhouse Rulez.&nbsp;Have you spoken to Edgar Wright about potentially all of you reuniting again for another project at some point in the future?Pegg: We always talk about it. Edgar is like family to me. We’ve been friends for a very long time. It’s not like he’s just my colleague. We see each other whenever we can, and we always talk about it when we get together. The only thing that holds it up is finding a moment when we’re all simultaneously free, because we’ve all got commitments leading up to a certain point. But yeah, it will happen. There’s no doubt in my mind. Edgar is working on something at the moment. I have a few things coming up. As soon as we get a nice big bit of free space, that’s what we will do.Terminal&nbsp;opens in limited release&nbsp;this Friday, May 11.

The last decade has seen John Cho shed his goofy teen comedy stylings – has it really been seven years since Harold and Kumar were on our big screens? – to forge two striking career paths: One as a key part of a mega mainstream franchise in the Star Trek movies, the other as a lead in some of the most interesting breakout indie films of recent years. If you haven’t seen him in 2017’s moving and visually singular Columbus, you really should.This month he runs straight through the middle of those two paths with Searching, a missing-child thriller full of mainstream pleasures – big twists, edge-of-your-seat suspense – told with indie innovation: The movie takes place entirely on screens, with FaceTime conversations, YouTube clips, Venmo accounts, and Google search bars somehow coming miraculously together to propel the story forward. None of it would work without a performance like Cho’s, who plays the father of the missing girl with a mix of determination and woundedness that never lets you forget the human story at the center of the technical wizardry.Ahead of Searching’s release, Cho spoke with Rotten Tomatoes about his Five Favorite Films, which themselves mix very real emotion with innovative storytelling. He stressed that there were “25 I could have picked from,” but settled –&nbsp;at least on the day we spoke&nbsp;– for the five films below.Sideways (2004)  97%I hadn’t seen Sideways in a number of years, and recently saw it again, and sat down with it and was overwhelmed at how much more meaningful it had become in the years since I had seen it. I don’t know why –&nbsp;I guess it’s just really cheesy: Like wine, it had aged for me. (I’d take that out, that was so cheesy!). But it had matured for me as a story, or perhaps I had grownup to meet the story – it was so lyrical and so authentic in every moment. Stories about failure, to me, are more meaningful as I get older.That movie also swings big, and that’s another thing that I like about it. That monologue, Virginia Madsen’s monologue… it’s just achingly romantic. [And] the end, where he drives up, sort of mirroring The Graduate, but it’s Dustin Hoffman, the loser version, which is way closer to me than the heroic version in The Graduate. [The movie] just keeps curving into itself, and out of itself, and it’s just an incredibly satisfying, enjoyable, meditative movie.It’s got some incredible performances – everyone is a delight, everyone is just incredibly fun, and each scene has something interesting happening in it. [Sandra Oh] was another inspired bit of casting. Her mother, and the kid, and she’s amazing, and the motorcycle helmet rage was one of the most terrifying things I’ve seen on film – and a flopping penis, that’s always good.The Big Lebowski (1998)  83%The Big Lebowski is like a bowl of noodles I could eat every single day, and it would be endlessly emitting new flavors. It’s just incredible. There is like an academic reading of Big Lebowski that you could go about on forever…this polemic about war, maybe specifically World War II, and then it’s like this commentary on Hollywood, like a spoof. Then, it’s just a great weed movie. And then the performances are just ridiculous. Jeff Bridges is doing, I mean, Olivier level acting.It’s ridiculous that there’s a monologue in the limousine… he comes out of the limo that Maude sent him, and then another driver immediately – ­which is just the most hilarious visual, just going from one limo to another limo. Then, he gets in there holding his White Russian, and then has to explain himself, and he stammers, and each thought is so clear, but leads nowhere.There are no scenes that aren’t fun. Also, I don’t understand the movie, which is kind of a great feeling to have. I don’t fully understand the plot, and I’ve seen it 100 times. It’s a very unique movie in the sense that I don’t know what’s going on every time I see it.GoodFellas (1990)  96%That’s sort of the oldest movie I still love, meaning a movie from my youth that I still can’t get enough of. It’s just so exciting, and – this is gonna sound douchey – there’s more propulsion to that movie than any movie that’s ever been made, it feels like. It’s just so fast. It’s like a car accelerating, and it just never stops accelerating. I mean, think about the beginning sequence of that movie: It’s so fun, and it ends with the coke sequence. I can’t imagine a movie that just keeps going that hard. It’s tremendous.Obviously, [there’s] such a performance from Pesci. I am deathly afraid of this small man. And Bracco: She’s amazing. That to me is another thing – I love portrayals of weird marriages. I feel like Husbands and Wives is my favorite Woody Allen movie. [Goodfellas] is a perverse love story at the end of the day, and I love it.Pulp Fiction (1994)  92%It was such an important part of my youth. I think more than any other movie, it changed my idea of what movies were. I wasn’t an actor then, but Pulp Fiction sort of…How do I put it? It was what, as a young actor, [showed me] this is what we’re trying to do. We’re trying to be this vital. We’re trying to be this fun. We’re trying to break the rules this much. I think it changed American independent filmmaking.For me, it was Travolta [who stood out]. I don’t know why. When I think of Pulp Fiction, the image I think about most is him getting blown away while reading Modesty Blaise on the can. Of all the images in Pulp Fiction, that’s the one that sticks in my head the most. We spent this whole movie falling in love with him, dancing with Uma Thurman, and accidentally blowing a guy’s head off. There’s so much going on, and then he meets his demise while reading a book while taking a shit, and there’s so much pathos in that image.Lost In Translation (2003)  95%Bill Murray, Scarlett Johansson. I was secretly thrilled that Sofia Coppola, who was panned for Godfather III, made such a triumphant movie so – it was so cool. I think it’s the single coolest movie I’ve ever seen. I haven’t revisited it in a long time, it just meant a lot to me at the time.Partially, I think it’s like I identified very strongly with the idea of being a stranger. I could talk to my therapist for a long time about this, but for me, it was like an Asian-American movie, because the idea of being a stranger in Asia was, to me, more of an Asian-American experience than it was a white American experience. That portrayal felt very inside baseball to me, and I identified very strongly with it.Perhaps it really is psychologically a commentary on me feeling Asian in white America, but I identified with that situation in a very personal way. It always meant more to me than I think the film should have, but I really have a lot of affection for it. I should revisit it, and I wonder if it’ll remain on my list, but I suspect it would.Have you Googled around to find out what is said at the end, or all of the theories?&nbsp;There’s a French movie called La Belle Noiseuse. The movie is about the abusive relationship between a painter and his muse, and model. It’s a four-hour movie with a cigarette intermission, and they battle through the whole movie. He’s trying to make this painting that he was commissioned to make, and you never see what he’s painting, and at the end of the movie he delivers the painting to his patron, and it’s a beautiful painting, but then the filmmaker reveals that he has the real painting bricked up behind a wall, because the truth is that terrible, and you should not see the truth.&nbsp;","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"2017, Comics, Walking, awards","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/14152558/John-Cho-FFF.jpg","slug":"john-chos-five-favorite-films"},{"id":"47508819333165","title":"Ethan Hawke’s Five Favorite Films","content":"Five Favorite Filmsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Ethan Hawke's Five Favorite FilmsThe First Reformed star on Jack Nicholson, Gena Rowlands, and watching Commando dozens of times.by Alex Vo | May 14, 2018 |  Comments(Photo by Dave Kotinsky/Getty Images)For Ethan Hawke, one particularly productive decade yields: A 100% Certified Fresh documentary debut (Seymour: An Introduction), a full embrace of steady genre work (The Purge, Sinister), and a Best Picture nod alongside longtime pal Richard Linklater (Boyhood).But look at the year before this past decade: 2007, when Hawke was directed by Sidney Lumet in Before the Devil Knows You’re Dead. It’d take until now before Hawke worked with another bona fide, old guard legend: Paul Schrader, who directs Hawke in the dramatic thriller First Reformed. Schrader wrote Taxi Driver and has directed nearly two dozen films since, and now he directs Hawke as a minister deep in secret despair, as a parishoner (Amanda Seyfried) asks him to counsel her radical enviromentalist husband, setting them on a course towards redemptive fire and brimstone.Hawke on working with Schrader: “You feel this wisdom gained from a life lived after a massive amount of experience, and a mind that is still open and curious and wild. It makes you excited about getting old because the possibility is there that you could actually become wise. It’s like being around to watch a lion roar.”Throughout our chat on Schrader and First Reformed (out this Friday) and his Five Favorite Films (see below), I mentioned Rotten Tomatoes editors were currently in the middle of compiling 140 Essential ’90s Movies, and that three of his were on the short list: Before Sunrise, Reality Bites, and Gattaca. I ask: If he could choose only one…?It’s impossible to answer, Hawke responds, while revealing he autographs more memorabilia for those three than any other movies he’s done. Then he offers an observation: “The Before Sunrise fans are the most passionate and literary, the Reality Bites fans are the loudest and funniest, and Gattaca fans are the quietest and most sincere.”As we wait for someone to turn that last bit into an internet personality quiz (“Which ’90s Ethan Hawke Movie Fan Are YOU?”), he goes in on his Five Favorite Films.Reds (1981)  89%Warren Beatty directed, about the life of John Reed. Jack Nicholson is Eugene O’Neill, one of his greatest performances. It combines everything I love about movies: great acting, unbelievable romance, and politics. Sondheim did the music, Elaine May helped write it.It’s kind of the bar. I just think of what cinema can accomplish. It’s like a great, great novel, only better. And with one of the great endings of all time. Just so beautiful.One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (1975)  94%I’ll continue the Jack Nicholson theme and go to One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest. Of its era, the great American novel. R.P. McMurphy is probably the defining Jack Nicholson character, if you had to pick one. It’s actually the first film I ever saw. I don’t remember it, but I was a little baby and my mom took me. It’s one of those movies I’ll watch whenever I’m feeling lost or alone in the universe. Something about McMurphy and the Chief throwing the sink through the window makes life worth living.[Director] Milos Forman was a really incredible storyteller. He knew how to tell a big story where the characters feel… Part of it has to do with the level of supporting acting. He creates a full world. Christopher Lloyd and Danny DeVito and Louise Fletcher and Brad Dourif — it’s just such an incredible cast. The world feels so real. That’s what so many epic movies get wrong. They feel important in the way that it’s in italics. They just feel like they’re about the director, and not about the characters.The Bridge on the River Kwai (1957)  95%Today, I’m gonna have to go with The Bridge On the River Kwai. You see that movie on the big screen and Alec Guinness is so proud of his bridge, then he drops this little stick he carries with him the whole time into the water and you start…I think for a guy my age, you start to realize there’s something very profound about the movie, about how we all get so self-important about what our lives are. But really all any of us are doing is building sand castles. There’s something much bigger at work in the universe than anything any one of us can do alone.A Woman Under the Influence (1975)  90%The truth is, it’s the “five” part [in Five Favorite Films] that’s a joke, you know? I probably have a good 100 favorite movies of all time. I mean, like, my brain is rifling. Am I really not gonna include A Woman Under the Influence? Am I really not gonna include Nashville? Am I really not gonna include Synecdoche, New York? I could do my five favorite films with terrible cinematography. I could do my five favorite films about love affairs.You could pick A Woman Under the Influence.Okay, I will. I will. I’ll do A Woman Under the Influence.Gena Rowlands. This is one of my favorite performances of all time. It’s exciting watching a husband and wife [Rowlands and John Cassavettes] work together. There’s something at its core that’s just rock and roll. The birth of true American independent cinema.Apocalypse Now Redux (2001)  93%I think I’d be lying if I didn’t say Apocalypse Now. It’s like Godfather, Citizen Kane. Those are the kind of ones that get thrown away all the time. But if you go to a real proper movie theater, I even love… I’ll pick Apocalypse Now Redux. If you see that last release version up on a big screen, you crank up the music, that is a life-changing experience.Afterwards, the conversation ambled towards Commando, the 1986 Schwarzenegger classic in which Arnie depopulates an island of mercenaries in a tableau of bullet mayhem.“I think I watched Commando 49 times,” Hawke laughs, “I don’t know why. We rented Commando when I was young and nobody returned it and I just watched it a million times.”The Year of Living Dangerously (1983)  88%Now that you said Commando, do you know what’s the other movie I watched a ton? I feel like I want to change one of my answers.Sure.The Year of Living Dangerously. We had that VHS. I saw it the first time, actually, when it came out in the theater. It had Mel Gibson in it, so I thought it was gonna be an action movie. I was really disappointed. But I couldn’t stop thinking about it. And I got the VHS and I started watching it. There’s something about Linda Hunt’s performance, you know? “What then must we do?” Travel and mysticism and romance is at the heart of that movie. And there are images in that movie that will stay with you your whole life.First Reformed&nbsp;opens in limited release&nbsp;this Friday, May 18.

He was only 16 years old when a couple videos of him singing in his bedroom quickly went viral and shot him to internet stardom back in late 2006. He continued to gain a fanbase as he released more original songs over the next couple of years and eventually found further success as a stand-up comedian, incorporating his music into his act. Since then, Burnham has released four comedy albums, appeared in a number of feature films, produced several stand-up specials, and even helped develop a sitcom for MTV.This week, however, marks a new milestone for Burnham, as he makes his feature film debut as writer and director with Eighth Grade, a coming-of-age comedy-drama about a socially awkward 13-year-old girl (Elsie Fisher) trying to survive her last week in middle school. The film premiered earlier this year at Sundance to rave reviews, and it’s currently Certified Fresh at 98%. Burnham spoke to Rotten Tomatoes about his Five Favorite Films, then talked about how he rose to fame, why he wanted to make Eighth Grade, and what he’s looking to do next.One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (1975)  94%First, One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest was very important to me. I probably saw that when I was 12 or&nbsp;13.&nbsp;I really loved acting, and it was the first thing I had ever seen, it felt like, on film where acting just felt alive in a way that I had never seen before.&nbsp;I couldn’t believe&nbsp;how free and chaotic and amazing and human it all felt. Those therapy scenes are just so incredible and special.&nbsp;To be able to have a scene of&nbsp;15 people where no one is taking you out of it and everyone just seems very vivid. It was scary to me how alive it was but very, very exciting. It just felt like, what an incredible thing it would be to be a part of that.You were already interested in acting by that age.Yeah. I was interested, yeah.&nbsp;But not film; I had only done theater. I was really interested in theater.&nbsp;It was the first thing that made me go, “Oh, wow. Film acting is very cool.” I’m not the first to watch movies and get excited, but I don’t know, theater is very collaborative and it’s about sort of working with a bunch of people. It just hit all the notes for me too. Also, I hadn’t seen any films, really, outside of what a 10- or 11-year-old is supposed to watch.&nbsp;Still, it’s absolutely incredible. Just one of the best versions of that.That’s a pretty intense movie for any 10- or 11-year-old to watch.Yeah, but I think it’s intense being a 10- or 11-year-old, you know?&nbsp;It’s funny — for the movie, my movie, it was an influence in terms of that vibe of the ward, of the hospital, was a little bit of the vibe of what we’re trying to go for in the middle school. Just in terms of, how do you&nbsp;do what&nbsp;Milos does in that movie, such controlled chaos?&nbsp;It’s something that feels so out of control, and yet it’s a scene that has a beginning, a middle, and end, and it escalates.&nbsp;It’s incredibly impressive.George Washington (2000)  84%George Washington, probably, David Gordon Green’s first movie.&nbsp;That was one that I probably saw right before I started, or was it… I can’t remember — it might have been right before I wrote this film. I had never really seen kids articulated in the way that it felt like kids actually thought. It&nbsp;wasn’t imbuing the kids with a sort of ability to articulate themselves that was beyond them.There’s that amazing monologue when one of the boys is sitting on the floor of a bathroom and he’s looking up, and he’s saying, “I want to be an inventor. I want to make stuff,” and he’s giving this monologue about his wants and his needs, but they’re so through the prism of a young mind.&nbsp;You can tell the speeches he’s heard that he thinks he might be making, but in that dishonesty it’s so honest. He’s reaching for things beyond himself, and you feel that he doesn’t have the faculties to get there, and that’s just so honest of what that time is. You can feel that he really gave a lot of this sort of articulated authorship over to the kid and that really shows.&nbsp;It’s like, “Oh, this is actually how kids speak.”A Woman Under the Influence (1975)  90%A lot of these are acting.&nbsp;A Woman under the Influence.&nbsp;I just think Gena Rowlands is absolutely incredible, and the sort of vibe of that movie. You can just feel the closeness of the actors and the crew and the people making the film. Again, it’s so incredibly alive and spontaneous, and that sort of weird, intimate, long-lens voyeuristic stuff and their fights, it’s just absolutely incredible. Also, just long takes of allowing actors to be, and to not cut out the white noise of superfluous action that doesn’t necessarily contribute to the plot. The purpose and the heart of the movie is stated over and over again in every tiny action, in every little thing they do, in every smile Peter Falk gives to her or look she gives to him. The messiness of it is just absolutely incredible, and that dinner scene with them all together is just stunning.Both Ethan Hawke and Elizabeth Olsen also chose this film as one of their five favorites as well.Yeah, and I’m not surprised that it’s two great actors. It should be, hopefully. It feels like a really strong… like required viewing for any actor is that movie. But it’s also a director’s film. You can tell&nbsp;the intimacy that Cassavetes created in that film, in terms of how comfortable people are in front of the camera. That is, for me, the first job of the director, is to attend to the actors.Raw (2017)  92%A recent one would be Raw, the Julia Ducournau film.&nbsp;I love that film. I had sort of finished my movie so… Or no, I hadn’t finished it — maybe I was just about to shoot my movie — but I watched it three times in theaters.&nbsp;I can’t believe that’s a debut. It only feels like seasoned masters are able to really manipulate an audience, beat to beat, to really feel like you are being so perfectly manipulated, and you’re just in the hands of someone who has complete control of you. It’s just unbelievable to have out of the gate.But also, she does an incredible — and it’s something I was trying to do in my movie — she is able to just really ground all of her stylized sequences really perfectly in the felt naturalism of the movie, and she does it in such incredibly sly ways that are so, so smart. Like, you know — spoiler — the finger eating scene.&nbsp;The fact that the beginning of that scene is all about them waxing. Like, the waxing is an incredible way to ground the physical reality of their bodies in something we can all relate to, in terms of, you know, none of us have ever eaten a finger, but we all know the feeling of hair being pulled out.&nbsp;It’s a really relatable and yet traumatic pain that we’re seeing and thinking about. It’s similar in the way that the animals are put in in the beginning.&nbsp;Because the bodies are treated so real and so relatably, then when this surreal stuff starts happening, it feels so goddamn real.&nbsp;She’s just eating half of a finger and people were traumatized by it. You know, it’s actually not that gory of a movie. It’s not that extreme of a movie, but she slyly grounds it in realism.And then there’s&nbsp;just these beautiful images over the whole thing. It’s such an economic use of set pieces. The blue paint and the yellow paint, and getting together and turning green. Even her under the covers, that feels like a set piece. She’s so economic with her use of action and framing, and it was something I really wanted to try to do. I felt like I didn’t have a good reference for “How am I going to integrate the stylized sequences I have in my mind into this natural world?” Then when I saw her movie, I’m like, “Oh man, this is exactly what I want to do.”She just has a really incredible eye for what is significant, and all the&nbsp;set pieces are&nbsp;just very muscular. Knowing the set pieces are made from simple clean action that is understood with iconic, and icons are simple. To know that things that are iconic are often very, very simple.Fat Girl (2001)  73%I would probably say&nbsp;À ma soeur!, the Catherine Breillat film. If you could put that title instead of&nbsp;Fat Girl.&nbsp;I’m just kidding. I don’t really like saying my movie is related to that. I do think Catherine Breillat is brilliant and her movies have so much psychological weight to them. Those two sisters, they’re just, like, titanic, in terms of the conflict between them. The sexual scene with the boy is one of the most charged, terrifying, strange, impossible-to-describe scenes ever, that long take. The sort of depth of… Anaïs? The main girl?&nbsp;Just the depth of her look, how significant her neutral look and gaze is. Her stare is one of the best stares ever. And I stole the swimsuit from that movie and put it in my movie. I just completely stole the lime green one-piece and put it in my movie.I just love Catherine Breillat. I just think she’s incredibly smart. It’s very exciting, and it’s a sign of a really incredible director to show how much tension and tone can be wrought out of a scene of a younger sister staring out of her covers at her older sister from the bed across the room. It’s kind of incredible how powerful and charged that movie feels before it becomes insane at the end.&nbsp;To me, the brutality and shock of the ending, I was feeling throughout the entire movie. It’s just crazy when it shows up literally.Ryan Fujitani for Rotten Tomatoes: I have to confess, I was not expecting such an eclectic list from you.Bo Burnham: Was that a f—ed up list? Is it like a pretentious thing? I can always change…RT: No, not at all. I’m just a bit surprised, but it’s a fantastic list. Has film always been a big thing for you?Burnham:&nbsp;Not really, no. It wasn’t until I was 18,&nbsp;19 that I even started really watching movies in any kind of serious way.&nbsp;I loved acting. I loved theater. That was my first love, and then I was going to go off to school for experimental theater, you know, and do that.&nbsp;It’s not like&nbsp;I was interested in lacrosse or whatever, and then all of a sudden I picked up film. I feel like even though I wasn’t watching film, I was learning things that would eventually lead me to film.&nbsp;I feel like, if I have any strength as director, it’s from all the time I spent in theater working with actors and collaborating with actors. Yeah, it was sort of late in life for me.Some of my&nbsp;favorite filmmakers are people that tend to… maybe haven’t been filmmakers, and then jump into it or something. Like, I love Steve McQueen. I mean, he was making film but not narratives. I wasn’t a kid growing up with movie posters on his wall, necessarily. I sort of stumbled into it and realized, “Oh, weirdly, I’ve been circling this this whole time. I actually think all of my interests are contained within this thing.” I definitely have catch-up to do, I feel. You know, people are like, “You haven’t seen&nbsp;Lawrence of Arabia?”&nbsp;and I’m like, “Oh s–t.”RT: It’s also a little surprising that&nbsp;Eighth Grade&nbsp;came from you,&nbsp;because while your comedy style is clever, it’s also brash, cheeky, and sometimes controversial. What made you decide to tackle more grounded material like this?Burnham:&nbsp;I kind of fell into a world of doing stand-up and the tools available to you as a standup, or for me in terms of what my shows were, was sort of irony and cynicism and being clever and overwriting things and making things very precise. I was sort of hungry to drop that stuff and collaborate with somebody and not use those tools, and try to capture something more human and spontaneous, and get back to what I loved about theater, which was something less knowable and not really speaking from authority, but instead jumping in something and flailing around, and trying to describe it from the inside, you know? I was sort of tired of going around talking about what I had figured out. I was more interested in exploring things I was struggling with.RT: Part of Elsie Fisher’s character Kayla’s story in the film involves trying to become a YouTube personality in her own right, and of course, you know something about that yourself. Looking back now, is this anything at all like the path you imagined yourself taking to get where you are?Burnham:&nbsp;No, I mean, in 2006, when I was 16, yeah, sure, I probably wanted to be famous, too. I mean, who doesn’t want attention all the time to some degree? I hoped to be making things. That was the hope, just to be able to make things. I didn’t know that I’d stumble in on this.&nbsp;You know, I thought I wanted to be an actor. I thought I wanted to be a theater actor, and then I avoided that, and I did stand-up, and then I tried to drag everything I loved about theater into stand-up, and then I hit a brick wall with that and realized all the things that I like&nbsp;could&nbsp;be contained here.Even though I didn’t really expect to be making a film in this way, the actual things I’m doing, which is working with actors and writing and staging things, that is what I wanted to do when I was 14, 15. I ended up staging stuff and doing that for my stand-up, but just craving working with other people, rather than try to return to a black box and put up a play. Also, during this I was just concurrently falling in love with screenwriting and, in filming my own specials and directing some other people’s specials, really falling in love with the medium and what it can do and also, watching movies. It feels like a solid 10 years of interest in this.RT: As a 27-year-old man, how did you get into the mindset of a 13-year-old girl?&nbsp;Part of this film’s appeal is that it feels so genuine, and I’m wondering how you accomplished that.Burnham:&nbsp;If you want to research these kids, they’re posting everything about themselves online, so it’s pretty easy.&nbsp;The other thing is to just believe that you can, to believe that her thoughts are just as interesting and deep and fraught as yours, and that it isn’t just, “How am I possibly going to understand what she’s thinking?” It’s like, “No, she’s a human, too, that’s struggling with her own things and is self-aware and is worried and has all of your fears.” Her circumstance is different but she’s still a person with a beating heart. Also, knowing that I’m going to actually be able to have an actual 13-year-old girl there, performing. I’m not writing a novel, so it really was letting her lead and letting her embody the part.RT: Did Elsie get some input on that?Burnham:&nbsp;Not specifically in terms of script or words, but she’s offering every moment by just being. It’s really just trying to get her to be comfortable enough to express herself. I didn’t do it. She did. She did it all. I just kind of laid a structure for her to perform in.&nbsp;She’s the one that is delivering the actual meaning of the movie, even if she’s not writing it. The words are dead until she says them.RT: Were there any specific coming-of-age movies you took inspiration from for Eighth Grade?Burnham:&nbsp;Welcome to the Dollhouse, I like. I find it a little mean, but tonally it captures how weird kids are, which I like. There’s this great movie called Old Enough by Marisa Silver that’s really lovely. Yeah,&nbsp;George Washington,&nbsp;Fish Tank.&nbsp;Billy Madison.&nbsp;I think Billy Madison gets school very right. First grade has never been more accurately portrayed since Billy Madison.RT: Now that you’ve finished your first narrative feature, and you’ve mentioned that you’ve fallen in love with screenwriting, can we expect more? Is there something different you’re looking to try next?Burnham:&nbsp;No, no. I’m not trying to try stuff just to try it. I hope to write. Well, I have been writing stuff, but I hope to make things. I’m not trying to be like, “Then I’m going to bake cakes,” or whatever. I have a whole lifetime of getting better at this, I’m saying. If I’m lucky enough to do it, I know there’s so much work ahead. Hopefully I can find something that makes sense and find people to pay for it. That’s the unfortunate thing about being a director: Your passion requires millions of other people’s dollars.Eighth Grade&nbsp;opens in limited release this Friday, July 13.","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"TV, sag, Chernobyl, RT, TV, TV+, caribbean, Arrowverse, Funimation, new, Columbia, Pixar","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/12115557/Bo-Burnham-FFF1.jpg","slug":"bo-burnhams-five-favorite-films"},{"id":"47508819324968","title":"Awkwafina’s Five Favorite Films","content":"Five Favorite Filmsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Awkwafina's Five Favorite FilmsCrazy Rich Asians' Awkwafina shows love to fellow scene-stealers Marisa Tomei and Lori Petty, and gets real on representation.by Joel Meares | August 18, 2018 |  Comments(Photo by Alexander Tamargo/Getty Images)Chances are you’ve&nbsp;been hearing the name Awkwafina, the alias of Queens-born actor and musician Nora Lum, a lot this year. She’s the co-star and premier scene-stealer of Crazy Rich Asians, the rom-com phenomenon getting a ton of buzz this month for its landmark place in cinema (and for just being a really good time at the movies – 92% and Certified Fresh right now). She was also the co-star and premier scene-stealer of Ocean’s 8, another buzzy cinematic milestone that made big dollars earlier in the summer. Critics and audiences have left both films singing Lum’s praises and wanting to know more about her.What they find out is that Awkwafina didn’t happen overnight (she recently shared her story in a touching Twitter post). She’s been making music for years, first uploading to YouTube and then releasing two EPs; her biggest hit, the hilariously pointy rap “My Vag” (sample lyric: “My Vag is Godfather 1, and yo vag is Godfather 3”) has racked up almost 3 million views on YouTube. Watching the video, or any of her other earlier work (sample titles: “Queef,” “Green Tea,” a duet with Margaret Cho), it’s obvious she was destined to break big –&nbsp;household name big – and Crazy Rich Asians could be the thing to do it.In the movie, adapted from Kevin Kwan’s crazy-popular novel, Lum plays Peik Lin, a college friend of Rachel Chu (Constance Wu), who reunites with Lin when she travels to Singapore to meet her (crazy-rich) boyfriend’s family. Peik Lin is Rachel’s guide through the parties and social thorniness of wealthy Singaporean culture, and her champion and coach when things get rocky in love. For the audience, she’s more than comic relief –&nbsp;though she is definitely that – she’s a one-woman Greek chorus in a world so opulent it can overwhelm. And she’s great at it. As Bill Goodykoontz writes in The Arizona Republic: “I’d watch every episode of a reality show with a camera following Awkwafina while she attends parties of the rich and famous while cracking wise about them.”With Crazy Rich Asians in theaters, Lum sat down with Rotten Tomatoes to share her Five Favorite Films in a chat that touched on representation, baseball, and Bette Midler.A League of Their Own (1992)  79%When I grew up, grandma would say, “Why do you like this movie so much?” And I would say, “Because I am Kit Keller. You don’t understand, like I am Kit.” It was very influential, and I saw it when I was four or five. Must have been really, really young. And I just remember, it made it seem normal that women could play baseball. I absolutely loved Lori Petty, like Lori Petty was me. I related to her in so many ways. I played baseball, I played softball. And, yeah, I even made a costume, a Halloween costume, for myself one year of the Rockford Peaches.&nbsp;It was just an amazing movie.Best in Show (2000)  93%It comes down to my specific brand of comedy –&nbsp;I really enjoy comedy that takes things to different places. Best in Show had already been out when I saw it, and it was the first improv sketch film I saw –&nbsp;it was my first mockumentary. And I noticed that the way that they do it is just so amazing. I was in love with Catherine O’Hara and Eugene Levy, who are amazing in A Mighty Wind as well. But Best in Show is so good because it was so evocative of a time and a place, this dog show that goes on, and I’d never seen, like I said, a mockumentary, I’d never seen improv.Have you ever done a mockumentary yourself? Would you do one?I would do a mockumentary so fast! Like, it’s not even funny. But, no, I have not been invited to do a mockumentary.This is an open call to Christopher Guest, then…Christopher Guest!&nbsp;I am – I am avail! Hit me up. Don’t even go through my agent, just hit me up. Hit me up on MySpace.Saving Face (2005)  86%I actually had the poster of&nbsp;Saving Face&nbsp;hanging in my room for a long time. It was the first Asian-American movie that I saw that really connected with me. I’ve seen some Asian-American indies, but that really kind of opened up my search for them. I didn’t even really know about the genre when I first saw it. It was written and directed by an Asian-American woman, Alice Wu, and it centers around, an Asian-American lesbian. It stars one of my favorite actresses ever – Lynn Chen – and Michelle Krusiec. This girl, she’s from Queens, and she takes the 7. It was the first time I’d ever seen a movie with an Asian American on a 7 train!I think that was the first time I really understood what representation was. But it hit closer to home because she was an Asian-American woman and because, you know, she is from Queens. And she went to Flushing all the time, and her mom [Joan Chen] was kind of this Flushing socialite who actually becomes pregnant. And she kind of has to go between both worlds of being the good Asian daughter and also coming to terms with her sexuality. It was one of those movies that I think explored a lot of layers about the Asian-American experience and the negotiation that come with it. And, so, I love that movie so much. I still have the poster somewhere.My Cousin Vinny (1992)  86%I didn’t even know when I saw it that Marisa Tomei had won an Academy Award for it, but it makes so much sense ’cause she’s amazing. It’s also my dad’s favorite movie, so I literally had a tape of it. But it wasn’t an official tape, it just kind of had a strip on it that said “My Cousin Vinny.”We would put it on, and me and my grandma and my dad would sit there and just be cracking up. And I really liked it because, you know, I’m from New York City, and you know, he kind of [embodies that]. It’s the perfect juxtaposition between someone from New York City that goes to the south and all the kind of lost-in-translation stuff that occurs.Some people say Tomei’s win was a potential mistake (not me!). What do you think about that – did she deserve it?Where are those critics? Call those critics up, tell them to come to my house. We’ll have a little talk, alright? We’ll have a little talk.Blue Streak (1999)  36%Yes! Martin Lawrence and Luke Wilson play a hilarious cop duo. I love Blue Streak&nbsp;because I used to watch that movie with my grandma. And my grandma loved Martin. She would watch his show on UPN, and, that was her favorite show. But, yeah,&nbsp;Blue Streak&nbsp;is definitely my favorite [action-comedy]. Love MarLaw.What do you think makes a good buddy cop duo?Well I think it helps when someone is just pretending, you know? The cops definitely have to be different, so one of them has to be a real cop, and I think one of them, you know…. Like in Rush Hour. There’s always that unlikely cop who has to kind of carry him through.Who&nbsp;would you want to do a buddy-cop comedy with?Oh man… Bette Midler?Really? Why Bette?Because she’s amazing –&nbsp;hello? Well, she’s amazing, and I think that she would make a really hilarious cop.Crazy Rich Asians&nbsp;is in theaters now.","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"Wars, 2018, Guide, monsters, female, lord, Reviews, and, dark, Kaling, book, Extras, Opinion, Comedy, drama","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/18120817/Awkwafina-FFF-Rep.jpg","slug":"awkwafinas-five-favorite-films"},{"id":"47508819336239","title":"Ed Helms’ Five Favorite Films","content":"Five Favorite Filmsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Ed Helms' Five Favorite FilmsThe star of Chappaquiddick talks about his love for Eddie Murphy and a Coen brothers classic.by Ryan Fujitani | April 6, 2018 |  Comments(Photo by Jason LaVeris/Getty Images)Comedy Central’s The Daily Show has been fortunate enough to count some of contemporary comedy’s sharpest talents&nbsp;among its alumni, including Steve Carell, Stephen Colbert, Samantha Bee, Robs Riggle and Corddry, and Ed Helms, who stars alongside Jason Clarke and Kate Mara in this week’s Chappaquiddick. Yes, Chappaquiddick is a political thriller based on the real-life scandal in 1969 when senator Ted Kennedy drove his car off a bridge, swam to safety, and left his passenger, Mary Jo Kopechne, to drown, so it’s not exactly a barrel of laughs. But after a starring gig on NBC’s hit sitcom&nbsp;The Office and a string of popular comedies like&nbsp;the&nbsp;Hangover trilogy, Helms is looking to expand his horizons.With Chappaquiddick opening in theaters today, Helms took some time to speak with RT about his Five Favorite Films, explaining how a Coen brothers classic helped him realize he wanted to be an actor and why he was obsessed with Eddie Murphy as a kid. Read on for the full list!Raising Arizona (1987)  91%Raising Arizona. It’s definitely in the top five.&nbsp;I remember seeing that movie as a VHS rental when I was, I think, 12 years old. I’d just had an operation, and I was recovering at home, and my mom just went and got a bunch of movies, and that was one that I could not… I couldn’t even comprehend it the first time I saw it. It was so weird. It was so beautifully weird. At least from my perspective, I had never seen a comedy toned quite like that before, and I just loved it, and I couldn’t get enough of it, and I wound up just watching it over and over again.It wasn’t just funny writing, it was funny looking. The acting is incredible, and the casting, the production design, the cinematography, the score… Carter Burwell, he wrote this haunting score that’s based on an old traditional tune, “Down in the Willow Garden”, which is this kind of haunting river ballad, and it’s the musical motif through the whole thing. It even plays during the diaper robbery scene in the convenience store. There’s like a Muzak version of that playing, and I caught all those little things. I was blown away by the specificity and the choices, and it was one of many movies that I kind of point to as being a moment that, for me, kind of stood out as, “Oh, this is what I want to do with my life.”RT: You’re known to be a very musical person, and I’m wondering how young you were when that started, if you were able to pick up on those cues in Carter Burwell’s score at that age.Yeah, it’s funny. Some of my first music acquisitions as a kid going to record stores were film scores. That and bluegrass albums.&nbsp;I can’t make sense of it either. No, but I always loved how much… Film scores are a very specific kind of composition, and the best film scores are so full of meaning and drama and anticipation, and they’re very powerful that way. They’re very evocative that way.&nbsp;I still listen to film scores when I’m in a creative space, trying to write or work on something, because it gets my wheels turning. It always just fuels my imagination.Apocalypse Now (1979)  98%Going in a little different direction, Apocalypse Now is&nbsp;an unbelievable piece of cinema. Just the scale of the production and the performances. I feel like, narratively, it’s one of the… There’s a subgenre of Vietnam movies, obviously, and this one just feels so epic and operatic, in no small part because it uses Wagner’s Ring Cycle as the score for one of the great battle scenes. I don’t know, I can’t say enough about it.And then, of course, seeing Hearts of Darkness, the documentary about it.&nbsp;That just made me love it even more, because you can see the creative depth that Coppola went to, the depth of his soul that he dug into to not just make the movie and keep it together, but to sort of fight for coherence in a chaotic production, and I love the discovery. I mean, clearly, when Brando showed up on set, it was such a disaster, because he didn’t know his lines and he was a hundred pounds overweight or something, and he basically refused to learn his lines. But then Coppola worked with what he had, and to me that is the most…&nbsp;He wound up with something genius and more coherent than what may have even been on the page originally.There’s a quote by Orson Welles that the absence of limitations is the enemy of art, and I feel like Apocalypse Now is a kind of great tribute to that idea, because Coppola just faced so much adversity making the movie. Not just Coppola, the cast, the crew, everybody faced so much and dealt with so much and then created this transcendent piece of cinema that captures a dark piece of world conflict history and some very intimate stories of young people sucked into it, and then, of course, a meditation on the darkness of the human soul, which is an important thing to explore artistically from time to time.Trading Places (1983)  88%Trading Places.&nbsp;Like most people, I don’t love the ending of the movie on the train with the gorilla costume, but I feel like even with that, it’s still a nearly perfect movie. What is it about that movie? Well, there’s a few things. For starters, when I was a kid, I watched Saturday Night Live from a very young age.&nbsp;I was obsessed with Eddie Murphy, and I don’t know why. He captured my imagination. I loved his energy, and he was always such an uninhibited performer on Saturday Night Live, and then later in his movies. I feel like Trading Places is a phenomenal performance by Eddie Murphy as he goes through this kind of metamorphosis, but also, it’s just an insanely funny movie. This image of Dan Aykroyd in a Santa suit, pulling a salmon steak out of his suit, which he’s hid, and he hid a salmon steak in his suit and stole it and ran out in the street, starts eating it, and he’s pulling his Santa beard hair out of the fish while he’s eating it because it’s all getting mashed… It’s genius.So, the physical comedy, the dialogue comedy is top-notch, but also, I think thematically it’s a piece of social satire that I’d love to see more of. I feel like it’s really what storytelling is at its best, where it’s kind of pointing out some social ills. In this case, it’s inequality, it’s corrupt influence, it’s corrupt power, it’s racial tension, racial disparity. It’s all baked into this hilarious comedy, and if you’re paying attention, you’re hopefully maybe learning a little something as well, or it’s just kind of seeping under the laughs, which is the best stuff.Dan Aykroyd’s character kind of… His performance is so great because it goes from really broad and silly to ultimately very humble and human, and it’s kind of like he and Eddie Murphy are playing these characters that have really great arcs that sort of crisscross right in the middle, right?&nbsp;It gets weirdly poignant, and as soon as it’s poignant, then Clarence Beeks will throw someone down on the pavement and just this explosion of physical comedy, and you’re laughing again.Rear Window (1954)  98%Rear Window. A little Hitchcock action. It’s just a hell of a good thriller.&nbsp;It’s so simple. It’s such a simple idea. It’s beautifully constructed as a story, and it’s Hitchcock at his best, where it’s kind of scary and building tension, but then also lots of laughs throughout the whole thing, lots of second guessing — Where are we, who’s right, who’s wrong? — and Jimmy Stewart is at his best. He’s wheelchair-bound with a giant cast on his leg, but it’s still one of his great physical performances. I just love how the tension builds and builds, and it’s a real kind of filmmaker’s film because the themes of voyeurism and projecting your own narrative onto things, I think, are baked into filmmaking as a form, and Hitchcock recognizes that and had a lot of fun with it, and I think we can all see ourselves in that a little bit.Groundhog Day (1993)  96%Groundhog Day.&nbsp;I can watch that movie just a million times and never get sick of it. There was a whole spate of movies around that time in the ’80s and ’90s where something magical would happen, and sort of screw over a protagonist in some way, and some of those devices were very corny and kitschy and didn’t work as well. Some of them just worked magnificently, and this one is one of those.It’s just these sort of inexplicable moments where the universe is teaching this one guy a lesson, and they never explain how or why, but you don’t care, because it just kind of makes sense. And the way it&nbsp;unfolds, it’s sort of like it’s one of those things that, I think, if you tasked somebody with writing a story with that premise, where a guy wakes up every day in the same day and he has to relive it over and over again until he learns to be a good person, you’d be sort of overwhelmed, like how can I do that? Then you see this version of it, and you’re like, that’s the perfect way to do it. It’s like, “Oh, it’s so simple.” That’s a brilliant script, when it looks like there was no other way to do it, if that makes any sense. And the performances, everyone from Chris Elliott to Andie MacDowell to Punxsutawney Phil. I mean, they all nail it.Ryan Fujitani for Rotten Tomatoes: I remember you first and foremost from The Daily Show, where your field correspondent segments were some of my favorite, and then, of course, there was&nbsp;The Office. I think most people know you for your comedic roles, and here you are in this dark, serious political thriller, and I’m wondering what that transition was like for you. Is this&nbsp;the path you always saw yourself ultimately pursuing in your career?Ed Helms:&nbsp;Great question, and I think the answer is that, for so many years, I never really wanted to do much besides comedy. It’s really why I got into the show business in the first place, was a love of just abject silliness.RT: And you’re so good at it.Helms:&nbsp;Well, thank you. It’s all I ever wanted to do for a long time, but somewhere along the line, I think some maturity started to creep in — and I’m very resentful of that, by the way — but you can’t help it. Life just kind of teaches you lessons, and I guess we all have to grow and mature in some way or another, but as a result, I’m much more open-minded about taking on different stories and roles. For me, the most important thing is just, is it gonna be a compelling story, and something that’s a role that I can sink my teeth into? And I just love this, and I really credit John Curran, the director, with sort of seeing me in this role, because he just was so enthusiastic about me from the get-go,&nbsp;and even more so than I was. I wasn’t sure I was right for it, but I saw it as a rather exciting challenge, and I did love the story, and I’m so proud of the result. I just love the movie, and I’d be thrilled to do more things like it. Like I said, I feel pretty genre-agnostic at this point, and I’m just here to chase the exciting roles and exciting stories.Chappaquiddick opens everywhere today, April 6.

He’ll soon play a different fish-man in Guillermo Del Toro’s festival favorite The Shape of Water, out Friday, and can be seen as alien Saru on CBS All Access’ Star Trek: Discovery.Rotten Tomatoes enlisted Jones, movie monster extraordinaire, to pick the Five Favorite Movie Monsters that influenced his career —&nbsp;and to reflect on five of his own favorite characters as well.The Mummy (1932)  88%The first horror movie I ever remember even seeing was The Mummy with Boris Karloff, so that would be my first monster that is beloved to me. Boris channeled something so haunting with that role, and close-ups on his eyes were enough to give me the heebie-jeebies for the rest of my life. The way he physically channeled that walk and the creaky movement of someone who’s been dead for that long and decaying for that long in bandages, he really gave it something beyond that era.Frankenstein (1931)  100%Number two would be also Boris Karloff, as Frankenstein’s monster in Frankenstein. That was another performance that left me just chilled and with such imagery that’s emblazoned in my mind, and he channeled something completely different for that. He was a completely different character. It showed his diversity as an actor, and his subtleties. That was an era of filmmaking where people over-did it a lot, and he found subtleties as Frankenstein’s monster that I just thought were [wonderful]. Less was more, and he knew that.Phantom of the Opera (1925)  90%Number three would be Lon Chaney as Phantom of the Opera. I think what struck me was his theatrics. Again, he did go over and big, as that era of acting would dictate, but he did it with such conviction and such truth that I bought every single minute of it. He left me, again, terrified and chilled.Creature from the Black Lagoon (1954)  78%Number four would be the Creature from the Black Lagoon. That one, of course, was split up; two actors played him. Ricou Browning was the Gill-man in the water, and Ben Chapman was the Gill-man out of the water, on the land. The most memorable imagery for me would be Ricou in those underwater sequences, when he’s swimming underneath Julie Adams. She’s innocently having a swim in her little white bathing suit, like “la la la,” having no idea that this thing is lurking underneath her. But that underwater performance of his has channeled its way into my own creatures. I’ve played two fish-men now in my career, so I think that the Creature from the Black Lagoon actually left a huge thumbprint on me from that.Legend (1985)  38%The last one on my list of five would be Tim Curry as Darkness in 1985’s Legend. He was a big, demon, Satan kind of character, which normally is not what I’m drawn to, but he —&nbsp;gosh. He was so present in that role, and gave it a voice and a physicality that no one else would have thought of but Tim Curry. So I just love him as Darkness.Jean Bentley for Rotten Tomatoes: You mentioned the two fish-men you’ve played. They’re Abe Sapien from Hellboy, and what’s the other one?Doug Jones: The most recent one, my most recent Guillermo del Toro film — which is coming out December 8th, of course — which would be The Shape of Water, and I play the amphibian man in that. He doesn’t have a name, so they just call him the amphibian man.RT: The Shape of Water has been getting great reviews. What was your experience like on that film?Jones: I was tickled pink with the reception it’s gotten just from the festival circuit so far. It was magical. With Guillermo I knew we were making something very special with this movie, the kind of feeling I had when we were making Pan’s Labyrinth together. This is my sixth movie with him, but most of them, the other four, have been big-budget things. We did Hellboy 1 and 2, and Crimson Peak and Mimic. But Pan’s Labyrinth and The Shape of Water are both films that were passion projects for him personally, you know? There was something very much more personal going on in those films for him, so a more artistic thing would come out of those experiences.The Shape of Water is a love story unlike anything I knew was possible on film. But only Guillermo del Toro could pull off a young lady falling in love with a fish-man from the wild, and make it look sexy and plausible. I’ve played many creatures on film before, but never in that kind of a story, with that kind of emotional attachment to my co-star.(Photo by Picturehouse courtesy Everett Collection)RT: You’ve listed five movie monster performances that made big impressions on you, but what are some of your own roles that stand out to you?Jones: Over 30 years of acting, all the characters I’ve played have become like children to me. It’s very hard for a parent to pick their favorite child, right? They’re not supposed to have one anyway. I think it was maybe Tom Cruise who said in an interview once, like, “What’s your favorite character you’ve ever played?” and his answer was, “My most recent.”But truly, honestly, the two characters that I have that are present in the public eye most right now are the amphibian man from The Shape of Water that I just mentioned, because it’s getting so much hype and it’s coming out soon, and Saru from Star Trek: Discovery. Saru as an alien character is different than anything I’ve ever played before. He’s got the most layers, and the most backstory to figure out, and the most wide array of emotion, and the most storyline I think I’ve been given on an ongoing basis. Over the arc of this first season we just finished, I get to go everywhere emotionally and intellectually with this character. So he absolutely has become a favorite, along with the fish-man from The Shape of Water, because of that.RT: What are some other ones?Jones: Probably the most scary thing I’ve ever played, and that has a long shelf-life as a scary character, is the Pale Man from Pan’s Labyrinth — the guy with the eyeballs in his hands.RT: Oh, I’m familiar. He haunted my dreams for a time.Jones: Yeah, right? He made his way onto many magazine covers the year that movie came out because it was such a striking image and such innovative character design. So channeling him and getting him through my body was an honor; another creation of Guillermo del Toro’s.RT: What’s another favorite role?Jones: I would say probably the most lovable, charming, of my characters might be Billy Butcherson from Hocus Pocus. I loved him so much. He’s a goofy zombie. I got to play a zombie before zombies were a cool thing. He was goofy and floppy, and could relate to the kids in the movie, and it was in a Disney, family-friendly, fun film that also has had a very long shelf-life. It comes back around this time of year, every year, with high-rotation television play. Even revival theaters are putting it up all the time. It’s playing at the El Capitan Theatre right now in Hollywood. So that movie lives on and on and on. I just adore Billy.(Photo by Universal courtesy Everett Collection)I would say, for overall physicality, and what I had to put into a character, Abe Sapien from the Hellboy movies. In a comic-book movie setting I had to make a fish-man mutant believable, but with a heightened comic-book sensibility, so that was quite a challenge for me. He’s wordy, he’s intelligent, he’s well-read, he’s cultured, he’s a gentleman, so to make all that happen in a fish-man body was —&nbsp;he was one of my biggest challenges, and the way the public has taken to him [is wonderful]. Also, those movies have a long shelf-life. When I’m doing convention appearances, that will be one of the biggest sellers at my tables. People love Abe Sapien. They want to talk about that movie, and a lot of people had their first date watching one of those movies. I hear lots of stories of people’s connection to Abe.I would say, for sexy heroism, the Silver Surfer. I played him in the Fantastic Four sequel, the Rise of the Silver Surfer. That was probably the best physique I’ve ever been given, and I say “given” because I didn’t earn it. It was sculpted on me with a rubber suit, right? So at the end of the day I had to give that amazing body back to the people that made it. Which is unfortunate.RT: Even just temporarily, that’s got to feel good.Jones: Right, right, right. Oh my gosh, yeah. It’s funny because when people know me just as the Silver Surfer, and they haven’t really looked me up to find out anything else I’ve done or what I look like in real life, and they’re meeting me at one of those fan/comic-book conventions, the look on people’s faces. “Oh wait. Did you play the Silver Surfer? Where is he?” I’m sitting at the table, this skinny old man in a tie, in a vest, going, “Hey, it’s me. I’m sorry, that’s all you get today.”I owe all of the above, by the way, to not only the great directors I’ve worked with, but also the creature effects and makeup people who have [collaborated]. Every one of those characters I mentioned has a completely different team attached to it that were just amazing artists. I’ve had the best makeup artists in the world put their hands on my face, so really, I owe a lot to them.Star Trek: Discovery airs Sundays on CBS All Access, and The Shape of Water hits theaters Dec. 8.","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"streaming, movies, cancelled, The, werewolf, BBC, horror, TCA, Comic-Con, political, One, Awards","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/30161824/Doug-Jones-FFF1.jpg","slug":"doug-jones-five-favorite-movie-monsters"},{"id":"47508820914238","title":"John Bradley’s Five Favorite Films","content":"Five Favorite Filmsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})John Bradley's Five Favorite FilmsThe star of Game of Thrones and this week's American Satan is as passionate about movies as Sam Tarly is about the history of the White Walkers.by Ryan Fujitani | October 13, 2017 |  Comments(Photo by Frederick M. Brown/Getty Images)Not everyone gets their big break on a global hit television series right out of drama school, but that’s exactly what happened to John Bradley. In 2011, the Manchester, England native auditioned for HBO’s Game of Thrones and landed the role of Samwell Tarly, the bookish sidekick to Jon Snow whose role on the series has become an increasingly pivotal one.Over the years, Bradley has had a few opportunities to pursue other projects, but GoT remains his best known work. With the series currently on hiatus until its eighth and final season airs at some undetermined point in the future, Bradley is spending some time promoting his new film,&nbsp;American Satan, a Faustian thriller about a struggling rock band that finds success after inking a deal with a mysterious stranger. RT spoke to Bradley about his Five Favorite Films and quickly learned he is as passionate about movies as Sam Tarly is about the history of the White Walkers.The Producers (1968)  90%In terms of the first film that I remember having a real visceral connection with me, it’d be The Producers, the original Producers, with Mel Brooks. There was something about such a rich movie, in terms of the richness of the ideas and the power of the quality. If you take the two central performances of Gene Wilder and Zero Mostel, they’re such powerful performances. And you think that they’d both be almost too much for the screen because they both put in so much detail and they both bring so much energy. And they’re both such ballsy and powerful performances, you’d think that the screen wouldn’t be able to contain it. Especially because I was watching it on a TV screen, you think no screen is big enough to contain these two’s performance.But there’s something about the way they work together and the way their styles complement each other and the suitedness of those characterizations, the detail that they both put in. There was something about that. When you get two performers that are so beautifully in sync with each other, it’s like a jigsaw. Whatever one of them’s missing, the other kind of fills in with a perfectly compatible performance. It’s like listening to an opera, listening to those two perform with each other. I feel that way a lot about Mel Brooks in general, in terms of the way he writes and directs. There’s such musicality to that comedy. It’s so specific, and it reads like a musical score. You have to be able to play that absolutely precisely. There’s almost not enough room for interpretation on it.And for actors, they have to be able to say the lines. But the thing about Zero and Gene Wilder is they nail the musicality of it so perfectly and yet manage to layer all of this beautiful character on top of it as well. And they really attacked it. The chemistry and the musicality between them was something that really made me sit up and take notice when I was a young kid. It was very powerful, I remember it very vividly, seeing that for the first time.RT: How old were you when you saw that?I was probably ten. I remember I was allowed to stay up and watch it on a Saturday night. My dad loved it — my dad introduced me to it and he let me watch it. There was something about the size of those performances. They’re almost theatrical performances on the screen. You don’t really get that anymore. A lot of comedy — for better, usually, but sometimes for worse — has gotten much more kind of screen-orientated, and actors play to the camera a lot. But this is almost the size of a Broadway musical, these performances, and that’s what I loved about it. They&nbsp;leap out of the screen with that energy and that characterization, and I just couldn’t get over the power of it. It was extraordinary.This Is Spinal Tap (1984)  95%Number two is slightly different. There are similarities. It’s gotta be This Is Spinal Tap. It’s gotta be that. Just the detail of that as well. What I love about Spinal Tap is, I think it’s the first example of that; it has been carried on through things like The Office and Arrested Development, because they have quite similar qualities. It’s comedy that’s made for people with a sense of humor. You actually have to have quite an attuned sense of humor to know why things are funny in that. I think some comedy is written and performed&nbsp;at an audience, like,”This is it, this is funny. You are not funny, but you’re gonna watch us be funny.”The thing about a lot of that stuff — and I think Spinal Tap is the kind of crystallization of that — you have to be quite a funny person, and have quite a grasp of the work in the comedy to know why&nbsp;Derek Smalls saying, “David, ‘Smell the Glove’ is here. Hello, Jeanine,” over the microphone is a funny thing for him to do. And you have to know why that’s an inappropriate thing to do. And you have to have an understanding of the rules of comedy, and just the rules of everyday social graces to know why that is funny. I kind of like being part of that exclusive club. You’re kind of in on the joke. It’s a communal experience because we’re trusting you that you’re smart enough to know why this is funny without us having to describe it and spoon feed it to you. I like the elitism of being part of that club.Raining Stones (1993)  100%Number three would be a Ken Loach film. I love Ken Loach very much because I love what he stands for politically. I love his bravery and I love the way that he really wanted to get these very socio-economic stories and real examinations of society in England and the unfairness of it. I think the way that he can manage to do that and make films that are entertaining as well, means that he’s such a master.He did a film in 1993&nbsp;called Raining Stones.&nbsp;It’s one of my favorite Ken Loach films, and it’s one of my favorite films in general. It’s a heartbreaking story about an unemployed man who has to scrape together the money for his daughter’s first Communion dress, because in the society that they live in, that’s quite an important thing. You have to have a new dress for Communion. It’s about the dignity of trying to find the money and not letting her go to this event with a secondhand dress. It’s about how people who would seem to be on the fringes of society and treated with a lot of contempt by a lot of conventional media — it’s an examination of how they do have moral compasses. They are human beings, and they do abide by a set of rules, and they’re not scum. They just had a very unfortunate break.I think there’s something about that examination of that which is very deep psychological and socio-economic issues, but then in a very entertaining way. I think when you get a message combined with the entertainment value, I think that’s when you’re really on to something. Because if you have a story like that, which can be very depressing and very heartbreaking and very dour in other hands, if you can make that funny and actually make that interesting, you can put your message across all the more strongly. So I think that’s what I love about Ken Loach, the fact that he knows that in order to get people to listen to your message, you have to be able to entertain them. I think that’s a much harder thing to do than to just put a message across in a very prescribed way. He works hard to make things as entertaining as he possibly can, knowing that his message is gonna come across all the more effectively. I think he’s the king of the message.The Godfather, Part II (1974)  96%I have to say Godfather Part II, because the thing I love about Godfather Part II is Godfather Part I was one incredible story filled with incredible performances, deep psychological examinations of what it’s like to be in that position of authority, and the struggle with that and the conflict of all the stuff we see with most good gangster films, really. You get that in one story in The Godfather Part I. I think in The Godfather Part II, there’s two stories like that.That’s what I love the most about it. It’s two wonderful gangster&nbsp;movies in one, and the richness of that, the way that they flip between those two stories, is something very, very special. It’s like two amazing movies in one movie. It would’ve been Godfather I, but&nbsp;the fact that Godfather II is two great movies in one movie just means it’s an embarrassment&nbsp;of riches. It’s just one of the greatest films of all time.2001: A Space Odyssey (1968)  92%2001: A Space Odyssey.&nbsp;What I love about that is, in a similar way to Spinal Tap, it trusts the audience to have the patience that there’s gonna be something fulfilling in there. Not&nbsp;only the visuals. I think if you watch it now, with&nbsp;21st&nbsp;century eyes, it can seem to some people like a very slow movie, where nothing happens for a long time. Visually it’s very innovative, but we’re so used to 15 cuts a second now that we’re not used to things being played out with that much pace and that much finesse and style and patience. I think, to watch it now, it’s seeing filmmaking with such confidence, the fact that he can hold those shots for as long as he holds them, and he can trust the audience to come along with him on the ride. It can be slow. It’s always visually breathtaking. But I think, to see it now, it looks like filmmaking from such a different time.If it was made now, it would be an assault on the senses. Everything would be very quick, everything would be breathless, everything would be very frantic, but Kubrick was such a confident filmmaker that he was able to play that whole story out with such pace and such style and trust that the audience was smart enough to be dragged along for the ride and stick with it until the end. That’s what I love about it, the pace of it. The respect for the audience’s intelligence. I like to feel part of those clubs and I think 2001 is the ultimate example of that kind of club where, if you understand why this is brilliant, then you’ll do for me. If you understand why this is brilliant, then you’re my kind of guy. And I like being involved in those miniature elite subcultures. 2001 is the perfect example of that.American Satan&nbsp;opens in limited release this Friday, October 13.","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"TV, Set, Year, Logo, streaming, of, police, know, Red, spanish, books, Marathons, renewed, ABC","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/13100400/John-Bradley-FFF1.jpg","slug":"john-bradleys-five-favorite-films"},{"id":"47508822646851","title":"Heather Graham’s Five Favorite Films","content":"Five Favorite Filmsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Heather Graham's Five Favorite Filmsby Ryan Fujitani | September 14, 2017 |  Comments(Photo by Michael Tran/Getty Images)Heather Graham began her career back in the 1980s, and while modern mainstream audiences likely know her best from movies like The Hangover and Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me, she’s managed an eclectic film and TV résumé full of acclaimed films and popular favorites. It’s a list that includes everything from P.T. Anderson’s Boogie Nights to David Lynch’s original Twin Peaks series, from Swingers to Bowfinger to Drugstore Cowboy and recurring roles on Scrubs and Californication. She also recently completed filming her directorial debut, a comedy called Half Magic.This week, Graham stars opposite&nbsp;Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje in Wetlands, a noirish thriller about a disgraced cop trying to stay out of trouble as he reconnects with his estranged daughter and ex-wife in the outskirts of Atlantic City. When RT spoke with her about her Five Favorite Films, she had some difficulty narrowing down her choices: ” showing love to The Apartment, Midnight Cowboy, The Godfather, and Sophie’s Choice before settling on her top five. Read on for the full list.Tootsie (1982)  90%One of my favorite films is the movie Tootsie.&nbsp;I really love Tootsie. I just watched it when I was a kid and for some reason, I just, I’m obsessed with that movie. I think I’ve watched it 100 times. It’s just so funny and fun, and I love it.&nbsp;It’s cool. I like that it’s sort of about women, you know?&nbsp;It’s sort of about how he finds the woman inside himself, so there’s sort of like this feminine aspect to it, and I just love Dustin Hoffman. He’s amazing.&nbsp;I don’t know, I just love that movie. It’s emotionally totally satisfying to me, and it sort of makes me feel good while being interesting and smart.Harold and Maude (1971)  84%I also love Harold and Maude. That’s another probably equal favorite. I just love the Ruth Gordon character in that.&nbsp;I feel like she is so inspiring to me, how she lives her life. I love the Cat Stevens music. I just remember watching it as a kid, and just some part of me thought, “I want to be like her.” I wanted to be this person who lives life and enjoys life, and no matter what happens, she is finding the positive, beautiful aspects of life. She’s kind of this unconventional woman who’s just enjoying her life. I thought she was super inspiring. I love Harold’s character too, but I think it’s just, as a woman, it’s very inspiring to see that kind of a character in a movie because you don’t often see a movie about an 82-year-old woman who you just really want to be because she’s so cool, you know?I also kind of like a movie to kind of inspire me and make me feel hopeful in a way, and I feel like that movie does that. There are so many good movies, but they just leave you totally depressed. But I feel like, with that movie, you’re like, “That’s a good movie that makes me feel excited about life.”The Shawshank Redemption (1994)  91%I guess you got to put The Shawshank Redemption in there somewhere, right? That movie was just so amazing. It’s a wild ride, because it’s very emotional. I just remember the line at the end where he’s like, “My friend.” There’s such an amazing friendship plot in that, and then there’s that line at the end that just makes you bawl your eyes out, you know? So, it’s like, get ready for an emotional… It’s very dark.&nbsp;He gets raped in prison. He’s getting attacked. But that story between Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman, it’s just this friendship plot that runs through the movie. I just thought that was really powerful.Julie &amp; Julia (2009)  77%I also really like Julie and Julia.&nbsp;I know it’s not really like a classic movie, but Meryl Streep’s character was so fun in that.Rushmore (1998)  90%I also really like Rushmore. the Wes Anderson movie. It’s fun to watch. It is not depressing; it’s just so delightful.Ryan Fujitani for Rotten Tomatoes:&nbsp;You had some difficult narrowing down your list, but that’s not uncommon.Heather Graham:&nbsp;This is just off the top of my head.&nbsp;If I had more time to think about it, I might have a more refined thought about it. What else do other people say?RT: It varies, and we get a lot of interesting&nbsp;choices. Some&nbsp;pick a lot of classics, while others talk about those movies they just have to watch if they come across them on TV or something. Others defer to stuff they grew up with. It really varies.Graham: I think movies that I watched when I was a kid…&nbsp;Sometimes it has a more powerful effect than newer movies you go to see to as an adult, when you’re slightly jaded and you’re like, “Oh yeah, I’ve seen that plot before. Oh, now they’re going to do this. Oh, they always do that in these movies.” You know what I mean?I feel like when you watch things when you’re really young and you haven’t read a million scripts or seen a million movies, when you’re just seeing it for the first time, it’s like your mind is blown.&nbsp;When I watch a superhero movie, I’m like, “The plot is always the same.”&nbsp;There’s no variation in the superhero movie structure. It’s always going to be the same story, you know? It’s like, something terrible happens, and they win, and that’s the story.RT: So, unfortunately, I haven’t been able to see Wetlands. Can you tell me a little bit about your role in the film and how you came to be a part of it?Graham:&nbsp;Well, I read the script, and I really liked it. It’s about this cop, played by Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje, and basically my character is from a rich family, and I marry this black cop. But I’m sort of this rebellious girl from this wealthy family.&nbsp;And we live together and have a kid, but then he becomes a heroin addict. We break up, and I take the daughter and go live in Wildwood, New Jersey on the beach and become a surfer and suddenly have a girlfriend. I have a younger girlfriend and live in this little surf shop and party with the surfer people there.He comes back to try to have a relationship with his daughter, and it’s kind of about how he wants to protect her from some of the seedier elements that… In Wildwood there’s kind of a drug-dealing plot through the girl that I have this relationship with, who is dealing drugs and stuff. It’s kind of a gritty, dark sort of thriller-drama.RT:&nbsp;You’ve been able to do both films that are broad comedies and some that are serious dramas. Which one you enjoy more?Graham:&nbsp;I mean, I really like both. It’s really great to get to do both, because there’s something… I mean, I love watching comedy because I really admire people that are funny. I guess I like things that are a mixture, you know?&nbsp;People that do things that are both dramatic and funny at the same time — I kind of feel like that’s the ultimate, when you can do that both at the same time.But I tried to look at it from the perspective that it was sort of a love story, in a weird way. And then I just started going from there, trying to push further and further with, well, what makes someone insecure or obsessive or jealous or crazy or needy? That was my “in” to the situation. Because otherwise, half the time I would’ve been judging my every move, and you can’t do that.RT:&nbsp;I feel like it was either&nbsp;Bowfinger or&nbsp;Austin Powers when I first noticed you, so for a long time I primarily had you categorized as a comedic actress in my mind.Graham:&nbsp;Well,&nbsp;Boogie Nights was serious, I think.RT:&nbsp;I completely forgot about&nbsp;Boogie Nights. That’s right.Graham:&nbsp;And then I was also in Drugstore Cowboy as a kid, which is more dark.RT: I think that was one of those times when I just didn’t realize that was you, or I was unfamiliar with you at the time.Graham:&nbsp;I know, and then people were like, “I didn’t realize you were in Swingers.” And I’m just like, “Yeah, I was in Swingers.” But yeah, it’s fun to be silly. And then, I just directed a movie for the first time, which is fun — directing your own thing and writing it. That was a fun experience.RT:&nbsp;I recently spoke to William H. Macy, who just opened his second film as director, about transitioning from acting to directing, and he described it as an immensely difficult thing. How was it for you?Graham:&nbsp;I mean, I feel like the business aspects of it are really hard, but the actual creative aspects of it were so fun that I loved it.&nbsp;I felt like getting the money and getting it all to happen — you know, selling it and doing all those things — that’s stressful, but I feel like actually making it was really, really fun.It’s not really the planning part of it, because I loved the planning part of it. It’s more raising the money and dealing with how people get money for movies. You know, you get money for movies through getting specific actors, or else getting someone to take a chance on you, and they run everyone’s numbers through a thing. It’s not as creative as you would think. When you really learn about it, there’s like a computer, and you put all the movies the actor’s been in and how much money they’ve made, and if they haven’t made enough money, then it’s like, “No, you can’t hire that actor.”It’s like a calculator. Someone with a calculator is sayin, “Well, I’ve averaged the money that the movies that this person has been in, and you’re not allowed to cast this person because they are not financeable.”&nbsp;And you’re like, “Oh, is that how movies get made? That’s really depressing,” because you’re watching movies thinking, “Oh, they just hire the best person for the job.”RT:&nbsp;Aside from that, were there any creative challenges for you as a director?Graham:&nbsp;I mean, getting the money is totally more of a challenge than doing it, because doing it was fun. I’m sure there’s so much you can learn and you know — I’m new to doing it — but I felt like the business aspects of it were a lot more challenging than the creative aspects, which were just fun.Wetlands&nbsp;opens in limited release this Friday,&nbsp;September 15.","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"movies, Avengers, DirecTV, BBC, drama, Academy, Channel, stoner, Rock, Marvel, Con, LGBTQ, News, Baby","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/14175953/Heather-Graham-FFF1.jpg","slug":"heather-grahams-five-favorite-films"},{"id":"47508822640705","title":"Doug Liman’s Five Favorite Films","content":"Five Favorite Filmsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Doug Liman's Five Favorite FilmsThe director of The Bourne Identity, Edge of Tomorrow, and this week's American Made on his \"anti-Top Gun\" movie and the thrill of adventure.by Rick Mele | September 28, 2017 |  Comments(Photo by Taylor Hill/Getty Images)Doug Liman first burst onto the Hollywood radar by directing two all-time indie comedy cult classics in Swingers and Go, before graduating to blockbuster fare&nbsp;with two very different spy movies, The Bourne Identity and Mr. &amp; Mrs. Smith. Now, Liman’s headed back to the high-stakes world of espionage and anti-heroes for American Made, which follows the crazy real-life story of Barry Seal, a former commercial pilot who was recruited to run guns for the CIA, and ended up running drugs for Pablo Escobar and the Medellin Cartel on the side.The movie, which lands in theaters September 29th, also happens to&nbsp;be a reunion for&nbsp;the director and star Tom Cruise, who&nbsp;collaborated on the beloved sci-fi/action movie Edge of Tomorrow back in 2014. Liman recently took a break from promoting American Made in London to speak with RT about a few of his favorite films, how this movie is the “anti-Top Gun,” and the downright terrifying way Cruise once woke him up from a nap during filming.Bringing Up Baby (1938)  93%I love Bringing Up Baby. Anything that Katharine Hepburn’s in. I’m committed to the Humphrey Bogart, Cary Grant, Katharine Hepburn era of filmmaking. The African Queen is influencing me on Chaos Walking, which I’m shooting right now.Guess Who's Coming to Dinner (1967)  70%That makes me sound like a film snob of some sort, because I’m just talking about black-and-white movies. I love those movies, but&nbsp;Guess Who’s Coming to Dinner&nbsp;is just brilliant.North by Northwest (1959)  97%North by Northwest was a big influence for The Bourne Identity. I’m really drawn to adventure, and characters being plucked from normal life and sent on extraordinary adventures. When Tom and I had the opportunity to go deep into the rain forest to shoot scenes in a really remote location [for American Made], I was promised 360-degree vistas with nothing manmade in sight for a hundred miles. Well, Tom and I are both going to jump at the chance to go on that kind of adventure. So I’m interested in stories where characters are sent out and get to have an adventure, the kind of adventure I dream of having.Superman (1978)  94%I got invited to the Superman premiere, and I was like, “I want to make a movie like that.” I was so enamored by the spectacle of it.Take the Money and Run (1969)  90%The reality is, the movies that were most impactful to me growing up, when I decided I wanted to make movies, I was going to see Woody Allen double features with my brother, back when they had double features. Younger audiences today, they don’t even know what that word means. But they would show two Woody Allen movies back to back. Bananas. Take the Money and Run, that era of Woody Allen.Why Take the Money and Run over, say, later Allen movies like Annie Hall or Manhattan?Maybe because his character is so flawed. You know, you can probably see traces of that in Barry Seal [in American Made]. I’ve never made a movie with a hero, really. Your classic Hollywood hero. My protagonists are always deeply flawed.Rick Mele&nbsp;for Rotten Tomatoes: You touched on something I wanted to ask you, but why do you think you’re drawn to these kinds of protagonists as a director? Whether they’re anti-heroes like Barry Seal or just reluctant heroes like Tom Cruise in Edge of Tomorrow?Doug Liman:&nbsp;I don’t know. But when I was in Columbia making American Made, we’re really back at the scene of the crime, and we’re flying airplanes, so we’re meeting other pilots, because we had to hire local pilots to work with us. And, basically, all the pilots we hired had a history of trafficking in narcotics. They all knew Barry Seal. And one of them told us how much he loved Barry. And we said, “How did you meet?” He said, “Oh, Barry stole an airplane from me.”He came down to take a look at it, and said, “Do you mind if I take it up for a test flight?” And then never came back. And this guy loves Barry! And I love Barry for it. I don’t know why when I hear that about Barry, I like him even more. For stealing another drug smuggler’s airplane. But if that airplane belonged to the Catholic Church, I might also love him. It’s not just who he stole it from. It’s that he saw an opportunity and he just couldn’t help himself but take it.RT:&nbsp;Sure. It’s just so audacious, you can’t help but laugh.Liman: I guess because he’s audacious, yeah. That’s why I’m so drawn to him. I’m not drawn to sneaky characters. I’m drawn to the characters who wear their flaws proudly.RT: When you’re telling a true story like this, how much research do you have to do before you head into production?Liman:&nbsp;A movie like this, there’s a lot of research that goes into it. It’s a true story, so we want to honor that. But we’re not making the movie because it’s a true story, we’re making the movie because it’s a great story and has great characters in it. But I’ve often found sticking to the truth makes for better movies, at least when I make them. I come up with better scenes when I’m hemmed in by the reality of the situation. Limiting the CIA’s power in Bourne Identity – what they really could do at the time versus, you know, other movies that came up with magical command centers, where the CIA has eyes in the sky that can see everything in real time, and not deal with the reality that a spy satellite that’s low enough to see people on the ground isn’t geo-stationary, but is travelling across the land at a very high rate of speed. And it can be over a site for maybe 30 seconds. I’m interested in those limitations. I think they make the scenes more exciting.So, making a movie like American Made, I’m interested in the reality of the story, because in my career up to date, the reality of the situation has always made my scenes more entertaining and more dramatic. And here I can always go back to the well, so any time I felt like the screenwriter was taking a shortcut, I’d say, “Well, let’s look at how it really happened.” And inevitably, I’d find a more exciting scene.RT: Tom Cruise has a well-earned reputation for doing his own stunts. I’m guessing that’s really him flying these planes?Liman:&nbsp;Oh yeah. He does all his own flying in the movie. I have to say – when we were flying to this remote airstrip, it’s Tom flying the airplane, there’s a safety pilot in the plane, and I’m in the back. I took a pillow from the hotel and I’m lying down on the floor. Because the airplane doesn’t have any seats in the back. In the movie, he’s using it to shuttle cocaine and guns, so all the seats are out of the airplane.So I’m lying on the floor and eventually I fall asleep. Because it’s a two-and-a-half hour flight across nothing — it’s just trees. And I wake up, I’m in the air slamming into ceiling, because Tom saw I’d fallen asleep in the back and thought it would be funny to wake me up by putting the airplane into a parabolic arc and slamming me into the ceiling.RT: How much of a difference do you think it makes that audiences can see that’s actually him flying, and you’re not hiding anything or fudging anything in those scenes?Liman:&nbsp;I think it makes a difference that it’s a real airplane. We’re doing car chases with airplanes, and it’s not CG. I think that makes a difference to the audience. To me, as a filmmaker, it’s a huge advantage to be able to shoot scenes with your actor flying the airplane, and not have to think about stunt-doubling it. We’re able to do a way bigger movie than our budget otherwise would’ve allowed for, because we didn’t need to spend money on the kinds of visual effects you’d have to spend money on to do what we did.And also, we were inspired by Smokey and the Bandit. We were inspired by these very lo-fi movies. And you can’t help when you’re making a movie with Tom Cruise to think about the brand of Tom Cruise, and Tom Cruise and airplanes… the comparison to Top Gun is inevitable. And I wanted to be like, “OK, this is the anti-Top Gun. The airplanes are s—-ier, and his character is s—-ier.” But you can do way more for the money if your movie star’s actually doing the stunts for real.RT:&nbsp;This character seems sort of tailor-made for someone like Tom Cruise. What do you think made him a good choice to play a guy like Barry?Liman:&nbsp;What I love about working with Tom – and it was the same thing with Matt [Damon] – when you have these characters that are a little darker, you get to embrace the dark side, and yet still have people root for them. I didn’t have to sugarcoat Jason Bourne’s past, and I didn’t have to sugarcoat Barry Seal’s many flaws. You can’t help but think about the Tom Cruise brand if you work with him. And with Edge of Tomorrow, I was like, I want to make a movie where if you love Tom Cruise, great. He’s going to play a role that’s different than anything he’s done; he’s going to play an unabashed coward. But he’s going to be awesome at it. And if you hate Tom Cruise, you’re going to get to watch him die a hundred times.But I just love how fearless he is. It’s way easier to be fearless about the stunts than it is to be fearless about trying new kinds of characters. And the fact that he allowed me to explore a version of “Tom Cruise” on the silver screen that is completely different than what his mainstream movie persona is, first of all, it’s just really fun. We shared a house while we were making the film, along with the screenwriter, and the common expression heard around the house, besides “It’s your turn to do the dishes” – literally, because we didn’t have a housekeeper, because of security concerns – was “Wouldn’t it be fun if…? Wouldn’t it be exciting if…? Wouldn’t it be funny if…?” We would just explore what we could do with the story, and with his character, and with the love story.American Made&nbsp;opens everywhere this Friday, September 29.","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"Showtime, FirstLook, Oscars, park, Grammys, movies, worst, talk, Opinion, Ghostbusters","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/28173109/Doug-Liman-FFF1.jpg","slug":"doug-limans-five-favorite-films"},{"id":"47508822619200","title":"Bruce Campbell’s Five Favorite Horror Films","content":"Five Favorite Filmsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Bruce Campbell's Five Favorite Horror Filmsby RT Staff | October 3, 2017 |  Comments(Photo by Robert Marquardt/Getty Images)If you’ve been coming to Rotten Tomatoes regularly for a while, you’re probably already familiar with our Five Favorite Films&nbsp;interview features. We wanted to do things a little differently for the month of October, leading up to Halloween, so we decided to speak to a number of actors and filmmakers who have a special connection to the horror genre and ask them specifically what their Five Favorite Horror Films are. We begin with none other than Bruce Campbell.Bruce Campbell and director Sam Raimi had the good fortune of meeting each other in high school, and in 1978, the two collaborated on a short film called&nbsp;Within the Woods that would eventually become The Evil Dead.&nbsp;The legacy of that movie speaks for itself, spawning a pair of widely beloved sequels, a number of video games, a comic book franchise, a stage musical, a 2013 remake, and finally, the Starz television series&nbsp;Ash vs. Evil Dead, which stars Campbell and serves as a serialized sequel to the original trilogy.Campbell was kind enough to take a quick break from&nbsp;a book tour he was on and offer us his Five Favorite Horror Films, which included a few established classics and a couple of unexpected choices. Read on for the full list!Night of the Living Dead (1968)  97%The granddaddy of them all. A landmark achievement in technical innovation, social awareness, and sheer terror. The handheld look so many filmmakers use today was very new in the ’60s, when visual styles were very “locked down.” It was my first experience watching someone get disemboweled, and you don’t easily forget that.The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (1974)  89%The opening scene was almost enough to make me not watch the rest of it. Images of illegally exhumed corpses, grotesquely draped over their own tombstones, set the tone for this classic. What I really like about this movie in particular is its relentlessness. Once the horror starts, it never lets up, and that’s something we kept in mind when shooting the original Evil Dead.The Exorcist (1973)  83%This flick is great because of its approach and tone. Director William Friedkin cast strong actors, giving entirely credible performances. Linda Blair is a revelation. What’s cool is how the characters in the flick treat possession like it’s a clinical disorder.&nbsp;&nbsp;The cherry on the cake was the groundbreaking special effects makeup by master Dick Smith.The Sixth Sense (1999)  86%This movie proves that horror can also be cerebral. You know a film is good if it messes with your mind, and this one does a great job of it. It’s virtually bloodless, which is also unique in horror, and the twist ending, for me, is easily top five.Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein (1948)  89%An early example of combining horror and comedy, which is a delicate balance. This is a fun, silly romp. Who says you can’t do slapstick with a monster? This movie is also an interesting example of early “cross-pollination,” where a studio takes two popular movie personalities and puts them together.","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"Trivia, Rocky, TCA","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/02172749/Bruce-Campbell-Horror-FFF.jpg","slug":"bruce-campbells-five-favorite-horror-films"},{"id":"47508820900918","title":"Ross Lynch’s Five Favorite Films","content":"Five Favorite Filmsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Ross Lynch's Five Favorite Filmsby Alex Vo | November 2, 2017 |  Comments(Photo by Mary Clavering/Young Hollywood/Getty Images)Ross Lynch is going from Disney to Dahmer. He’s playing a teenaged Jeffrey in My Friend Dahmer, a prequel&nbsp;to the&nbsp;madness that would drive Dahmer to kill (and rape and consume) 17 people over 15 years. Heady stuff for Lynch, who wasn’t born yet when Dahmer was killed in prison in 1994 while serving multiple life imprisonment sentences. And&nbsp;the role is perhaps even shocking to his fans, who’ve been following his career through Disney Channel’s Austin &amp; Ally, and as 20% of R5, the rock band he fronts with his four siblings.“I like the idea of shocking people and playing something that was so far from what people were used to seeing me in,” Lynch explains on making this his leading actor debut, “Even when I was on Disney Channel, I had that in the back of my head, and I put it out in the universe that I wanted to do an indie film next. I wanted to do something that was darker and with just a little bit more … something with more substance. A lot of this film is what is not being said.”As My Friend Dahmer&nbsp;opens in limited release this Friday, we spoke with Lynch to get his Five Favorite Films, and followed up with more on expanding a career into film after conquering radio and TV.Romeo and Juliet (1968)  95%It was made in 1968, and it’s kind of old school. I actually ended up watching it for school, but I was home schooled, so I watched it in my house. For whatever reason, when I saw that film, dude, I loved it. I [was] addicted to it. Kind of ended up falling in love with Olivia Hussey. I became a fan girl, I’m not even kidding you. I thought about it nonstop for a long, long time.The Theory of Everything (2014)  80%My second favorite film right now… This is also a film that hit me pretty hard. The Theory of Everything. I like what it says about life. It made me appreciative of life, about everything. Ultimately, I think those are some of my favorite movies, where you leave the theater, you sit up and you want to be a better person, or you want to enjoy life more.About Time (2013)  69%I’m still debating whether or not I want this on my list, but did you ever see About Time, with Domhnall Gleeson? Same kind of thing. An uplifting film. Makes you appreciate the time you got.Boogie Nights (1997)  93%You can’t really go wrong with Boogie Nights. [I first saw this] maybe 16, 17, maybe a little younger. I have a lot of older siblings, so I saw really inappropriate stuff when I was pretty young.I remember the impact Boogie Nights made when it came out. It’s still carrying on.Yeah, especially with young filmmakers. That film is very, very often referenced. A lot of it because of the technical aspects, along with, obviously, the acting. The whole vibe of it. ’70s Hollywood is epic.Django Unchained (2012)  87%A recent film. But man, I had to pick a Quentin Tarantino film. I’m a really big fan. He’s super unique. I appreciate the people who have a thing that’s completely different than whatever anyone else is doing.Was it a fight to pick the Tarantino movie you wanted on your list?I definitely thought about Pulp Fiction for a second. You know what I think it was? I was a little too young to really grasp everything about Pulp Fiction on the first watch. When I saw Django Unchained, I was really immersed in the world and everything that was happening. Based on my personal experience with the film, it’s Django Unchained. But, as far as the better movie, you probably should say Pulp Fiction.Alex Vo&nbsp;for Rotten Tomatoes: Is there anyone you’re looking at as you make these big steps in your career?Ross Lynch:&nbsp;I look up to people like Jamie Foxx, the people who do everything. He’s got an Oscar, he’s not an average actor, he’s always playing these awesome roles, like Django Unchained. Or Baby Driver, where he’s this random gangster dude.Ultimately, I just want to be an artist, really. I want to do films that are interesting and that people probably wouldn’t expect me to do, like My Friend Dahmer. I also want to make music that is maybe a little further left field than the norm of pop radio. Obviously, I still have ambition in mind. I still want to get on the top 40, and all those things like that. I’m always wanting to just be creative.I also really look up to people like Steve Jobs and Elon Musk, the innovators of today that push the envelope. Maybe in the future, I’ll do something like that, too.My Friend Dahmer&nbsp;is in theaters this Friday.","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"aapi, who, book, Academy, Awards, Amazon, Tarantino, italian, video, Biopics, TV, spain, NYCC, Elton","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/02133911/600RossLynch.jpg","slug":"ross-lynchs-five-favorite-films"},{"id":"47508820907066","title":"Tobin Bell’s Five Favorite Horror Films","content":"Five Favorite Filmsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Tobin Bell's Five Favorite Horror Filmsby Ryan Fujitani | October 26, 2017 |  Comments(Photo by Jason LaVeris/Getty Images)When the original Saw opened back in 2004, few people could have predicted the low-budget shocker would become a franchise phenomenon, spawning six sequels that premiered annually in late October and spawned a Halloween tradition. This week, seven years after its last installment, the series looks to make a gruesome return to theaters with Jigsaw, so we took the opportunity to speak to the man behind the puppet, namely Tobin Bell.Bell has been acting since the 1970s, honing his craft in smaller parts and background roles in a variety of films and television series. But his turn in Saw as the corpse on the floor — who ultimately reveals himself to be the evil mastermind behind the plot — quickly turned into a fully fleshed-out villain, and Bell became a horror icon in the process. To celebrate the Halloween season and the release of his new film, we spoke to Bell about his Five Favorite Horror Films, what makes a good horror film, and why Jigsaw resonates with audiences.Diabolique (Les Diaboliques) (1955)  96%An old French film with Simone Signoret, and I think Paul Meurisse is in it. It’s the film that terrified me as child, with this very simple scene where she pulls a curtain back in an upstairs window, and he’s watching from the yard. That was actually probably the first horror film I ever saw.&nbsp;It was a very scary. I was a small child. I just remember the simplicity of that moment when she pulled that curtain back. So there’s that, and they did the remake with Sharon Stone that was not very successful and wasn’t very well made.Psycho (1960)  96%Psycho, the Alfred Hitchcock film, the film with Anthony Perkins and Janet Leigh. I thought that film was groundbreaking at its time, and I think everyone else did, too. The shower scene in&nbsp;Psycho, I likened it to people being afraid to go in the ocean because of&nbsp;Jaws.&nbsp;People were afraid after that film to take a shower. I remember distinctly so many people talking about that because of that shower scene with Janet Leigh.The Exorcist (1973)  83%The William Friedkin film. I thought that was very smart. I thought the priests were as terrifying in that, and all the religious symbolism, and&nbsp;all of the dogma of the Catholic Church that was involved in that. It’s pretty rich stuff. The performances were very, very powerful in that film. Some of the special effects also that they did with the child in the bed were just so freaky.The Descent (2006)  86%The Descent, which was the film about the women spelunkers who go down into a cave. What I liked about that was the fact that you spent the first half hour of the film developing the characters. You cared about the people. By the time they went into the cave, you were involved. I thought that was very smart, and I loved that a horror film didn’t go right to the scares but made you care about the characters and their relationships with one another.&nbsp;The Descent was very well made, I thought, on a relatively low budget.Wolf Creek (2005)  54%Wolf Creek, the Australian independent film that has such great locations and great music.&nbsp;A very simple premise, and it’s surprising. It starts out in this sort of idyllic setting and situation, and it just falls like dominoes into this horrific situation. Your hopes for the characters are dashed, one by one. I just love when I see a little independent film that’s got all the elements of good filmmaking done on a small budget with extremely powerful performances by the two lead characters in it.Ryan Fujitani for Rotten Tomatoes: For you, what makes a great horror movie?Tobin Bell:&nbsp;Obviously, people go to horror films to be scared and to have a visceral experience and to be thrown back into their seats and clutching the person next to them and all of those kind of simple things. The same things come into play with a horror film as with anything else. For me, I mean, I’m subjective, but for me, it’s character and relationship. It’s not necessarily always about plot, but plot helps. For me, as an actor, I want to care about the people, and then whatever happens to them happens. That’s what’s so great about Jigsaw,&nbsp;is that you get involved with the people, and you find out a lot about their backgrounds and what they’ve done right or not done right. That raises the stakes, and when the stakes are higher, that’s always better.RT: Jigsaw is somewhat of a unique villain in that, even though his methods are twisted, he actually believes he’s doing good. I’m wondering if you think that moral center of his character, as twisted as it is, is what the fans of the series really respond to.Bell: Yes, I do. I think that his thought process, whether you would do that yourself or whether you think he’s right to do what he’s doing, as long as it makes you think and be able to put yourself in his thought process or his position, even for a moment, that’s all you need. You don’t need more than that. You just need people to identify with him. The smallest moment is enough, because when it’s surrounded by the chaos of a&nbsp;Saw&nbsp;film, it resonates. Whatever concept he mentions, whatever it has to do with, is often something that people think about every day in their daily life.The world that we live in today is topsy-turvy, and something as simple as climbing over other people in order to achieve what we want for ourselves — I mean, people do that every day, cutting in line in the freaking supermarket. It’s done on a small scale. It’s done on a big scale. It’s done in financial markets. It’s done in fire stations. Everybody does it on some level or another. If it makes you think, even for a second, about your own life, your own self, “How much do I appreciate my life? How grateful am I for the fact that there’s gas in my freaking gas tank?” You take the fact that the sun is shining and… The sun ain’t shining in Syria today, I’ll tell you that right now. Why do we have to be in the sh–s before we realize how lucky we are? Why can’t we feel a sense of joy?RT:&nbsp;Right, and appreciate the things around us.Bell: Yeah, the simple things. I think it’s part of the human condition. I really do. I think it’s from 100,000 years of genetics, where we come from the caves, where we were watching out for saber-toothed tigers, and we’re still watching. We’re still looking at the next problem rather than being able to feel a sense of satisfaction at the fact that we have decent running water to drink.Tobin Bell in Saw VI (2009) (Photo by Steve Wilkie/©Lionsgate)RT: I’ve read that you frequently keep a journal when you’re working on a film, to jot down notes and even formulate backstories for your characters, and I understand you did this when you worked on the first&nbsp;Saw movie.Bell: I&nbsp;did, yeah.RT:&nbsp;John Kramer’s backstory is gradually revealed throughout the&nbsp;Saw sequels. Did they incorporate any of the notes from your journal?Bell: Yeah, yeah. I mean, when we got him up off the floor in Saw 2, it was the first time you really heard… I remember talking in Saw 2&nbsp;about Darwin’s trip to the Galapagos and the whole idea of survival of the fittest. He talks about the jigsaw piece that he takes from people’s necks, and he says something about, “They are only meant to symbolize one thing, that something’s missing in this person.” So, yes.There’s still a lot of notes in that notebook that we haven’t explored. We look forward at some point to possibly doing that. We’ll see. I’m hoping that Jigsaw&nbsp;is able to inspire a whole new group of fans that weren’t old enough to get into theaters; they weren’t 17. That was seven years ago.This is a standalone film. I think that would be so cool, because old Saw&nbsp;fans are so passionate about the series. If we can create a whole new group of millennials — who, by the way, live in a completely different world than we lived in seven years ago — what the young people will bring to the theater will be completely different than what fans brought to the theater 10, 11 years ago.RT:&nbsp;Speaking of&nbsp;Jigsaw, how much involvement did you have in it? Your name’s in the credits, and that’s clearly your voice in the trailer. Are we getting another posthumous appearance of John Kramer somewhere in this film? Are you even able to tell me that?Bell: No. I can tell you this. Obviously, the film is named after my character, so that’s pretty telling in its own right, in terms of whether I’m in this film and to the extent I’m in this film. Saw&nbsp;is always a series of twists and turns and surprises. The role that I play in the film is going to have to be one of those surprises.&nbsp;But you can be sure that I have an impact.Jigsaw opens everywhere this Friday, October 27.","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"Avengers, horror, Tyler, south, Walt, joker, Prime, movies, Black, of, reviews, VH1, USA, San, Diego","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/26185111/Tobin-Bell-FFF2.jpg","slug":"tobin-bells-five-favorite-horror-films"},{"id":"47508820905017","title":"Rob Zombie’s Five Favorite Horror Films","content":"Five Favorite Filmsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Rob Zombie's Five Favorite Horror Filmsby Kerr Lordygan | October 27, 2017 |  Comments(Photo by Maarten de Boer/Getty Images)Whether building ridiculously scary worlds like those of&nbsp;The Devil’s Rejects,&nbsp;Lords of Salem, or&nbsp;House of 1000 Corpses; imaginatively reinventing a classic franchise like&nbsp;Halloween; or creating twisted metal anthems like “Living Dead Girl,” “Dragula,” and “Sick Bubblegum,”&nbsp;&nbsp;Rob&nbsp;Zombie&nbsp;is one intense fellow.

Granted, it wasn’t easy for&nbsp;Zombie&nbsp;to settle on&nbsp;his all-time faves (you can see his favorite all-time films of any genre&nbsp;here), but he’s been on a 1930s horror kick of late and was eager to elaborate on some of the best ones of the era.Dracula (1931)  94%I could go on forever with the list, so I just picked five random ones, because I go through periods where I watch certain movies a lot. I don’t know why — I’ll get on a kick. I’ve been on a kick lately of watching Dracula, the 1931 version with Bela Lugosi, over and over and over and over. You know?I love everything from the ’30s. The 1930s is my absolute favorite time period for horror movies, because they were just so demented and sick. Sometimes you watch them and go, “Wow, they get away with a lot.” Then, of course, the codes came in and it ruined the party. When you watch movies from the 1940s, they seem so tame and so dry, but everything from the ’30s is just amazing.Lugosi in that film is so iconic, he doesn’t even seem like an actor giving a performance. Some of these people transcend to something else. It’s like Marilyn Monroe or something. They became something else. Sometimes people will make fun of his performance because of his accent, but he’s so… It’s so funny. I love watching him, because his performances are so unique. Sometimes there’s other people in the film — like David Manners, who’s like the lead, good-looking guy, and he’s so wooden and so 1930s-stiff acting, and Lugosi seems like Brando. You can see he’s so in it that when they yelled, “Cut!,” he didn’t cut. You can just see it. He’s so committed that his performance is funny, because it’s on such another level from anyone else in the film. Everybody in those movies back then, you watch them and it’s just — it’s that feeling like, “Eh, you know, even though they’re supposed to be boyfriend/girlfriend, husband/wife, they don’t [seem] like they’re having sex or something.” Lugosi seems like he wants to f— everything in the movie constantly. He just has that vibe. Really weird, man. You know?He does, essentially, I guess.Yeah, he does. He’s just not tame. I don’t know, maybe because he was Hungarian or whatever, he just has a different way of approaching, but he does not have that “uptight American actor from the ’30s” vibe at all. He just steals every moment. Not just him; Dwight Frye as Renfield is amazing. It’s funny — actors seem like they don’t want to do these types of movies, but as soon as you play a villain in something that’s like a horror movie, that’s what you’re going to be remembered for. Even if Anthony Hopkins won an Oscar for whatever —&nbsp;Remains of the Day or Howard’s End or I can’t even remember what it was — he’s Hannibal Lecter. Doesn’t matter if Jack Nicholson won an Oscar for Cuckoo’s Nest or whatever; he’s Jack Torrance. It’s so funny, these roles are just so — they stick.Murders in the Rue Morgue (1932)  79%Lugosi’s my favorite. I think he’s in almost every movie I picked here.I didn’t even realize it till I did my list and it’s like, “Oh, s—, He’s in every movie I picked.” Another one is Murders in the Rue Morgue. 1932 again, with Lugosi as Dr. Mirakle, who’s desperately trying to mate a woman with a gorilla. Again, you watch — basically, he wants the gorilla to have sex with this woman, and they’re sort of dancing around the topic the whole time. He’s mixing their blood, and when he’s done with the ones that failed, he just dumps them in the river. It’s pretty f—ed up. Again the male leads seem completely… Oh, they’re from “blah blah blah”&nbsp; acting, and Lugosi is so bizarre and incredible, as always.Do you think they intentionally told the rest of the cast to keep it kind of mellow so he could upstage them?I don’t think so. I think he was just on another vibe. They were all like, “We’re in a movie and we’re acting,” and he’s like, “I am Dracula.” It’s funny — I always talk about Brando, like I said before, bringing in that new style of acting, but I don’t know. When you want Lugosi, he sort of was like… He was already there, man.The Black Cat (1934)  89%I would say my third one would probably be The Black Cat, 1934. Lugosi, but with Karloff, who also is demented, as a Satan worshiper. David Manners, who is in Dracula, again giving another bizarre, stiff, wooden performance, except this time it’s more obvious, because you have two guys who are amazing surrounding him. It’s always weird watching these sort of straight-up leading men being destroyed by these freaks. I don’t know, it’s kind of weird. I guess these guys don’t really get the credit that they deserve for their acting, because they were always in horror movies, but Lugosi and Karloff are just incredible. I mean, they create these iconic moments that define what cinema is, and they’re sort of brushed off. But I guess that’s the way it goes.And I’m sure they had no idea their images would become so legendary for decades to come.No, I’m sure once they shot these movies, they thought, “Oh, who’s going to remember this next year?” No one thought they’d be watching these movies over and over. That why, when that Shock Theater popped up on TV in the — what is it, the late ’50s or whatever? And people started rewatching these movies on TV, and they found a whole new audience, people were shocked. They’re like, “Who cares? These movies are old.” It’s so bizarre.People don’t give enough credit to how twisted they really were. You can watch them now, and they stand up.They totally do, because what happened was like, you can see the cycle. In the 1930s, they’re incredible. They’re like A-level movies for Universal or MGM or whatever. They’re really dark. They’re really adult, too. 1940, the codes come in, everything gets a little bit more whitewashed. It becomes like House of Frankenstein, and there’s a lot of monsters, and you can see it’s more aimed for kids. Then the next step of degradation was they have to meet Abbott and Costello. By that point, it’s just complete buffoonery. Maybe it’s like a 10-year gap or something. But if you watch Dracula and then you watch Lugosi in Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein, you’re like, “Wow, it’s so weird to watch …” It’s like watching Jack Nicholson pop up in an Adam Sandler movie, but playing the character from The Shining, and you go, “What? Really? We’re doing this?”I love those movies, too, because they’re so bizarre, but it’s so funny, because that’s, I think, what people think of, because they’re so childish. The ones from the ’30s are definitely not childish. Especially Frankenstein. When you watch it, I mean we’re not really talking about that one, but some stuff is… These are such early films, people must have been so disturbed. There’s not a lot of music. Especially Dracula has, like, no music, so the sounds of people screaming or whatever’s happening just seems so real. I can’t imagine what people were thinking, because movies had just come out of the silent era, practically, so it’s pretty crazy.You know, we can talk about degradation back then, but today too — the first Elm Street movie was such a classic, and then Freddy almost became like Mickey Mouse.That always happens, yeah. I used to always say that — that Freddy Krueger and stuff, he was scary, and then they’re like, “Oh, his catchphrases get a big reaction. More catchphrases.” Then there’s a line of toys. I used to think it was funny when you’d see a five-year-old dressing up as Freddy Krueger. Your five-year-old’s dressing up essentially as a child-murdering pedophile? Okay, that’s a good costume. Yeah, they always become lovable after a while. It just happens.Pretty disturbing in itself.That’s just the way life goes [laughs].Island of Lost Souls (1933)  88%Yeah, and The Island of Lost Souls is amazing, from 1932 with Charles Laughton as Dr. Moreau. That movie is amazing. That movie’s dark. For anyone who hasn’t seen it, the extras — I mean, even now you watch like, this is really disturbing. The extras are supposed to be the half-man/half-animal people. You can tell they got really bizarre-looking extras before they did the makeup, and everybody looks like they’re deformed and f—ed up. Again, Lugosi plays the leader of the beast men. He’s not in it a lot, but of course he has the line that everybody remembers about the House of Pain: “He who breaks the law goes back to the House of Pain.” He’s in the movie for five minutes and steals the movie. Charles Laughton is incredible. But it’s demented again. The basic premise is a crazy one. They have the beast men and they’re being operated on and just screaming. It’s like, “This is not fun.” You have little kids running out of the theater in tears, or adults. It’s amazing. Still amazing. The cinematography’s amazing. Everything about it is just incredible.White Zombie (1932)  86%The last one I picked was another Lugosi film, so yeah, he is in every film I picked. That’s funny. I didn’t even realize it. It’s White Zombie from ’32, which is shortly after Dracula. It’s an amazing movie. I’m pretty sure it’s the first movie to ever use the word “zombie” — to use that in a movie. It takes place in Haiti, and Lugosi runs this sugar mill and the zombies are his workers and stuff. Again, he’s amazing, but the film is — only really bad versions of it existed for so long, so every time you’d watch it, you go like, “Wow, the quality of this movie is horrible. It looks like a cheap movie.” Then later, when people have restored things and find them, it’s a really incredible-looking movie. Again, it seems very primitive, but it looks amazing, and he’s great as always. If you watch some of the leads and you just watch their scenes, you go, “What is this, like a cute little musical comedy?” Then he comes in. Again, not f—ing around.I know a certain rock star that named his band after the movie.Yeah, I love that movie so much, and I always thought, “What a great name for a band.” I thought that way before I ever had a band. I go, “If I ever had a band, that would be the name.”Kerr Lordygan&nbsp;for Rotten Tomatoes: Last we spoke I&nbsp;think you mentioned how movies were your first love, even over music. Is that right?Rob Zombie: Yeah, I mean, I loved everything to death, but I think I probably discovered movies first as a kid before I really discovered music. You’d watch King Kong or Godzilla or Planet of the Apes or whatever. Then you get a little older. I mean, still real young. Then you discover the radio and, oh, the songs and the music, but they were sort of indistinguishable for me. I always wanted to do movies, but it just didn’t seem possible. Starting a band, you can get a couple other goofballs together and buy some cheapo equipment. You go, “Hey, we’re a band.” Back in the day of owning camera equipment, buying film and editing stuff, it’s just like, “Who’s making movies? I don’t know. That’s like for the special people.” Now, you can make a movie with your phone, so it doesn’t seem so mysterious, but back in the ’70s, it seemed virtually impossible to do such a thing.RT: You brought that horror movie inspiration to your stage show. Your huge stage show is a horror film.Zombie: Oh yeah, totally. Yeah, everything was always linked in my mind, and it still is. When I’m making a record or making a movie or making music videos or designing a stage show, it’s one giant project for me. One thing just informs the other constantly.RT: A lot of horror fans now would also consider some of your films in their top five, so I’m wondering, do you have a favorite of your own films, or one that was most fun to make?Zombie: Well, the one that was the most fun to make was Devil’s Rejects. That was the most fun to make. The first film, House of 1000 Corpses, was — on your first film, that was film school, one crash course in filmmaking. That was stressful and crazy, and you don’t know what you’re doing, and you’re learning as you’re going, blah blah blah. By the time I got to my second film, I had it dialed in. You’re always dialing it in, but dialed in more so. Everything was great. The crew, the actors, the studio, it was just great. Really, ever since then, it’s like I’ve been chasing that high. Each film gets more and more difficult. Some of them have been just downright miserable to make. I hate to say that, because I love movies and I love making them, but the two Halloween films I made, those were the most miserable experiences of my life, making those films.Rob Zombie on the set of House of 1000 Corpses (Photo by Lionsgate courtesy Everett Collection)RT: You&nbsp;can’t look at them fondly now at all?Zombie:&nbsp;I start to forget. Yeah, I totally start to forget. I could watch a movie and go, “Oh, well,” because — you can be miserable while you’re doing something and the end product can still — you can still go, “Oh, but it turned out fine.” But as far as looking back, it’s like, “That was good times.” Yeah, definitely not. In that way, I don’t think it was [a good time] for anybody. The situations, without going into it, were miserable. But it’s always something. We have short memories, so it’s like a goldfish. I’m like, “I’m never making another movie.” Then I swim to the other side of the bowl and go, “Let’s make another movie.” You know? I totally forget. I do forget, because I’ll run into somebody who worked on one of those movies and go, “Hey, remember that thing?” And I’m like, “Holy s—, I forgot all about that.” Some f—ed up thing that happened.RT: What’s next? You have something in the works?Zombie:&nbsp;Well, I’m in the studio right now making a record. I haven’t made a record in a while so excited to do that.RT: When can we hear that, do you think?Zombie:&nbsp;I don’t know. The way I do things now is I may not even finish the record before I start another movie, and I may come back and finish the record after the movie, or I may end up back on tour. It’s kind of a different world. It used to be a real world of: you stopped, made a record, and then you did this album cycle for the record. It doesn’t really work like that anymore, you know? It’s sort of like you have to be doing everything all the time or the world forgets you’re alive.RT: Yeah. With social media and everything, it seems like you always have to have a presence, too. That’s got to be a challenge.Zombie: It is kind of weird. Social media adds to it, but you saw it coming maybe 10 years ago or something.&nbsp;Now it’s like, Jennifer Lopez was an actor, then she’s a pop star, and then she’s hosting American Idol. Or Will Smith. If you go, “I’m an actor,” it’s like, “What else you got?” “I’m a singer.” “What else you got?” I can’t believe how many people I turn on the TV and go, “You already have a hit show. Why are you now hosting a game show?” I thought hosting a game show was the booby prize when your career went to s—? Now when you have a number one show, you still host game shows? I’m confused.Rob Zombie on the set of The Devil’s Rejects (Photo by Lionsgate courtesy Everett Collection)RT: Like the Gene Simmons philosophy of, “All of it. Now.”Zombie:&nbsp;Yeah, I guess so. I get it. I have a side of my personality that would do that, too, but at a certain point, I go, “Okay, I got to dial it back,” because I want to make sure when I’m doing something, I have the time and the care to put into it and it’s not just like, “Let’s get this done and move on to the next thing.”RT: You want it to be quality.Zombie:&nbsp;It’s real easy to fall into that trap. Yeah, and quality takes time. It’s not just like, “Oh, we’re going to go and s— this out, then go over there and s— that out.”RT: Do you ever sleep? It sounds like you don’t sleep.Zombie:&nbsp;Usually, I do, but I fall asleep thinking about everything, and I get up in the morning, I’m like, “Oh, yeah, go do that thing.” That’s kind of why I like going on tour, because when you’re on tour, you kind of can just only be on tour. It’s kind of a vacation. Playlist goes in, the rest of the work has to wait until you get home.Catch Rob Zombie’s 13 Nights of Halloween on HDNET Movies now.

He took the reins for the Pierce Brosnan 007 film The World Is Not Enough, and his acclaimed&nbsp;Up documentary series, which&nbsp;began in 1964 with a profile of several seven-year-olds and has checked in with the same “kids” every seven years since then, remains a singular cinematic achievement. Since making his debut over half a century ago, Apted has worked steadily in both television and film, as a documentarian and narrative filmmaker, establishing himself as one of the most prolific, most versatile directors of his era.Apted is also&nbsp;known for working with celebrated actresses in acclaimed films about famous women, like Sigourney Weaver as Dian Fossey in&nbsp;Gorillas in the Mist and Sissy Spacek as Loretta Lynn in Coal Miner’s Daughter —&nbsp;both earned multiple Oscar nominations, and Spacek actually took home the Best Actress trophy. This week, Apted returns to the big screen with&nbsp;Unlocked, a tense spy thriller starring Noomi Rapace, Michael Douglas, Orlando Bloom, and Toni Collette. He spoke with RT about his Five Favorite Films, explained what he finds so fascinating about women’s stories, and talked about how his documentary background informs even his most outrageous films.Wild Strawberries (1957)  96%The first one is&nbsp;Wild Strawberries by Ingmar Bergman.&nbsp;It’s what I saw when I was 15, and it showed me that films could be something more than just entertainment or going and staring at girls in the cinema or whatever, but film could have the kind of weight of a book or something like that. I used to be a big reader, and I loved going to the movies, but I had no sense of taste in the movies.You know, I grew up in a suburb of London, and I went to school in the middle of London, and that’s when I found myself, one wet afternoon, in an arthouse, and there was Wild Strawberries, and that, for me, was the beginning of it all. It had so many ideas, and it played with dreams, and I thought, “Oh my God. This is quite something.” So it really was a kind of major event in my life.RT: Had you seen many foreign or arthouse films at that point?No, never. Never. My life had been entirely that of a middle class suburban lad who went to the movies with his friends for all sorts of reasons. This was the first time I could look at a film as an equal of a book.Kes (1969)  100%Number two is Kes, Ken Loach’s film. I’d already kind of established myself in television, and I loved Italian movies and all that. And then here was a genuine British neo-realist movie, which I thought was an exquisite film. It dealt with incredibly complicated social issues, which I was very much involved in myself, with my Up series, which had already started by that time. But what I thought was so beautiful about it was that he found the metaphor of this boy and this kestrel, and he told the whole tale of the boy’s life — the stress the boy was under, and the unfairness of life — through the relationship with him and a bird, which I thought was just a brilliant filmic notion.I mean, I’ve always loved his work. He was very influential on my generation — not that he’s much older than us, but I think he was very much our man, and, you know, he has a huge body of work in his lifetime. He never seems to stop. Stop! Right? Otherwise, we’ve all got to keep going, if you keep going. God.Nuit et Brouillard (Night and Fog) (1955)  100%Next is a documentary called&nbsp;Night and Fog by Alain Resnais, which is a story of then and now, of concentration camps. That had a major influence on me, again, for the poetry, if you can call it that, of the documentary, but also the way he used time, the way he used two time zones, two sets of material, to make his point, and to give the film, which obviously had some astounding, alarming images in it, but without a lot of babble, of explanation, by contrasting what it once was and what it is now. It was very moving to me, and I think that was inspirational, again, in the [Up] films I did with these children, which I’m still doing.But I could see how you could time travel in documentary, and it makes both sets of material more powerful. Of course, the film is incredibly powerful anyway. But nonetheless, he’d found a style of doing it, a way of doing it… It’s just, the power of those images, without endless babble, was, to me, a very strong lesson.RT: That’s an interesting notion, of time travel through documentary.Yeah, I’ve used it a lot. I mean, we’ll get to it in a movie in a minute, but that, to me, was very, very striking — not just the material, but the whole structure of it, the whole idea of it.This Is Spinal Tap (1984)  95%And then, my fourth one is a comedy, and I was torn between Some Like It Hot, which I love, but my vote went to&nbsp;Spinal Tap, which I thought was more contemporary. It made me feel such an old man, but…One of the things about Spinal Tap&nbsp;— I was doing a documentary [The Long Way Home]&nbsp;about Russian rock and roll in, I don’t know, the late ’80s or something like that, and it was about a Russian band coming — it was around Glasnost when they came across to America to make the record, and it was about Glasnost, and the co-production, as it were, saw the closing of the gap between East and West, as it were. That’s what it set out to be, but it turned out to be a disaster.&nbsp;Not the film, but the whole object of the enterprise, because it split the band up, and the Russian band never made another record. They were completely disoriented by being in the West and all that. So it was one of those documentaries where what you set out to do, you don’t do, and you do something else, which is usually better than what you were going to do.The point of the story is that I showed them Spinal Tap. They&nbsp;fell about,&nbsp;and they couldn’t speak a word of English, but they absolutely got it. It was just, again, the power of the humor and the power of the images, and all this kind of stuff. I mean, we were in common ground — they never understood a word of it, but they were just laughing as much I would laugh every time I saw it. That was a kind of interesting experience for me, to see how universal films can be.RT: So you showed this film to them as you were filming the documentary?Yeah, yeah. One evening, I brought it with me, because I’ve loved it, and I thought, well, I’ll try it. I’ll show it to them, and they might throw me out, or whatever. [laughs]&nbsp;And I thought, let’s just try it. Let’s see what they thought. And so I put it on, and they just were absolutely gobsmacked by it, and just were crying with laughter.&nbsp;It was a great bonding moment, you know. I mean, the music was the bonding moment that I was doing with them, but it was&nbsp;sweet to see humor as a great bonding thing.Pulp Fiction (1994)  92%The last one is&nbsp;Pulp Fiction. Me and my, as he was then, I suppose, eight-year-old, nine-year-old son, thought it was great.&nbsp;I just loved, again, the way [Quentin Tarantino] used time, the way he moved backwards and forwards in time, which I thought was sort of groundbreaking, although it may not have been. But I thought it was. And I saw the energy and the vigor of it all, and just the images of it. I just love that film.I watch it now and again, as it were, and it never palls for me at all, but I just thought he kind of invented a way, or kind of storytelling technique, which is sort of second nature to us all now, but again, that nonlinear business — for me, it was a revelation. I’m sure there have been other films like it, but this seemed to work so well within a very contemporary, very fast-moving, very original piece. To have the courage to play with the structure, and tell things backwards and forwards and all that sort of thing, I thought, was not just cute, or just showmanship. It actually enhanced the drama, trying to figure out where you were and what was going on. I found that a very creative effort, and so did my son, which thrilled me. He wasn’t fazed by it at all.Ryan Fujitani for Rotten Tomatoes: A lot of your films — and perhaps some of the ones you’re best known for — feature female protagonists, and&nbsp;Unlocked&nbsp;also falls into that category. Can you talk a little bit about why it’s important to you to tell these female-centered stories?Michael Apted:&nbsp;I’ve always felt that women’s lives were intrinsically more dramatic than men’s, largely because they have the issue of having children, and so at some point in their life, they have to make a decision not to have children, or to have children. And just to compare two of my women’s films, one was Sissy [Spacek] in Coal Miner’s Daughter,&nbsp;when she burdened with having to bring up four children and have a career. And with Gorillas in the Mist, when Dian Fossey decided to abandon all kinds of social life. Although she liked men, and she liked clothes, and all those things, she decided to go live in these godawful mountains for 15, 16 years.I find that, at the heart of women’s stories, for me, there’s much more drama, much more emotion in it, because of the kind of expectations they have of life, how they’re expected maybe to have children, get married, blah, blah, blah. Even in something like the film I did with [John] Belushi,&nbsp;Continental Divide, which was directly on that motive,&nbsp;that there was this woman who’d gone on up and sit on the top of the mountain to follow birds around — eagles — and there was this kind of grubby newspaperman coming in and wondering what the hell was going on. Although it was a comedy, nonetheless underlying it was the fact that this woman has given up the expectations of her life to do this rather odd job, to try and see how many the eagles were and all this sort of stuff.And Nell, too. I just found women’s stories more emotional, and that’s what I have to look for in any film I do, is the emotion, whatever it is. It doesn’t have to be between a man and a woman. It can be with an older man, or a younger boy, or whatever, but as long as some emotional center to it, then I can come up with it. And I find that that’s why I’m attracted to stories with women.Only this one was slightly different, because this one was in place, and Noomi [Rapace]&nbsp;was in place and all that when I came in to do it, but nonetheless…&nbsp;I feel like every film I’ve done, there always seems to be women in it, which is just an instinctive choice on my part.RT: Going back to&nbsp;Unlocked, in the end, it’s a propulsive spy thriller, and it’s set in a sort of heightened reality, but it sort of sits in this interesting middle ground between truly fantastical stuff — like your James Bond film or the&nbsp;Chronicles of Narnia film that you did — and movies that are strictly based in reality, like the documentaries you make. Does something like&nbsp;Unlocked hit sort of a sweet spot for you as a filmmaker who has made films in both realms?Apted:&nbsp;It’s dealing with a horrendous issue. It’s slightly over-the-top and slightly unbelievable, but nonetheless it does ask questions about where we’re at or what we are, and it brings intimacy to the kind of dangerous life we’re all living, every time we go down the Underground, every time we get on a bus, or into the car. Without being too squeamish about it and all that, I found that that story took me into something that maybe people don’t think about quite enough. Not that we should all go around terrified of opening the door.But I thought, again, it was the kind of human way of expressing what is very troubling — not that it should ruin our lives, but we should not be unaware of it. So, yeah, it does… I mean, there’s the stuff that I do, I suppose, &nbsp;that is in the middle ground, if you like. That’s an astute observation on your part. But I think everything I do is basically a documentary. I mean, even things as outrageous as Bond and that.I remember with the Bond film, it was about getting gas out of the water, out of the Caspian, so I made them all go down there and have a look at it and see what was down there. We got some astonishing images. I shot some of them, in the design of the sets and all that kind stuff. It was this city in the middle of the Caspian sea. It was unbelievable. And had I not sort of said, “Well, look, I’ve got to find out how this really happens…” I find my documentary instinct always, at some point, comes to bear, and if it doesn’t, usually I don’t do a very good job.&nbsp;I like having that as a kind of back stop, if you know what I mean.I was very upset when I did Gorky Park, because they wouldn’t let us in. We did go in to start, but they threw us out when they realized what we were doing, that we were adapting this book. And they said, “There is no crime in Russia. Get out.” And they threw us out in a rather unceremonious, rather scary way, because this was pre-Gorbachev.But again, I felt… “God, I didn’t know what they had for breakfast,” and things like that, and how they live and all that. “How am I going to do this if I don’t know this stuff?” You know, I do my best with it, but I always love to have a kind of documentary or reality base to what I do.Unlocked&nbsp;opens in limited release this Friday, September 1.","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"Geographic, TCA, Christmas, Network, the, comiccon, historical","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/31131225/Michael-Apted-FFF1.jpg","slug":"michael-apteds-five-favorite-films"},{"id":"47508822687819","title":"Jon Bernthal’s Five Favorite Films","content":"Five Favorite Filmsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Jon Bernthal's Five Favorite Filmsby Ryan Fujitani | August 11, 2017 |  Comments(Photo by Dia Dipasupil/Getty Images)Even if his name doesn’t immediately ring a bell, you’ll almost certainly recognize Jon Bernthal‘s face. After a string of appearances in various TV series and smaller films, Bernthal found mainstream success with a pivotal role in the first two seasons of AMC’s The Walking Dead, which led to parts in Martin Scorsese’s The Wolf of Wall Street, David Ayer’s Fury, and Denis Villeneuve’s Sicario. Most recently, Bernthal appeared in Edgar Wright’s acclaimed Baby Driver and Taylor Sheridan’s thriller Wind River, and his turn as Marvel vigilante the Punisher in season 2 of Netflix’s Daredevil has led to a previously unplanned solo series for the character, set to drop later this year.This week, Bernthal stars opposite Richard Armitage and Tom Holland in the period drama Pilgrimage, about a group of 13th century Irish monks on a journey to escort a holy relic to Rome. He took some time to speak to RT about his Five Favorite Films, and explained why he couldn’t tell us when Punisher would arrive.GoodFellas (1990)  96%Alright, I’d say the first would have to be Goodfellas. I know that’s probably one you get a lot, but I remember it came out, and I was probably in about the 8th grade. Me and my buddy Dougie Thornel probably saw that at the theaters 30 times. I mean we would just go, and we would watch it, and then sit in the theater and watch it again. I can’t say enough good about it. It’s horrifying, it’s hilarious, it’s so unbelievably honest.Look, I mean, Scorsese is my favorite filmmaker. You know, the fact that I got the chance to work with him [on The Wolf of Wall Street] was sort of the mountaintop, the kind of crowning achievement of my career, and I don’t mean that in sort of how I’m perceived by the world. I just mean in terms of experience. My brief time on that movie really changed the way that I work as an actor. He’s one of these guys that makes you feel that anything is possible.I’ve studied in the Russian theater, and one of the main ways that we study was you get a scene and then you do a big improvisation about the scene and what the scene could be. That’s precisely how he worked. Each one of these scenes, you create this unbelievably vivid reality, you really take yourself to the place, and everybody feels like they are one hundred feet tall. It doesn’t matter whether you are background or whether you are craft services or anything, but everybody is so full of ideas. You make it on the day, and then he just sort of takes what he wants from that. I feel like that method of filmmaking that’s so Scorsese, so uniquely his, shines brightest in that movie. That sense of anything can happen at anytime, it’s happening right there in the moment. I think it really, really just shines brightest in that film, and that’s why it’s my favorite film.The Silence of the Lambs (1991)  96%Second I would say came out roughly around the same time but probably, The Silence of the Lambs. I just loved that movie. That too, me and my buddy Dougie Thornel… We actually were too young to get into that movie, but I remember one time we weren’t allowed in and then we snuck in anyway, and again, it was one where we went back and back and back.I think Ted Levine’s performance as Buffalo Bill is one of the most haunting performances that has ever happened on film. He’s an actor that I admire so deeply and I really love… Especially in the last few years, I’ve gotten to take these parts that are only in a few scenes and really create as rich a back story and history for the character as possible, and I thought he did that so cogently and so beautifully in that movie.Its not just that there are so many quotable lines, but you really see the depths of the torture that’s going through him. It’s such a meditation on serial killing and psychotic murderers, and I love the fact that Hannibal Lecter — obviously one of the great characters of all time — but I just love the fact that you don’t know whether to root for him or against him. I think it’s the ultimate anti-hero character, and the fact that they were able to achieve him being able to… you know, at the end of the movie, you’re actually rooting for him, that he got out and that he’s going to go eat people. I think that’s just so f—ing awesome. And obviously the scene with Levine and Jodie Foster with the night vision. It’s a book that I loved and I think its one of those rare times where I think the movie totally even outshines the book. Wow, what a film. It will always be one of my favorites.True Romance (1993)  92%Then, next I would say, would have to be True Romance. Again, I just cannot say enough good about that movie. It’s a movie I can just watch over and over and over and over again. It really, to me, defined what love is and it defined what… It was just the coolest movie ever made, but so heartfelt and so honest, and every performance is so rich. God, I just love that f—ing film, man. I just absolutely love it, and I believe every second of it too, and I cannot say enough good about that one.A Prophet (Un prophete) (2010)  96%Then A Prophet. I love that movie. I think one of the greatest things about films is when they can take you to a very certain time and a very certain place. It’s time travel, its magic. I know nothing about what French prison would be like, I know nothing about it, but I believe every single second of that film. I feel like, after you watch that film, you know a little bit about what that’s like. I know how difficult that is to do. I just think it’s a beautiful honest moment, and I think that he deals with the immediacy of panic and how being panicked can change you and what people will do to survive. Its a brilliant film.D.C. Cab (1983)  22%Lastly, I gotta throw it in there, I gotta say D.C. Cab. [laughs] I know that probably no one else says that, but I’m born and raised DC. I’m DC through and through. It will always be in my heart. Again, me and little Dougie Thornel grew up watching that movie on VHS over and over and over again. It shows a little bit of the real DC that I think never gets shown in films and television. I just love the movie. I think it’s the only honest DC movie ever made, and its funny as hell.RT: We’re talking about the Joel Schumacher movie with Mr. T, right?That’s right. Yeah, Mr. T and the Barbarian Brothers. [laughs] It was a great movie, man. He also made Saint Elmo’s Fire and all those movies, which are kind of like Georgetown and kind of made about the DC everybody thinks is DC, but that’s not the real DC. D.C. Cab is real DC. There’s this scene at the end, through the credits, where they do this parade — it’s just the most honest thing ever. I love the film.RT: You mention your old friend Dougie Thornel quite a bit.Jon Bernthal: I gotta say, with Dougie, to this day, every film I do, every moment I do, when I’m working on a moment in a film, I still ask myself, would this make little Dougie Thornel laugh? Would this make him want to watch? Would the two of us, sitting there on the milk crates in a s—ty ass room watching TV, would this be something that we would buy and we would think is funny or hilarious? Its called the Dougie Test, and I do it on everything I do.RT: Any chance I can get the Punisher release date out of you?Bernthal: [laughs]&nbsp;No, of course not man, no! First of all, I don’t know it, and even if I did there are like… You know, they take that s— so seriously. They know better. They don’t even tell me, so you couldn’t even trick me.Pilgrimage&nbsp;opens&nbsp;in limited release today, August 11.","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"The, HBO, Ovation, thriller, medical, actors, Christmas","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/11153419/Jon-Bernthal-FFF1.jpg","slug":"jon-bernthals-five-favorite-films"},{"id":"47508824259663","title":"Tony Hale’s Five Favorite Films","content":"Five Favorite Filmsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Tony Hale's Five Favorite FilmsThe star of Arrested Development, Veep, and this week's Brave New Jersey on The Goonies, Lord of the Rings, and quarter-pounders with cheese.by Ryan Fujitani | August 2, 2017 |  Comments(Photo by Priscilla Grant/Everett Collection)Even with a ton of screen credits to his name, including appearances in major feature films, popular TV staples, and a number of animated projects, Tony Hale is still best known for his roles as Buster Bluth on&nbsp;Arrested Development and Gary Walsh on&nbsp;Veep, the latter of which has already earned him two Emmy awards and another nomination&nbsp;this year. This week, he makes a trip to the big screen in&nbsp;Brave New Jersey, a comedy about a small New Jersey town whose terrified citizens panic after hearing Orson Welles’ famous&nbsp;War of the Worlds radio broadcast.Hale graciously took some time out of his family vacation in Tennessee, where&nbsp;Brave New Jersey was shot, to talk to RT about his Five Favorite Films, mass hysteria, quarter-pounders with cheese, and the amount of abuse he takes on his most popular show.Punch-Drunk Love (2002)  79%Punch-Drunk Love is at the very top of the list. Like everybody else, I’m a huge fan of Paul Thomas Anderson. The journey that he took Adam Sandler on in that movie, starting as a guy who is very put-upon and all this kind of stuff, and then love came into his life through Emily Watson. Just to see that journey. There’s a great scene at the end when he just totally stands up to Philip Seymour Hoffman at his mattress store, and there’s that time when Emily’s in the car with him, and he grabs… I think it was a tire iron in the car and swings. It’s just such a great moment. And then that crying scene with the therapist in the closet. I mean, it was just perfection, that entire film, for me.Lars and the Real Girl (2007)  81%And then I would say second would be Lars and the Real Girl by Craig Gillepsie. You read the log line and you’re like, “Huh, blow-up doll. Interesting.” But then, the whole movie is really talking about everybody’s desperate need for community. We’re not made to be isolated; we’re not made to be alone. And also how the town embraces the doll. There’s even one time when Ryan Gosling had to let the doll go, and the whole town came and sat in his living room, and they didn’t say anything. Many times, in those kinds of death scenes, people have a lot of talking, but they just kind of sat there with him. I loved that.The Goonies (1985)  76%I’m going to throw The Goonies in there, because as a kid, that was just the ultimate fantasy. That was every kid’s fantasy. I watched it over and over and over. The fact that they slid through the rocks, and she’s playing the bone piano, and all that kind of stuff. You’re like, “What? Is this really happening?” And it never gets old. I saw it recently with my daughter, and I was still into it.The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (2001)  91%I’d put The Fellowship of the Ring in there. I just think Peter Jackson did a fantastic job with the movie, and I loved those books. It’s one of those things where, reading the books, and getting so excited about them, and just praying that the movie did it justice. And it totally did, to me. Plus, the relationship between Frodo and Sam, and Gollum, and all of that. I loved it. I’m also a huge fan of The Chronicles of Narnia, and I had the opposite experience with that, where it just didn’t click like it did with The Lord of the Rings. So I just loved what Peter Jackson did with that.Inside Out (2015)  98%Rounding it out would be Inside Out. I remember seeing that with my family on one of our family vacations during the summer, and just how they interpreted emotions to kids. There’s such an emphasis in society to “Be happy, be happy, be happy!” but you have to give kids the permission to feel sad. You have to give them permission to feel the range of emotions. That’s really healthy. And how creatively it was done, and it didn’t hurt that Amy Poehler was the voice of Joy. It just worked. I’m a huge Pixar fan, and it just completely worked.Ryan Fujitani for Rotten Tomatoes: I haven’t seen Brave New Jersey, but I love the idea behind it. Having said that, I know the public panic at the time has been greatly exaggerated in the years since. Do you know if the story is based on some obscure real-life incident that actually happened? Or was it just a fun idea to explore?Tony Hale:&nbsp;That’s a great question. I know that there was, in New Jersey, a lot of widespread panic that happened, because back then, all they had was the radio. So the family would sit around at night and they would listen to the radio. They got most of their news, they got most of their entertainment from that. It just so happened that this small town in Jersey missed the first part where it was announced that this was a dramatic reading, and they just took everything else as fact and really thought Martians were coming to destroy the Earth, and they were like an hour from where they were in Jersey. So the town just went into hysteria.I think that’s what initially drew me to it, because back then, they only had the radio, so it kind of made sense that they didn’t have a fact-checker. Whereas today, there’s still mass hysteria, and we have fact-checkers. We actually can check facts and sources. So that was really interesting to me.Also, just the idea that somebody said, “If today was your last day to live, how would you do things differently?” For my character, Clark, he was a guy who was kind of put upon; he was a mayor that was just going through the motions, and it forced him to analyze what he wants and what he values, and priorities just got knocked into place.RT: Did you guys do any fun research for the film, like listening to the original broadcast or reading old newspaper clippings of the incident?Hale: Yeah, Jody had really done his research and sent us all that. He sent us the broadcast, he sent us all the articles, so we were able to kind of see the hysteria that happened from this broadcast. Actually, after it, I think Orson Welles did an apology, and from what I heard, it was done very, very well. It sounded very authentic. I mean, if I were put in that position, I would have done the same thing.RT: You did touch on this a minute ago, and I’m sure you’ve already answered it a million times, so I’m not going to ask what you would do on your last day on Earth. Instead, I’d like to know what you would choose as your last meal, and what would be the one exciting, dangerous, possibly illegal thing or crazy adventure you’d attempt that you never had the chance to do before?Hale:&nbsp;Oh, good question. That, I love. My sister’s actually in the car, and she’s going to be very angry with this answer, because she’s a very good cook, but it would be a quarter-pounder with cheese, with fries and a chocolate shake. That would, hands down, be it, immediately. My first and final answer. And my wife just said, “Oh yeah, that would definitely be your last meal. Because you would die.”I don’t know if I would do anything crazy. This is kind of going back to the general question, but it forces you to be present. I think so much of my life is a fight to be present, you know? And so, rather than doing something, it would just force you to stay where you are and be in the now. It wouldn’t be as much of a fight, because you would say, “No, I’ve got to force myself today to at least do that, to at least be present.”(Photo by Gravitas Ventures)RT: What’s your character in Brave New Jersey like?Hale:&nbsp;Well, he’s the mayor of the town. I think he was probably pushed into that role. I don’t think he carries a lot of weight; he doesn’t have a lot of responsibility. It’s just in title alone, and people’s expectations of him are kind of low. He doesn’t really step up to the plate. So he just goes through the motions, and I think he very much feels the fact that he’s going through the motions. He’s ready for something to change, but he doesn’t know how to change it. He’s just kind of walking through water a little bit.When this happens, he’s still trying to figure out what to do, but then he has that moment of, “I’ve gotta step up to the plate. I’ve gotta act. Whatever my emotions, my thoughts, are saying, forget it, and just do it.” He’s a pretty average guy, just living day-to-day in a bit of a fog, and this snaps him out of it.RT: So, speaking of average, put-upon characters living in a fog, you’re best known for your work on Arrested Development and Veep, and on both shows, you play anxious, put-upon characters who take a lot of abuse. Now, I don’t remember when I first saw you do a live interview, but what struck me was how well-composed, well-spoken, thoughtful, and genuinely nice you seem to be. How do you get into that headspace to play characters like Buster Bluth or Gary on Veep and not come home from a day on set just exhausted?Hale:&nbsp;Oh, it comes from a lot of pain. A lot of pain. I think the scary thing is that it comes very naturally. Here’s the thing. I can only speak for myself, but when I enter into these things, I have to come from a place where you have to begin believing what people are saying. If I really believed what somebody was saying to me, how would I react? Like, I remember Reid Scott, who plays Dan on Veep, called me “cow eyes” on one of the episodes, and it’s just kind of like, “Wow, that’s jarring.”But it’s just naturally how I would react. There are so many sexual jokes and crazy things talked about on the set. If I were standing there, in an elevator, listening to that stuff, I would probably have the same reaction. You know, like, “I can’t believe I’m overhearing this conversation.” I can’t say anything — and this is just Tony speaking — because I’m not in their conversation, but even as Gary, he doesn’t really speak up. He doesn’t speak about politics, he doesn’t know anything about politics. So his facial reactions are how I think anybody would respond, like, “Whoa, that was harsh,” or “I didn’t need to hear that.”What I’m most amazed about with Gary is that he stays, because the amount of abuse that he gets, and then bounces back, it’s pretty fascinating. I mean, that’s incredibly dysfunctional. But he just kind of bounces back. Even though, in the show, you get used to a certain type of dialogue and language, it’s intense language, and I think a lot of it is just acting naturally. That’s how I would respond.What I get the most joy out of on Veep is, the writers work very, very hard on the scripts, and they give us a lot of material to work with. But when we get on set and we’re in a scene, there’s a moment that Julia and I typically have, where we can find the physicality in the script. “Okay, what if I drop your coat here?” or “What if you fell over the bannister here, and I try to catch you?” You know, stuff that’s not scripted, but we can take it, hopefully, to another level — that, to me, is the most fun, because I love that kind of physical humor.Brave New Jersey&nbsp;opens&nbsp;in limited release this Friday, August 4.","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"Day, Opinion, Emmys, Islander, Best, cancelled, Cosplay, marvel","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/02202635/Tony-Hale-FFF1.jpg","slug":"tony-hales-five-favorite-films"},{"id":"47508822694989","title":"Elizabeth Olsen’s Five Favorite Films","content":"Five Favorite Filmsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Elizabeth Olsen's Five Favorite Filmsby Ryan Fujitani | August 4, 2017 |  Comments(Photo by Mireya Acierto/Getty Images)Right after her breakout performance in 2011’s&nbsp;Martha Marcy May Marlene and just ahead of the release of the horror film&nbsp;Silent House, Rotten Tomatoes spoke to then rising star Elizabeth Olsen about her Five Favorite Films. Five years have passed since then, and Olsen has made the most of her opportunities, appearing in smaller independent films as well as gigantic blockbusters like&nbsp;Godzilla and the Marvel Cinematic Universe movies.This week, she stars alongside fellow Avenger Jeremy Renner in acclaimed writer/director Taylor Sheridan’s new thriller Wind River, which follows a pair of law enforcement agents on the trail of a murderer in rural Wyoming. RT spoke to Olsen, who decided it would be fun to compare her current list of Five Favorite Films with the one she picked in 2012. She also talked about the new film and how her perspective has changed since she began her career.The First Wives Club (1996)  50%I would watch that movie on VHS every night before bed for maybe two years.&nbsp;I’ve always felt a very close kinship with middle-aged women. [laughs] When I was in elementary school, I felt like I understood it. [laughs]&nbsp;I don’t know why.&nbsp;It’s three greats, three great female comedians, and the final song and dance at the end, “You Don’t Own Me,” was something Sarah Paulson and I recreated many a time, filming Martha Marcy May Marlene. It had a new meaning, all of a sudden.Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom (1984)  84%Indiana Jones, that trilogy I just rewatched on a plane from a holiday I just took. I watched all three, and Temple of Doom just continues to win me over.&nbsp;I know; usually, people like The Last Crusade, and there’s a lot of love for Raiders, because it’s the original. But&nbsp;Temple of Doom is just, to me, so funny and entertaining and fun. And the kid from Goonies&nbsp;— Hot Shot? Short Round.&nbsp;He’s so funny, and I grew up with Goonies, but I prefer him in Indiana Jones.What, you didn’t like Data in&nbsp;The Goonies?No, I loved him. Obviously, he had all his fun little tricks, all the things that he would shoot out and cling on. I do, I just love Indiana Jones so much, and I believe Harrison Ford is one of the best big movie actors. While he is still engaged in something that’s really active and he keeps the intensity of the moment. Now I can appreciate it, because I don’t know how to be funny in the Avengers movies. He keeps the intensity, but then he still can be sly and charming and funny. Same thing in Star Wars. I just think he’s so good.A Woman Under the Influence (1975)  90%Between Opening Night and A Woman Under the Influence, Cassavetes. I still dream, to this day, of having an experience. I thought the borderline guys are the modern version of this, of creating a really intimate, truly intimate environment, without any kind of producers with creative control, or any kind of desire of a specific distribution, but to just make stories that you want to make because they are close to you and personal and interesting and character-driven. Gena Rowlands, to me, is&nbsp;so amazing to watch. That’s something I discovered more in my early 20s, Cassavetes movies.Return to Oz (1985)  54%Return to Oz was just one of my favorite films as a kid. If you watch it any time recently, it’s one of the most disturbing films made for children.Oh, definitely. And I love that movie myself. To be honest, I think I actually have a deeper connection to that movie than the original&nbsp;Wizard of Oz.Oh yeah, me, too. Absolutely, by eons. That was the film that my friend Clay and I were just obsessed with for our whole childhood, with the wheelers&nbsp;and the woman with the hallway full of heads. That was a movie we loved.Annie Hall (1977)  96%Woody Allen — namely the Diane Keaton collaborative days — those movies were really important to me when I was like 15, 16 years old, because it was when I discovered watching them and went through the canon. I, for the first time, had seen a woman that I was like, “Oh, I can be that kind of a woman. I’m not really the nerd, I’m not really the charactery person. I’m not really the sexy one, but I am a neurotic, nervous, but semi-intelligent one, but I also say stupid things.” It felt comforting to know that that was an example of a kind of woman I could be when I grew up and when I was going through that transition in teenagehood.Ryan Fujitani for Rotten Tomatoes: So there was only one duplicate between this list and the one you chose last time, and that’s&nbsp;Annie Hall. You mentioned at the time that you loved Woody Allen, so another one of your choices was&nbsp;Manhattan. Then you also picked&nbsp;Gone with the Wind,&nbsp;Roman Holiday, and&nbsp;Pal Joey.Olsen:&nbsp;Oh, I said&nbsp;Pal Joey? That’s cute, that’s cute. I think, probably,&nbsp;Roman Holiday, I must have been going through a phase or just enjoying watching that movie. I don’t have very many movies. I think&nbsp;Roman Holiday is right next to&nbsp;Heavyweights on my iTunes movie list.RT: That’s a weird double feature.Olsen: Also, probably,&nbsp;Seven might be right above it. It’s a very strange group. [laughs]RT: So let’s talk about the film. Taylor Sheridan wrote and directed&nbsp;Wind River, and he’s been actor for a long time.&nbsp;Was it different working with someone as a director who had done all three things?Elizabeth Olsen: I don’t know. I would actually be curious to ask Taylor, but I think he probably would have approached all three — whether it was being an actor, a writer, or a director — I think he approaches them very similarly, which is just trying to tell an authentic truth of an experience that he has had, or that he knows of, or that he had learned about. I think why people are drawn to his writing is because it’s poetic while showing active, driven stories where character becomes unfolded. It’s not just about the action. The action is how we understand characters better, because of how they approach whatever obstacles that come their way and then we learn about them.He’s a very straightforward, no bulls— kind of guy. That’s why he writes the way he writes. That’s the way he directs, and I’m assuming that maybe that’s what he did as an actor.&nbsp;Sometimes, it’s hard to do that as an actor, because there are so many things that are fake that you’re dealing with.&nbsp;That’s why it’s not for everyone.I do know that he’s a great bulls— detector, and he’s really great at telling you. He’s a great lie detector, and I think that’s what I want in a director. I want them to have a great vision and understanding of the tone and the world they’re trying to create, and I want them to be passionate about the story we’re making. I also want them to just say, “That wasn’t good,” or, “This is how you can do it better,” or, “How about you try this?” He’s very good at that, and so is Jeremy. The three of us together, I think it was a very trusting and comfortable set to be on, because no one was just trying to stroke each other’s egos.(Photo by The Weinstein Company)RT: Speaking of Jeremy Renner, it feels to me, at least based on a lot of the media coverage that comes from the set, that&nbsp;the Avengers cast is a fairly tight group, and I’m wondering if either you or Jeremy played a part in recruiting the other for this film?Olsen:&nbsp;I was attached to the movie first. I was attached to it for a year, and there was another actor — I think that’s public knowledge at this point — that was attached as well. Scheduling didn’t work out, and Taylor wanted to make it the during the winter we made it. He said, “How about Jeremy?” I said, “I love Jeremy. It would be incredible to get to work with him.”But I felt uncomfortable pushing it on him, because we weren’t that close. If it were Aaron Taylor Johnson, I’d be on him to do it because Aaron and I have that kind of friendship. Now Jeremy and I do, but at the time, it was more of just a work relationship and semi-social. I think I might have just sent him a text message once saying, “Did you read this script yet? I’m doing it. I just wanted to let you know that I’m definitely doing it, and it’s not someone just… Whispering that in your ear, or something.”I told Taylor I didn’t want to be too pushy about it, because I don’t think Jeremy responds well to that.&nbsp;Taylor just sent him a note and said, “Dude, read 10 pages of this script, and if you hate it, you don’t have to finish reading it, and I’ll buy you a nice bottle of booze.” That’s the story that I’ve heard now a gazillion times, since we’ve been doing press. He loved the script and that was it. We started filming a month or two later. It was really fast. He&nbsp;finished the script. He devoured it and wanted to do it.RT:&nbsp;When we first spoke with you, it was five years ago in 2012. You’d just done&nbsp;Martha Marcy May Marlene and&nbsp;Silent House, and you had stuff like&nbsp;Kill Your Darlings and&nbsp;Old Boy coming out. You expressed at that time a desire to challenge yourself with a&nbsp;lot of different roles. So, looking back on the past five years and the rapid rise of your career, do you feel like you’ve settled into a groove now? That you have a handle on the kids of projects you want to do and want to be involved with?Olsen:&nbsp;Yeah. I think the first, I would say, four or five years of working, I was just so excited to be working. I was excited to do every kind of movie. I wasn’t thinking, really, about the producers or the directors, the DP. My mind didn’t work in that way. I wasn’t even thinking about, “What’s a creative arc that I want to create for myself?” That has altered and that has changed.I really love working. I think that’s also part of the problem, because I don’t want to have free time. I like to go from one film to the next to the next with just maybe a week or two in between, because that’s all I really need to decompress. I think I just got a little excited at the beginning, and I wasn’t making the most discerning decisions.Now, I do feel like I have made decisions, even though it’s almost impossible to compare and contrast Ingrid Goes West and Wind River. They were both projects I really wanted to be a part of, and I thought made sense for me, for what I want to put out there, that are&nbsp;completely different. They don’t have to be similar. It is interesting, and now I’m diving a little bit into the development side of things.It hasn’t even been 10 years yet for me, but it’s still a much more knowledgeable perspective now, obviously, than I had in 2012 after working for like a year and a half or something.&nbsp;I seemingly get wiser. I think maybe in 10 years, I’ll tell myself that I was an idiot today, but we’ll see.Wind River&nbsp;opens&nbsp;in limited release this Friday, August 4.","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"awards, BBC, TV","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/04151843/Elizabeth-Olsen-FFF1.jpg","slug":"elizabeth-olsens-five-favorite-films"},{"id":"47508822675528","title":"Dave Bautista’s Five Favorite Films","content":"Five Favorite Filmsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Dave Bautista's Five Favorite Filmsby Ryan Fujitani | August 25, 2017 |  Comments(Photo by Karwai Tang/Getty Images)Long before he landed the role of Drax the Destroyer in Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy, Dave Bautista was already a star&nbsp;to WWE fans, who knew him as Batista, a villain-turned-fan favorite and eventual World Heavyweight Champion. Since leaving the professional wrestling world behind, Bautista has been a reliable presence in action films ranging from smaller thrillers to big budget affairs like the James Bond film&nbsp;Spectre,&nbsp;the&nbsp;Marvel Cinematic Universe movies, and the hotly anticipated&nbsp;Blade Runner 2049, which opens in October.This week, Bautista stars alongside Brittany Snow (Pitch Perfect) in&nbsp;Bushwick, an urban action thriller about a young woman and a janitor attempting to survive a domestic militia invasion in their home neighborhood. Bautista spoke with Rotten Tomatoes about his Five Favorite Films, making movies on a limited budget, and what it was like to film the long, single-shot scenes that comprise&nbsp;Bushwick.Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope (1977)  92%I think a lot of ’70s films, like later ’70s films seem to be some of my favorites. I’m going to say, I’m going to go with Star Wars.&nbsp;I don’t know what it was. It may have just been the time when I saw it, the time it was, with childhood, but everything about that film just makes me feel good. I just, I love it. I never get tired of it. Even back when I was a kid and I saw it in the theaters, I was just… Maybe just because it was so new and fresh, and it was just so original, and so inspiring.The Force, it just made you feel good. It made you think that miracles could happen, or there was just this higher power that could give you this energy, only positive things, and you could defeat evil with it. Everything about it, the movie, and I mean, the sounds of the film, the music, and the toys, and just everything about it. It might have been just that time, but everything about it just brings me right back to 1977 when I was a child, and so I just love everything about it.RT: I assume you saw that in the theaters when it came out.Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah. I still have collectibles,&nbsp;Star Wars collectibles.RT: I have to tell you, when I saw the first&nbsp;Guardians of the Galaxy with one of my friends, he said to me afterwards, “You know what this is? This is Star Wars for this generation.”Man, that’s so awesome. That’s really, that’s such a compliment.&nbsp;I remember James Gunn saying that he had such a strong affection for The Empire Strikes Back. He said he didn’t want to emulate that film, but he wanted people to walk away with the same feeling that he left The Empire Strikes Back&nbsp;with. So that’s really a huge compliment.The Godfather (1972)  97%I’m going to go with&nbsp;The Godfather. It’s weird — I didn’t see The Godfather in theaters. I actually saw it on television. I think when I was a little kid, they ran it in a series.&nbsp;It was on over three or four days on television. I remember just being immediately sucked in, and I was a young kid. My mom was actually amazed that I was just so sucked in. I kept asking her all these questions about the film that she had no answer for, and didn’t really care to sit down and watch it, and couldn’t answer the questions, but I was just so curious and I just loved all the drama of it, you know? And it still, it holds up. My wife and I were just watching it on HBO — I think it was HBO — like last night or the night before. They play part one and part two together now. It’s like five hours of&nbsp;The Godfather.To Kill A Mockingbird (1962)  92%I’m going to go with To Kill a Mockingbird.&nbsp;Something about that film… Man, it’s hard to put in words, but there’s something very peaceful about that film. There’s something that is really… There’s such a strong sense of right and wrong in that film, but there’s something also that’s just reminiscent of childhood. I don’t know if that makes sense, but there’s just something very peaceful about that film that I love. Gregory Peck, his performance, he’s just so strong in that film. Also, seeing a young Robert Duvall is really strange.&nbsp;I love the overall message about the film. There’s just a strong sense of justice. I think that would be the best term I could use. I love that film.Close Encounters of the Third Kind (1977)  94%I’m going to go with Close Encounters of the Third Kind. It’s amazing. It’s just one of those films that, if it’s on — I have the DVD too — but if it’s on, I just can’t not watch it. A&nbsp;lot of times, that’s how I know that films are my favorite, if they’re on and I just can’t change the channel, and just have to watch it, even though I’ve seen it a million times, and it holds up and it’s still fresh, and it still feels good to me. That’s one of those films. I love everything about it. Again, it’s just one of those movies that makes you think, and it’s inspiring, and it just feels good, and it feels magical. I love Richard Dreyfuss as well, and Jaws&nbsp;is also one of my favorite films. But just the performance, and the whole tones at the end with the aliens, as they’re coming out, it’s just a feelgood film.La La Land (2016)  91%Just for sh–s and giggles, I want to pick a recent one, but you just never know until years go by whether movies stand up. You love them at first, and you love them the first five times, but 10 years down the line, will you still not be able to switch the channel if this film comes on? I don’t know, but I’m going to pick one, my favorite film of last year. I’m going to say&nbsp;La La Land.I recently worked with Adam Siegel, who was one of the producers. I worked with him on a film called Hotel Artemis, and we have had this conversation, and he asked me what I loved about it. This was the first time I really pinpointed it.&nbsp;I didn’t go when it first came out, because I just didn’t have any interest — musical, just not my thing, I just don’t. So I didn’t really want to go see it. Then it was re-released after the Golden Globes, and I was like, “I’ve got to go see what the hype is all about.” I went and saw it, and I sat in the theater by myself, thinking, “This is the best thing I’ve seen in a long time.”What it was, was that it made me feel like Hollywood was romantic again.&nbsp;I don’t feel that when I go out there.&nbsp;What I feel like now is that it’s a town full of people who want to be on reality shows. It made me feel like old Hollywood. It just made me feel romantic, like this is what I love about films. There was just something very romantic about that film, and just I love it. Then the music is incredible.What I really, really love about it is it’s just completely unpredictable, because up until the very end of that film, I had no idea how it was going to end, and I love that. That is so hard to do nowadays, just to keep people guessing right up to the last two minutes of the film. Like, it’s almost impossible. They did it, and not only did it, but in a magical, exciting way. I just love that movie. And some of the shots, I mean, just technically, some of the shots were amazing. Like, I still don’t know how the hell they did that shot in the pool. When I saw it, I couldn’t believe it, and I just thought and thought and thought, and was trying to figure out how the hell they shot that.Ryan Fujitani for Rotten Tomatoes: Your new film this week is&nbsp;Bushwick. Where was it actually shot?Dave Bautista:&nbsp;It was filmed in Bushwick.RT: Wait, really?Bautista:&nbsp;Yeah, yeah, we filmed it in New York in December, and we actually were lucky with the weather.&nbsp;Yeah, no, we filmed it there. The directors lived there for… I think they still live there, actually.&nbsp;That’s their community and that’s where they wanted to film it. That’s where the whole idea for this came about, so yeah, that’s where we filmed it. I actually lived in Williamsburg, in Brooklyn for six weeks, and that’s where we shot. Not Williamsburg, but in Bushwick.RT:&nbsp;The reason I’m surprised&nbsp;is because one of the defining aspects of this film is its super-long takes. There are several long shots&nbsp;that just kind of take you weaving in and out of the streets. I&nbsp;wondered how you guys would have been able to shut down all these multiple streets at the same time for these shots that I’m sure you had to do more than once.Bautista:&nbsp;It was a lot of camera tricks. [laughs] At the end of the day, I’m sure they digitally erased a few people and cars, because we just didn’t have the budget to shut down streets. There were certain days where we had blocks blocked off for a certain amount of time, or we could stop traffic for minutes at a time. Then we could just make sure the camera wasn’t facing the street. But it was just a lot of people being very creative.Like I said, it was a very limited budget, and we just didn’t have… Even the guns we used — I mean, they were plastic guns that had no gunfire coming out of them. We were going “bang, bang” inside of our head, and we just didn’t have them. We didn’t have permits for that, so it was just a lot of people just being very creative with limited resources.There were actually even a couple of takes — I mean, because they were long takes — once we were four, five minutes into a take, you don’t want to bust it because people are walking through, but it did happen.&nbsp;We were running down the streets from — supposedly, people are shooting at us, and then somebody comes walking through our shot, smiling, having a great day, eating a bag of chips or whatever, and the shot’s busted. It happened, yeah.RT:&nbsp;So when that happened, would that be a re-shoot situation, or would that be something that could be fixed in post, so to speak?Bautista:&nbsp;Yeah, no, well, so the first time that happened, I had a complete meltdown. [laughs]&nbsp;Because once I get into it, and we’re like four or five minutes into a take, and you’re just totally emotionally invested in this, and somebody comes walking through your shot and just completely takes you out of it. I just had a meltdown. Then the director said, “Next time if we’re that far into it, just don’t stop. We will digitally erase them later.” So&nbsp;that was how I learned my lesson. But yeah, the first time that happened, I was literally like, “Oh man, are you kidding me?!”RT:&nbsp;I wouldn’t want to be the person just walking down the street, eating a bag of chips, who made Dave Bautista furious.Bautista:&nbsp;Well, I wouldn’t direct it towards them. I would never say, “Get the f— out of our shot!” [laughs]&nbsp;But I was like, “Oh, come on.”RT:&nbsp;In preparation for those long takes, was it difficult to stay in character while you’re trying to focus on remembering the dialog and where to run, where to duck, and so forth?Bautista:&nbsp;No, not so much, man, because it’s weird — once we got going, we really hit the ground running, and there just wasn’t that time to try to snap out of character.&nbsp;We just worked non-stop, because not only did we have limited time to shoot the film, but we were also playing with real time, so we had to use the natural light, the daylight, and we had to stay on kind of a timeline. We were very limited, so once you got in there, everybody was just really, really focused.RT:&nbsp;Did you guys have to stick pretty closely to a script, or did the nature of the film present opportunities&nbsp;to improvise?Bautista:&nbsp;No, it was very open to improvise.&nbsp;A lot of times it was very open, and sometimes it was for the better, sometimes not so much, because it left a lot of empty gaps or maybe a little bit of untold story, but it’s kind of one of those things where this was the risk that we were all taking. &nbsp;We just all kind of put it out there and we tried to fill it in the best we could, or interact with one another, Brittany and I, as naturally as possible, but that’s just the risk of doing this type of film.Bushwick&nbsp;opens in limited release this Friday, August 25.","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"Arrowverse, superhero, book, wars, Premiere, Crunchyroll, superman","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/25161713/Dave-Bautista-FFF1.jpg","slug":"dave-bautistas-five-favorite-films"},{"id":"47508824276050","title":"Flying Lotus’ Five Favorite Films","content":"Five Favorite Filmsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Flying Lotus' Five Favorite Filmsby Ryan Fujitani | July 20, 2017 |  Comments(Photo by Daniel Boczarski/Getty Images)As the grandnephew of Alice Coltrane, LA-based recording artist Flying Lotus (a.k.a. Captain Murphy a.k.a. Steven Ellison) draws from a variety of eclectic influences to create his music, a unique blend of experimental jazz, hip-hop, and electronic compositions. Even if his name doesn’t ring any bells, there’s a decent chance you’ve heard his work, whether it was the dreamy track behind a late-night Adult Swim promo or one of his collaborations with the likes of Erykah Badu, Radiohead’s Thom Yorke and Jonny Greenwood, or Kendrick Lamar. In fact, his work on the latter’s album To Pimp a Butterfly earned him two Grammy nominations last year.But Ellison is interested in more than just music, and this week, he makes his feature film directorial debut with Kuso, a collection of loosely connected post-apocalyptic vignettes that range from the comedic to the horrific, sometimes in the same scene. This is a hard-to-describe film that will divide even audiences accustomed to midnight movie fare.&nbsp;Ahead of Kuso‘s exclusive streaming release on Shudder (and a limited run in LA’s Silent Movie Theatre), Ellison took some time to speak with RT about his Five Favorite Films, and while he gravitated to the ones that inspired&nbsp;Kuso, it was clear his passion for movies&nbsp;runs deep.Beetlejuice (1988)  85%Well, first off, I’ll say Beetlejuice because that is my number one movie of all time, period. I know it’s not like no f—in’ Orson Welles s—, but I swear to god,&nbsp;Beetlejuice was, to me, the greatest movie ever made.&nbsp;It’s amazing, and it’s so fun. It’s so fun and it ages well.You know, watching it as a kid was great, and as you get older you’re like, “Oh these were some dirty jokes in here.” I remember I loved it then, and then I got high and saw it, and I was like, “Oh my god! Dude, what the…” It was amazing.I’ve never tried that. That’s something to put on the bucket list.Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. Watch Beetlejuice stoned, for real, if you never have. That movie is f—ing awesome.&nbsp;It’s so original. It’s so original. There’s nothing like it.Funky Forest: The First Contact (Naisu no Mori: The First Contact) (2005)  20%Funky Forest. It’s a Japanese movie. It’s kind of like a patchwork film, kind of like&nbsp;Kuso is, in a way.&nbsp;I think it was heavily influential in just like, “OK well, it doesn’t all have to be … It can feel more like a short film, but in the same world, in an absurd world.” I think it was really, really inspiring for me. It had a lot of body comedy in that movie, a lot of really cool prosthetic effects that mixed with CGI, I think. It’s one of the movies where people will just be like, “What the f— is this? What is this?” And it’s not perfect movie, but it is, at times, perfect.Tetsuo: The Ironman (1989)  79%Another one is Tetsuo: The Ironman, directed by Shin’ya Tsukamoto.&nbsp;To me that’s up there. That’s up there for me. I’d say the whole Tetsuo series, just because it’s such a beautifully handcrafted movie. You can tell there’s so much in it. I love that kind of, you know, like the early Tim Burtons and the David Lynches and all that stuff. There’s something about this Shin’ya Tsukamoto stuff. It was just at the perfect time when cyber-punk — what cyber-punk looked like — he was one of those people kind of establishing that.And whether people know it or not, Tetsuo: The Ironman was just hugely influential on everything, on sci-fi after that. It became like a design resource for everybody f—ing with sci-fi. You know, people have seen these images without even knowing the movie. It’s really, really awesome. I just think about it still, like, “How did they do that with no money, really? How did they pull this s— off and build these amazing effects?” They had to redub all the audio because there was no audio when they filmed it. There were a lot of elements against them too, but they pulled it off and it’s still just so amazing. I just hope to do a fraction of that with my own film.Having finished&nbsp;Kuso, you must kind of know what that feels like, right?Yeah, I get it. I get it. I get it to an extent, you know?&nbsp;But I think in their case, they had a lot less people to count on, and I think they had more elements against them. I think the one thing that I’ve learned about this s— so far is you just have to use what you’ve got, because it ain’t gonna be easy. So what do you have around you? There it is. There’s the movie. Especially when you have no money, you know? Know your world.Fantastic Planet (1973)  91%We can throw in Fantastic Planet,&nbsp;La planète sauvage.&nbsp;We can&nbsp;&nbsp;throw that in there. The cut-out animation style, the psychedelia of it. I think it’s such a hypnotic piece of work, and I loved it ever since I heard the samples of the movie. I heard the samples before I saw anything.&nbsp;Madlib sampled that s—. I was like, “What is this animated movie?” So I credit him for me hearing about this, and I have just been on it ever since. I own some of the original cut-outs of the movie that they did. I buy some weird little pieces of art sometimes, but that is one of my prized possessions right there. You know, bits of little movie history.Eraserhead (1977)  90%What kind of a–hole would I be without giving David Lynch some love, but I can’t figure out which movie I’d pick of his. I think I’ll have to say Eraserhead in this case, because it was his movie where he put all of himself into it, you know? Every little bit of what he could do on his own, he did it, in terms of designing things and building things and whatever he actually could do and put forth, he put in this movie. He gave it all that energy. I don’t know how many times I’ll be able to do a Kuso, just energetically.If I had to make another movie, I probably would not go as far as I did this time on my own, because it took so much energy and took me away from a lot of things. I’m sure it was like that for him, too. By the time he got to Blue Velvet, he got people who have his style worked out, what things he likes. He didn’t have to try to design every little aspect of it. Then he did, and that, to me, is something that resonates with me. I listened to the making of Eraserhead while making my movie to just kind of keep me inspired.Ryan Fujitani for Rotten Tomatoes:&nbsp;As someone familiar with your work, it’s always been clear to me that you have this deep, eclectic knowledge of music, so it’s interesting — and maybe not surprising — to find out that it’s the same for you with movies, as well. I’m wondering, when did that start? Where did that come from?Steve Ellison:&nbsp;I don’t know man. I’ve always been a fan of films. I went to film school too, you know, and I was really gung-ho about that for a while, but then I was making music on my own, and that was way more appealing because I didn’t need a whole crew to do it. I could just do it on my own at the time.&nbsp;It was like, “Well s—, I’m gonna miss this History of Film class to go and make some beats.”And it just kept happening. It kept happening. I always said I would go back and make films if I could, if I made enough money in music and all that. I just hit this point where I’d done so much stuff in music — I f—in’ got a Grammy nomination and all this stuff — and I was like, “What else am I gonna do, man? I’m not gonna just go back to the drawing board after losing a Grammy to Justin Bieber.” [laughs]&nbsp;You know what I’m saying?&nbsp;I’m like, I need to challenge myself and&nbsp;go back to school. So that’s kinda what I did in my own brain. I was studying heavy after that.But yeah, man. I do love it, and that’s something that… I get the feeling that a lot of people will hear about me making a movie and they’ll be like, “Oh, he’s just trying to be whatever,” but I actually care about this s—. It’s not like a vanity f—ing project.&nbsp;I hope people see that in the movie.RT: When you first started making music as Captain Murphy, you remained pretty anonymous, and clearly that’s not the case with Kuso. Was there initially any thought to being anonymous&nbsp;as a director, too?Ellison:&nbsp;Kinda, kinda. That’s why it says “Directed by Steve.” Initially I really wanted to just do it without having to bring Flying Lotus into it, but it hit a point where I was just… The first half of the production, nobody knew I was making the movie. Nobody. Just my friends. It wasn’t in Variety or Deadline. We were just working, chipping away at this thing and calling it like little short films. We were just chipping away at this thing and no one knew.Then I&nbsp;just hit a point where I f—ing just needed more help, man. I knew I could get more help if I started reaching out to people publicly and using what I had. So I had to do it. It was just too hard. I did want to just do it anonymously and take the pressure off of myself in a way, and just have a clean slate in this field. But it became too difficult.RT: So circumstances forced you to relinquish that anonymity.Ellison:&nbsp;Yeah, yeah. Because I liked the idea of just having a bland name, like just “Steve.” It’s my real name, but it’s the most boring name of all time. I was like, “That’d be great if that guy directed the craziest s—.” That’d be f—in’ hilarious.RT: Right, like, “Who is this guy?”Ellison:&nbsp;Yeah, “Who the f— is Steve?” I was like, “Maybe I can make that name sound terrifying.” [laughs]RT:&nbsp;So,&nbsp;I read somewhere — I think it was an Okayplayer interview — that the original name for the first track on your album&nbsp;You’re Dead! was “Jodorowsky.”Ellison:&nbsp;Yes, yeah. Wow, yeah, good call.RT:&nbsp;So, having seen Kuso, it’s clear to me you’re a fan of the director. I’m wondering how much of an influence he was on you in general and maybe on the film itself.Ellison:&nbsp;He’s hugely&nbsp;influential on my stuff, and unfortunately, I couldn’t shout him out in my top five. Just in terms of, like, even his comics. I think I’m a bigger fan of a comic of his that’s never been filmed than The&nbsp;Holy Mountain and all that. Metabarons&nbsp;— it’s this comic he did that’s kind of like… It’s like Dune meets The Fifth Element meets Star Wars. It’s amazing. Not a lot of people f— with it.RT: That’s not the one he did with Moebius, right?Ellison:&nbsp;No, it’s not Moebius. I don’t think Moebius did this one, but it feels like that. It’s got that vibe. That’s like The Incal; I think he did that and another one. But this s—, it feels like that, but it’s f—ing Star Wars deep, the world of it.&nbsp;To me, Metabarons, I want to f—ing make that movie, right? If I can keep doing this s— and they start giving me budgets, I’ll make a Metabarons movie and it’ll be f—ing awesome.I met Jodorowsky the other day in New York and that was huge for me. At the end of my promo cycle in New York, I got to meet him, and he gave me his blessing. That was really special to me, after having done this.RT:&nbsp;Did he get to see&nbsp;Kuso?Ellison:&nbsp;Nah, but we’re gonna get him a link, though. He’s gotta see that.RT: Did he know who you were when you met him?Ellison:&nbsp;No, he didn’t know who I was. He didn’t know who I was, but we got to chop it up for a minute. We have the same publicists in New York. They were like, “Yo, you’ve got to meet him.” So they made it happen. It was awesome.&nbsp;It was a real brief encounter, but for me, it felt like my reward for having done this s—. Going through the trenches making a movie, you know? It was really special.RT: If someone were to ask me to summarize Kuso, I’d have a really difficult time. When you were pitching this out to the people you collaborated with, how did you describe it to them?Ellison: I would just say it’s f—ing crazy, this project — you know, experimental horror comedy thing. What I would do, though, is every time I would work on some s—, I would kinda make little highlight reels of the movie to illustrate the point to someone who I wanted to get interested in the movie. Like, “You can watch the first 15 minutes of Kuso, and then if you want to be involved, at least you know where we’re going. This is where we’re at, if you want to be down with it.” I had to do that quite a bit. A lot of people were scared of me, you know?So I made little mini-trailers, and then eventually it was, “Alright, I’ll show you this short film,” like Royal, for example.&nbsp;I would show them that, and then it was, “As part of this world, what do you think?” It made it a lot easier.RT:&nbsp;One last question. I’m half Japanese myself, so I know what “kuso” means, and I’m curious about the choice of making that the title. Obviously there’s a thematic relevance to the film, but is there a reason why you chose that title, and why you chose it in Japanese?Ellison:&nbsp;Well, first off, I knew I was treading in these waters, so I did want to show love to Japan, you know? I wanted to show love to Japan, and I tried to in all the aspects of this movie. I tried to give a little nod to the country I love. But it started off as me wanting to find a name for this character. His last name was supposed to be Kuso, so it made it simple. I don’t know how it came about, I really don’t, but it just stuck. For a while I had different names for the movie, like I was thinking it was gonna be called Yo Ass Ugly. [laughs]&nbsp;For a long time that’s what I was thinking. I was like, Yo Ass Ugly.&nbsp;There were other titles too, but I just kept coming back to Kuso because it was one word, to the point, it was a good way to summarize everything.RT:&nbsp;Maybe it’s just me, but it kind of has a mystical quality to it, especially if people don’t know what the word means.Ellison:&nbsp;It does, it does! Yeah, exactly, yeah. It’s awesome, and you can get away with it. You can get away with saying it.

Recently, she raised her feature film profile with a pivotal role in the Disney animated hit&nbsp;Zootopia&nbsp;and an award-winning performance in the comedy Obvious Child.This week, Slate reunites with the writer-director of&nbsp;Obvious Child,&nbsp;Gillian Robespierre, for another wry comedy called&nbsp;Landline, about a pair of sisters who attempt to figure out whether or not their father is involved in an affair. Slate was kind enough to share her Five Favorite Films with Rotten Tomatoes, and you can read all about her choices below.L' Argent de Poche (Pocket Money) (Small Change) (1976)  89%I love this movie for its many innocent, earnest, stylish, authentic moving pieces. I love that there are so many little delights to love.Crossing Delancey (1988)  89%I first saw this movie when I was a little girl. I was so drawn to Amy Irving, her personal style in this film. I loved this story of a progressive, intelligent, Jewish New Yorker who was so bonded to her grandmother, but not necessarily to her cultural traditions. And what a great romance! There is nothing else like this movie.Sesame Street Presents: Follow That Bird (1985)  92%Honestly? The best songs. Beautiful cinematography. Wide shots of our gorgeous Big Bird as he travels across vibrant American cornfields, farms, and cities. Plus, you know, a true heart. This one will make you want to hug someone — like a big huge yellow bird.Field of Dreams (1989)  87%Magic. Magic. Magic. And baseball.A League of Their Own (1992)  79%More baseball. Plus, a phenomenal cast, excellent direction and script. This movie is perfect and we all know it, and there’s no reason to say anything else except, “Has anyone seen my new red hat?”Landline&nbsp;opens on&nbsp;Friday, July 21, in limited release.","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"and, action, documentary, movie, crime, Fox","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/19155533/Jenny-Slate-FFF1.jpg","slug":"jenny-slates-five-favorite-films"},{"id":"47508824312924","title":"John Cena’s Five Favorite Films","content":"Five Favorite Filmsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})John Cena's Five Favorite FilmsThe WWE champion and star of The Wall went a little beyond just five choices, but we weren't going to argue with him.by RT Staff | May 11, 2017 |  Comments(Photo by Ethan Miller/Getty Images)He’s a WWE superstar and champion, he’s made hundreds of children happy through the Make-A-Wish Foundation, he’s released a rap album, and he’s even inspired a hilarious meme. In short, John Cena‘s made a quite a name for himself over the&nbsp;years, even if you don’t count his growing filmography.While he’s established a natural gift for comedy in films like Sisters and Trainwreck, this week he stars alongside Aaron Taylor-Johnson in Doug Liman’s war thriller The Wall, which follows two American soldiers in Iraq trying to survive an assault by an enemy sniper. Cena was kind enough to share his Five Favorite Films with RT, explaining why certain franchises should count as one choice. We weren’t inclined to argue.Blazing Saddles (1974)  88%It makes fun of everyone. The comedy stands the test of time, and it’s just a wonderful film and an example of not taking yourself too seriously.Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope (1977)  92%–&nbsp;FranchiseThe&nbsp;Star Wars story arc — that is, all of them. And I know that’s inclusive, but if you look at them like episodes of television, I can just say the words, “Star Wars,” because I think it is a great depiction of the classic story of good vs. evil.The Matrix (1999)  88%– TrilogyThe same could be said about&nbsp;The Matrix movies, all three. A lot of people will be like, “Well, no, just the first one, because the other two weren’t to my fancy.” I liked all three because I like the entire story. What a unique concept that the world is completely fake, and amazing to think that machines could be running things, as I sit here and talk into a machine recorder. It’s just a really forward-thinking concept. I thought it was wonderfully done, and certainly a movie that, from an effects standpoint, changed the way people made movies. It’s one of those movies where people were wowed by the effects, but I think they took a back seat to what a wonderful story it was. It was such a fantastic story.Saving Private Ryan (1998)  93%I’m a huge fan of&nbsp;Saving Private Ryan. What the movie did, and how it rekindled a new generation’s respect for the Greatest Generation. I thought that movie was just brilliant in many aspects.The Big Short (2015)  89%I loved&nbsp;The Big Short because it took a great approach to explaining the financial crisis to even someone who knew nothing about it. An all-star cast got together, and the movie was just done fantastically. The moments they broke the fourth wall were just amazing, to explain finance, which is really simple when you strip it down, but finance folks keep it complicated so no one gets it. Man, if society goes through that again, they just didn’t watch that. You can learn something from that movie.The Wall&nbsp;opens on Friday, May 12, 2017, in limited&nbsp;release.","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"Thanksgiving, strong, parents","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/08151916/John-Cena-FFF1.jpg","slug":"john-cenas-five-favorite-films"},{"id":"47508825583710","title":"Groot’s Five Favorite Films","content":"Five Favorite Filmsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Groot's Five Favorite FilmsThe Guardians of the Galaxy star waxes poetic about the cinematic gravitas of Eeyore and Sgt. Tackleberry.by Matt Atchity | May 4, 2017 |  CommentsWhen Guardians of the Galaxy exploded into theaters in 2014, the heroic band of misfits were suddenly as popular as any of the Avengers. And one cast member in particular was the breakout star of the film, becoming a household name overnight. Obviously, we’re talking about Groot.We were fortunate enough to talk to Groot’s friend Rocket a few years ago, but it’s been almost impossible to get an interview with the star himself. Luckily for us, director James Gunn stepped in to help, passing us this list of movies that Groot loves to watch. To say that Groot has “eclectic taste” is putting it mildly, but he gave us thoughtful and insightful commentary on some of his more unexpected choices.Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh (1977)  100%“I am Groot.”Police Academy 7: Mission to Moscow (1994)  0%“I am Groot.”Million Dollar Arm (2014)  65%“I am Groot.”The Hottie and the Nottie (2008)  6%“I am Groot.”The Godfather, Part II (1974)  96%“I am Groot.”(Special thanks to James Gunn for providing us with Groot’s list.)Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2&nbsp;opens on May 5, 2017.","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"Paramount, diversity","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/04114726/Groot-FFF.jpg","slug":"groots-five-favorite-films"},{"id":"47508824302679","title":"Steven Yeun’s Five Favorite Films","content":"Five Favorite Filmsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Steven Yeun's Five Favorite FilmsThe star of The Walking Dead and this week's Okja talks about Frank Darabont's \"magic window,\" filming in Korea, and what made Glenn such a relatable character.by Ryan Fujitani | June 27, 2017 |  Comments(Photo by Priscilla Grant/Everett Collection)Over the course of six seasons, Steven Yeun became a fan favorite as Glenn Rhee on AMC’s megahit series&nbsp;The Walking Dead, but the Korean-American actor (and new father) has also been providing voice work for a couple of well-received Netflix original animated series (Trollhunters and&nbsp;Voltron: Legendary Defender). With this week’s streaming release of Bong Joon-ho‘s&nbsp;Certified Fresh Okja, Yeun continues his successful relationship with Netflix — and he got to work with one of the directors who inspired him to begin acting in the first place.Rotten Tomatoes spoke recently with Yeun, who gave us his Five Favorite Films, talked about the new movie, and reflected on what made&nbsp;TWD‘s Glenn so relatable. Read on for his list.The Sandlot (1993)  63%I’m gonna be so judged for this, but&nbsp;The Sandlot is a pick for me. Top five.&nbsp;I had the privilege of listening to a Frank Darabont conversation earlier on during&nbsp;The Walking Dead, and he kept on talking about this “magic window” — I think it’s from maybe ages 10 to 12 — when you watch a movie, and it moves you. It just becomes one of the greatest things in your life for the rest of your life.&nbsp;The Sandlot was that for me.You can watch that movie again and that movie is perfect. I mean, it gets trashed on, maybe, by adults because people think it’s for kids, but that movie’s amazing. Every single one of those child actors were incredible in it, the narration was awesome, Denis Leary’s in that movie. There’s so many amazing people that were part of it, and it was just a rinky-dink kids’ baseball movie, but it meant so much.The Transformers - The Movie (1986)  63%Transformers, the animated movie.Is it the same case for this one as it was with The Sandlot?Yeah, I think it is. It’s that, and it’s also that, as a kid, the film actually took me seriously, you know? It took me seriously as a viewer. It wasn’t like, “I’m just gonna zone you out for an hour and a half, or two hours.” It was like, “No, by the way, your favorite hero? He’s gonna die. And then he’s gonna try to pass the torch, but he’s not meant for that. And then, I’m gonna show you what it’s like for planets to be destroyed, for people to have terrible notions of who they are and what they want to become, or other people who don’t think that they are something, but they really have something great to offer.”That movie was awesome. And it was so weird, too. Like, this is for kids? I loved that movie.Office Space (1999)  80%Office Space, for me, was a college joint. It was the movie that was on in the background 24/7. We watched that movie in college my freshman year maybe 40 times, just quoting the lines. Also, it was an interesting meta way of telling us what we were actually heading towards, if we didn’t choose wisely in college, you know? It’s funny to me, watching it in college when you have no real reason to find the jokes funny because you have no context for that — you don’t work in a cubicle, so how would you possibly know? But there was just something so real about following the droning path that isn’t what you’re meant to be doing, and I think that was the thing that really resonated, but we didn’t realize it because we were busy getting drunk.Tokyo Story (Tôkyô monogatari) (1953)  100%Tokyo Story is fantastic. You could throw any Ozu film in there.&nbsp;Good Morning is also up there — it’s top six. I think what I love about Ozu is, especially in&nbsp;Tokyo Story, just the simplicity of the depth of the seemingly mundane life. We always try to add some zest to our lives, especially in films that we see now that are like, “Let’s talk about the most complex issue that we have in our lives, and that’s what makes this movie so interesting.”But&nbsp;Tokyo Story was an exploration of, “This is what is, and this is what everybody universally feels.” There’s that one moment when the daughter-in-law explains to the youngest sister, “This is just what is. This is life.” And the tone in which Ozu explores the loneliness that this man is going to feel, now that his wife has passed — he just ends it by saying, “You’re going to be very lonely,” and he just says, “I am.” And he just contemplates his life further from that point on.It’s just… To me, it was one of the first films where it showed me that you don’t need to crack out a movie. You can show people the truth. Just show people the truth, and he was so good at that.Memories of Murder (2003)  94%Memories of Murder, and I don’t say that because of&nbsp;Okja. I say that because that’s why I wanted to be an actor.&nbsp;Memories of Murder is one of those things where you’re watching so many things at once. For one, you’re watching the second installation of a genius director, and you’re witnessing his full genius. The way he composes his scenes, the way he composes his frames, the deliberateness he has in his execution, the way he directs you to watch things and the way he directs the audience to notice things or not notice things, the way he builds suspense… He just does a lot of things that are incredible as a director.But then, it’s also kind of people’s first taste of Song Kang-ho, and goddamn, that dude’s so good. It was just like watching a master director also work with master actors, but also watching a master actor do his thing.&nbsp;Ryan Fujitani for Rotten Tomatoes: Speaking of Song Kang-ho, considering how often he’s collaborated with Bong Joon-ho, were you disappointed you didn’t get to work alongside him in Okja?Steven Yeun:&nbsp;Well, that would have been awesome. But I also think that’s a testament to director Bong, that it’s not about him kind of just putting in people that stars or people like, but rather he’s very thoughtful in his casting, and if it doesn’t fit, it doesn’t fit.RT: So how was it to actually work with Bong Joon-ho?Yeun:&nbsp;It was amazing.&nbsp;He’s exactly what I thought. Not exactly what I thought he’d be, but the details were exactly as I thought they would be. He really dives into the nuance of everything that he’s putting into frame. You know, you’re getting&nbsp;a frame-by-frame shot list, a storyboard of what the movie’s gonna look like, and in some respect, someone might look at that and say, “Wait, you want me to stand here? So you’re limiting me as an actor?” But in reality, it’s actually more freeing, because if anything, all he’s doing is saying, “Trust me. I’m putting you within these parameters but you’re allowed to do anything you want within these parameters.” So it’s kind of a really freeing journey to take. You kind of can’t do wrong because he wants you to be there.RT:&nbsp;In the film, you play the role of an interpreter, and I’ve seen the videos of you and Conan O’Brien in Korea, but what’s it like to really get to flex your Korean skills? Do you speak it fluently?Yeun:&nbsp;I do speak it fluently. My pronunciation is probably pretty decent. For this role, I actually had to make my pronunciation worse, which was the fun part. It was kind of an exploration with [my character] K into the world of what an Asian-American person might go through, or any immigrant. Like, he feels like he’s a part of the society that he’s representing, which is America, but America doesn’t necessarily see him in that way sometimes, and when he goes back to the place where everybody looks like him, they don’t understand what he’s saying. So K’s kind of on his own island, and it gives him a lot of motivation to do the things that he does. It was really fun.RT: What was it like for you, to be working on a film in Korea?Yeun:&nbsp;It was awesome, man. It was a really, really transformative experience for me, because I’ve been to Korea before — I was born in Korea, but I’m fully, fully American at this point. To go back and be at the same age that my father was when he and my mother were there, right before they immigrated, was kind of like this weird, shoe-filling feeling, you know? That was really bizarre.And also,&nbsp;K is obviously the interpreter in the movie, but in that way, I had to interpret for the cast as we moved along, and when we were down, when we would go out to eat, they needed me to navigate. It was a very meta experience. There’s a weird feeling. There’s a buzz. It feels like you’re connected to some sort of mothership, in a way.RT:&nbsp;So, South Korean cinema has found a much larger global audience, thanks to people like Bong Joon-ho, Park Chan-wook, and Kim Jee-woon, among others. But something I’ve noticed&nbsp;is that, even in the darkest films — things like Oldboy or last year’s&nbsp;The Wailing — there’s always an element of wackiness, this uniquely Korean sense of humor that sometimes results in jarring tonal shifts but they somehow still work.Yeun:&nbsp;Yeah, I know what you mean.RT:&nbsp;It looks like&nbsp;Okja has some of that as well. Why do you think that’s so common?Yeun:&nbsp;I don’t know if I can necessarily&nbsp;speak at this point, with kind of limited thought on it, about why that might be, but it is interesting to explore. It could be the fact that, as a culture that is a very collectivist society and in some ways is very repressed, to a degree, it could be a little steam valve that releases a little bit of tension for the audience.The Wailing, to me, is f—ing terrifying. That movie is awesome, so good. But I was not as scared watching it, because they allowed me to see the humanness of what was going on. If anything, actually, now that I see that, I think humor, in the way that they subtly do that, allows you to actually connect with it more, because it makes it much more real, right? Like that pudgy old, s—ty police guy is going to go defeat the demon, and he throws a bunch of shovels in the back of his truck, or a pickaxe or something dumb — you know, whatever they have — and that’s not a joke. That’s just actually probably what would happen. If anything, it colors a portrait of it being much more grounded, to a degree.Yeah, I think that’s maybe it, you know? Maybe Korean cinema as it stands loves exploring the fact that life is everything, that life isn’t just a comedy or a thriller or a horror. It’s all of them.RT:&nbsp;Korean films do seem to blend disparate genres in ways that a lot of Western films generally don’t.Yeun:&nbsp;Yeah, I mean, you look at something like&nbsp;Secret Sunshine. Lee Chang-dong, that guy is such a brilliant filmmaker that’s really working off of very subtle, really grounded performances. But then you get Song Kang-ho in that movie, and you’re like, “He’s not doing anything that’s not real. That’s an actual guy. I’ve seen that guy.” But man, he does it so well that you can’t help but laugh, because it’s so silly, you know? Honestly, to me, that was his best performance ever.RT:&nbsp;Since I’ve got you, I have to ask about&nbsp;The Walking Dead. One of the other editors here&nbsp;told me, “Oh man, when they killed Glenn, I was done with the show,” and then literally stopped watching after that episode, because he was such a big fan of the character. I’m wondering if you encounter other people who feel that way, and if so, what do you tell them? How do you convince them to stick with the show, if you do at all?Yeun:&nbsp;Yeah, you know, that’s very flattering. Is he Asian-American or Asian?RT:&nbsp;He is not, no.Yeun:&nbsp;I think that’s the coolest part. I think Glenn kind of sneaks up on people. Not to say that people reject him at all, but people don’t really understand why they feel the way that they feel, and maybe the reason why they’re so disgusted is because that does sneak up on them. You know, you don’t realize the connection you’ve made with a character that is probably more in line with a clear window into connecting with a character. I think the other characters are more to be awed, to wish to be like, you know? Glenn was kind of the one that you could just parallel yourself to. So, in that way, I can see the feeling. I can see why someone whould be like, “I’m done,” because it essentially killed you off the show, right?But what I will say in response to that is, that’s also the beauty of that death, that it catapults the show into another era, because we finished telling the story as it is, and now we’re gonna tell it in a different, new, fresh, and exciting way. And what I will say is that Scott [Gimple] is truly, truly a thoughtful person, and I think a lot of people have their judgments on how they would have done something, but I think Scott, of all people, is someone that lives a couple steps ahead of a lot of others. So it will be fascinating to see what people think when they return and review what we’ve witnessed with that show.Okja&nbsp;will be available on Netflix on Wednesday, June 28.","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"service, Creative, Pixar, Amazon, adaptation, Films, sequels, movie, obituary","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/27171619/Steven-Yeun-FFF1.jpg","slug":"steven-yeuns-five-favorite-films"},{"id":"47508825586783","title":"Scoot McNairy’s Five Favorite Films","content":"Five Favorite Filmsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Scoot McNairy's Five Favorite FilmsThe Film and TV Star Enjoys a Fine Variety of Films from Chinatown Down to Alone in the Wilderness.by Kerr Lordygan | April 17, 2017 |  Comments(Photo by Kevin Winter/Getty Images)In the action thriller Sleepless, which opened earlier this year, versatile character actor&nbsp;Scoot McNairy (Halt and Catch Fire, 12 Years a Slave, Aftermath, the new season of Fargo, and the upcoming Godless on Netflix) starred opposite Jamie Foxx as a villainous mobster who orchestrates a kidnapping when he’s robbed of a shipment of his cocaine. The film hits DVD, Blu-ray, and On Demand this week, and that&nbsp;gave us a great opportunity to talk to McNairy about his Five Favorite Films. Read on for his eclectic list.De rouille et d'os (Rust and Bone) (2012)  82%I just thought the tone and the feel of that movie — the way it sort of characterized small people in such small ways — it gave you so much information about them. It was so brilliantly done. As well as the struggle and the performance from the characters was incredible. Marion Cotillard, I thought, was robbed from an Academy Award. I thought she was just amazing in that. The story was so different and interesting. I just thought everything about it was really good. It just tapped into every single emotion that you had, went through the whole wheelhouse. I just loved it.Chinatown (1974)  99%Chinatown&nbsp;sort of has this classic Hollywood vibe to it, or — not vibe — feel to it. I was always fascinated with sort of the old Hollywood, old architecture, the way Hollywood was back in the ’20s and the way that it captured all that, as well as the story and the acting. It’s just one of those films that I find myself watching over and over and over. I love seeing Jack Nicholson&nbsp;when he’s young — and his voice. All that stuff about him is so interesting to watch.It’s amazing how riveting a movie about water can be.Yeah, but it’s so cool to see how much Los Angeles has changed based on what you could see they were shooting then. Now, I know that that obviously wasn’t the old orange orchards, but you just get this idea of this vast sort of country land that is now a sprawling metropolitan city. Which is just incredible to me, in how fast it has grown. That’s always interesting, sort of looking at locations and then seeing those locations when you are driving around town.Sling Blade (1996)  96%Sling Blade. I loved it. It was a southern story and it was such a simple story, but the character work was just some of the best that I’d ever seen. I was fortunate enough to work with Billy Bob [Thornton]&nbsp;recently and — just looking back at that movie and what he did and knowing him as a person — it was just one of the most interesting, well-designed characters. It’s always fascinating to watch.&nbsp;The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford (2007)  76%I grew up watching western films, and for someone to slow down the pacing to a sort of a western drama — I just thought was so incredibly well done. The acting in it was absolutely phenomenal. The cinematography of it was beautiful. The tone, the production — just everything about it. Go down the list of everything about all the departments of a film and I feel like everybody nailed it on that one — just knocked it out of the park. It’s just such a beautiful piece of film to watch. Sometimes I like to just play it in the background with the volume off — just to be looking at the imagery of it.&nbsp;Oh, man. Watch it with the lights off. It’s awesome.Alone in the Wilderness (2005) Alone in the Wilderness is weird. Somebody gave me this documentary years ago, and I put it in and I watched it about four times in a row. Nothing is really happening in it. This guy is just building a cabin in the woods and sort of narrating it. It’s a true story. It’s actual live footage, 16mm footage of him. I gave it to a buddy of mine and he said the same thing — he was like, “Yeah, I watched it like two or three times in a row.” Another buddy said the same thing. I don’t know what it is. It’s just this guy building this cabin in the woods. I feel like it’s this sort of dream that every guy — or man — has. to go out into the woods and build a cabin and live in the woods. This guy does it, and does it for 40 years, and finally comes down when he’s 80, in Alaska. He just makes it look so feasible or accomplishable that — I don’t know, you just kind of watch it and start dreaming that you could do it too, you know? I think that is what a lot of my buddies felt when I sent them the film. It’s just something I’ve been toying around with — making a movie about it — sort of similar to&nbsp;the events that took place in the documentary, but not.Sleepless&nbsp;is now available&nbsp;on Digital HD and will be released on Blu-ray, DVD, and On Demand on Tuesday, Apr. 18.","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"Disney, die, serial, on, RT, 99%","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/12210048/mcnairy-fea.jpg","slug":"scoot-mcnairys-five-favorite-films"},{"id":"47508824306777","title":"Lightning McQueen’s Five Favorite Films","content":"Five Favorite Filmsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Lightning McQueen's Five Favorite Filmsby RT Staff | June 15, 2017 |  Comments(Photo by Pixar)He’s won the Piston Cup championship, he’s traveled the world on the international circuit, and he’s met a lot of new friends along the way. This week, Lightning McQueen makes his third trip to the big screen in Cars 3, and he took some time out of his busy racing schedule to gush about his Five Favorite Films!Winning: The Racing Life Of Paul Newman (2015)  91%Y’know, it takes a real pro to grasp the ins and outs of something like racing. It takes time, and even more than that?&nbsp;Passion.&nbsp;You gotta put in the work. From what I understand, with Paul Newman? Apparently racing wasn’t his day job, but he had a real passion for being out on a track, digging in and getting up close to his competition, lap after lap. It wasn’t about winning, it was about how much he just loved doing it, and how he’d do it every chance he got, no matter what anyone else said. You gotta respect that! THAT’S inspiring!The Love Bug (1969)  76%Ha, back in the day? What first made me want to get out there and tear it up and just have&nbsp;fun&nbsp;doing it? One dude: Herbie. Nobody cracked me up like Herbie. It wasn’t about being slick, or about what tires you had, or about track conditions and temperatures and all the stuff we gotta think about these days. It was about putting on a number and having some good old-fashioned fun. I wanted to BE Herbie when I watched that for the first time! Greatest actor in the world, if you ask me.Racing Dreams (2010)  100%I’ll tell ya, when you see a kid actually stop and focus because they love doing something — I mean something other than just goofing around or playing video games, right? Something next level — putting in the extra work and scraping together a few bucks to enter a race because they just want a shot at hugging a real track? THAT gets me. Watching kids like Annabeth, Josh, and Brandon… all different but all with the same grit and attitude and big dreams? THAT’S what gives me hope for this sport! And for the future! I get emotional just thinking about what they put on the line!&nbsp;Great. Now I gotta wipe my windshield. Thanks.Grand Prix (1966)  100%I’d&nbsp;never&nbsp;seen this one, but you know me — I’m a sucker for a classic. You remember my old crew chief, right? Figures it’d take a classic like Doc to make me park it and “appreciate the greats” — old flicks like Thunder Road, Two-Lane Blacktop…&nbsp;and at the top of my faves? GRAND PRIX. I mean, come on! You’ve got a&nbsp;killer&nbsp;international cast and some of the best shots with real racers I’ve ever seen in a movie. Every year, New Year’s Day rolls around, and it’s the first movie I throw on, like clockwork. Now THAT’S how you start things moving!Secretariat (2010)  64%Different racers might tell you what they get out of being part of this sport — the King once told me something like, “I didn’t miss out on a family life because of racing, I had one because of it”! I love that. For “Champion” Chick Hicks it’s always been about a trophy. You ask me, though? It’s not about winning. It’s not even about being up front. It’s about being side by side, nose to nose. The&nbsp;competition.&nbsp;It pushes you. It makes it special. And it can give you that extra little bit of horsepower when the chips are down, you’re in a slump, and you’re itching for a comeback. Secretariat really drives that home, you know?

Yet&nbsp;critics are hailing the role as one of his strongest, most likable&nbsp;performances, right alongside his work in&nbsp;Pretty Woman,&nbsp;Days of Heaven,&nbsp;and&nbsp;Primal Fear. It’s really no wonder the versatile actor chose two of his own movies&nbsp;— his first and his latest — as part of his Five Favorite Films;&nbsp;they are landmarks&nbsp;not only in his acting career, but in his personal life.&nbsp;See the full list below:Days of Heaven (1978)  92%OK, so, I’m gonna start with my first film, Days of Heaven,&nbsp;because it’s my first film.&nbsp;It’s probably, unfortunately, my best film. It’s very hard to follow up on a film like that.Why do you say that?It was the first film that Terry Malick made that kind of became Terry Malick in that movie. It also was the first film of mine at the Cannes Film Festival. So, everything about that film kind of was important to me as an actor and as a person.Life changing.Absolutely.Norman (Norman: The Moderate Rise and Tragic Fall of a New York Fixer) (2017)  88%And the second one is my last film — so 50-something films later — is Norman. Norman is probably the least obvious casting choice of me one could ever make. I think because of that it ended up being such a terrific experience. Sort of completely working in another territory.It’s one of my favorites of your performances — despite&nbsp;the fact that it reminds me so much of my family. I didn’t even realize how Jewish it would be. It was so authentic. I was like, “Maybe he is Jewish.”You know, when I first started, some woman came up to me — I remember this very clearly — and saying, “Your name is really Gara, isn’t it?” And I said, “No.” And she winked at me and said, “I know you’re Hungarian.” Then I went through a period where everyone thought I was Italian. So, now, clearly, I’m Jewish.That’s the sign of a brilliant actor. Plus, this movie just keeps you thinking. I’m still thinking about it.We had a screening last night. [Writer-director]&nbsp;Joseph Cedar and I’ve been doing Q&amp;As after. They’re always fun. People are just kind of flipped out by it. And it does continue. I have a feeling it’s the kind of movie that the dinner conversations are interesting.Babette's Feast (Babettes Gæstebud) (1987)  97%I actually just talked to Joseph about this last night, one of my all-time favorites is Babette’s Feast.&nbsp;It’s hard to pinpoint exactly why. It’s very pure. It’s not tricky at all; the filmmaking is almost invisible. I think for the most part, it feels like there are non-actors in the piece — although I’m sure they’re actors — but it’s not an actor-y piece at all. It’s just beautifully conceived with a really generous heart at its center. It just really moves me, I saw it again last week.And it holds up.It does; it’s the purity and the simplicity of it. And the sentiment of community and excellence. The idea of excellence and generosity as real things. Something, obviously, that’s in danger these days. The idea of truth and excellence and compassion. And kind of a willingness to accept the other. Forgive. So I think it’s a really deep, timeless film.Bicycle Thieves (Ladri di biciclette) (The Bicycle Thief) (1949)  98%What else comes to my mind?&nbsp;Bicycle Thieves was always one I loved, too. Again, deeply moving, operatic Italian story. Impossible to see the film and not weep.&nbsp;The simple life of people just trying to get through the day in very hard times. High unemployment after the second world war — a bicycle is the ticket out of unemployment and poverty. That’s a film that also still works.&nbsp;I see it every couple years. I look at that again.Sunrise: A Song of Two Humans (1927)  98%One&nbsp;more. How about another film that Joseph and I were talking about last night, which is a wonderful film:&nbsp;Sunrise by Murnau.&nbsp;It’s a silent movie — I think it’s from 1927, something like that. And it’s one of the most beautifully shot movies you’ll ever, ever see. Just the pinnacle of silent film art photography.&nbsp;Deep emotions of, again, almost operatic story. There’s a lot of nature in it, there’s a lot of water, fire, sunrises, and sunsets that are connected to the story. Human emotions and consciousness and yearnings and failings and karma. It comes from a short story, and a very beautiful film.It won the first Cinematography Oscar.Is that true? Well it’s worth it. If you ever see that film, it’s a “wow” experience.Kerr Lordygan for Rotten Tomatoes: How did you end up working with Joseph Cedar on Norman?&nbsp;Richard Gere: We met through&nbsp;Oren Movermen. I&nbsp;knew Oren because he co-wrote I’m Not There with Todd Haynes, the Bob Dylan movie.&nbsp;He and I became good friends. We were at an Academy cocktail party for new members. I was asked to come and talk to the new members in New York, and they were both there together. Oren&nbsp;introduced me to Joseph and asked if I knew his work, and I hadn’t known Beaufort. It was a terrific Israeli film that he had made. So it just started the dialogue. I said, “If you ever want to do anything in the Middle East, and&nbsp;I’m right for it, give me a call.” So.&nbsp;That’s how that happened.RT: Were you worried about it, scared of it?Gere: No, I wasn’t. I was kind of perplexed and bemused, and my first question to him was, “Why me?” And I said, “Look, as a director and as a producer, I wouldn’t cast myself in that.” He didn’t want the usual with this. He wanted someone who’s gonna bring — I mean, what he has told me, who knows what he really wanted — I think he wanted to avoid the clichés of a Woody Allen approach to it. So we didn’t have a lot of time; we had eight or nine months to work on this before we started shooting.RT: How did you prep for it?Gere: Living in New York since I was 20. The best preparation. 47 years of having Normans around me all the time.RT: It would be so easy for him to turn into&nbsp;an unpleasant character, but you made him so endearing.Gere: I think there was a quality to him — and I didn’t realize it — we did talk about it a bit when I was trying to get a sense of where Joseph was coming from with this, and I at one point said, “Let’s think about the pulls, of what this could be.” It could be Woody Allen — he doesn’t want Woody Allen. And I said “Well, the other pull was Charlie Chaplin.” And he said, “If it has to go anywhere, it would go in that direction.”And there is a kind of sad, sad quality about him. We never see his home. The film almost — although there’s an almost nonstop dialogue — the film actually works as a silent film. There are sections of the film that are completely silent. There’s the whole dumbshow when Norman and Eshel meet outside of the shoe store. Where he cuts out the dialogue and we just see it as a physicality.RT: I loved that.Gere: Yeah me too, it takes a really brave director to do that. The camera doesn’t move. There’s a soundtrack that kind of identifies the quirky circus quality of the movie, and forms that. But we just kind of see the physicality of the two people getting to know each other.RT: And was that scripted?Gere: It was partly scripted as dialogue — and we shot it as dialogue — but with the intention that he may pull it out, he’d have to look at it. Now I think he did a couple of different cuts, with the dialogue and without it. And it was way more interesting without it.RT: It was fascinating, because we are trying to figure out how you were going to do this — how you were going to get him in your pocket.Gere: Yeah, and it actually worked with the dialogue too. It was just so much more interesting without. And without the camera moving; no cuts. It’s a long sequence — it’s about a minute and a half, two minutes.Norman&nbsp;opens on Friday, Apr. 14, 2017, in limited&nbsp;release.","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"Emmys, SXSW, awards, Exclusive","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/12160122/richard-gere-600x314.jpg","slug":"richard-geres-five-favorite-films"},{"id":"47508826761325","title":"Kenan Thompson’s Five Favorite Films","content":"Five Favorite Filmsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Kenan Thompson's Five Favorite Filmsby Kerr Lordygan | February 22, 2017 |  Comments(Photo by Joe Scarnici/Getty Images for Hulu)Though his masterful sketch comedy work on&nbsp;Saturday Night Live&nbsp;and&nbsp;Kenan &amp; Kel&nbsp;gets him a lot of notice, Kenan Thompson&nbsp;is no stranger to film. This week, his new animated feature&nbsp;Rock Dog&nbsp;opens.&nbsp;We asked him what his Five Favorite Films are, and based on his picks, it’s easy to see where he gets some of his creative sketch and character work. See the full list here:Groundhog Day (1993)  96%I think it’s a perfect movie. I think it’s perfect in concept and truly executed to the upmost awesomeness. It’s funny when it needs to be funny. It’s super funny when it needs to be super funny. It also sinks down into some really dark, dark places or whatever. Turns it right back around and gets funny again within a few minutes. I think it’s a brilliant movie.Coming to America (1988)  72%Coming to America. Duh. We [can] leave it at that.I’ll start with the “duh” connotation. It’s an awesome movie. I can’t exactly remember the first time I saw it. I think I was really, really young, when it came on television — I think when it came on HBO or something. I don’t know that I was old enough to see it in the theaters. I doubt it. When I did see it at home, it was when cable first came out. There was only so many movies that would get played over and over again. Thank God Coming to America&nbsp;was one of them. I can quote it from the beginning to the end to this day. It was Eddie Murphy in his prime. Arsenio at his most confident. It was just an awesome concept. Super duper rich African dudes coming to Queens, trying to live regular. While you got Mr. McDowell thinking that he’s the king of the hill and stuff like that. It was a really funny movie.So much character work. I really appreciated those dudes –especially in the end credits, seeing how many characters they really played. I already kinda knew. But it was an awesome surprise to find out that Eddie was the little old man in the barbershop and stuff like that.Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back (1980)  94%That hits home for my sci-fi nerd self side of myself. I love the first one, A New Hope&nbsp;— that’s where it all started. But, Empire&nbsp;was just so awesome. I always remember watching Empire and being like, “Man, this movie is awesome from top to bottom.” So many good battles between Luke and Vader. Luke getting his arm chopped off — it’s a cold blooded movie. Return of the Jedi&nbsp;is awesome too. But, without Empire Strikes Back, I don’t know if Jedi would’ve even been a thing.So much Billy Dee Williams, too.Casino (1995)  80%That’s another perfect movie in my opinion. It’s like all those dudes in there — the height of their abilities. I wish I could name six because I would put Training Day up there. That’s Denzel at his most, most confident. It’s an awesome movie to watch.But, Casino is just classic like, Goodfellas, and then&nbsp;Raging Bull&nbsp;and all of those things coming are like little seeds, and the flower that sprouts was Casino.Scorsese and all those dudes really knowing each other for years. Putting together an awesome story about the beginning of Las Vegas or the last time the mob controlled Las Vegas — was just a great story and then to execute it for two and a half hours like that from top to bottom. It’s like some of Joe Pesci‘s finest work ever — Goodfellas&nbsp;is, like, his greatest film. Both of those dudes — De Niro‘s got so many great ones. [But] for those dudes together, I think Casino‘s my favorite.Tommy Boy (1995)  42%I remember seeing Tommy Boy,&nbsp;like, 15 million times. It makes me laugh every single time. Then I realized that I’m really laughing at Chris for 90 percent of the time. Then David kicks in there the other 10 that I need to make it a 100 percent completely awesome experience. Those two going back and forth and David being such a dick — it just works in that movie.Rock Dog&nbsp;opens on Friday, Feb. 24, 2017 in wide release.","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"Reality, Disney, Red, RT21","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/14174742/kenan-thompson-fea.jpg","slug":"kenan-thompsons-five-favorite-films"},{"id":"47508826773618","title":"J.A.

Bayona's Five Favorite FilmsThe A Monster Calls Director Reveals the Film that Served as His First Childhood Memory.by Kerr Lordygan | December 21, 2016 |  CommentsPhoto by Juan Naharro Gimenez/Getty Images&nbsp;J.A. Bayona&nbsp; (The Orphanage, The Impossible) is back in the director’s chair for&nbsp;A Monster Calls, which opens this week. In the film, a 12-year-old boy befriends a monster who helps guide him through the difficult intricacies of growing up and rising above&nbsp;heartache. It is further illustration of Bayona’s larger-than-life filmic style (he is also set to direct the Jurassic World sequel). Judging by&nbsp;his Five Favorite Films, it’s clear he grew attached to large cinematic adventures — some of his first life memories — which then&nbsp;inspired him to become a filmmaker. See the list here:Superman (1978)  94%It’s the first movie I saw when I was a kid, and it’s also my first memory of my life. It’s the first thing I remember. I was three years old — I know that because it was 1978. The first thing I remember in my life is the shot of Christopher Reeve wearing the Superman clothes and flying. That image provoked such an impact on me that from that moment on, I wanted to be Superman. And then as I grew up, I wanted to be the guy who made Superman possible. So I found out that there were these guys called actors and I wanted to be one.I was obsessed with movies when I was a kid. That movie created such an impact on me, and when I watch it again nowadays, I still believe it’s a masterpiece. It established the superhero genre on a level that, I think nowadays there’s not any movie that has it better than that for me, in the genre.The reality of the special effects, the chemistry between Christopher Reeve and Margot Kidder is still there. The way Richard Donner recreates Smallville… It’s an endless film to me. It’s an amazing film, especially nowadays.The Executioner (El verdugo) (1963) I wanted to mention a Spanish film because I’m Spanish. Criterion just released — I think this week — they just released The Executioner.&nbsp;Not many people know that film but it’s been considered the best Spanish movie ever. It’s black and white, it was made in 1963, and it’s a black comedy about the death penalty. It’s about this guy who falls in love with the daughter of an executioner and how, somehow — we find one thing: that he’s becoming more into the position of the father of his girlfriend, and eventually he becomes an executioner. That was shown during the Franco regime under a cruel, ferocious censorship regime. It’s as funny as depressing. It’s a very unique film, and it’s considered probably one of the more important Spanish films ever.E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial (1982)  98%Another film would be E.T. from Spielberg. I think somehow it’s a kind of fantasy film — very grounded in reality, very respectful of childhood. It’s a multi-layer, so the complexity of childhood — the way they portrayed a kid going through a very difficult moment in his life — I think it reminded me a lot of the kinds of movies that I love.The Tenant (1976)  88%Another one would be The Tenant from Roman Polanski. I think it’s my favorite Polanski movie, and I consider Polanski one of the biggest influences in my life. I love the tone — also because it’s another black comedy that mixes with horror. [It] was a quite unique film. I love absolutely everything about it.2001: A Space Odyssey (1968)  92%The last one, I’ll say another classic:&nbsp;2001. I think it’s a movie that you can watch every year and you’ll keep discovering new things. It’s funny how, as time goes by, the movie becomes more relevant and poignant. I love the fact how the storytelling of Kubrick is always inviting you to interpret the movie yourself, but at the same time it’s so rich — so much layers. The fact that now we’re living in a moment where technology is replacing man from [the] center of life — Kubrick really started to talk about that so many years ago, and I think it’s overwhelming. Every time I see it I think it’s overwhelming because I discover new things.A Monster Calls&nbsp;opens Friday, Dec. 23 in limited release.","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"critics, fast, adventure, superhero, CMT, justice, Critics, TV, Reviews, tv, Globe, Ice, Thanksgiving, IFC","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/12155105/ja-bayona-rep.jpg","slug":"j-a-bayonas-five-favorite-films"},{"id":"47508826775667","title":"Jake Lacy’s Five Favorite Films","content":"Five Favorite Filmsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Jake Lacy's Five Favorite Filmsby Kerr Lordygan | December 8, 2016 |  CommentsPhoto by Dimitrios Kambouris/Getty ImagesJake Lacy&nbsp;is on a bit of a fast-track in his career at the moment. He’s starred in such popular films as Carol, Obvious Child, and How to be Single, and has appeared on TV shows like The Office,&nbsp;Billy &amp; Billie, and Girls. His latest,&nbsp;Miss Sloane,&nbsp;goes wide tomorrow. Lacy loves movies&nbsp;that boast magical, dramatic, and comedic elements, and his Five Favorite Films show off many aspects of his own personality. See the full list here:Ghostbusters (1984 Original) (1984)  97%It’s a movie that I go back to probably once every other month, and I mean, it sounds so dumb, but it’s just something familiar. And I feel like I always discover a new little thing. A new tiny joke. A new little blink or a nod, or something of that nature. It’s a comedy from the era where, as crazy as the story elements are, the actual film feels as grounded and as real as three disgraced Columbia professors fighting supernatural ghosts alongside Ernie Hudson can be. It feels like real professors who are actually kicked out from the school, and the jokes are based on these characters, and are sarcastic. It’s not a big goofy chuckle fest of what crazy thing can happen to this group of people next, you know? It feels authentic. Something in me as a kid really liked that. Something in me now certainly loves that.&nbsp;I have an endless endless love for the original Ghostbusters.GoodFellas (1990)  96%I read Wiseguy,&nbsp;the book that Goodfellas is based on, before I knew that Goodfellas existed. I was, like, 15 and found it in the school library. Then at the end it was a footnote that was like, “Oh by the way, Scorsese made this into a film.” At 15 or 16, I saw Goodfellas for the first time. Was mesmerized. And then also, it was the first time I probably watched a movie or a film with the beginning of an adult perspective on things. Where it wasn’t just participating in the story, but seeing what a masterpiece it is that someone created that. That those performances individually were so fantastic that the story, the shots, the music… The first time I understood the elements of film coming together, being a conscious choice for those things to be in the film, and then the effect that it had on me. As opposed to being a kid and a viewer, and being like, “I like that thing.”&nbsp;I’m not unique in this, I think, but I can go back every six months and watch that movie and still be so excited to see it. I’m always ready to watch it. I wanted to be Henry Hill as a kid. Growing up in the country with no excitement around us, I wanted to be half Irish, half Italian, and adopted by this family I could never be a part of. That whole scene. I just wanted that life. Or as a kid, I thought I wanted that life.Mary Poppins (1964)  98%I, as a child, loved Mary Poppins. Something about these misunderstood kids who couldn’t catch a break, and this fantastic woman coming into their life and showing them this other world, and yet also being so coy: “I don’t know what you’re talking about. What world do you mean?” I just really liked escapism as a child, I guess. The time element of Britain in another era, and then this fantastical element of going into pictures and cartoons and flying and laughing. It’s like it was so exciting to me, even though it came out 30 years before I was born. Something like that. It was a real go-to as a kid.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the last two and a half decades, it still works. It doesn’t drag. It’s still like the magic is still there.&nbsp;Whereas maybe other films from that era may or may not have aged quite as gracefully as Mary Poppins has.Being There (1979)  95%Peter Sellers. I think it might be the perfect film. I saw it in college. I just was blown away. This is not a unique argument unto myself, but the key thing of that film is it’s so wonderful to sit and allow this story to unfold and wash over you. The effect it had on me then is that this final scene, I was, like, weeping when this last moment happened. It’s not even a conclusion to anything. It’s not “the hero makes it home from war” or “the orphan gets adopted.” It’s not this big conclusion to an arc. Yet it is. It is like this unbelievable moment of beauty and grace, and the fact that the film never nods to that entirely until this final moment, to have such control over your medium to do that sort of thing, is remarkable in itself, I think.&nbsp;To see Sellers — he is so magnificent — to see him in a role like this, instead of Clouseau or The Party&nbsp;or something like that, that’s wonderful. But still a very large character. It’s just wonderful.Boogie Nights (1997)  93%Anytime somebody’s like, “You want to watch Boogie Nights?” No problem.&nbsp;Carve out the afternoon. I’m ready to go. Again, story, performances, direction, music, era, subject matter — it all works for me on that one. Both as just a simple audience member who wants to check out of life and have a nice time, and also as someone who works in this industry and appreciates as an objective viewer the craftsmanship of that film.I mean, “It’s my big dick and I want to f— now, Jack?” How do you write something better better than that?&nbsp;[laughing] I’m constantly quoting that to friends. But there’s this thing that a friend of mine just showed me on the DVD that’s called the “John C. Reilly Files,” or “Reilly Files.” It’s basically scenes that were not used in the final edit, but are John C. Reilly-based scenes. They are incredible. It’s so cool. So many of them are — maybe my friend who showed it to me, maybe he’s lying — but so many of them are cut scenes during the recording sessions. Things like that, where he’s the ultimate wing man. You know what I mean? He’s repping so hard for Dirk in the recording studio.It’s a bench marker. I would be interested to see what other films came out in 1997. Like what really holds up. Like,&nbsp;Magnolia still holds up for me.&nbsp;Punch Drunk Love still holds up for me. PT Anderson — those movies. I went back and watched There Will be Blood maybe three or four months ago. Just riveting. Those movies don’t get old for me. There’s so much to digest in them.Miss Sloane&nbsp;is now open in limited release and opens wide tomorrow.","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"Video, APB, PlayStation, joker, TV, Lionsgate","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/02150808/jake-lacy-rep.jpg","slug":"jake-lacys-five-favorite-films"},{"id":"47508826771569","title":"Betsy Brandt’s Five Favorite Films","content":"Five Favorite Filmsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Betsy Brandt's Five Favorite Filmsby Grae Drake | January 12, 2017 |  Comments(Photo by Tommaso Boddi/Getty Images for New York Magazine )&nbsp;Claire in Motion, a mysterious new drama opening Friday, stars Betsy Brandt&nbsp;as Claire, a woman in search of her missing husband and the truths behind his past. The actress, though, who has starred in TV greats like Life in Pieces, Masters of Sex, and Breaking Bad&nbsp;among many others, did not have to search too long to come up with her Five Favorite Films. The list is refreshingly fun, and you can see it here:Hidden Figures (2017)  93%I just saw Hidden Figures yesterday and I’m so glad that I saw it at the New Year, because I feel like that’s exactly what you want to get off on the right foot for 2017. I saw it with my husband and my kids. My kids are 11 and eight, and it was a phenomenal experience. I saw it at the ArcLight in Hollywood and the house was full. Everybody was so vocal. We clapped, we laughed, we cried. It was like watching a play. I really don’t know how to describe it. Afterwards we went out to eat and I could not shut up about it. I could not stop talking about it.Postcards from the Edge (1990)  84%My brother and his family were in town and my sister-in-law’s never seen it. I’m like, “How have you not?” She’s five years older than me. I’m like, “How have you not seen that?” I read the books. You feel like you’re bipolar when you read it. I think that’s as close as anyone who does not suffer from that illness, that you can understand it. It’s the way [Carrie Fisher] writes that. What a talent and what a loss.Parenthood (1989)  91%I feel the performances are great and I love how it’s funny, it’s dramatic, but it’s also really, really honest. There’s some beautifully tender moments because it has that honesty. It was amazing to watch when I was younger. It’s amazing to watch now. Whenever that’s on HBO, I can’t not watch it. I just love the film. I love the film.I love that part at the end when they’re talking about the rollercoaster.And when I watched it when I was much younger, I got that, but now I get that more.Sure, and after having kids, too.Yeah, absolutely, being married. I feel like 10 years from now, it would feel differently to me then also. I think that’s such a great mark of a film.Hannah and Her Sisters (1986)  91%I was in college. I had the chicken pox so I had to stay in my dorm room.&nbsp; I wasn’t even sick. I had like two pox. Not like the rapper, but like two pox, and I had all this energy, and I was like [makes sick noise], and I watched Hannah and Her Sisters with two other friends of mine in the dorm that had already had chicken pox, so they could be around me.I’d never seen filmmaking like that, although, in high school, I watched New York Stories by Woody Allen, which I also was a big fan already, so I was like, “Oh, this is great.” I feel like Hannah and Her Sisters was just a beautiful film. Such a beautiful film. The work that he gets out of the actors… He casts these amazing actors, but then he gets these phenomenal performances out of them. There’s so much vulnerability in that movie that it just struck me. It was like an amazing artistic truck just running me over. I was already studying acting and knew I wanted to do that, but it really, really landed on me.Singles (1992)  79%You know, I could just totally mix it up and be honest. It’s not Lawrence of Arabia, but I’ve got to be me. I think I’m going to have to say Singles.&nbsp; After college, I moved to Seattle with my boyfriend, who is now my husband. We moved to Seattle and it was awesome and I loved it. I danced in really crappy, dirty, disgusting clubs and had the time of my life. And I did a bunch of plays.That’s great. I love that movie, and I’m a huge Campbell Scott person.Oh, my God. Me, too! Oh, my God. I love him. Isn’t he just so great in that?He’s fantastic. Like, memorably fantastic.&nbsp;I thought Bridget Fonda’s performance was great, too.I was going to say, love Bridget Fonda in that movie, also. And Matt Dillon. I quote it all the time: “We’re huge in Belgium right now.” I will say that. I’ll say that about Claire in Motion. I’m like, “It’s huge in Belgium.” People are like, “Is it really?” I’m like, “Probably not. No. It hasn’t even been released yet. No.”I just think that on paper she could potentially come off as unsympathetic, but she plays her so well that she ends up being cute.She really tapped into [how] Janet faces her insecurities and her vulnerabilities head-on. At first, she’s all about her boyfriend. I’m like, “He really does not give a rat’s ass about you.” I think there’s so many things that could’ve come across as cheesy, but then they work. The film just works. I think it’s kind of lightning in a bottle. Don’t know how they do it, but I just love it. It’s so nostalgic for me.Claire in Motion&nbsp;opens Friday, Jan. 13&nbsp;in limited release.","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"pirates, sports, robots, Marvel, 2017, Adult, game, TV, Globe, Academy, Film, Epix, Channel","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/11164716/betsy-fea.jpg","slug":"betsy-brandts-five-favorite-films"},{"id":"47508825603175","title":"Kiernan Shipka’s Five Favorite Films","content":"Five Favorite Filmsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Kiernan Shipka's Five Favorite Filmsby Kerr Lordygan | March 27, 2017 |  Comments(Photo by Dimitrios Kambouris/Getty Image)Kiernan Shipka&nbsp;was the daughter of Don and Betty Draper in Mad Men,&nbsp;the daughter of Tenzin and Pema in The Legend of Korra, and she currently plays the daughter of Bette Davis in Feud. This week, she plays another daughter shrouded in dark mystery in&nbsp;The Blackcoat’s Daughter&nbsp;—&nbsp;a twisted new horror film — which opens on&nbsp;Friday. Fittingly, she revealed that she’s a bit of a horror fan herself when asked about her Five Favorite Films. Her well-rounded list includes one horror classic as well as solid representatives of several other genres. See her list here.The Wizard of Oz (1939)  99%Well, the first movie I ever saw was Wizard of Oz, and that was when I kind of realized that movies — almost in a way — existed, that this other world of movies could be my playground too, and that was definitely probably the movie that fascinated me and entranced me with, hence, Hollywood. Not to be cheesy about it.The Shining (1980)  84%I think that The Shining is probably my favorite horror movie just because it’s a smart film, but at the same token it’s so chilling, and there’s so much to dig into. I mean, I could get myself into two-hour-long hauls just looking at conspiracy theories about it on the internet.Eraserhead (1977)  90%I think that Eraserhead by David Lynch. That’s a movie that I actually had to watch for Blackcoat’s Daughter. It’s one of [director] Oz [Perkins]‘ favorite movies. I was sick when I watched it the first time, but I’ve never seen anything that kind of like stuck with me and disturbed me in a cooler, more powerful way. I really, really enjoy that movie.Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone (2001)  81%Personally, I grew up with Harry Potter. So, that first Harry Potter was probably the movie that I’ve seen the most in my life and probably… I mean, I watched all of them, but the first one was my favorite. Gosh, I just watched that movie on repeat when I was younger. Absolutely loved it.Ferris Bueller's Day Off (1986)  80%I think that, as far as comedies go, I can watch Ferris Bueller’s Day Off so many times, and that’s one movie I can watch over and over and over again, and just absolutely never get sick of. I can drop in&nbsp;at anytime — I could watch the whole movie. It’s one of my favorites.Kerr Lordygan for Rotten Tomatoes: Are you a horror fan?Kiernan Shipka: I do like horror. Yeah. It’s an awesome genre. It’s an interesting genre. And I think that some of the best movies are horror movies.RT:&nbsp;So what will your fans think of Blackcoat’s Daughter?Shipka:&nbsp;I’m playing a character that’s very wildly different from anything that I’ve ever played before. I think it’s a lot… It’s easy to draw parallels between a lot of characters that a lot of people play because, you know, a lot of humans share similarities [laughing] but this is almost supernatural in a way that I think people are really gonna enjoy seeing.The Blackcoat’s Daughter&nbsp;opens on Friday, Mar. 31, 2017 in limited release and On Demand.","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"composers, heist, It, Searchlight, Awards","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/23193842/kiernan-shipka-fea.jpg","slug":"kiernan-shipkas-five-favorite-films"},{"id":"47508826757228","title":"Dolph Lundgren’s Five Favorite Films","content":"Five Favorite Filmsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Dolph Lundgren's Five Favorite FilmsThe Action Star Talks Kubrick, Buckets of Blood, and \"Demons and S---.\"by Kerr Lordygan | March 1, 2017 |  Comments(Photo by Ethan Miller/Getty Images)Dolph Lundgren&nbsp;(Film:&nbsp;Universal Soldier, Rocky IV, A View to a Kill, The Expendables, Masters of the Universe;&nbsp;TV:&nbsp;Arrow,&nbsp;Justice League Dark) is a household name when it comes to studly bad-assery with a slight tongue in a cheek somewhere. Now&nbsp;Don’t Kill It&nbsp;— directed by Mike Mendez (The Gravedancers, Tales of Halloween) — &nbsp;opens this week with Lundgren as a snarky demon-hunter trying to save a small Mississippi town. This one has a sense of humor a la Evil Dead 2 or Dead Alive&nbsp;and more than enough hilariously campy gore to please fans of the genre. Mr. Lundgren graciously spoke to us about the films that he has always loved. The list of his Five Favorite Films is here:The Godfather (1972)  97%One movie I like is The Godfather, the original, because it’s got everything. The lighting, the acting, the story, the performances, direction — everything put together. You can always watch it. If you’ve seen it 20 times, you could see it another 20 times, you know? There’s always little details — that’s the thing, attention to detail.Gladiator (2000)  77%I like Gladiator, the one with Russell Crowe, because it’s an epic and they used CGI really well, I thought. I like those movies. A lot of films I’ve done, it was about the hero’s journey and all that Joseph Campbell stuff. That’s a good one.Unforgiven (1992)  96%Unforgiven is a good movie, I think. Simplicity and epic qualities, and acting and everything. Story.Spartacus (1960)  93%Spartacus is a great movie, too. It’s also one of those epic pictures.&nbsp;The story is great. I think what’s cool is you had a young director. The fact that he had to walk on there — Kubrick was in his 20s and they fired the original director, and it was produced by Kirk Douglas, so being a star producer — I can kind of relate to that. He brought this kid on set, and didn’t really know him. He turned out to be this incredible genius who did these incredible battle scenes, and just some beautiful stuff in there with real extras — they had 5,000 extras. If you call “Cut! Reset!,” it took half a day to put everybody back in their positions. That’s an accomplishment, I think. Scale, but also keeping it intimate in those close-ups.Also, they said that [Kubrick]&nbsp;always designed the last shot of his movies first. He tried to sum up the whole picture in the last shot of the movie, like Dr. Strangelove. The guy sitting on the bomb, falling down. That’s a classic shot. In Spartacus, it was Spartacus hanging on the cross being crucified, and there’s a row of crosses leading all the way to Rome, I guess, to the horizon. Then his son is born a free man at his feet, and his wife says, “Spartacus, please die.” Because he was so tough, he wouldn’t die on the cross. She’s asking him to die, while she’s sitting there with his son who is free now. He’s not a slave anymore. &nbsp;Anyways, it’s a beautiful movie.Have you ever done a movie last scene first?Have I? No. I know when we shot Rocky IV, Sly [Stallone] said, “Hey, you guys should shoot the ending first while we still have money and everybody’s fresh [laughing].” So&nbsp;we shot the ending of Rocky IV first.I haven’t directed in almost 10 years, but I’ve got something planned — hopefully this year or maybe next year. But yeah, we’ll probably try to do the same. I try to design the last shot first to see how it works. At least, it’s a good theory of trying to tell the story in the last shot again.Pulp Fiction (1994)  92%That’s one you can see a million times and and it’s like a whole new style, and dialogue, and all that stuff.Kerr Lordygan for Rotten Tomatoes:&nbsp;I saw Don’t Kill It, and I fell in love with it. I wasn’t expecting it to be so funny.&nbsp;You’re very funny in it. You had to learn a Missouri dialect there?Dolph Lundgren:&nbsp;Oh, yeah. It was a funny movie. The whole thing: the guys talks a lot, the dialect, the fact that there’s so much verbiage. Usually in action movies — which is mostly what I’ve done, people don’t talk that much; you’ve got to do without dialogue. But that’s what I liked about it when I read it. The guy over-explains things, and I thought it was funny. I tried to make the guy funny. Make him comical.I’m doing this arc on Arrow, and I was taking so many ideas there and used it for&nbsp;Don’t Kill It because the guy on Arrow talks quite a bit, too. It’s quite efficient sometimes, effective on screen. A&nbsp;big guy — I think no one expected it.RT: It was great. Did anything surprise you about doing the movie?Lundgren: I had a lot of fun. I had more fun than I thought. It was a little bit of a breakthrough because you are a slave to the material as an actor, and that one — because I talk a lot and because it’s funny — I felt much freer after that movie doing other things because it affected me a little bit — like I said — on Arrow. The kind of movies now, everything I’ve done recently, I have a little more fun in front of the camera.RT:&nbsp;Did you expect it to be that funny when you agreed to do it?Lundgren: Not really, no. I knew that the character was entertaining, the main character. I haven’t done many horror movies, and I’m skeptical to all that about demons and s— like that. But I read the script, and somehow it pulled me in enough about halfway through. I said, “If it could pull me in, then maybe it will pull the audience in,” because I’m sure they’ll be skeptical, too, of this thing — especially if I’m playing the lead in it. It worked, I guess.RT:&nbsp;Lots of really fun gore in this one, too. Funny and well done.Lundgren: Yeah, because Mendez, he doesn’t care. He’d have buckets of blood standing by all the time. He doesn’t care. I like that. There’s so many movies that’s, “There’s too much blood!” Did you ever get punched in the nose? Do you know how much you bleed when somebody breaks your nose? It’s like there’s blood everywhere down to your knees on your shirt. I used to do martial arts. I know how much blood comes out of a nose. But in movies, they don’t want to do that because people can’t take it anymore. People are a&nbsp;sanitized version of reality.Don’t Kill It&nbsp;opens on Friday, Mar. 3, 2017 in limited&nbsp;release.","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"movies, Swim, drama, CBS, festivals, Classic, Action, lee, Mindy, New, ESPN, emmy, IFC, transformers, america","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/27183412/dolph-fea.jpg","slug":"dolph-lundgrens-five-favorite-films"},{"id":"47508825601126","title":"Daniel Brühl’s Five Favorite Films","content":"Five Favorite Filmsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Daniel Brühl's Five Favorite FilmsThe Zookeeper's Wife Actor Has Brexit on His Mind.by Kerr Lordygan | March 27, 2017 |  Comments(Photo by Clemens Bilan/Getty Images for GQ)“I came to the conclusion that probably my answers are influenced on what I’m thinking about right now,” says The Zookeeper’s Wife actor Daniel&nbsp;Brühl&nbsp;regarding his Five Favorite Films. “So maybe in a couple of weeks it would be five different films.”&nbsp;Brühl, who also is known for roles in The Bourne Ultimatum, Captain America: Civil War, and Inglourious Basterds, was influenced by current events in Europe while making his picks. “I’ve been talking about Europe so much recently with Europe falling apart: Brexit, all this political discussion.” You can see the complete list here:To Be or Not to Be (1942)  96%Starting chronologically, the oldest one, let’s say, would be To Be or Not to Be —&nbsp;Lubitsch&nbsp;—&nbsp;which to me is a perfect comedy. A flawless comedy with incredible wit and pace and rhythm, and a sense of humor that unfortunately disappeared in Germany, and all these wonderful directors like Lubitsch and Billy Wilder and — God knows — Fritz Lang, and everybody else left. This is such a wonderful film [about]&nbsp;fooling the Nazis — it’s just one of my favorites, and I think I’ve seen it probably more than 20 times. Each time I burst out in laughter, and I’m impressed by it.Rocco and His Brothers (Rocco e i suoi fratelli) (1961)  89%Then the films that made me want to become an actor were films that were recommended by my father when I was 16, and I got my first VHS player, and they were very often these French films, Italian films in the ’60s and ’70s, and one of the films that impressed me the most was Rocco and His Brothers. Neo-realism —&nbsp;Rocco and His Brothers with Alain Delon, which is great because it’s told in different chapters. I think five chapters. Telling the story of each of these brothers, of this poor southern Italian family coming to Milan trying to begin a new life, and the authenticity of that neo-realistic Italian filmmaking, is very impressive. Also the drama, the way it is told, and big family issues of rivalry and jealousy and love and hatred are told in a magnificent and very moving way, and with a wonderful young Alain Delon playing Rocco.Le samouraï (1967)  100%Another film with Alain Delon. It’s interesting — probably he was my favorite actor when I was 16, and then I was a bit disappointed of how he changed when he became older. I guess also politically, but that doesn’t matter. As a young man, he played some very enigmatic and wonderful roles. Another favorite film of mine … It’s a genre film, Le Samourai, by Melville. It’s an incredibly cool gangster film. Just the opening, I think, is 20 minutes where not a word is spoken and you always see Alain Delon with his hat and his trench coat. It is just an incredibly stylish and aesthetically wonderfully shot genre gangster film.&nbsp;In German, it’s the Ice Cold Angel, but the Germans always have these funny titles.Raise Ravens (Cria Cuervos) (1976)  100%Because I’m half Spanish, I want to add a Spanish film, which I think is a film from the ’70s which is called Raise Ravens — I think was the English title. Cria Cuervos, with Geraldine Chaplin. It’s a film by Carlos Saura, a famous Spanish filmmaker. This is a very peculiar film because it’s a ghost story. It’s a young girl [played by Ana Torrent&nbsp;who is fantasizing. You are in the head of a girl the whole time, and it deals with child visions. Nightmares. It’s a very spooky film, but it also reflects very well Spain at the time and of mysteries within families, and mysteries that go on from one generation to the other. It’s a fascinating film that many people don’t know about. That’s why I want to point that one out as well.Wild Tales (2015)  94%Last but not least, I would just also mention a modern film. I was between Force Majure, this Swedish film, but then I thought, “Okay, let’s leave Europe. Let’s go to South America.” The Argentinian film Wild Tales was a film that I enjoyed a lot because it’s different episodes all dealing with revenge. One episode more clever and entertaining than the other. I think [it has]&nbsp;one of the funniest, surreal wedding scenes in film history. Probably my favorite wedding scene in a film ever. Very, very Latin American. Very brave. Muchos cojones. Incredibly smart and clever because revenge is told through so many different angles. Wonderful performances with the lovely Ricardo Darin, who is one of my favorite actors. Leonardo Sbaraglia&nbsp;—&nbsp;another wonderful Argentinian actor. A very powerful, fresh and wonderful film.Kerr Lordygan for Rotten Tomatoes: You play a Nazi in&nbsp;The Zookeeper’s Wife, &nbsp;but it’s not the first time you’ve played one.Daniel Brühl:&nbsp;Yeah, I know. We Germans always have that problem. That’s why I was a bit reluctant at first, but then there was something in that story that interested me in my character because I am playing this guy who is a scientist as well that was obsessed by the crazy idea of recreating a Germanic forest and of recreating, re-breeding extinct animals. It’s such a crazy, surreal, stupid idea that the Nazis had. I found it fascinating that there was that man who was seriously convinced to achieve the goal, and so absolved by that Germanic Nazi ideology. I didn’t care about the uniform and playing a Nazi. It was more playing an obsessive, obsessed scientist.The film deals with animals and the zoo. What I found interesting about my character is actually I’m playing a human being who is losing his human values throughout the story and ends up being a wounded, despicable beast. Sounds very dramatic [laughing].RT: Sounds like it. And an important story to tell.Daniel Brühl:&nbsp;Yeah. We had our premiere in Poland and the daughter of Antonina Zabinski, of Jessica Chastain‘s character, was present. The premiere was right where the ghetto was. It was so — for the Polish, especially for the Polish — it was a very important story to be told. It also reminded me, being in Warsaw, of what had happened there. That was quite an emotional moment.The Zookeeper’s Wife opens on Friday, Mar. 31, 2017 in limited release.","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"Tour, Elton, Tyler, zombies, free, Pirates, TLC, TV, Reality, Drama, streaming, venice, Comic-Con","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/28124318/daniel-bruhl-fea.jpg","slug":"daniel-bruhls-five-favorite-films"},{"id":"47508825609323","title":"Guy Pearce’s Five Favorite Films","content":"Five Favorite Filmsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Guy Pearce's Five Favorite FilmsThe Proficient Actor Explains His Love for Peter Weir, Al Pacino, and Why Elephant Man Hits Close to Home.by Kerr Lordygan | March 7, 2017 |  Comments(Photo by Neilson Barnard/Getty Images)Memento was a mindbending&nbsp;mystery flick that rested almost entirely on&nbsp;Guy Pearce‘s&nbsp;electrifying breakout performance in the lead role. Consider his work in other films like&nbsp;The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert, L.A., Confidential, The King’s Speech, The Time Machine,&nbsp;ABC’s&nbsp;When We Rise, and soon,&nbsp;Alien: Covenant, and it’s easy to see why his remarkable versatility has become a hot commodity.This week, Pearce stars in&nbsp;Brimstone&nbsp;as an intimidating reverend out for revenge, and we were almost a’scared to ask the guy anything, but we were pleased to find that he loves movies just as much as the rest of us. Ever charming and earnest, he gave us his list of Five Favorite Films, which you can read below.The Elephant Man (1980)  92%It came out in 1980 and I have a sister with an intellectual disability. I think in 1980 — when I was 12 and I saw The Elephant Man for the first time — the film just struck a chord in me that nothing ever had before, and it does to this day when I watch it. Obviously the performances by Anthony Hopkins and John Hurt and John Gielgud, etc. are just so sensitive and touching that it’s heartbreaking for me. It really touches me in a way that I think has — not to suggest that my sister has the same condition that Joseph Merrick had — but the way in which that character feels ostracized and the way in which people are judgmental of him are all things that really hit home for me as a young boy trying to protect my sister out there in the world. Very much connected to my upbringing, but obviously quite a different story.But I just think Anthony Hopkins in that film, the way that David Lynch captured him, and obviously the way he performed that role of Freddy Treves just… There’s nothing better. Anthony Hopkins is someone who I think does sensitivity on screen better than anybody anyway, so his heartbreak and his compassion for that character was just unforgettable really.A Streetcar Named Desire (1951)  98%Something actually I watched recently — my girlfriend hadn’t seen it yet —&nbsp;A Streetcar Named Desire. I’m a huge Marlon Brando fan, as a lot of actors are. I know it’s a cliché, but obviously there are many performances of Brando’s that are just exquisite, but there’s something about that performance as Stanley in Streetcar that I think is just so raw and electric, as everybody says. I’m not saying anything that anybody hasn’t said before, so excuse my banter, but you just cannot take your eyes off him. I think as a young male actor at the time, when I first started seeing that film, you just wanted to deliver everything that he could deliver, and of course, none of us can. I certainly can’t, but the envy that I would feel for him, as well as the thrill of watching what he could do, was so mixed up in my head and my body that I just go back to that film every couple of years and watch it again.Obviously, Tennessee Williams is such a wonderful writer, and we all understand, I think, those powerful emotions that exist within families, and those things that seem very subtle at one point that can then be the breakdown of a family. I just think the combination of his writing and Brando’s performance is just exquisite. It’s really exquisite.The Godfather (1972)  97%Okay. I do come back to The Godfather, and to be honest, if I had more time to think about it, I would probably leave The Godfather out only because I know that it’s a film that is often touted. But primarily, I think it’s about Pacino for me.I think all of the things that make The Godfather what people call the perfect film, where you’re taken into a world where, for most us, is really just — we’re never going to go there ourselves, into the world of the mafia and organized crime, but to see how it’s connected to family and how that is the basis of this story being the bond within a family, is so foreign to, I think, most of us. Foreign as far as where killing is part of family life. It’s just so unusual, but at the same time, it’s done in such a way that they make it feel perfectly normal.Of course, again, there’s Brando, there’s Pacino, and then in the second one we see De Niro.I think I’m often drawn to films primarily because of the performances, and speaking of performances, I would then probably move to Dog Day Afternoon with Al Pacino for very different reasons. We see Pacino in Godfather in an extremely restrained performance. And then, of course, in Dog Day Afternoon, we see just this loose mess of a human being spilling out out all over the place, and he’s just absolutely electric and just as compelling and just as unpredictable as the character Michael Corleone in Godfather, but completely at opposite ends of the spectrum.I just think Pacino is someone for me who, like Brando, I just find him completely watchable and can’t get enough of him. Anything he does, really, I would find compelling. Although there have been performances lately that haven’t been as interesting as the earlier stuff.[Godfather and Dog Day Afternoon] are so different. They’re really, really different. I think Godfather is a better film, but I think Dog Day&nbsp;— that performance —&nbsp;John Cazale‘s performance in Dog Day, as well — and as you know, I have really eclectic taste anyway in the kinds of things that I like, and the kinds of jobs that I choose, too. I get just as much out of both of those films. The potential energy that exists in Godfather versus Dog Day is that they’re just extreme, explosive kind of sweaty performances of Pacino [and they are]&nbsp;are two completely different things, but they both affect me&nbsp;a great deal.Bridget Jones's Diary (2001)  80%I’m also a big fan of comedy as well, so even things to this day like Bridget Jones’s Diary, there was just something about Bridget Jones that I thought … And I guess it’s [Renée Zellweger‘s] performance. I remember there was a lot of talk about the fact that they cast an American in that role, but I think she captured the sensibility of a repressed English girl who was desperate to fall in love so beautifully And as an actor myself, often you caught slack if you’re playing a gay person and you’re not really gay, or you’re playing an American and you’re not really American, or you’re playing whatever it happens to be. I just think if you can find the essence in a character and pull it off, then it doesn’t matter where you’re from or what your nationality is, etc. There’s something to me about that film that’s like the perfect romantic comedy. I just think it’s a bit hard to put my finger on what it is, to be honest.&nbsp;It’s just beautifully executed. Everything’s so well balanced. Often whenever I read a romantic comedy now, I’m comparing it to Bridget Jones and if it’s planned well.Gallipoli (1981)  91%One of my favorite directors is Peter Weir, and a film that I watched recently of his is Gallipoli —&nbsp;Mel Gibson and Mark Lee, as well as a bunch of other great Australian actors. I think that film for me is this incredible combination of the brutality of war and yet the sensitivity of the human spirit, and I think Mel Gibson is absolutely electric and fantastic in that film, but I think Mark Lee is utterly heartbreaking. His almost non-sexual personality and spirit is so engaging and sensitive that the film, and the combination with his performance, the energy of the film, and then the music in that film really — I think music is a really important aspect in film, and, as you know, you can play Yakety Sax over a scene, or you can play something from Morricone&nbsp;over a scene, and the scene will then have a completely different meaning and feel. That’s an extreme example, but if music is done well in a movie, it can turn anything, even a three dimensional performance — it can make it turn more three dimensional because it enhances what is meant to be there. I think that the music used in Gallipoli is just utterly heartbreaking. Really, really heartbreaking and beautiful.&nbsp;Brimstone&nbsp;opens on Friday, Mar. 10, 2017 in limited&nbsp;release.","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"Paquin, See","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/01182141/guy-pearce-fea.jpg","slug":"guy-pearces-five-favorite-films"},{"id":"47508826768496","title":"Milla Jovovich’s Five Favorite Films","content":"Five Favorite Filmsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Milla Jovovich's Five Favorite Filmsby Grae Drake | January 25, 2017 |  Comments(Photo by Kevin Winter/Getty Images)&nbsp;Resident Evil: The Final Chapter&nbsp;opens Friday and&nbsp;is the newest — and the last — offering in the video game franchise. Star Milla Jovovich&nbsp;has survived six of these films — on screen and off — with bad-assery and skill. But when she’s not destroying the undead, she does films of other genres (The Fifth Element, Dazed and Confused, Zoolander). Living in a zombie apocalypse probably doesn’t give one too long to ponder many things other than survival tactics, like Five Favorite Films or the next great strudel recipe. But we were able to get Jovovich to do just that. Here is her list of awesomeness:Blade Runner (1982)  90%It’s such a modern film and it was really just taking all these risks and pushing the boundaries. When you know the history about it, it’s so interesting because it bankrupted the people that made it. I don’t even think it was that successful when it first came out.It just kind of built up this audience over years and years. It’s so beautifully shot and the music, everything just came together, and Sean Young. That was a defining moment in her career. Perfect.Her hair is unforgettable.Daryl Hannah, that makeup, it was just out of this world.I interviewed Ridley Scott once and said, “I just want to thank you for giving me Rutger Hauer in boxer briefs because it kind of turned me into a woman.”Right?Really exceptional. That’s a great one.Those tests that they do at the beginning — I think that’s just classic.It’s one of those movies — it almost seems like they had a crystal ball when they were writing it; it’s so valid even today.It really is.Boogie Nights (1997)  93%That’s one film that just like — when you’re flipping the channels and you’re lucky enough to find that — I don’t care where it starts, the end or the beginning or the middle — I’ll just watch that all the way because all of those characters, all of those actors; it’s like the beginning of so many amazing careers. The dialogue is timeless. That first scene with John C. Reilly, he’s like, “Dig for greed.” It’s so good.Oh my God, there are so many good scenes in that movie.There’s quite a few [Paul] Thomas Anderson movies that…&nbsp;Magnolia is one of those too. I’ll watch that one at any point. Tom Cruise…He’s unbelievable in that.Amazing, and just the most incredible performances. Julianne Moore just killed in that movie.The Shining (1980)  84%It f—ed me up for life. I still can’t walk down a long corridor without getting scared.You always imagine that it’s going to be covered in blood in a minute, or that there are twins at the end of it.Something at the end.Always something.I always run, and that’s saying a lot. You’re an adult — you’re a middle aged person — and you’re still like, “Okay, let’s just get to my room.”A good argument, I think, for how movies really do effect you. They really do stay with you. They can make an impression on you.It’s so true.I have a question. Do you think that Jack Nicholson became crazy during the course of the movie or that he always was crazy?I think Kubrick‘s pretty crazy too. Do you know what I’m saying? I think he drove them crazy.They probably all started pretty crazy then.I think Jack Nicholson was born crazy but I’m not one to talk. I don’t know him.Mean Streets (1973)  95%Mean Streets —&nbsp;Robert De Niro is so gorgeous. Again, the beginning of all these people’s careers. What a full, well-rounded movie. Then you go to Goodfellas, it’s hard. [Picking five] really is hard. I also loved Wolf of Wall Street, I have to say. That was a fun movie. Matthew McConaughey, so good.I think [what I love about Mean Streets is] just seeing the world, seeing the costumes, the relationships these guys have with each other. I think also just the stories behind — knowing that these actors, this was so many of their first movie breakout performances; it’s unbelievable watching it and the performances are so great.WALL-E (2008)  95%You can’t forget animated films either.&nbsp;WALL-E just kills me. It’s so funny because we watched WALL-E with my daughter when she was little, like two and three and four, and she loved it and then we didn’t watch. It was one of those “we watched it 50 times” kind of films. We didn’t watch it for a couple of years and tried to watch it again when she was seven and as soon as she heard the music, in that part where you have to press play and it was lonely music, and she’s like, “It’s just making me feel really sad. I can’t watch it.”Then watching him alone on the garbage dumps and she was like, “But everybody’s gone.” It suddenly just started making her question reality, and she kind of tripped out. I had to turn it off because she started crying.It’s amazing to me, because I don’t have kids, but the emotional difference — I see the same thing in myself too. I watch Boogie Nights as an adult way different than I did maybe even just five years before that. It’s interesting how your relationship changes.You grow and make stupid mistakes. You suddenly watch and go, “Oh my God.”You’re like Alfred Molina in a bathrobe throwing firecrackers.Right, exactly. Also, with Don Cheadle and the bank. Heartbreaking.I know, I still feel bad for him.I feel like we all have moments like that, where we’re, “I’m not that.” I’m like really dragging, “I’m not that.”I was driven to this and I’m just trying to do something good. That’s a solid, it’s a solid film.Resident Evil: The Final Chapter&nbsp;opens Friday, Jan. 27 in wide&nbsp;release.","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"Arts, reboot, Thanksgiving, Travel, documentary, LGBTQ, monsters, of, Food, Comics, TBS, book, History","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/24151031/milla-fea.jpg","slug":"milla-jovovichs-five-favorite-films"},{"id":"47508826790008","title":"Will Packer’s Five Favorite Films","content":"Five Favorite Filmsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Will Packer's Five Favorite FilmsAlmost Christmas Producer Will Packer Talks His First Production Internship and Bringing On the Tears.by Kerr Lordygan | November 8, 2016 |  CommentsPhoto by Rob Kim/Getty Images for Tribeca Film FestivalAlmost Christmas, a holiday film with an amazing cast and crew, opens this Friday. We thought it would be cool to get not one, but two Five Favorite Films entries in celebration of the release. We start today with producer Will Packer, who also brought us Straight Outta Compton, About Last Night, and Ride Along. See the list here, and a followup mini-interview about working with such a stellar cast (and see part two with actor JB Smoove here).The Shawshank Redemption (1994)  91%Shawshank Redemption, because I love that it is about the power of the human spirit. That movie is one that I watch when I think about giving up. And that’s rare. I don’t do that anymore, but when I was first starting out in this industry, I would use that film as a metaphor for life because it was really hard and I was getting told “no” by all the studios and [wondered] if I would ever be a successful filmmaker. I would literally look and I would say, “If [Andy Dufresne] can survive and go through all that and keep his spirit then so can I, dammit [laughing].” That’s one of my favorites.Aliens (1986)  97%I’m a really big fan, but I also like the combination of action and a little bit of humor and the storyline. I’m a fan of that film just from a pure escapist entertainment perspective. Nothing to do with the overall themes of human nature or people surviving as a human race. None of that. It’s just fun. It’s just a fun movie.The Usual Suspects (1995)  89%Yes. I like that one. It was one of those I saw late. I’d talked to everyone else who had already seen it.&nbsp;I like the construction of the narrative in that film.New Jack City (1991)  77%That was the first movie that I saw that I felt really painted the picture of the gritty hardcore realities of the urban drug culture.&nbsp; Done in a way that made it palatable for mainstream audiences. It was glossy and it was like that black version of an Italian mafia film. But I dug it for those reasons.Boomerang (1992)  43%I’m skippin’ past all my movies right now in my mind,&nbsp;just so you know [laughing]. You know what? I’m going to go with Boomerang.&nbsp;Yeah. It was either going to be Boomerang or The Color Purple, but I feel like I’m trying to pick movies that not everybody picks. So I’m going with Boomerang.&nbsp;It was Eddie at the height of Eddie. It was a movie that was different than you had seen him do. The romantic comedy genre, and of course Halle Berry, who was still a fresh face at that time.&nbsp;I really enjoyed the construction of that movie. I’m a fan of the Hudlin Brothers [Warrington and Reginald]. They actually gave me my first internship in this industry.&nbsp;Absolutely. Straight out of college. My first internship was on a movie they made for Miramax, called Ride. I went down to Jacksonville, Florida and I was a camera PA on that movie. I learned a lot about Hollywood production. At that point I had made a movie, but it was an independent film that I made while I was still in college. This was my introduction to Hollywood filmmaking.Almost Christmas brings on the tears, man. What’s that about? Did you have to do that?Gotta have that with a good Holiday movie. I mean of course you gotta have the laughter the uproarious comedy, but if you really get invested in a family, you’ve got to have heart. And you gotta have moments that pull those heartstrings.&nbsp;The holidays are the best of times and the worst of times. Sometimes you’re just holding on. You’re just trying to survive. And sometimes it’s just, “Oh yeah. I know why I love this family! Other times it’s like ‘How Soon Before It’s Over?'” With a movie like this you’ve got to show both sides.Yeah, but, I’m sorry, I just thought it was mean.I have heard that a few times [laughing]&nbsp;I take it as a compliment. What part got you?Family relations stuff. And especially around the holidays. Even families at their worst — for some people it’s better still than not having that. There’s something to be said for that.That’s right. Well said. Well said.Hey, you put it out there! I just recapped. So, what was it like to work with such an amazing cast?I’ll tell you this. I got this script. It was a Thanksgiving movie about a family that was trying to survive Thanksgiving after the death of the matriarch. I made a movie called This Christmas a few years ago and I had been looking for an opportunity to get back into that holiday family movie genre. And I got this script and I told Dave Talbert, the writer/director, I said, “Listen, I got one big note.” He was so nervous, he was like, “Oh my God. What? What is it?” And I said, “Let’s just make it Christmas.” And he was all in.The first call I made after that was to Gabrielle Union. Gab and I had done a bunch of projects together and talked about producing together. I hit her up and I said, “YO G!” And she said, “What you got, Packer?,” and I said, “I got something for us.” Having her on board as an actor and as an executive producer really gave us the anchor we needed to go out and get people that are iconic:&nbsp;Danny Glover and people that have been in the game forever doing great movies and great work like Kimberly Elise, who I think is woefully underutilized. And JB Smoove who is so incredibly, painfully witty. He’s so funny.And even newcomers like Jessie T. Usher and DC Young Fly. I really dig this cast. I’ve made a few of these ensemble movies. You don’t know how the cast is going to come together, but I’ve been very, very fortunate to work with some great casts that really gelled together in a really good way. You can tell onscreen when a cast is working and when it’s not, when they’re just going through the motions. This cast really had an affinity for each other.We can tell that in the ending credits bloopers reel that you’ve got going. It is so funny. You could just tell everyone loved working with each other.That’s how it really was on set, yeah.So now I have to ask, what is your favorite holiday film?Oh wow! You know what? Soul Food. I like Soul Food. I really do. That was something that was inspirational to me when I made This Christmas and even this movie. That was like the first time I had seen an African-American family that looked like my family and was available to me onscreen. I was barely making movies at the time when that came out. I really enjoyed it.Almost Christmas opens Friday in wide release.","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"Opinion, Emmy, visit, Sci-Fi, Netflix, trailers, CNN, name, First, lee, Sundance, ITV, batman, VOD","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/04175809/will-packer-rep.jpg","slug":"will-packers-five-favorite-films"},{"id":"47508826784886","title":"Jeff Nichols’ Five Favorite Films","content":"Five Favorite Filmsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Jeff Nichols' Five Favorite FilmsThe Loving Filmmaker Discusses Paul Newman's Flawed Characters and the Emotional Draw of Kurosawa.by Kerr Lordygan | November 15, 2016 |  CommentsPhoto by Araya Diaz/WireImage/Getty ImagesFilmmaker Jeff Nichols&nbsp;has a whole slew of Certified Fresh films to his name, starting with his 2007 debut&nbsp;Shotgun Stories and onward through Take Shelter, Mud, Midnight Special, and his latest, Loving, which is currently in theaters in limited release. That’s quite a track record, and so we we jumped at the opportunity to ask him about his own Five Favorite Films, three of which star&nbsp;Paul Newman. Here’s what the man has to say:Badlands (1974)  97%The first one —&nbsp;I would say Badlands. I caught Badlands&nbsp;in college for the first time. They actually had a film screening of it at my film school. I’d just never seen a film like that before. I’ve never seen a film that was paced that way, that was structured that way, that felt that honest. But also at the same time kind of dreamy and transportive. I remember immediately going home to my dorm room and I called my older brother — who’s kind of my bellwether for cool interesting things — [and asked], “Have you seen this film?” I tried to explain a theme to him, which was nearly impossible of [Martin] Sheen‘s character giving his comb away to the National Guard soldiers at the end of the film. My brother: “I don’t understand what you’re talking about.” You realize that’s kind of how that movie is — you can definitely revel in it and share with it when other people have seen it. But it’s such a beautiful anomaly that when you try and tell people about it that haven’t seen it it’s kind of impossible to categorize or just explain.&nbsp;Badlands —&nbsp;it touched upon a stylized truthfulness that I wanted to do in my film.Cool Hand Luke (1967)  100%Now we’ll start with the Paul Newman ones. The three Paul Newman ones. I guess I’ll start with Cool Hand Luke. I think it’s the first time I ever started to recognize metaphor. Or I guess allegory, because it’s a bit of a Christ allegory, I think. After he eats those 50&nbsp;eggs and he’s laid out on that table it’s the same way that he’s laid out at the end after he’s shot. His legs are crossed, and his arms are out. I didn’t know when I first saw that film that that’s what was going on, or I didn’t know how that affected the rest of the story, but I recognized it, I know that. Because Cool Hand Luke is a strange film where I grew up with it on TV every weekend. It was just one of those films that always played on cable on the weekends growing up. It’s just always there, so you never really consider it. My dad loves that film. Then you go back and sit and watch it when you’re older and you realize that in the background of your life there was this amazing piece of artwork playing. Obviously its depiction of the south and the character behavior in it is just so rich and the cast amazing.Also I’m really drawn to this idea of a square peg in a round hole. That’s what Cool Hand Luke was. Luke was this guy, he wasn’t a bad person but he just didn’t fit in the world around him and he was persecuted as a result. Yeah, he was responsible, he was cutting the heads off parking meters. He was always culpable in the things that he did. But it was more a result that he probably just never belonged anywhere and he was restless as a result, unsettled. What that says to me: it’s not like that’s the way I felt in my life — quite the opposite actually. What I recognized in that is that is an archetype of a man, that person exists. To be able to take a personality type like that and make it so realistic, make it not cliché, make it not generic, but at the same time represent this type of person — I’m really impressed by that. It’s kind of what you strive for in ultimate storytelling in my mind. Both specificity and universality all at the same time.The Hustler (1961)  98%Then the next Paul Newman film has to be The Hustler —&nbsp;that’s as much about directing as anything else. I know that director [Robert Rossen] didn’t do a ton of stuff but that’s the first time I really started thinking about the frame. That’s not true; I thought about the frame before I even knew I was thinking about the frame when I saw Lawrence of Arabia. I saw The Hustler again on a film print in college. I’d seen it many times before, I actually owned it on video in high school. What high school student owns a video cassette of The Hustler? But I did. I just thought it was so beautiful — that black and white photography. The framing in that film&nbsp;— I think it’s cinema scope. I know it’s 235, so super wide frames.The way they would stack foreground-background action in that — that was a real lesson because I had done this thing in my first video project in film school. I was looking at the camera and I was looking at the shot and it was a video camera that they had on a little pee-wee dolly that had a hydraulic boom arm on it. I was just sitting there looking at this video and wondering, “This is in my infancy as a person thinking about visual storytelling.” I was messing with this hydraulic boom lift and looking at the monitor and all of a sudden I lowered the camera to the point to where this table that was right in front of the camera fell into the foreground. Then I had this thing in the foreground and this carriage in the background. And all of a sudden, it just got vastly more interesting to me. I know that might seem so remedial to people that take photographs and other things. This was a big breakthrough for me.When I went back and looked at The Hustler you see all of this complex foreground-background framing going on. Spielberg‘s the best at it too. Spielberg does it all the time. If you look at scenes in Indiana Jones&nbsp;where they’re sitting across the table the more he puts the camera — it’s awesome. But there’s an elegance to the camera placement and the camera movement in The Hustler&nbsp;that’s pretty undeniable.Not to mention, there’s a reason I’m talking about Paul Newman movies: there’s a behavior emerging in these films from the sixties that I really identified with. I almost felt like they valued it more than people in other decades, because they were so directly breaking free from the structures of studio films of the fifties and that acting style, more importantly. That it seemed like, “Now we’re going to take some seriously flawed characters for a run, for a test drive.” It’s when you start getting, I think, some of the best writing in film history —&nbsp;and character writing specifically. Stories that turn on character more than plot. What an odd plot for The Hustler. What an odd trajectory, but totally compelling. When I guess they’re going to the derby or whatever and that’s when his girlfriend — what an odd structure. That’s really something I strive for in my stuff. Structures that aren’t just a continual execution of plot, but are really driven by characters and their flaws.Hud (1963)  83%This one — they’re just kissing cousins, really — but the last Paul Newman film I’ll talk about is Hud —&nbsp;just the greatest introduction to a character maybe ever on screen. You’ve got this goofy kid walking around town and he walks past the bar, and there’s glass on the sidewalk and the bar owner’s sweeping it up. And the kid goes, “Did you have trouble in here last night?” “I had Hud in here last night.” Such an awesome way to introduce the main character of this film. When you first meet him, he’s walking out of this married woman’s house putting his boots on and the husband pulls up, and he immediately blames his nephew.It’s this really incredible thing. I was lucky enough to work on a college professor’s documentary called The Rough South of Larry Brown. Which is about the writer Larry Brown out of Oxford, Mississippi. In that documentary Larry Brown talks about his writing, he says, “Yeah, you read my stuff and you read a little bit and you might think it’s pretty funny. And then you read a little bit more and you realize, it’s not funny worth a damn.” And that’s Hud. You start it off and you’re like, “Gosh, look at this rapscallion, this character,” and then you realize, “Wow, that’s not funny; there is some deep stuff inside that man that is hurt and angry, but is manifesting itself in very evil ways.” The complexity of that — it’s different than Newman’s character in The Hustler. In The Hustler,&nbsp;he’s doing pride, but there’s something deep going on in Hud&nbsp;that’s darker. It’s more about family and legacy and things that I think, because it’s attached to the family, I relate to very much. I had to deal with familial relationships that are complex.Dreams (1990)  65%Let’s tall about Kurosawa‘s Dreams. When Bravo first came on television, they were figuring out who they were as a cable network and would just play random foreign films. This was before the travesty of reality television permeated their station. I was at home alone in high school, I think I was a junior in high school and Dreams&nbsp;comes on by Kurosawa. I could not separate myself from it. I didn’t know who Kurosawa was — I didn’t care. I was just a kid absorbing things that flashed on the screen in front of him. I was immediately captivated by this thing that was at once beautiful — obviously surreal — but at the same time palpable enough to actually hit home emotionally. I think not many people would probably describe scenes in my movies as surreal, but there are some. Kind of this magical realism that exists in that film.Also it feels ancient; it feels like when this boy comes home having witnessed the wedding of foxes and his mother’s there and says he can’t enter the home because he spied on the foxes and then presents a dagger to him and says, “They want you to kill yourself. Run. Run and ask for forgiveness.” It feels like an ancient story, it feels like something — I’m not sure what. It feels like something that kind of bubbled up from our beginning. I was fascinated by that.Just go watch it. It’s all skits, it’s basically short films strewn together.&nbsp;Get’s real weird by the end, but the first three are three of the greatest films I’ve ever seen.Loving&nbsp;is now&nbsp;open in limited release.","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"awards, movie, Photos, Movies, psycho, Character, Television, Thanksgiving, Go, all-time, Office, Set, Alien, 72","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/02145505/jeff-nichols-rep.jpg","slug":"jeff-nichols-five-favorite-films"},{"id":"47508827916412","title":"Jason Blum’s Five Favorite Films","content":"Five Favorite Filmsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Jason Blum's Five Favorite FilmsThe Horror Mogul Alters the Question and Gives us His Five Favorite FIlms of this Year While Confessing that the Timeliness of The Purge: Election Year Was Just a Coincidence.by Matt Atchity | September 22, 2016 |  CommentsPhoto by Laura Cavanaugh / Stringer / Getty ImagesJason Blum&nbsp;and his company Blumhouse Productions are responsible for most of the theatrical horror film releases in recent years. With his hand on the wheel of popular&nbsp;franchises like&nbsp;Insidious, Sinister, The Purge, and&nbsp;Paranormal Activity, as well as countless others (and a few non-horror films like Whiplash), Mr. Blum is now recognized as one of the most prolific creators&nbsp;of horror. With the new home release of&nbsp;The Darkness, we at Rotten Tomatoes grew curious about his favorite films. And when we asked him, he altered the question slightly to provide us with his Five Favorite Films of this year:Hell or High Water (2016)  96%Definitely Jeff Bridges’ performance was what was my favorite thing about it. It was incredible.RT: I love that movie. I have a theory that there is a four-movie quartet that includes that movie; you begin&nbsp;with No Country for Old Men, then move on&nbsp;to Hell or High Water, then The Rover, then the original Mad Max.I like that. I like that.RT: It’s the Downfall-of-Society Quartet.War Dogs (2016)  61%What I loved about War Dogs was the fact that the tone — turning that story into a spectacular two hour ride is just such a complicated thing to do. So really I thought the directing, the way that Todd [Phillips] kind of handled that movie, was just so spectacular. I loved it.The Purge: Election Year (2016)  56%Gotta do one of ours. The Purge: Election Year, because of the timeliness. I wish we could take credit for how timely it was, but it just happened to be extraordinarily timely, and I was very proud of that movie. Loved what James DeMonaco did on that.RT:&nbsp;Yeah that’s turned into a fun little franchise. I shouldn’t say little, but there are a lot of people I know looking forward to more Purge movies.Compared to Avengers, yes, we’re working on that. We’re working on purging [laughing].Before the Flood (2016)  75%I saw a terrific movie last night called Before the Flood, which is [Leonardo] DeCaprio’s &nbsp;movie about global warming, which is spectacular. It’s amazing — &nbsp;really, really amazing. Really blew me away, I thought it was incredible.Kicks (2016)  87%It’s a small independent movie; it was directed by the people who wrote a movie that we did called Lowriders, which we’re actually releasing next May. This is the movie they did before Lowriders, and it’s a very small indie story, but I just thought it was incredibly well done. I think they spent $100,000 on the movie, and I just really loved it.Rotten Tomatoes: I saw that you guys were out at Toronto International Film Festival. Were you out there with The Belko Experiment?Jason Blum:&nbsp;I was. We picked up Belko and I went to go watch it screen at midnight. It screened really well. It’s really fun and we picked it up. We’re going to release it next year, so I’m really psyched about that. It’s a great, crazy movie.The Darkness&nbsp;is now available for&nbsp;home release.","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"Globe, visit, reviews, BAFTA","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/20184304/blum-rep.jpg","slug":"jason-blums-five-favorite-films"},{"id":"47508826792057","title":"Andre Holland’s Five Favorite Films","content":"Five Favorite Filmsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Andre Holland's Five Favorite FilmsThe Moonlight Actor talks about the old days of renting VCRs and the necessity of a shirtless Paul Newman.by Grae Drake | October 28, 2016 |  CommentsPhoto by Ray Tamarra/Getty ImagesFans of&nbsp;Andre Holland&nbsp;on&nbsp;American Horror Story: Roanoake and The Knick&nbsp;can now see him on the big screen in Moonlight, which has earned rave reviews across the board.&nbsp;His Five Favorite Films, listed here, reflect the diversity and quality that he demonstrates as an actor. Movies from several decades and genres populate his list, and he shows his passion for the art as he discusses them. See the list here:The Bourne Identity (2002)  83%The one that, if I’m sitting on the couch and it comes on, I can’t turn away — The Bourne movies. I will watch them a million times, and any time they’re on, which is often [laughs], I gotta watch them. I just loved that character. I thought it was so fascinating and, honestly, that’s the kind of part that I would love to play one day. So, I love watching it and watching the way Matt Damon played it. It’s just so exciting, to me. I don’t know why, but I can’t get enough of it. I think there is a little bit of… &nbsp;just the escapism of it all – running through the streets of Germany or all the different cities that he went to and trying to figure out who you are is really cool. It’s just a cool conceit.Nothing But a Man (1963)  96%The movie that I always watch before doing just about any project — and certainly before doing this one — is called Nothing But A Man. It’s a classic film. Ivan Dixon played the lead character and it’s just about this black man trying to make his way through the world. But it’s a beautiful, beautiful film, and it breaks my heart every time I watch it. It’s just one of the most extraordinary movies I’ve ever seen. I was introduced to it by a friend of mine; I was doing a play — probably eight or nine years ago — and my friend, Aunjanue Ellis, who is an actress, put me on to it and I had not seen it before. Now I watch it all the time. &nbsp;It’s great – I think it was in the 1960s. Ivan Dixon and Abbey Lincoln -– it just was super. An incredible film.Paris Blues (1961)  67%And then kind of parallel to [Nothing but a Man] — number three would probably be my most favorite romance, Paris Blues. Sidney Poitier, Diahann Carroll, Paul Newman, and Joanne Woodward. I love it. The dialogue in that film is some of the best I’ve ever seen. And Sidney Poitier, I think, gives one of his best performances. And it’s so, so sexy, that movie.RT: Yeah, that’s right, it’s been so long since I’ve seen it. And Paul Newman – I remember several of the films he was in that way, actually, as well. I was like, “Man, I feel too young to watch this.”[Laughing] Yeah. He’s got these scenes where he’s in the bedroom with his shirt off, and you can just see it. I mean, he was such a heartthrob, you know. You can just see the filmmaker thinking, “We have to get a shot of Paul Newman with his shirt off [laughing].” And they got a few of them.RT: We’re not made of stone. The filmmaker was right.True, true.Up (2009)  98%For some reason, there’s another movie that I really love, that always breaks my heart and makes me cry, every time I watch it, and that’s the animated movie Up.RT: Oh, my God, yes. We could have a whole therapy session about that movie.Yes, absolutely. Just the opening sequence is, like… I can’t even get through that without breaking down. It’s so beautiful.RT: That movie made me really happy for 3D glasses because it covered my tears.Yeah. That’s hilarious. I know what you mean with those 3D glasses. One of the first times I saw it, I was on a date and, I mean, you talk about trying to hide some tears? I was trying to maintain my cool, but I could not do it. It was such a beautiful movie.RT: Do you think that made the date go better, because it made you so emotionally vulnerable?I think it did, actually, because, as I recall, she was crying a lot, too, and I think it definitely put us both into a good, nice, open, vulnerable place. And it’s funny — where I live in New York, there’s a coffee shop around the corner from me that I go to all the time, basically, and in going to it, there’s a guy who I would always see there, and we would always talk and chat. Someone said, “Oh, yeah, you know he’s a writer and he used to be an actor,” and blah, blah, blah. I didn’t know his work, I’m ashamed to say, but, at the end of Up&nbsp;when the name Tom McCarthy flashed across, I thought, “Wait a minute! That’s the dude from the coffee shop.” &nbsp;I guess I was living under a rock that I didn’t know who he was. But anyway, I just was even more of a fan of his. He’s such a talented man.Oliver! (1968)  82%Number five — this is a tough one. I think the one I would like to say, though, is one — when I was a kid, this is the one that I watched all the time. I had it on VHS tape and probably wore the tape out – I know just about every line from the movie. I don’t know why I loved it so much, but the movie Oliver. The musical version. The Lionel Bart one. Ron Moody was &nbsp;the guy that played Fagin. Growing up, we never went to the movies. I grew up in a pretty rural town in Alabama, and we just never went, and so our big excitement for the weekend would be to go to the video store and… We also didn’t have a VCR, but you could, back in the day, rent a VCR. So, we would rent a VCR, and for some reason, we owned the movie. We owned two movies; we owned Oliver and we owned The Wiz. Whenever we would rent the VCR, we would watch the movies that we rented, but then, because we had the VCR, we’d always end up playing Oliver and The Wiz again. I think that’s probably why I fell in love with it. And then, ironically, it wound up being the first play that I ever did in community theatre. Although I’m [also] obsessed with The Wiz. It terrified me, as a kid. That was gonna be the other one I was gonna say. It was either Oliver or The Wiz, but The Wiz is just amazing.Moonlight&nbsp;is now&nbsp;open&nbsp;in limited release.","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"TCA, Games, Crunchyroll, Christmas, Infographic, boxoffice, Showtime, Comic, Disney, movies","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/27180317/andre-holland-rep.jpg","slug":"andre-hollands-five-favorite-films"},{"id":"47508827931776","title":"Edgar Ramirez’s Five Favorite Films","content":"Five Favorite Filmsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Edgar Ramirez's Five Favorite FilmsThe Hands of Stone star talks about the impossibility of love and why he prefers not to do on-set interviews during filming.by Ryan Fujitani | August 26, 2016 |  CommentsPhoto by: Jason Kempin / Getty ImagesThough he&nbsp;made his Hollywood debut over a decade ago, Venezuelan actor Edgar Ramirez caught his big break&nbsp;when he earned widespread acclaim for his portrayal of real life terrorist&nbsp;Carlos the Jackal (aka Ilich Ramirez Sanchez) in the 2010 miniseries Carlos. Most recently, he appeared in David O. Russell’s Joy alongside&nbsp;Jennifer Lawrence and Robert De Niro, and in last year’s Point Break remake, he tackled the role originally made famous by Patrick Swayze.This week, Ramirez reunites with De Niro for another true story, starring in Hands of Stone as Panamanian boxer Roberto Duran. He spoke to RT enthusiastically about his Five Favorite Films, noting that they were hard to pin down and that he could have continued well past the five he mentioned. Read on for the full list.Dancer in the Dark (2000)  69%The first one that comes&nbsp;to mind is&nbsp;Dancer in the Dark. I was very moved by Bjork’s performance in the film. You know, how much can a person take? How much suffering can someone endure? Also, how storytelling saves you from pain. In the case of this movie, it was through her singing. She was making stories; the medium that she used was music, but it was storytelling through music. She found a refuge in music to deal with so much excruciating pain and isolation and despair. That movie really moves me because it’s so beautiful and it’s so painful at the same time. It’s really overwhelming. I love that film.A lot of people find that film difficult to watch more than once. Is that the case for you?I return to that film, and to that soundtrack. Actually, every time I watch it, I cry as if I’m watching it for the first time. It really breaks my heart, that film. It’s how poetry saves you from darkness and pain, which is a great metaphor for life in general. And the music is so beautiful, and the character of Selma, her pain is so palpable. And the movie deals with so many issues – not being in your country, being far away; dealing with feeling manipulated and deceived – so many issues. But beyond all that, it’s just the pure pain of the film, of the character. It’s really moving to me.In the Mood for Love (2001)  90%The next one that comes to mind is In the Mood for Love. It’s about the impossibility of love, how we get in the way of our own happiness. Again, it’s pure poetry. And Wong Kar-Wai is so stylized, but at the same time, so raw; there’s a rawness in the beauty. He’s a painter, but in his movies – and especially in this movie – beauty doesn’t equal gloss. It’s just pure beauty in the rawness of the emotions in the film. I really like him, and the actors – I love Maggie [Cheung] in the film; she’s so beautiful and so strong.Clouds of Sils Maria (2015)  90%I really loved Clouds of Sils Maria. I just love Juliette [Binoche]. She’s a very close friend – we worked together on An Open Heart in France – but I think everybody was fantastic in this film. Kristen Stewart is fantastic in this film. I think it’s such an honest film. Of course, it’s very intellectual, but it’s very emotional at the same time. If you talk about this film with someone who hasn’t seen it, it’s very hard to say what the movie’s about. There’s so many layers to it. It’s how reality and fiction intertwine, and of course, that’s something I relate to because I’m an actor. So that’s a movie, I think, that really resonates a lot with people involved in what we do – writers, directors, actors. It’s like, when does it stop? Where’s the boundary?Because here’s the thing: the thing is that you need to give something of yourself – you need to lose something – in order to gain something. I think there’s no creative process that goes without injuries and scratches and punches. You get beat up somehow, and that’s part of the commitment. You have to be open to that. You do your job, you do your homework, you open up, and then the camera captures the accident, and when there’s an accident, definitely there will be injuries. That’s what this movie makes me feel.So what’s the boundary? Sometimes, in the middle of the process, you don’t really know. That’s why it’s so hard to speak about movies or your characters when you’re in the process. You know, for example, when they take camera crews or journalists to set, when I’m doing a movie, if it’s possible, I try not to do it. I try not to give interviews during that moment because I don’t really know what to say. I’m being it – you don’t have perspective, because you’re already this mixture; you’re mixed with your character, or at least, that’s my process.I’m telling you this just to illustrate that boundary. You know, where does it begin, and where does it end? I get that from the interaction between Kristen and Juliette’s characters in the film. How much of themselves were they putting out there when they were rehearsing, you know? It’s fascinating, I think. Brilliant.The Hunt (Jagten) (2013)  93%Wow, this movie… I mean, come on. Mads Mikkelsen and Thomas Vinterberg. It’s a very strong film. It’s about the doubt that lingers there. How can you really recover from something like that? And how can you really blame other people for doubting you after something like that? Because the thing is that, the way Thomas Vinterberg presents it, it’s agonizing because you know the truth as the audience, but there’s no way for the character to fully prove that. It’s a movie that makes you really uncomfortable.There's Something About Mary (1998)  83%I love this film. It’s one of the most hilarious films I’ve ever seen. It’s fantastic, I love it. I love everything about the film. Cameron Diaz and Ben Stiller are so moving in the film. Ben Stiller is so fantastic – how many things can go wrong? I mean, it’s hilarious.You know, I was going to say, your choices are all pretty heavy films.No, no, no, I’m not a sad guy. It’s just the moral conflicts, you know? I’m very moved by sadness, yes, but also by bright and amazing happiness and goofiness.Hands of Stone&nbsp;opens this Friday, August 26.","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"Peek, Apple, Calendar, CW, FX, name, Review, camera","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/26123653/Edgar-Ramirez-FFF2.jpg","slug":"edgar-ramirezs-five-favorite-films"},{"id":"47508827944067","title":"Cillian Murphy’s Five Favorite Films","content":"Five Favorite Filmsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Cillian Murphy's Five Favorite Filmsby RT Staff | August 12, 2016 |  CommentsIrish actor Cillian Murphy first came to international attention when he starred in Danny Boyle’s zombie thriller&nbsp;28 Days Later in 2002, and since then, he’s racked up a number of impressive credits. Most notably, Murphy reunited with Boyle for Sunshine, collaborated with Christopher Nolan on multiple projects (the Dark Knight trilogy), and worked with Ken Loach, Wes Craven, and Neil Jordan, in addition to starring in his own period BBC drama, Peaky Blinders.This week, Murphy stars in World War II thriller Anthropoid, based on the true story of the assassination of a high-ranking Nazi officer by Czechoslovakian operatives, and he was kind enough to share his Five Favorite Films. Read on for the full list.Scarecrow (1973)  77%I rented this film by mistake when I was 15 with my brother. They told us it was a scary movie. It pretty much made me want to be an actor. Al Pacino will break your heart. And Gene Hackman will break your other heart.Mean Streets (1973)  95%Another very early formative film for me. Extraordinary energy and performances from De Niro and Keitel, with Scorsese beginning to cast a spell over filmmaking in the 1970s.La Haine (1996)  100%Still relevant, still shocking. Stunning performances and direction. A film I revisit very often. Vincent Cassel is a bit of a hero.The Butcher Boy (1997)  77%Arguably the finest Irish book and Irish film of the last few decades. Twisted and funny and dark. Pat McCabe and Neil Jordan are masters.The Night of the Hunter (1955)  95%A masterpiece visually and in so many ways, but also a tragedy as Charles Laughton only directed this one film. Robert Mitchum is so rivetingly magnetic.Anthropoid&nbsp;opens in limited release this Friday, August 12.","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"DGA, 2019, sequel, Mary, cancelled, Marathons","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/12125558/Cillian-Murphy.jpg","slug":"cillian-murphys-five-favorite-films"},{"id":"47508829542541","title":"Colin Farrell’s Five Favorite Films","content":"Five Favorite Filmsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Colin Farrell's Five Favorite Filmsby Grae Drake | May 20, 2016 |  Comments(Photo by Andrew Goodman/Getty Images)&nbsp;Irish actor Colin Farrell is a tough man to pin down artistically (it’s how he keeps our relationship with him fresh). With a career that ranges from big box office popcorn flicks like Minority Report&nbsp;to independent ventures like In Bruges, he exhibits an adventurous spirit that is directly reflected in his choice of favorite films. He next appears in the Harry Potter spinoff Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them,&nbsp;alongside Eddie Redmayne and Katherine Waterston. We spoke to Farrell about this Five Favorite Films, which you can find below:Paris, Texas (1984)  97%The whole feel of this film was something that woke me up to cinema in a way. Before this film it was very much an Amblin world for me. Lots of Indiana Jones&nbsp;and John Hughes and Willy Wonka&nbsp;(the original) and Van Damme action movies and Richard Pryor comedies like Brewster’s Millions, etc. Then a friend introduced me to Paris, Texas. The aching loneliness and sense of lost love that pervades the film from the arid desolation of the desert landscape to the haunting strings of Ry Cooder’s soundtrack just blew me away. Maybe I was 17 or 18 when I saw it, but it stayed with me, and I go back to it about once a year. It also has one of the most honest portrayals of the loss of love between a couple, and the inherent danger within the nature of obsession. This lost love is broken down for the audience in what, to me, is possibly most quietly powerful monologue ever delivered in any film I’ve seen; when Harry Dean Stanton’s character, Travis, finally sits with the woman he loved and lost, and he recounts their story to her. Travis has to turn the chair around, so he’s facing away from her while he speaks. I assume because it’s too much to look at her while he’s expressing where and how such love disintegrated. Yeah, it’s a beautiful, beautiful film.Withnail and I (1987)  94%Oh man, is there a funnier and more poignant film that captures the anarchic irreverence of that period? It’s just perfect, from start to finish, in my book. Ridiculously quotable with mad, perfect performances across the board. Richard E Grant is pure genius, but everyone in the film gives amazing and hilarious and heartbreaking performances. Again, I think loneliness and isolation, and a desire to belong play big parts in this one. The story is as much a love story between the two leads as anything, with a very sad break-up of sorts taking place at the very end; with Withnail left out in the rain.Some Like It Hot (1959)  95%This was where I fell in love for the first time. As a boy of maybe nine, or so. Marilyn really nailed my little, tentative heart. Something about her insane beauty, mixed with that self doubt and sensitivity she portrayed, was so effecting. The performances from Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon are hilarious. Again, like most great films, this one has some quotes and moments that just stay in the mind and resonate. It’s a film about love and friendship and second chances, I think. Will never get tired of watching this, as long as I’ve got days on my calendar.Lawrence of Arabia (1962)  93%This is just maddeningly brilliant. At once sweeping and epic, and yet searingly personal, thanks to the incredible work of Peter O’Toole. It’s such a long film, which I love, and yet there’s not a moment in it that seems like it’s played too long. Everything from the rich orchestral score, to the extraordinary photography of F.A Young, and David Lean at the peak of his powers make this a timeless film, and one that remains, sadly, as relevant today as when it was shot. It’s about political and financial power and about the subjugation of a people, the fight for freedom and the power of the individual to make a stand against the imperial. All the performances are fantastic, from Sir Alec Guinness to Omar Sharif and on. Again, this feels like a perfect piece of cinema to me.Back to the Future (1985)  96%This one. A nostalgia that will never go away. I went back and forth between this, and BIG with Tom Hanks but I ultimately chose this film for sheer entertainment, and for how outlandish the story is, and just how much fun the whole thing is. I saw it recently again, and it just doesn’t date. Michael J Fox, who I loved already from Family Ties, was the coolest thing on two heels for me. I just wanted to be him. The DeLorean. Doc Brown. Time Travel. A bit of young love. All these things played out with such light. A true classic.Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them&nbsp;opens on November 18.","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"Video, Kimmy, ViacomCBS, crime, Society, league, TBS, Comic, Sundance, shows, Polls, spanish","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/20160627/Colin-Farrell-600x262.jpg","slug":"colin-farrells-five-favorite-films"},{"id":"47508829575315","title":"Chris Columbus’ Five Favorite Films","content":"Five Favorite Filmsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Chris Columbus' Five Favorite Filmsby RT Staff | March 11, 2016 |  Comments(Photo by Getty Images / Grant Lamos IV / Stringer)&nbsp;Chris Columbus‘ 1980s output helped shape a generation of young film fans with hits like Gremlins, The Goonies, and Adventures in Babysitting — and he’s further solidified his legacy in the decades since, directing more massive hits (including Home Alone, Mrs. Doubtfire, and films in the Harry Potter franchise) while building an impressive production portfolio with releases like The Help, Night at the Museum, The Witch, and this weekend’s The Young Messiah.Columbus took time out of his busy schedule to talk with Rotten Tomatoes about the movies that have defined his personal love affair with cinema and informed his own ever-expanding filmography. Check it out here — and leave a little room for The Godfather, which he purposely didn’t mention because it’s such a widespread favorite.&nbsp;A Hard Day's Night (1964)  98%These are all films vying for my favorite film. The thing I love about all the films I chose for the list is that they still feel extraordinarily fresh, as if they were made yesterday. There’s a timeless quality to them and a vibrancy and an energy to all of them, but particularly A Hard Day’s Night really struck me, being a huge fan of rock and roll. It’s a film that really defies any sort of — it’s difficult to put it into a specific genre — it’s a rock and roll film, right? It’s also sort of like a documentary of the early years of Beatlemania, and it’s also comedically like a Marx Brothers film. I just love the combination of all of those things, which give it an intense vibrancy and charm. Also these are five films that I watch at least once a year. I always come back to them and the Criterion collection just restored [Hard Day’s Night].&nbsp;It was a marvel to see it restored and how beautiful a movie it is.Saturday Night Fever (1977)  82%Moving to New York from Ohio in 1976, it was an opportunity for me to just basically gorge myself on films that I had never had an opportunity to see before. There were so many theaters, so many repertory theaters showing films. You could see three films for a dollar, you could see prints of these movies, and I was watching a lot of films. In 1977, Saturday Night Fever came out, and it was the first time I remember seeing a film twice. Sitting there and watching it once and sitting there and watching it again. Another musical choice, but different than A&nbsp;Hard Day’s Night because it felt like it really captured what was going on — at least what I felt was going on in New York at that particular time. Travolta’s performance in that film is one of the top ten performances I think I’ve seen in film in my entire life: very real portrayal of a character, the relationships all feel very authentic and real, and it’s got an energy and an emotional intensity that really stuck with me. Sticks with me all these years later. I always wanted to see someone do a sequel to it — not the sequel that exists, not Staying Alive, but the sequel that felt like —&nbsp;it would be interesting if someone would go back to do a Creed sort of version of where those characters are now.On the Waterfront (1954)  99%I actually own a print of this. It’s one of those movies that was pivotal [for] me. I remember it screened in 16mm at my high school. The emotional power of that movie — it’s the first time I ever felt such intense emotion watching a film. I wasn’t that well-versed in film in high school, but I knew I was being hit by something incredibly powerful. What really struck me was Marlon Brando’s performance. And I know that’s easy to say, but that’s why I never get tired of watching the film, and why I really wanted to own a print because there’s a level of acting there that went beyond anything I had seen before. And it still ranks as maybe the best performance I’ve ever seen on film. I find it fascinating every time I watch it. Plus he’s surrounded by a brilliant cast and also the location — the way the film was shot on location — at that time, it had never been done before. All of that adds to the fact that I have a pretty lousy print of the movie but that’s what’s fun about it — it even feels more real. And then Criterion — to be completely geeked out — released it again last year, and I didn’t know it was shot in three different formats. Television was becoming popular at the time so they didn’t know if they would go widescreen with it, 1:85, or the typical way I think it was released, which I think is 1:66, but it’s fascinating to look at those versions as well. This is one of the greats.Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969)  88%Godfather and Blazing Saddles got me into falling in love with film, but this is a pivotal movie that was probably — I think it was 1969 — prior to that I had been to the movies a few times and seen some hideous movies like Santa Claus Conquers the Martians and that sort of thing, and The Jungle Book. I went with my cousin to see Butch Cassidy. It was an amazing mixture of what I thought was sort of a poignant character study and a comedy. What’s amazing about the movie — and the reason I watch it time and time again — I had never seen such chemistry between two actors. Newman and Redford were just incredible together, and those sequences in the movie were some of the funniest sequences I’ve ever seen. So they taught me how to stage comedy a little bit, yet at the same time, it had serious undertones. It was beautifully directed and shot, and you watch it today, and it feels like it was made last week.Horse Feathers (1932)  97%I watch this with my family a lot. All of the Marx Brothers movies have been very popular in the Columbus household for the last 20 years or so. I was a bit of a dictator making my kids watch these movies. They grew up with them because kids are really reluctant to watch black-and-white films. Our family loved the Marx Brothers films, and for some reason the one that we always went back to, and the one that we were obsessed with, was Horse Feathers. It’s 1932, so that’s going back a long way. Yet at the same time I would show that movie to my kids who were seven and five and three, and they were mesmerized. I learned a lot about comedy and breaking the rules in that movie — in terms of comedy — which extended to seeing movies like Blazing Saddles and Young Frankenstein and Annie Hall to a certain extent. The Marx Brothers started it all, and it’s smart comedy. The funny thing about the movie is, there are scenes that, still for me and my family, are falling down funny. So they can watch that movie and take away from it — maybe laugh a little harder than they do at some of the more modern comedies. That movie — and there’s like five or six Marx Brothers movies — is just a wonderful sort of family experience and that’s why it’s on the list.&nbsp;The Young Messiah&nbsp;is now&nbsp;open in wide release.","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"Adult, lord, hollywood, BET, Day, technology, watch, Seed, service, leads, critic, Awards, Box, Disney, monster","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/09155037/chris-c-rep.jpg","slug":"chris-columbus-five-favorite-films"},{"id":"47508827961481","title":"Michael Jai White’s Five Favorite Films","content":"Five Favorite Filmsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Michael Jai White's Five Favorite FilmsThe star of Vigilante Diaries has a sweet spot for 1980s comedies.by Grae Drake | June 28, 2016 |  Comments(Photo: Getty Images / Ben Gabbe / Stringer)Michael Jai White, known for terrific&nbsp;performances in such diverse projects as&nbsp;Tyson, Why Did I Get Married, Spawn, Black Dynamite and Tyler Perry’s For Better or for Worse&nbsp;has been a busy guy. His latest film,&nbsp;Vigilante Diaries, is playing in limited release, but he made time for Rotten Tomatoes when we asked him what his favorite movies are. Here are five from the top of his list:&nbsp;The Princess Bride (1987)  97%I think Princess Bride is my very favorite all time movie. It’s gotta be number one. There is no way that movie comes on without me watching it. It’s funny. It’s sweet. It’s adventurous. I can watch it with my kids. It’s just a delight. I just feel great watching the movie and afterwards. It might be the one movie I’ve seen more than any other movie. I don’t know if that kills my tough guy image.Monty Python and the Holy Grail (1975)  97%To me, Monty Python and the Holy Grail is the funniest movie ever made. There are influences in this film that caused me to write Black Dynamite. I’m such a Monty Python Fan. I think that the layers of humor go from absurdly silly to very intellectual and then you have the physical humor on top of that. I don’t think I’ve seen a movie as physically and mentally funny with the brilliance of satire and political humor underneath it. This movie is just so layered, and again it is what influenced me in writing Black Dynamite.Enter the Dragon (1973)  95%This movie largely influenced me by putting me in the position I am in now. It’s the greatest martial arts movie ever made.Say Anything... (1989)  98%Say Anything is just such a sweet coming-of-age movie. I just love everything about it: the romance, the comedy, the time period, the music, and the chemistry between the two lead characters. This movie was the beginning of a lot of great careers. The image of John Cusack and the Peter Gabriel song “In Your Eyes” is just so iconic. And Cameron Crowe is my favorite director of all time. If there were a sixth&nbsp;favorite film, it would have been Almost Famous.Coming to America (1988)  72%In my opinion, Coming to America is the second funniest movie ever made. And it is one of the most quoted films I’ve ever seen. It’s just a masterpiece.Vigilante Diaries&nbsp;is now open in limited release.","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"witnail","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/27175950/mjw-rep.jpg","slug":"michael-jai-whites-five-favorite-films"},{"id":"47508827957383","title":"Kevin Murphy’s Five Favorite RiffTrax/MST3K Movies","content":"Five Favorite Filmsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Kevin Murphy’s Five Favorite RiffTrax/MST3K MoviesThe film commentator and funnyman discusses producers hiring friends, Lemminkäinen, and why Twilight is perfect for riffing.by Grae Drake | July 6, 2016 |  CommentsPhoto by Brad Barket / Getty Images / StringerA couple weeks ago, we asked Kevin Murphy, one of the minds behind Mystery Science Theater 3000 and RiffTrax, to share his favorite movies with us. And now, as an added bonus in response to the &nbsp;very cool RiffTrax and #BringBackMST3K’s live show&nbsp;that occurred on June 28th&nbsp;— with a repeat on July 12th&nbsp;— in movie theaters around the country, the comic film commentator also gave us his Five Favorite Films to riff on. So, gather round, grab some popcorn to share with your funniest friends, and check out this list of nutty, um, classics?Space Mutiny (1988) It starred Reb Brown. They tried to make him into an action hero and failed. This Canadian crew came down and shot on the set of Battlestar Galactica while they were dark. And one of these crew members in the movie finds out about something she shouldn’t and she gets killed and the next day she’s at her desk in the background and it’s never mentioned. She’s just there, it’s wonderful.The Day the Earth Froze (Sampo) (1959) This is directed by Alexander Ptushko. I think he was Russian but he did all his films in Finland because they actually had money. This is like an amalgam of Norse folk tales poured into a film. The special effects are stunning for the time of the film, and yet it is so whacked out. It’s indescribable. It seems like it was filmed with an alien culture. Nothing makes any sense of any iteration of myth or culture that you can think up in this world. It’s actually quite beautiful, and it has a hero whose name is Lemminkäinen who tries to be a hero and just continues to fail in every respect and yet he comes home and it’s “hail to the conquering hero” even though he’s a total failure. And we actually sing a song in the Riff Trax about what a failure he is.The Guy From Harlem (1977) I forget who turned us on to this, but it came out in the era of films like Shaft and Superfly. The guy from Harlem is supposed to be this cool suave detective fella’ who found that there were too many cool, fly detectives in Harlem and moved to Florida. That’s the whole thing. Honest to God, it’s the kind of thing — if Tim Meadows saw this, it could have been one of his characters, because nothing ruffles him but he acts like a spaz and an idiot so many times during the film that you can’t help but laugh. He’s always trying to be super suave at the same time, though, so it’s amazing. I think that it’s one of those films where the producers hired a lot of friends and family members to do onscreen performances, because there’s at least one moment when you can tell the guy on camera, he doesn’t know a single one of his lines. And yet he flubs his way through what you think is ostensibly what he’s supposed to say, and then gets to the end and that’s all he does in the film.Miami Connection (1988)  68%We put this one out into the world and we got hundreds and hundreds of responses saying “of course.” It was perfect for us. The lead is really sincere, and everyone says he’s a great guy. A tae kwon do champion. And he has not only a tae kwon do team — which are all these guys who he lives with in a house — but&nbsp;they’re also a band, and they all go to a junior college in Florida. The music is as hammy as possible and the guys never wear their shirts — even on stage, shirtless through almost the whole film. And they seem to have no compunction over killing people who get in their way, and yet they’re all, like, loving friends, and delightful at the end. Even though the trail of killing is miles long.Twilight (2008)  49%I’d die a happy man if we could Riff this one live. Never has a film been so perfect for us. I had heard my nieces talk about the books and how much they were going to love this film. I actually went to a movie theater to see Twilight —&nbsp;a grown man on my own on a Monday so no one would see me — and I came back and emailed immediately, “You guys, you guys, we have to have to have to do this film.” And it’s one of our most popular. It’s so perfect. In every turn it begs for someone to mock it. It is so dead earnest about itself, it is so serious.RT: Important question: are you team Edward or team Jacob?I am team mustache dad, all the way.

He immediately pointed out how this exercise is “an unfair thing to ask someone who likes movies.” He indulged us, regardless, and went on to&nbsp;explain: “It ultimately comes down to what movies, when they come on at two in the morning when I should be in bed, do I watch until the end.”To celebrate the triumphant return of RiffTrax and #BringBackMST3K’s live show coming up on June 28th with a repeat on July 12th in a movie theater near you, Murphy gave us both his list of Five Favorite Films — which follows below — and&nbsp;his list of Five Favorite Films to “comment” on, which will be revealed in a follow-up article next week.Local Hero (1983)  100%Bill Forsythe film, Scottish and unassuming. He came to the states and he worked with Peter Riegert and you’ll recognize Peter Capaldi as a very young man named Donnie. It’s so sweet, and yet savvy, and I think that’s the same thing with Local Hero&nbsp;— it’s a comic film that captures a tremendous amount of sadness and that’s really hard to pull off, to have a character who’s fundamentally sad, and then finds something wonderful and risks it being taken away from him. That’s the complication of the film. He’s the oil man that comes over from this huge air conglomerate in Houston and his mission is to come over to this small town and buy the town and turn it into an oil refinery. It was a precursor to things like Northern Exposure. Instead of having aggressively quirky characters, all of these characters are people I’ve met when I’ve been to the British Isles and Scotland, and yes they are that eccentric. Peter Riegert is wonderful in it. It’s slow and it’s soft, but it’s hilarious, and the music is by Mark Knopfler [of Dire Straits]. I’ve never shown this to anyone who regretted seeing it.Young Frankenstein (1974)  94%I can’t help myself. I think Mel Brooks pulled off a magic trick, which was to pull off a parody of a certain style of film, but also make it something absolutely new at the same time. I love The Producers because it has such great characters, but Young Frankenstein is a little&nbsp; broader and it has some of the most brilliant comic moments. It’s hammy without being overtly crass like Blazing Saddles was. Madeleine Kahn — God bless her — it’s one of the best comic performances that I know of. I go back to it and see something new that she’s added to it. Mel Brooks and she must have fed off each other’s madness to get that sort of performance. And Marty Feldman attacking her fox stole and chewing on it; I lose it every time when I see that.Dr. Strangelove Or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb (1964)  98%I saw it — they brought it to my junior high school when I was in seventh grade and they showed it in an assembly to an English class. It was great.Casablanca (1942)  99%I saw it again recently and had to watch it all the way through to the end. It is so emblematic of an era of film that was unique to its time. There will be no more Bogart and there will be no more Bogart films, and it was for me like the quintessential Bogart film. He’s a good guy with a shadowy past, –he’s a little gruff but you absolutely cheer for him no matter what. It’s just good old fashioned filmmaking that I don’t think has aged, except for the fact that it’s so stylized and sort of melodramatic that you could never pull it off again. It’s frozen in time. It can’t be altered, so it can’t be hurt. Nobody will ever successfully make that film again.Way Out West (1937)  100%It has to be a tie. Laurel and Hardy simply because they are two of the funniest people who have ever been on film. I’m leaping over the entire Marx brothers collection to say this, which I also love, but I recently went back and saw both of these films, and just the combination of really brilliant physical humor and absolute charm when these guys are just standing there, and they’re so good together. Nothing beats weirdness for the sake of weirdness, like the Marx brothers were prone to lapse into. But just to see the scene where they’re in a bar where they’re way out west, and a cowboy starts singing “Trail of a Lonesome Pine” and Stan and Ollie just join in and do a dance and harmonize and Stan gets hit in the head with a hammer, it’s sublime. Sons of the Desert for the same reason. I don’t think there’s ever been a comedy team as good at what they do as these guys.&nbsp;The RiffTrax’s 10th Anniversary, 20th nationwide&nbsp;RiffTrax&nbsp;Live event and the return of #BringBackMST3K, RiffTrax&nbsp;Live: MST3K Reunion performance takes place on Tuesday, June 28, broadcast live&nbsp;via satellite to hundreds of movie theaters across the country with an encore showing Tuesday, July 12.","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"of, Paquin, Awards, Plus, Sundance, Photos, Amazon, international, Star, politics","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/22164351/kevin-murphy-rep.png","slug":"kevin-murphys-five-favorite-films-part-1"},{"id":"47508829556879","title":"Karyn Kusama’s Five Favorite Films","content":"Five Favorite Filmsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Karyn Kusama's Five Favorite Filmsby Grae Drake | April 11, 2016 |  Comments(Photo by Matthew Eisman/Getty Images)&nbsp;Karyn Kusama has been at the helm of several projects that warrant numerous viewings — whether it’s the stunning visuals of Aeon Flux&nbsp;or the alternate history of Amazon’s The Man in the High Castle, things often aren’t as they seem. Such is the case in her new film The Invitation, in theaters now. When I talked to her about her Five Favorite Films, her choices were reminiscent of the kind of work worth pondering that she’s dazzled audiences with over the years.:Together (2001)  90%A&nbsp;film of perfectly realized proportions about broken marriages and failed utopian ideals. Slyly understated and very funny, this portrait of a Swedish commune in the mid 1970s is filled with vivid, affectionately-drawn characters, incredibly sympathetic children, and, in the end, a profoundly moving final scene.&nbsp; When I have lost hope in humanity (which sadly occurs more frequently than I would like) I re-watch this stirringly beautiful film and feel my faith in the world restored.The Elephant Man (1980)  92%Though perhaps an outlier in Lynch’s seminal body of work, this film reveals the depth of his humanity and the care with which he attends to all matters of the tragic, the pitiable, and the grotesque. Lynch demands that we align ourselves with the deformed John Merrick, and in bringing the audience so close to the agony of being this man, we approach the same exquisite, unexpected grace that Merrick experiences. Misunderstood and reviled, ridiculed and feared — this is the terrible humanity that Lynch dares to reveal in all of us. We should be grateful for a statement of such compassion and hope.The Hustler (1961)  98%I first saw this film in my early 20s, while on a month-long nannying job in Pittsburgh. Having my nights free, I watched movies to while away the time. This movie descended upon me like an intoxicating cloud of nostalgia and bittersweet regret. Paul Newman‘s soul-crushing beauty, Piper Laurie‘s frank intelligence, George C. Scott‘s lizard-like alertness — this was the powerhouse cast of my dreams. While ostensibly a showdown between two very different pool players — Jackie Gleason‘s seasoned veteran, Newman’s distracted con-man — it’s ultimately a searing portrait of ambition run amok and the failure of the American Dream to deliver on its many promises.The Parallax View (1974)  89%Here’s a movie with a political conspiracy plot that’s all too real.&nbsp; Warren Beatty stars in this elliptical thriller, playing a reporter who insinuates himself into a murderously effective multi-national corporation.&nbsp; Startling, eccentric, and a scary-close approximation of the world we actually live in today, this film continues to stoke the twin fires of paranoia and mistrust.The Year of Living Dangerously (1983)  88%This is a movie to watch when you crave good old-fashioned Hollywood glamour. A young Mel Gibson practically sets the screen on fire with his flinty charisma, as a journalist in way over his head in 1960s Indonesia. With a revolutionary turn by the actress Linda Hunt as a male photographer, and Sigourney Weaver as a British correspondent toying with Gibson’s affections, this is a lustrously intelligent entertainment.The Invitation&nbsp;&nbsp;is now&nbsp;open in wide release.","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"Guide, Animation, golden, OneApp, comic, satire, Marvel, TV, 71st, Day, south, Turner, stoner, ABC, Mystery","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/11212545/karyna-600.jpg","slug":"karyn-kusamas-five-favorite-films"},{"id":"47508829533323","title":"Luis Guzman’s Five Favorite Films","content":"Five Favorite Filmsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Luis Guzman's Five Favorite Filmsby Grae Drake | June 9, 2016 |  Comments(Photo by Getty Images / Alberto E. Rodriguez)&nbsp;Luis Guzman, everyone’s favorite character actor, has a new film&nbsp;out: buddy-cop comedy&nbsp;Puerto Ricans in Paris, co-starring Edgar Garcia, Rosie Perez, and Rosario Dawson. We had a chance to talk to Guzman about his Five Favorite Films and he lays ’em all out:On the Waterfront (1954)  99%I had seen it prior in the course of my life, but when I got into the acting game I referenced it because I was always so blown away by Marlon Brando’s effortless performance, and how truthful it was. I was like, “Wow, I want to do that.” Incredible cast, incredible director. It was a story that people could relate too, you know? The whole aspect of the waterfront and the union and all the shady stuff that went down.12 Angry Men (Twelve Angry Men) (1957)  100%How incredible of a cast [director Sidney Lumet] had in that movie. That was a who’s who. I heard that when Sidney did that movie, most of the guys were doing Broadway plays. So somehow they worked out the timing so they would shoot on certain days. Amazing to see. I got the opportunity to work with Sidney — ended up doing Q &amp; A&nbsp;with him.Billy Jack (1971)  63%I guess because there was some socially conscious stuff going on in that movie. To see somebody stand up to the injustice the way he did was so good. I found the movie to be so honest. That movie was independent when movies were truly independent. That was not a studio movie by any means. I just dug the whole premise of it.Kiss of the Spider Woman (1985)  87%I love watching old movies. The two characters in this movie were unbelievable. Raul Julia was phenomenal in it. They kind of beat each other up emotionally. I really got a kick out of seeing that whole relationship.The Count of Monte Cristo (2002)  73%The Count of Monte Cristo, which I happened to have been in. Only because, man, I really dug how Edmond Dantes went about, his passion in getting his revenge. The movie just looks absolutely beautiful, but, like I said, it was just the story and how well it was made into film. Not just how it was a guy who’s like, “Okay, we’re gonna go get our stuff, we’re just gonna shoot this guy, we’re gonna have a shootout…” No, Dantes really processed his revenge in such a passionate way. Makes you wish other people went about doing thing more thoughtfully and more passionately.RT:&nbsp;What was it like when you read the script?I absolutely believed I was out of my element because I had never done a period piece. When [director] Kevin Reynolds said, “You’re my guy, there’s nobody else I see in this,” I was blown away. When I got to Ireland, I thought I was even more out of my element after hearing how eloquent the Irish and English actors were. I’m like, “Oh, man, how am I going to do this?” Kevin says, “Dude, you don’t even have to worry. You’re a pirate. You come from a totally different place, so just do your thing.” That’s what I ended up doing and it worked!So many people, even today, say this is their favorite movie. Like I said, it was my first period piece. I’m one of those cats, man, that loves to learn. I’m not the guy who shows up knowing it all. I’m the guy who wants to learn, and observe, and appreciate the eloquence of language through the art of acting. I had a chance to do that on The Count of Monte Cristo.Puerto Ricans in Paris is in theaters now.","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"Swim, biography, Fresh, Walking, Alien, TV, Travel, Film, USA","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/09145905/600Luis.jpg","slug":"luis-guzmans-five-favorite-films"},{"id":"47508827959432","title":"Jaume Collet-Serra’s Five Favorite Films","content":"Five Favorite Filmsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Jaume Collet-Serra's Five Favorite FilmsThe Shallows Director shares his love for John Wayne, Bruce Willis, and François Truffaut.by Grae Drake | July 1, 2016 |  CommentsPhoto by Carlos Alvarez / Stringer / Getty ImagesAs&nbsp;Non-Stop demonstrates, director&nbsp;Jaume Collet-Serra&nbsp;has a knack for tense thrillers in&nbsp;extreme locations.&nbsp;His latest,&nbsp;The Shallows, stars Blake Lively as a woman seeking refuge from a&nbsp;shark by clinging to a buoy. Here, he shares&nbsp;his Five Favorite Films, placing particular emphasis on the importance of a John Wayne classic and a Bruce Willis action-fest in the development of his career.The Searchers (1956)  96%This might be the first movie that I saw. I remember watching it when&nbsp;I was five or six — I shouldn’t even have been watching it — and I saw&nbsp;it in a theater. I grew up in a small town and they had one of those&nbsp;small town theaters, and they put Westerns and whatnot onscreen. It’s&nbsp;one of those movies that made me think it would be very cool to work&nbsp;in movies. I don’t know if I understood the concept of being a&nbsp;director, but I understood the concept of someone making movies, and&nbsp;this movie did it for me. Other people say Star Wars or Indiana Jones.&nbsp;For me it was this one. That’s why I have an emotional reaction to it.Rosemary's Baby (1968)  96%It’s the perfect genre movie. It’s brilliant I every aspect. It deals&nbsp;with some very complex subjects and is done masterfully. Even the&nbsp;dream sequences were so advanced at the time, the way [director Roman&nbsp;Polanski] made it surreal like a dream has to be, but very economic. I&nbsp;love every aspect and I watch it over and over again.Die Hard (1988)  94%I have to mention this as one of my favorites. I’ve been lucky enough to work with [producer] Joel Silver. It rewrote the rules on the modern thriller. It set the stage for the expectation that every question needs to be answered, and it has to be big, fun, and emotional, and a movie that can do everything. I try to do Die Hard in every movie that I do, by fulfilling that promise of delivering from the first frame. Obviously many more movies have done that — like Hitchcock — but as a movie that potentially could have gone many ways, it became a masterpiece. Before this movie, you could potentially believe that the bad guys are just bad guys; they don’t have motivation or are dumb. This guy had smart plans and dialogue, and set the bar high. Other movies have met it, but this was one of the first ones and I was blown away when I saw it. As much as I’ve liked other movies, at that time, Die Hard has had more of an influence on my work than the other ones of the time.The Conversation (1974)  96%This is&nbsp;such a complete technical movie about such a simple idea done so beautifully. It’s a thriller with very few elements and it’s a deconstruction and pure poetry. The sum of the parts is more than each of the parts individually and it’s so simple, yet the pieces together blows your mind. It also places a big emphasis on shooting because every shot means something, not one shot is wasted. I strive to do that. I think it’s very important that every shot has to have a meaning.The 400 Blows (Les Quatre cents coups) (1959)  100%This is what film is about. It’s pure art. It’s the movie that expresses why movies are important. We can have fun, we can have movies that touch us, movies that are an experience, and then we have 400 Blows. And then you understand why film will transcend every other art. I could never make a movie like that. It’s the ultimate expression of artistry.The Shallows is now playing in wide release.","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"toy, Ellie, TV, critic, TV, animated, foreign, Dates, One, Discovery","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/28165150/jaume-rep.jpg","slug":"jaume-collet-serras-five-favorite-films"},{"id":"47508831155362","title":"Cynthia Nixon’s Five Favorite Films","content":"Five Favorite Filmsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Cynthia Nixon's Five Favorite Filmsby Grae Drake | November 18, 2015 |  CommentsGetty Images / Astrid Stawiarz / Stringer&nbsp;Cynthia Nixon has always been easy to find in films or television, with a career spanning decades since her childhood. She currently stars in James White as the main character’s mother Gail, who is suffering from a serious illness. The film takes place in New York, which is also where Nixon was born, and is also a big part of her Five Favorite Films.The Taking of Pelham One Two Three (1974)  100%It’s just a nearly perfect film. It has everything. It has humor and suspense. It has danger and emotion. An incredible ensemble cast of the people you’ve heard of and know their name — like Walter Matthau and Jerry Stiller — to the amazing actors who played the characters on the subway train. I think it captures my New York — what I love about New York, what I think New York is — so beautifully. It’s this place of cranky individuals with big personalities who make our city run.&nbsp; And you’d think it wouldn’t work, but actually, it does, and New York comes through. And all the ways the transit cops, and cops, and mayor, and the citizens, and the people in charge of making the trains go — all of these people amazingly work together. And you know, when the lights go off and the old man who keeps saying, “There’s going to be red lights and it’s going to stop the train,” he’s right. Actually the system works. It lumbers along but actually it works.The Magnificent Ambersons (1942)  89%Well, it has a lot of what makes Citizen Kane amazing; you know, the incredible camera angles and perspectives, and the sense of history — American history — great performances. But to me, it’s a much juicier story.&nbsp;&nbsp;So it’s from a&nbsp;Booth Tarkington novel — which I’ve never read — and it’s the story of a young man who’s played by Joseph Cotten — who you know is also in Citizen Kane — who will go on to become the man who invents the automobile. But at the time, he is the ruler of our heroine, and he does not win her hand because he’s not a big deal enough — not from her point of view, but from her family’s point of view. Because they are the magnificent Ambersons; they are the richest, most important family in town. And instead she marries someone that she doesn’t love and who’s not as impressive a person. So she takes all that love she doesn’t really have for her husband, and pours it onto her son, who becomes a spoiled nightmarish brat. And it is the downward trajectory of the Ambersons &nbsp;— as Joseph Cotten’s character, in his ingenuity, makes all these important scientific advances, and he gains money. And the Ambersons spend their money terribly and they’re dissolute.And all this tragedy ensues — finally, finally, finally at the end.&nbsp;When he’s a baby — when he’s a young boy — he’s so spoiled.&nbsp;And they’re all waiting for the day when George Amberson will get his comeuppance. And finally, everything horrible that could happen to a person happens to him. But by the time George Amberson got his comeuppance, the people who had so longed to see it were no longer around. And in the end, he finally, finally, finally comes to his senses and embraces his mother’s true love and accepts help. It’s just a beautifully told story of star-crossed lovers; but also how when everything is going for you — and you think you’re so great, because you come from people who’ve told you that you’re great — but actually, if you can’t fend for yourself you’re gonna float to the bottom pretty quickly.Heartburn (1986)  45%One time when I auditioned for Nora Ephron, I went on and on and on to her about how much I loved Heartburn. And I also love the book that it’s from.RT: Was she psyched about that?She was a little puzzled. She didn’t think at the time it was such a successful film. I don’t think she thought it was as funny as it should’ve been. And she said, “Why do you love that film so much? Was someone very, very bad to you?” And I guess it’s sort of true. I guess there was a period of heartbreak in my life that I identified with in Nora Ephron’s character. There’s just something so delicious — and, again, it’s a very New York movie. It’s like a really grown-up movie about love, and motherhood, and betrayal — and marriages that don’t work out, and food, and wanting to be the perfect wife and have the career too. It’s all that stuff, and also just watching Meryl Streep and Jack Nicholson together — what could be better than that?&nbsp;And also supporting [cast] — Stockard Channing, and Milos Forman, and Catherine O’hara — all these people who are in the movie are just incredible.The Band Wagon (1953)  100%I love The Band Wagon.&nbsp;You just can’t go wrong. Singin’ in the Rain is great. The Sound of Music is great. But I think it is the number one MGM movie musical.&nbsp;It just has endlessly inventive numbers. And everyone in it is great and it’s so witty. Then again it’s very New York. A very New York story. Hollywood actor kind of fallen on hard times comes to New York to revive his career.Finding Nemo (2003)  99%Oh, I just love Nemo. Again, it’s just an almost perfect film.RT: Absolutely. There’s so much poetry in Albert Brooks as a fish.Oh, and Ellen DeGeneres. Of all the fantastic things Ellen DeGeneres has done — she’s never been better than she’s been in that movie. It is an astonishing performance. Astonishing.&nbsp; And all those people in the tank, and just the artistry with which they made the movie. And the script is so great — and those turtles — you know those Australian turtles? They’re the best.James White&nbsp;is now open in limited&nbsp;release.","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"SDCC","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/18125013/nixon-rep.jpg","slug":"cynthia-nixons-five-favorite-films"},{"id":"47508831150240","title":"Rev Run’s Five Favorite Films","content":"Five Favorite Filmsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Rev Run's Five Favorite Filmsby Zayre Ferrer | December 2, 2015 |  CommentsGetty Images / Ian Gavan&nbsp;Having performed sold-out concerts around the world with his legendary rap group, Run-D.M.C., Rev Run is embarking on a new adventure with his wife Justine and their two youngest children, Russy and Miley, in Rev Runs Around the World, premiering tonight on Travel Channel.Rotten Tomatoes caught up with Rev Run in the midst of his globe-trotting to talk about his five favorite films.The Talented Mr. Ripley (1999)  83%My favorite movie is The Talented Mr. Ripley. “Tommy, Tommy, Tommy, Tommy — Tommy.” Philip Seymour Hoffman was crazy. Jude Law was just great. I don’t like what he did, but it was just the whole running-around-Europe-loving-jazz [thing]. That was very interesting to me. He didn’t want to do his father’s business. He just wanted to love jazz. He was free enough to do it and be content.I think Matt Damon was very interesting. Just to be so conniving and to steal identities and money. Jude Law was so naive for a while and then he realized Damon was a moocher. It was kind of weird how quickly someone could be deceived when they’re caught up in their own world.The Wizard of Oz (1939)  99%Another favorite movie of mine is The Wizard of Oz. It’s just a beautiful movie all the way around. It would get a little dark and scary for me as a kid when those flying monkeys came out. Hoo-Hoo!&nbsp; Yeah, the flying monkeys kind of threw me off. I’d start watching the movie at three o’clock, by five o’clock the movie’s about to end, and I’m scared and dinner’s ready — I’m giving you too much info.When Dorothy first lands and the house falls on the shoes and the feet curl up, and then she goes walking and finds all these different characters — all of that was beautiful — gorgeous. Matter of fact, it was straight-up genius and it hasn’t been matched… It was too incredible. Who ever penned that was genius. And the director was genius. And the Lion was genius. And the Tin Man was genius — everything about it. I love all the characters but Dorothy was the best character. She was everything. She was a great singer. She was a great actress. She was kind. She wanted to take everybody with her.Dr. Seuss' How the Grinch Stole Christmas (2000)  49%I also love Dr. Seuss’ How the Grinch Stole Christmas. I just think that Ron Howard‘s a genius along with Jim Carrey. Jim Carrey was the Grinch for real. Like, he is the Grinch. He was funny. The part where he just goes to his house and closes the door and says, “I’ve got everything I need right here.” And he didn’t have everything he needed there, but he thought he did. He was just kind of a lonely guy.Creed (2015)  95%I don’t know if it’s too early to say it, but I’m really in love with Creed. It made me cry… It touched me when Rocky was talking to Adrian and Paulie at the graveyard and he said, “Everything’s good. Bills are paid.” And I was like, ‘Wow.’ I loved his peace and his contentment. At one moment, you wanna take over the world, and the next minute, you just want the essentials. Him reading the newspaper there at the graveyard — it just felt right to me that he was finally content. I like the entire Rocky franchise and this brought it full circle for me. I love the Philadelphia theme and the music from Meek Mill. And instead of climbing to the top of a mountain, Michael B. Jordan was running with the motorcycles. He was doing the new things Philadelphia people are doing.GoodFellas (1990)  96%You know, what’s touched me I think is GoodFellas… It’s a very real movie. GoodFellas is really some deep stuff. It was very good. It was believable. It just felt like Queens. I don’t know if a lot of that movie was filmed in Queens, but it felt like something that was happening in my backyard that I didn’t really know about. So it’s almost like a history lesson.The acting is so good. I’ve said that a couple of times, but that’s my truth. When he came out with the gun and beats the kid up for messing with his sister, the kid was like, “You got something to say to m–,” and before he could say the word “me,” he was beat up. That’s the scene for me. It was very real to me that guys would do that for their family. People just want to be successful in life. They all want to be happy. And some people go about it in a way that’s pretty destructive, but in that scene, you could see how much he loved his family.Rev Runs Around the World, premieres Dec. 2 on Travel Channel with back-to-back episodes at 10 and 10:30 p.m.","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"Sneak","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/02195038/rev-runs-around-the-world-600.jpg","slug":"rev-runs-five-favorite-films"},{"id":"47508831112346","title":"Cloris Leachman’s Five Favorite Films","content":"Five Favorite Filmsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Cloris Leachman's Five Favorite FilmsThe Legendary Star of Stage, Screen, and TV Reminisces about her Own Five Favorite Film Experiencesby Kerr Lordygan | January 5, 2016 |  Comments(Photo by Getty Images / Valerie Macon)&nbsp;Cloris Leachman&nbsp;has been a household name&nbsp;since she won the Best Supporting Actress Oscar for The Last Picture Show in 1971. Between that film and her latest,&nbsp;This is Happening&nbsp;(now available on VOD), Leachman has entertained us with some of our favorite comedy performances of all time in movies (some of which are discussed below) and TV shows like The Mary Tyler Moore Show, its spinoff Phyllis, and The Facts of Life.With such a variety of illustrious films in her pocket, here at Rotten Tomatoes, we got to ask her about some of her favorite film experiences throughout her career. Here is the list, with some very funny anecdotes to boot!The Last Picture Show (1971)  100%It was just the oddest time of my life. We were in Texas in some godforsaken little city, little town.&nbsp;We never stopped using the accent no matter what we said. We were just wrapped up in it.&nbsp;Ellen Burstyn and I would hang out together. We’d talk about our horrible situations, relationships,&nbsp;our marriages. We&nbsp;were both going through divorce.&nbsp;We never stopped talking in the accent.RT: Even while you were talking about the personal stuff?Yeah. And&nbsp;the last scene that we did. That was almost taken out of the film. We were [running] long and had to cut about five minutes and the producer suggested that we cut my scene, the last scene.&nbsp;[The director] said no&nbsp;and he kept it in. That’s all we know.&nbsp;Young Frankenstein (1974)  94%Oh, Gene [Wilder]. Gene would laugh every time I said anything. He was just helpless [laughing].RT: It&nbsp;must have been a lot of fun on that set.It was serious though. Except for Gene [laughing]. The minute I would say my line, I know he was laughing. I could just feel it. I’d look back and his face was in two pieces. We had plenty of takes&nbsp;for that.RT: Did that make you laugh as well?Make me laugh? Well by the 15th take, I was getting pretty frustrated [laughing].RT:&nbsp;It’s hard to be that funny, that brilliant, right?Mel [Brooks] gave me one line reading in the whole script and that was the first time that Gene had started laughing. We had just met outside. We were coming up the stairs now inside, and I said, “[in German accent] Stay close to ze candles; ze staircase can be treacherous.” That’s how I did it, but Gene&nbsp;would laugh no matter what I did. And&nbsp;Mel said — by the 15th take, he came up to me and said, “Stay close to ze candles; ze staircase caaan be treacherous.” It makes me laugh. Very serious, though, all of this, except [Gene]&nbsp;laughing. We were making a picture, we had to get things done, you know?High Anxiety (1977)  72%When Harvey Korman’s coming downstairs, before the line [about fruit cups], he shifts his cuffs&nbsp;and he’s very, you know, breezy — very on top of his game, whatever you want to say — he was sure he was gonna have that fruit cup.[Regarding how she got the mustache in High Anxiety:] I had been made up and I was sitting in my trailer waiting to be called and just doing nothing so I had a little black pencil. Just not even thinking about it, I put on a mustache, and all of a sudden, I got a knock on the door: “Okay, time. Come to set.” So&nbsp;I tore down there and Mel was there and I said, “How do you want me to play this part?” He said, “I’ll leave it to you.” I said, “Well, I did this already&nbsp;in Young Frankenstein.” He said, “Oh well, what do you want to do?” I said, “Well, I don’t know. I feel like&nbsp;in High Anxiety that I don’t want anyone to know me so I thought I’d just talk funny.” We went to the wardrobe department and they put this costume on that fit perfectly and was beautifully made. I said well let’s make the shoulders a little bit broader maybe. That didn’t work, and I had this big chest if you remember in High Anxiety. You remember that?&nbsp;&nbsp;So I thought we should put a back on to match the front, to balance it at least. That worked, that was good, but this thing about broader shoulders didn’t work. The costume didn’t look like it was mine, so by that doing that it really helped, it was very good. Then&nbsp;I wanted to raise the whole costume. I&nbsp;looked like a baby ostrich in it. My head was sticking out so I thought we should raise the dress. They just pulled the dress and everything way up. That’s what I looked like with a mustache and raised [dress].&nbsp;Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969)  88%We worked at 4 o’clock in the morning and whoever was going to play my part — they couldn’t find the list when they came back from location. So they just — as they said — got their favorites. It was Henry&nbsp;[Jones]&nbsp;and me. So I played the girl of the evening that he picked out. I decided that he loved my long beautiful blonde hair so I went to the hair department and found a beautiful wig with hair down to my knees, and the only way to show it of course would be to be on my stomach and the hair on top. Then I thought, “Wouldn’t it be nice to sing a song for&nbsp;Paul Newman’s fans?” I thought “The Sweetest Little Fellow” [from the song “Mighty Like a Rose” by Paul Robeson] would serve the purpose: “with eyes of shiny blue, makes you think of heaven — da-da-da-da-da.” So the producers said I could sing it and then when when I heard it, it sounded like a cat mewing. We didn’t have time to fix it [laughing].This Is Happening (2015)  44%It’s a lovely film with Mickey Sumner, who’s Sting’s daughter.&nbsp;She’s excellent, excellent.&nbsp;And James Wolk. Also excellent.&nbsp;I loved working with them. They’re excellent. The people are so fun. Mickey Sumner is excellent and the director Ryan Jaffe — he was awfully good.RT: You’re&nbsp;a fugitive grandma.Yeah, and my little dead dog.RT: That you carry around with you.Yeah. Well here’s another fact: He is in a suitcase, in my living room. [Laughing]&nbsp;And the dumb stuffed one that they had was ridiculous. It didn’t look dead or alive, or it didn’t look like it had ever been a dog. So I was very proud to bring Jo up.&nbsp;Jo’s a girl, a Shih Tzu.&nbsp;[Jo was Leachman’s favorite dog who died right around the&nbsp;time of shooting the film,&nbsp;while visiting Palm Springs; instead of burying her in the city that wasn’t her home, Leachman and her daughter decided to mail her — via the post office — to get stuffed and she became a star in the film.]This is Happening is open&nbsp;in limited release and is now available on&nbsp;VOD.","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"watch, Pacific, show, directors, video","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/05123249/cloris-rep.jpg","slug":"cloris-leachman-five-favorite-films"},{"id":"47508831147167","title":"Dave Navarro’s Five Favorite Films","content":"Five Favorite Filmsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Dave Navarro's Five Favorite FilmsThe Rocker Guitarist Discusses Cinephelia, Political Scandals, and Overcoming Traumaby Kerr Lordygan | December 3, 2015 |  CommentsGetty Images / Anna Webber / Stringer&nbsp;Best&nbsp;known as the guitarist for Jane’s Addiction, the Red Hot Chili Peppers, Panic Channel, Deconstruction and, well, himself,&nbsp;Dave Navarro&nbsp;has done his fair share of TV as well, not only as host of&nbsp;Ink Master, but also as a judge on&nbsp;Rock Star: INXS&nbsp;and&nbsp;Rock Star: Supernova.Now,&nbsp;Navarro is the producer and subject of&nbsp;Mourning Son, a documentary&nbsp;that delves into&nbsp;his profound personal trauma (his mother’s ex-boyfriend murdered her and her sister&nbsp;when&nbsp;Navarro&nbsp;was 15; he was out of the house at the time). A self-proclaimed cinephile, Navarro shared his Five Favorite Films, and discussed the difficulty of sharing his most painful memories on camera.Nosferatu: Phantom der Nacht (Nosferatu the Vampyre) (1979)  95%I’ll just start with the Werner Herzog’s Nosferatu. That’s one of my top fives,&nbsp;primarily because I love the Dracula story, of course. And I’m a huge fan of the 1922 [F.W.] Murnau film and I love that Herzog took the time to go to the actual locations where the original was shot. It’s just so simple and it is such a slow, deliberate mood throughout the film that borders on taking too much time — to the point where it’s almost a meditative state as a viewer that you get into.And that’s not even counting Klaus Kinski‘s portrayal of the vampire which,&nbsp;to me, rivals the&nbsp;[Max]&nbsp;Schreck&nbsp;1922 portrayal. But I’m such a Kinski fan, and knowing — having insight as to how out of his mind he was in real life — portraying the vampire really lends a lot of layers to viewing it.&nbsp;It’s one of those few cases in which knowing the actor that portrays the role actually creates more depth in the role itself. Where normally you would want to avoid that kind of influence, in this case it really works. Because Klaus Kinski’s so unpredictable as a human being. I would imagine, based on what I’ve heard, much like Max Schreck was in 1922, it’s really a lot of interesting parallel there. For a color adaptation, it’s almost camp, in a way, but… it hasn’t crossed that line — but it almost is. I think the portrayal of Jonathan, and frankly, the girl in it [Isabelle Adjani as Lucy Harker]&nbsp;is&nbsp;probably one of the most beautiful women I’ve ever seen in my life. If you haven’t seen it in a while, revisit it…&nbsp;she’s just insane.RT: Do you think that that’s probably the best&nbsp;vampire movie?Yeah, I mean — that’s the weird thing is that if this was five favorite horror films, I could narrow it down a little bit, but because that genre’s so important to me. but I don’t know that I can really put any of them in top five, with the exception of maybe The Shining, which is just a whole Kubrick section on its own&nbsp;— we could go down that road [laughing]. But for me — I think for my case, yeah, it’s probably my personal favorite vampire movie. I prefer the vampire the way it was written, which was a seductive character that wasn’t necessarily what they’ve evolved into.&nbsp;I mean, I guess they’re all seductive, but they don’t turn into into maniacs, you know what I mean? They’re very deliberate and very manipulative, and it was just a better paced tempo with these original films. Don’t get me wrong, have you seen the 1922 version with Type O Negative doing the music?&nbsp;There’s a bunch of different people who’ve contributed soundtracks to it. It’s pretty amazing.Ordinary People (1980)  89%This one’s going to make you — well, I don’t know what you’re going to say to this, but Ordinary People, the Robert Redford film with Timothy Hutton, and Mary Tyler Moore, Donald Sutherland, [has] got to be one of the most emotional films for me, just seeing the middle upper class being stripped of the veneer and seeing the dysfunction within. That film really captures that more than any other, I think, and certainly of that time, it was such a dangerous statement for Robert Redford to be making in a film like that. Every time I watch that film — and I must have seen it over 100 times — I weep.And Mary Tyler Moore’s performance in that film, I’m telling you, man, growing up in LA, I knew women like her… That was my friends’ mothers, without a doubt.&nbsp;It’s so simple and it’s just beautiful story telling. Judd Hirsch as the therapist and the relationship he creates with Timothy Hutton in that film is pretty special. I feel that if that film doesn’t touch you on some level, that you’re not human.&nbsp;Looking back at it now, it may seem like a very after-school-special choice, but if you really visit that film again, it holds up, man. It’s pretty compelling.&nbsp;You got to see that, man, on a Sunday when it’s a little rainy out there. I don’t know if you have a boyfriend, or a girlfriend, but whoever that is, sit with them, put that on. I’m telling you, dude. It’s like… How do I put it? It’s like The Notebook&nbsp;for our generation, or my generation, you know?All the President's Men (1976)  94%In the same [kin]&nbsp;as Ordinary People, I have to throw All the President’s Men in there, which is a completely different film for Redford to do, but probably&nbsp;one of the greatest journalism films of all time. There&nbsp;are&nbsp;so many elements to that film that are unique to it. The relationship between [Bob] Woodward and [Carl] Bernstein, the way those are portrayed, and then just the whole mystery of the Watergate being spilled out for us. When that happened, I was… I don’t remember, I must have been three or four, five.&nbsp;Those were the years — that was the first time I can remember in my lifetime of something going on politically, and so I actually have memory of that time. And I don’t remember what it was, but I remember the words “Watergate”&nbsp;meaning something. Meaning something big, even though I didn’t understand what they were. Just for that film to be so dialogue heavy, and so all about performance, and the written word, it is one of the most on-the-edge-of-your-seat thrillers that I can think of that is pretty powerful… It’s the most riveting film about people who sit down and type, you know what I mean? You can imagine, it’s pretty intense.RT:&nbsp;There’s one out with Cate Blanchett now.Yeah, that’s the movie [about Dan Rather], Truth. I haven’t seen that yet. What was the scandal in Truth again? It was about criticizing the president’s military service&nbsp;report.&nbsp;Nobody cares anymore.&nbsp;That’s the thing. That’s the difference is that — I don’t know why, but that is just so lightweight compared to the Nixon White House [laughing] — trying to break into the Democratic headquarters. Especially, the craziest part about the Watergate thing is that Nixon’s going to win by a landslide… or did, in fact, and that was just all paranoia. There was absolutely no reason to do any of that [laughing].&nbsp;He just f—ing, like, won by a landslide.&nbsp;Moving along.2001: A Space Odyssey (1968)  92%I kind of briefly threw The Shining out there, so that gets its own due, which means I can fall back on 2001, I suppose?&nbsp;I think that film speaks for itself, if I could explain that film to you, then I’d be… I don’t know what I’d be, one in ten who could explain it to you, but there was a followup called 2010 with Roy Scheider, which wasn’t a great film, but if it did anything, it helped explain 2001 a little bit, but 2001… I remember my father took me to see that in the theater, and that was so awe inspiring, and just to see where the imagination and creativity could go on screen as an 11-year-old kid, or however old I was. And to have seen that film over and over and over again and ask new questions every time I do, it’s been a pretty profound staple in my house for years.Then you get into all the conspiracy stuff. You attach the lunar landing — Kubrick shot the lunar landing stuff in it, and the rear screen projection that was used in the space scenes and in the ape scenes in the beginning, and how conspiracy theorists surmise that that’s what he used to shoot the moon landing. Did you hear all that?&nbsp;The theory is that NASA got a hold of the footage from 2001, saw it, and got Stanley Kubrick to shoot all the moon landing stuff in his studio and broadcast it across the country. Now, they’re not saying that we didn’t go to the moon, they’re saying that what the people in America saw was shot in a studio, because at that time we didn’t want to broadcast to the world what we may or may not have found on the moon — which actually makes more sense then it just being…&nbsp;It’s not, “We didn’t go.” We went. But we didn’t want the Russians to see, or we didn’t want Japan to see, or China to see what we’re discovering, you know?&nbsp;In case there’s anything there, or anything that we could weaponize, so Kubrick shot all this stuff in a sound stage, and that was the agreement.That’s why NASA gave Kubrick a super, super special space lens that he used for Barry Lyndon, because Barry Lyndon wasn’t shot with any lights. It was all natural light… candles, or sunlight, or whatever, so he used the lens, and that’s what allowed the light to get in for the film process, but there’s so many layers to the Kubrick stuff and I just, as a conspiracy theory fan, I like to have that in the back of my brain while I’m watching those films.Stardust Memories (1980)  68%Alright,&nbsp;my next one on my list is Stardust Memories, Woody Allen.&nbsp;It’s really amazing, and it didn’t do very well at the time. It wasn’t a huge film for him, but it’s loosely autobiographical and arguably super self-indulgent. I f—ing love it and there’s just something about the cage of celebrity that he put together in this film which is pretty on the money. To a degree, I identify with the character in the film. I feel like it’s a really great blend of story-telling and film-making and avant-garde, self-indulgent artsy-ness — without being too far in that direction. And it’s conscious of its own attempts at being incredibly avant-garde and almost pokes fun of itself for that. To me, it’s one of my favorite films of his, and he’s one of my favorite filmmakers, period.&nbsp;That one … It’s f—ing good.RT:&nbsp;Yeah, that’s not one that people talk about very much.No, no. Well, there was some years where he went from … I think Annie Hall was ’77. Wasn’t it?&nbsp;And then he went into this direction that was really… He just made some decisions that were… Like, there’s a line in this film, where he’s at a film convention of his own films and one of his fans says to him, “I’m a fan of your films, particularly your early, funny ones.” Where he’s talking about … You know what I mean?&nbsp;Where he’s conscious of the fan base turning on him already in the film. It’s fucking great.&nbsp;Yeah, that’s got to be one of my top five. I’m more of a film nerd than a music nerd for sure.RT: &nbsp;A lot of the best musicians are, I think. It inspires the music, right? I mean, doesn’t it inspire you to write?Exactly, for sure. I don’t really go to shows, and I don’t go see bands, and I don’t really buy a ton of music, but I’ll see everything.&nbsp;Kerr Lordygan for Rotten Tomatoes: Do you want to talk about&nbsp;Mourning Son?&nbsp;I know it’s probably hard to talk about.&nbsp;Navarro:&nbsp;Basically, me and my partner, Todd [Newman], we worked on it every step of the way. This film couldn’t be more DIY independent filmmaking because we just basically made it ourselves. We were talking about making a film. We were talking about what it would be like to put a documentary together, because we’re both such huge fans of film. And we just got in the car one day with a video camera and went and made one. That was literally how it happened. We funded and shot everything ourselves, did audio ourselves, did the film ourselves, booked everything ourselves, found everybody ourselves, did the interviews… Everything down the line was all by ourselves until we finally hired on an editor who helped us make sense of everything we had, but even then&nbsp;—&nbsp;we’re in the editing room the entire time. There was no other project I’ve ever been a part of that has been that hands-on from beginning to end. We just wanted to do it ourselves. It’s certainly — a story of this nature, which is — it goes over my mom’s murder and dealing…RT:&nbsp;Yeah, I didn’t know. I saw the trailer and I had no idea that you went through that.Yeah,&nbsp;yeah.RT:&nbsp;What an amazing thing that you were able to put it out there. Was it cathartic? Was it helpful, or was it torturous?You know, I think maybe at times a little bit of all of that. Yeah, it’s super hard to revisit a lot of that stuff. But I mean, the odd thing was that — how can I put it? It’s really an experience like no other. I’ve never worked on a documentary film before, I’ve never worked really with any feature length film before in my life, so there was a lot to juggle in terms of emotionally and technically — and just a sheer filmmaking sense, a lot to navigate through, and make sense of so, yeah, there was some catharsis involved.But I think, more than anything, as we were telling the story, and as we were putting it together — because we initially didn’t really have any idea what we were going to do with this — is this going to be a 15 minute film that we put out on YouTube?… We didn’t know what it was going to be. And it just evolved because part of the thing that we learned about documentary filmmaking is that as you put the film together, it kind of decides where it wants to go from there. Then it just decided it wanted to be this feature length thing, and I think one of the things we realized as we were going is that it had the potential to help trauma survivors and victims of crime in a way that no other film has. And in terms of pointing out that there’s no right way to do this, and it’s probably never, ever going to be totally okay. You’re just going to have to get better, and things are tough. I think it speaks on a real level to people who have been through something like that. And buzz words like “closure” you got to throw that out the window right away, because there’s never going to be a day that there’s closure.&nbsp;I think what happens is that, in today’s “touchy-feely” climate, people end up feeling bad because they don’t feel closure, and then they feel worse.RT:&nbsp;Yeah, like any time someone says they need to “just deal” with something, or you need to “work through it” — what does that even mean? I don’t even know what that means, to work through something.It would imply that there’s a day that it’s all better. No, what happens is you learn to cope, and you learn that there’s more to live for, and you find other things that are bringing you joy. But this film, — you know, I go into drug addiction; I go into all sorts of ways of either avoiding, or dealing, or compounding, or however — whatever I chose to do. And certainly being a public figure while doing all that was challenging.RT: Was it rewarding to have fame at your fingertips while it was happening, or was it more of a distraction?I don’t have any other frame of reference, so I don’t really know.&nbsp;You know what I mean? All I know is that there were a lot of things that I may have not experienced as much as I could have, because my head was somewhere else. But you learn, you know?Through the process of making this thing we realized that we weren’t just speaking to ourselves, and we weren’t just speaking to the murder junkies that watch Investigation Discovery all day long — although I’m one of them.&nbsp;We were hopefully speaking to a lot of people, and just maybe people who have dealt with loss — it doesn’t have to be that traumatic, you know. Just showing that there’s an up side, but even in my own personal way, my up side is very particular. I’m not suggesting anyone do anything that I did or didn’t do. It just happened to be my journey.Mourning Son&nbsp;is now available on VOD,&nbsp;Cable On-Demand, and iTunes.","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"New, heist, Tarantino, Nat, ABC","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/30172856/navarro-feat.jpg","slug":"dave-navarros-five-favorite-films"},{"id":"47508831135900","title":"Henry Rollins’ Five Favorite Films","content":"Five Favorite Filmsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Henry Rollins' Five Favorite Filmsby Kerr Lordygan | December 18, 2015 |  CommentsGetty Images / David Livingston / StringerHenry Rollins, the punk rock legend and Black Flag singer who surprised many by bringing a new audience to the art of spoken word, has so many sides to him that it’s hard to pinpoint him as any one thing. He has been a radio personality on Los Angeles’ KCRW, a regular columnist for publications such as&nbsp;LA Weekly, and is known as a public activist.&nbsp;As an actor, he’s made cameos in many films and TV series and has been a regular on shows&nbsp;The Legend of Korra and Sons of Anarchy.His new film, He Never Died, masterfully tells the story of an ancient character known to most of us who, well, never died. But this one cooks up brilliant comedy and wonderful characters and relationships that can’t normally be found in your typical vampire film.Rollins meticulously chose his Five Favorite Films to share with us, and here they are:The Graduate (1967)  87%The Graduate directed by Mike Nichols. It’s just a perfect film. And it was, I think, the first non-student real film for Dustin Hoffman. It’s just a beautiful, perfectly written…&nbsp;perfectly shot, perfectly acted film, where you have Dustin Hoffman who has bedded both Anne Bancroft and Katharine Ross and he breaks up the marriage. I saw it as a little kid because I lived with my mom and she liked to go to the movies. She couldn’t always get a babysitter and so now and then I would get taken to films that were quite adult. There’s not necessarily nudity, because there doesn’t need to be. The thing is so well written; the adult themes and just how screwed up adults are is on full display in The Graduate. You can tell all these people are just so damn talented, and you look at a young Dustin Hoffman and you go, “Damn, man. Look at the career you’re about to have, dude. You’ve got it.” His talent was just so huge yet so innate in that he’s not gonna fail. He’s one of those people like, “Man, you were born to act.” I’ve tried to get to Buck Henry to get him to tell me stories about The Graduate&nbsp;and I’ve hung out with him a couple of times. And I’m like, “You wrote The Graduate!” And he’s always very funny and kinda belligerent to me, “Ah, shut up… Rwagh, Rwagh.” I’m like, “OK [laughing].”RT: He didn’t tell you anything?No, no. He just said,”That’s a long time ago, who cares?” I think he’s having fun not answering me. I’ve tried on two different occasions to get him to talk to me about The Graduate. But it’s kind of part and parcel of the films that were happening in America in the late 1960s and 1970s where there’s just so many great scripts and great acting. Hardcore, rip-your-guts-out acting, stellar performances, great lighting. A lot of natural lighting in 1960s and 1970s films, while now everything is just so well lit, it just looks too good. There’s all these things like Serpico and The French Connection where it looks almost indie. You know, kinda grungy. And you’re like, “Damn, man. This is really moving me.”Anyway The Graduate is that. I just remember the moment, as a little kid, watching when Dustin Hoffman kisses Anne Bancroft — and because he’s so nervous about doing it– and she’s inhaled this cigarette, and he doesn’t know that she’s holding back two lungfuls of tobacco. And when she exhales it, [she] doesn’t lose a beat. You can tell that she’s in charge. That kinda acting, that kind of scripting, that physicality — you come with that. You figure that out in that moment and you make that something really amazing.Also there’s that scene at the end of the film when Hoffman and Katharine Ross are at the back of the bus. You know, they’ve eloped. They’ve ruined this marriage. And they’re sitting back there and they smile for a minute and then you see them both kinda go away into themselves, like maybe, “We’ve really made the wrongest move of our lives.” The way that that camera locks off and just sits on them as they look at their future. Good Idea? Bad idea? Horrific idea? Hopeful idea? They basically run their whole future, and that’s such a brave thing to do in a film because it’s real… You never know, that relationship might be over in 48 hours. She might go running back to the groom and have a dull ordinary life. So that’s a film that stood out to me as a young person, but I didn’t even understand why it did because I was too young, but then I saw it repeatedly as an adult and went, “Wow, what a beautiful piece of work.”Seven Samurai (Shichinin no Samurai) (1956)  100%Here’s another one: Seven Samurai. The great Akira Kurosawa. He’s my favorite director and a lot of his films featured my favorite actor Toshiro Mifune. I never understood a single word he said, but the force and physicality of Mifune [was] just like a damn hurricane on a screen. In Seven Samurai, this epic film, there was a scene where Mifune’s character — he’s drunk — gets hit in the head. Someone whacks him with a stick and her just comes roaring into this scene like, “Who hit me?!” And he’s hilarious and crazy and you find out by doing some homework that guy never took any acting; he just walked into an audition and said, “You need an actor? I’ll act.” He was just this raw, crazily talented guy. I became fascinated by Kurosawa many years ago on a lot of levels — the way he would light scenes, the way he would shoot things, and the fact that he would use many of his actors over and over again. Obviously, Mifune repeats all throughout Kurosawa’s career, and also Takashi Shimura is in this film, and he stars in a beautiful Kurosawa film called Ikiru, which means “To Live.” It’s one of Kurosawa’s more melancholy introspective works. It’s just a beautiful film. Every time I’ve watched it it always moves me. And in Seven Samurai, there’s so much kinda cop-buddy film — you’re like, “Wow, that’s where they’re gonna get Lethal Weapon, Fistful of Dollars, Hang Em High.” I mean they’re just gonna get &nbsp;so many big movies from Kurosawa.There’s a guy named Seiji Miyaguchi who’s the master swordsman in Seven Samurai, where he goes out on a mission just on his own and comes back holding some dead guy’s gun. A man with a sword takes out a guy with a &nbsp;gun. He just takes the gun, throws it on the ground, and I think he says, “Got two.” He just sits down and goes to sleep. This guy puts his face on his knees and goes to sleep like, “Been a rough night. Killed two guys. Oh, and here’s this gun thing. I don’t know how it works.” There are so many killer moments in Seven Samurai. Meanwhile it’s this sweeping epic [of] good versus evil. And the kind of neutral victory at the end where four of the seven samurai are dead;&nbsp;the farmers are just notably ungrateful for having had their assess saved by these seven selfless samurai. They’re basically rōnin —&nbsp;they are masterless samurai. And they go right back to their crops like, “Thanks, dude.” &nbsp;Really? You barely noticed what sacrifices were made, and you’re all cowards in the face of aggression. And these guys gave you everything and died doing it. &nbsp;There’s a lot of your own life that you could read into that. And I think Kurosawa did that magically from film to film, where he’d tap into human feelings quite often.[Kurosawa] was just a master movie maker. Master writer. Master cameraman. The dude knew how to make a movie. And Seven Samurai is just a great example of it. It’s not my favorite Kurosawa film. I just think it’s such an amazing piece of work. It’s one of my favorite films just because it’s a massive undertaking. And in my top five I did not put in a Werner Herzog film, which I’m rethinking. I probably would have put in either Fitzcarraldo or Aguirre, the Wrath of God. And so, Herzog gets an honorable mention. But moving on.All the President's Men (1976)  94%All the Presidents Men. Alan Pakula. I lived &nbsp;in Washington, D.C. all throughout Watergate and my mother worked for the government so she was hyper-aware of Nixon and all of this. The Watergate [Hotel] was a bike ride away from my home. It was just a building in a series of buildings that you drove by all the time. And the Howard Johnson’s where the plumbers all had their dinner before break-in? I used to eat at that Howard Johnson’s. This was a local story for me. The Woodward and Bernstein book is a read and a half, and I’ve watched that film I don’t know how many times — it is just perfect. I watched it like 10 days ago. I watched it on the Drake Passage on my way to the Antarctic peninsula. That’s the last time I saw it, like three weeks ago. It was then as it is now — a beautiful piece of work. It’s suspenseful.Again, there’s Hoffman. I guess I come off as some massive Hoffman fan. It’s merely coincidence, although I do think he’s great. Him and Redford together are just amazing. And again you see the genius of Hoffman. You see just how ready-to-go Robert Redford is as an actor. Handsome, leading guy, believable as hell. And that whole cast — I just love seeing older people in films who don’t necessarily look good, but they’re good actors. And that the entire weather-beaten, hard-chewed staff at the post that were cast in that film. They sit around and have those meetings, “Well screw that; what d’you got?” They’re just these tough newsmen, and I love it. They took down Nixon, these two young guys. I hung out with Bernstein; he’s just a true maniac. It’s an honor to hang out with him. I said, “Man, it’s an honor to meet you.” And he said, “I’m gonna tell my son that&nbsp;and boy, he’s gonna respect me now.” [Laughing] I’m like, “Yeah, right!”It speaks of a huge moment in American history when every American now had proof that you cannot trust your government, that you’d be stupid to trust the government. Like yes, vote. Elect these people. But you gotta keep a very Jeffersonian jaundiced eye on every politician: the ones you voted for, the ones you voted against, the ones you say you like. As Gore Vidal said, by the time anyone gets to the Oval Office, they’ve been bought and sold at least ten times. And All the President’s Men is a case study of that. Hal Holbrook’s character, you find out 30 years later, that dude did exist. It was Deep Throat. That was a real guy. And the fact that these little clandestine meetings happened in a place I may have well pumped my skateboard by makes that film very relevant to me.Apocalypse Now (1979)  98%Another film is Apocalypse Now, which I’m sure every male moron you’ve ever interviewed&nbsp;has put in his top five. But the reason I put it in my top five is because Ian MacKaye, my best friend, and I went to go see it, first run, and we walked out not understanding what we had seen. But we walked home with, like, smoke coming out of our ears. And it’s one of those, where you’re young with no car, you get used to walking — like, “it’s only four miles each way.” And you’re so young and so stupid you just do it. Just getting snowed on. No problem. It was one of those massive walks back to our neighborhood and we just kinda walked home in shocked silence. We were, in a way, devastated, and neither one of us could tell you what that film was about. “Was it about the war?” “I guess.” So we went back to see it again later, and we were like 18 or 17. And maybe other 17-year-olds could’ve articulated it, but for Ian and I, we loved it but we were just kinda devastated by it.As I grew older, now I’m a twenty-something, and I’m watching once a year. And I start to&nbsp;understand&nbsp;it when I start to understand the Vietnam War differently. I’m starting to understand that conflict a little more as a young adult. Then I start reading into the characters more, and the more I see it, one day I feel like I’m Willard, Martin Sheen’s character. And one day I feel like I’m Kurtz, Brando’s character. And then I join Black Flag and our tours — our van was like PBR Street Gang. The highway was the Nung river. We would just go into these hairy situations.I’ll never forget one night, I’m in the back of our equipment truck with the backdoor kinda open, me and one of the roadies, and we’re looking at the lights of some harbor in Florida and I looked at him and said, “This sure enough is a bizarre sight&nbsp;in the middle of all this s—,”&nbsp;as Clean says when they’re going into that crazy kinda nightclub, DMZ area where Bill Graham comes out and does his amazing scene. And,&nbsp;Apocalypse&nbsp;Now lines from the film became patter between me and a Black Flag roadie, and then between members of the Rollins band, where we would speak in Apocalypse Now. When we’d go into a place where everything was screwed up I’d say, “Chris, did you find the monitor guy?” and he’d say, “No, there’s no f—ing CO here,” which is from Apocalypse Now, which means there’s nobody in charge; this place is a wreck.&nbsp;So, as I got older — I’m 55 now — that film is still relevant to me. And it still speaks to me on a lot of levels. Like when Kurtz says to Willard, “It’s impossible for words to&nbsp;describe what is necessary to those&nbsp;who do not know what horror means…&nbsp;you must make a friend of horror.” And I never really understood that line until I was involved in a murder [the murder of Joe Cole], where I was almost killed and my friend was killed. I became full of horror. And&nbsp;once you get that, you get it. And so I’ll never think of that line the same way again, because it so describes what happened to me.I can’t describe what that was like to you. I can describe it but it’s gonna fall short. Unless that’s happened to you, you don’t understand what I’m telling you. You’ll only understand it in a journalistic way. Oh, right, OK, something bad happened. You don’t know the half of it, ’cause I can’t articulate it to you, and you can’t read me. And it’s what happened to all these dudes. These Vietnam vets, Iraq and Afghanistan. They come home and no one can read them. Which is shown so beautifully in The&nbsp;Hurt Locker. When the guy goes home and he’s preparing the meal with his wife, like yeah, “This guy got blown up.” And she’s like “Uh-Huh, cut the carrots.” There’s a complete disconnect. And so what Apocalypse Now&nbsp;— I finally figured it out — it’s just about insanity, which is nothing but what war is. It’s just a bunch of people being completely insane. And it captures the insanity of human conflict perfectly. It&nbsp;could’ve&nbsp;been any war.National Lampoon's Animal House (1978)  90%The last film is Animal House. Where I [veer]&nbsp;away&nbsp;from intense dramas. This thing is&nbsp;a perfect comedy, and I saw it right when it came out, as many people of my age did. It’s one of those films — I saw it one weekend; I went back to see it the next weekend and the next weekend. It’s a perfect piece of work and I watch it almost once a year. I’m no expert on it — can’t tell you the cast except for the big names — but it’s one of those things where I don’t even know if it’s any good. All I know is, I laughed in the same places, like Pavlov’s dog. “Hey, I’m a zit!” and the food comes out of [John] Belushi’s mouth — to me that is about the funniest thing I’ve ever seen. Until he does this or until he does that. And you know: “A pledge pin on your uniform,” stuff like that. It’s funny down to my DNA. You know how it is with films. You love them so much, you almost adopt them. Like if there’s a song you really like — you almost kinda wrote it yourself. Because now it’s in your bone marrow. Animal House to me is from a much happier time of my life. As an adult I’m over-serious and worried. But as a younger person, that comedy was just so effortlessly immature and funny. The humor is not the highest brow, but it’s done so well. It works on every human cliche, like the drunk wife of the dean and the dean is over-serious… That was a film I watched usually around Christmas time. Somehow, I always find it in December and I watch it and I laugh sometimes, and I find myself crying because I miss Belushi. I think he was a great talent. I’ll watch him eating the food and I laugh so hard, literally, tears will go down my face. I don’t know the guy but I spoke to him once on the phone, briefly, but I just miss the guy. ‘Cause he’s one of my guys, like Bill Murray and Chevy Chase. All those SNL people — that’s my kind of humor. It’s just a perfect low budget comedy. It’s what you do with great acting and great writing. You don’t need a budget. You just need great acting and great writing.He Never Died&nbsp;is open&nbsp;in limited release and available on&nbsp;VOD and iTunes.","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"YouTube, Tubi, dramedy, Month, die, National, Exclusive, thirty, Spike, thriller","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/16175445/rollins-feat-img.jpg","slug":"henry-rollins-five-favorite-films"},{"id":"47508831126683","title":"Cameron Crowe’s Five Favorite Films","content":"Five Favorite Filmsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Cameron Crowe's Five Favorite Filmsby Kerr Lordygan | January 3, 2016 |  CommentsPhoto by Matt Winkelmeyer/Getty ImagesJerry Maguire&nbsp;is 20 years old? How did that happen? The classic was a hit with critics and audiences alike, successfully incorporating&nbsp;sports business into mainstream comedy and earning a Best Supporting Actor Oscar for Cuba Gooding Jr. in the process. To celebrate the anniversary — and the release of the new 20th anniversary edition&nbsp;of the film — &nbsp;we asked director Cameron Crowe&nbsp;(Almost Famous, Say Anything, Singles) to enlighten us with his Five Favorite Films. His choices make it clear how his own storytelling skills evolved throughout the years. See the list here:Local Hero (1983)  100%Bill Forsyth, come back! &nbsp;It’s hard enough to create a movie this deeply funny, so odd and so memorable… but to have a score like Mark Knopfler’s, too? Come on. This is the holy grail of personal filmmaking with a distinctive directorial touch. Also check out Forsyth’s other films like Comfort and Joy and Gregory’s Girl for his trademark touch: the random moment that has no reason to be in the movie, except it’s everything you think about later.Quadrophenia (1979)  100%Quadrophenia&nbsp;[and also]&nbsp;Control. Franc Roddam and Anton Corbijn’s films both accomplish the rarest thing; they capture the feeling in the music of the bands that they’re covering. To watch these two great movies is to geek out on cinematic portraits that remind you exactly why you first fell in love with a Townshend power chord, or discovered Ian Curtis’ bleak genius. Character to look for: Steph (Leslie Ash), the scene-stealer from Quadrophenia.The Rules of the Game (La règle du jeu) (1939)  96%Jean Renoir puts on a master class in ensemble comedy-drama. Period.The Royal Tenenbaums (2002)  81%The Royal Tenenbaums is a mood masterpiece. Everything about Wes Anderson’s film is perfect; it immediately transports you to a world only he could create. Part Salinger, part idealized New York, but mostly Wes’ pleasantly devastating view of this family’s life, Tenenbaums&nbsp;succeeds on great writing and extremely particular filmmaking. Put this together with a score and a soundtrack for the ages, and you have a film that operates like the best of Hal Ashby or even a filmmaker like Miyazaki. It feels so good, it’s almost like a drug. Also, the Rolling Stones have never been used better in film history, and that’s just one of the movie’s many wonderful marriages of music and cinema. And then there’s Gene Hackman…The Apartment (1960)  93%You really can’t beat The Apartment for finding laughs and heartache and triumph in the life of a morally compromised schnook of an insurance salesman. The great Billy Wilder was at one of his many career peaks here, finding unforgettable depth in Shirley MacLaine as elevator operator Fran Kubelik, and pulling a delicious Mitt Romneyesque-bad-guy performance out of an unlikely casting choice, the Disney leading man from Flubber, Fred MacMurray.The high-water mark in romantic comedy, this movie is so assured of its tone that even an attempted suicide is never far from a big laugh. It’s all wrapped up in giddy melancholy and — in a rare move — the Academy gave this comedy a whole bunch of Oscars too. Viva Wilder!The limited edition 20th anniversary Blu-ray release of&nbsp;Jerry Maguire&nbsp;is available now exclusively at Best Buy locations.","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"President, Trophy","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/30132020/crowe-rep.jpg","slug":"cameron-crowes-five-favorite-films"},{"id":"47508831152289","title":"Pierce Brosnan’s Five Favorite Films","content":"Five Favorite Filmsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Pierce Brosnan's Five Favorite Filmsby Kerr Lordygan | November 23, 2015 |  CommentsGetty Images / Craig Barritt / Stringer&nbsp;Pierce Brosnan&nbsp;has a long history of breaking hearts and taking names. Remington Steele and James Bond are two household names brought to life by Mr. Suave-and-Debonair himself. He’s charmed his way onto screens large and small, not only as those two impressive guys, but also in films like Mrs. Doubtfire,&nbsp;The Thomas Crown Affair and The Matador. &nbsp;His latest film, No Escape,&nbsp;is out tomorrow on Blu-Ray, DVD, and On Demand. His thoughts on the films that most inspired him, though, are right here:&nbsp;The Wizard of Oz (1939)  99%I did it as a musical when I left drama school. Back in ’76, I did it as a Christmas pantomime [laughing] and so the &nbsp;movie is kind of indelible in my head. I wish I could say I played one of the main roles. I was just a chocolate tree.RT: That’s inspiring for the rest of us, just so you know.[laughing] Yeah, I made the props for the cast and I made cups of tea and I put the posters up and I watched the movie endlessly because I’d been trained as a method actor — deep in the method, you know — I was deep into my chocolate tree. I was a chocolate tree, a dancing skeleton, and a jitterbug. I don’t know, the movie just kind of stuck with me. And it was a movie that I skated over when it would come on Sunday afternoons after the Sunday roast in England. But somehow it connected with me and I just think it’s a magnificent film — brilliantly orchestrated and performed by them all. And “If I Were King of the Forest” is one of my favorite songs. Just the magic of it, and it’s a bit terrifying as well — flying monkeys — it’s pretty scary.RT: That’s true; it’s one of the scarier moments of many films. You don’t realize how scary that movie can be because of how grotesque films have gotten lately. That was truly terrifying, especially for kids.Yeah, back then, that was a big jolt to the system to see those little f—ers come down and try to grab your dog.The Godfather (1972)  97%Huge fan of Marlon Brando. For this man to come out of the shadows playing Don Corleone was just captivating. And it never disappoints; to this day it doesn’t disappoint. That movie is still a spectacle of Americana storytelling with a performance by him which is just inspiring. And he was an inspiring actor, he was certainly somebody who I still go back and watch and… the music, the story, the whole trilogy — It was very much connected to my youth as a young man about to go off to drama school.RT: So that inspired you to do what you do?Yes. I mean, Brando was one of many — Montgomery Clift, Spencer Tracy, Cary Grant, Paul Newman, Warren Beatty, Robert De Niro. When you’re moved emotionally by an actor, you want to be like them, you want to be up there, just that innocent dream that I had as a young man to make movies, to be a part of movies, never in my wildest dreams thinking I was going to come close to it. And it still has that allure. You still — you know, how it goes as an older man, you see young… I saw Brooklyn the other day with Saoirse Ronan and Emory Cohen, this young fellow — the two of them together were just breathtaking, brilliantly real. [laughs]&nbsp;Same with Michael Shannon in 99 Homes, and Andrew Garfield. It’s good, it’s great.The English Patient (1996)  85%Ralph [Fiennes] is a spectacular actor. I just love the romance of the film. The soundtrack — when you have great acting and great story and a soundtrack, it just always cuts to the marrow of your senses, so to speak.&nbsp;And you know both those films&nbsp;—&nbsp;well actually, those three films have soundtracks which are very memorable.There Will Be Blood (2007)  91%What other great films are there? Ah, for God’s sake,&nbsp;There Will Be Blood and No Country For Old Men. I saw those films that year, back to back. Just outstanding work by director, writer, producers, actors. Captivating, both men: Javier Bardem and Daniel Day Lewis — just iconic. Every time he steps on the stage, you know, you can’t take your eyes off the guy. And both films sit on the bookshelf as bookends, really, to that special year of film making.No Country for Old Men (2007)  93%RT: Is there one that you think ranks a little bit higher?I can’t really say one ranks higher than the other because they’re on par with each other. I mean the Coen brothers’ unique landscape of film-making — they have such a versatile touch, and such a unique way of telling their stories. I wouldn’t want to rank one above the other because they’re both impressive movies and movie experiences.&nbsp;Kerr Lordygan for Rotten Tomatoes: What can you talk about that you’re working on next?Brosnan: I’m about to go off and do a movie with Martin Campbell here and the end of the week in London. And Jackie Chan. It’s a piece called The Foreigner, and it’s a thriller, and it’s — for Jackie — a wonderful part. A man whose life is torn apart by the IRA and a bombing. I play the Northern Irish Minister who’s trying to keep the peace accord together.RT: So you’re a good guy.Brosnan: Yeah, I believe I’m a good guy. So that’s where you’ll find me right now, just pulling that together.No Escape&nbsp;will be available on Blu-Ray, DVD and On Demand Nov. 24th.","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"ghosts, television, Black, italian, streaming, telelvision, Valentine's, Emmy, strong, Access, Fox, criterion","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/19145129/pierce-feat-img-smaller.jpg","slug":"pierce-brosnans-five-favorite-films"},{"id":"47508831160484","title":"Josh Duhamel’s Five Favorite Films","content":"Five Favorite Filmsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Josh Duhamel's Five Favorite Filmsby Sarah Ricard | November 3, 2015 |  Comments(Photo by Getty Images / Frazer Harrison)&nbsp;When Lost in the Sun hits theaters this week, fans will see a very different side of actor Josh Duhamel,&nbsp;best known for his starring TV roles on Battle Creek and Las Vegas.&nbsp;In his new film, Duhamel plays a drifter&nbsp;who enlists a teenage orphan&nbsp;to accompany him in&nbsp;his criminal ways along&nbsp;the open road. How very un-Tad Hamilton of him!Rotten Tomatoes caught up with Duhamel to talk about his five favorite films — and also a very funny memory he has of his Star Wars toys!One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (1975)  94%I love it. I love the characters. I love the crazy psych ward. Jack Nicholson! I remember hearing about it when I was young and I was becoming more interested in film. Jack Nicholson had a run there in the ‘70s and ‘80s that was just unrivaled in my opinion. I’m a huge fan of his.Dumb and Dumber (1994)  68%I can’t even tell you how many times I’ve seen Dumb and Dumber. It’s got to be at least 50. I remember in college, I watched this movie with my buddies and we just thought it was the funniest f—ing thing we’ve ever seen. I still watch it and I still quote it all the time. In fact, I [went] on Ellen as Lloyd Christmas for Halloween… You know what it is about it? There are so many moments in this movie that are ridiculous; they’re dumb — that’s why the movie is called Dumb and Dumber — but I’ve thought about this. Why is it that I love this movie so much? I think it’s because Lloyd and Harry really cared about each other. There was real heart to that movie… &nbsp;and if you don’t have that in these movies and it’s just pure broad comedy, it’s missing something that you can connect to.&nbsp;The Shining (1980)  84%I love The Shining. I love Stanley Kubrick. I love the tone of his movies. It was super-scary, and, again, I love Nicholson in it. I love the ominous nature of that giant hotel in the mountains.Pulp Fiction (1994)  92%That was in 1994. That was right around the time I was finishing college and moving to California,&nbsp;in&nbsp;that period of my life, and I was secretly interested in the entertainment business but didn’t tell anybody. There was something about the writing and the music and John Travolta’s resurgence. Sam Jackson was just a badass motherf—er. I love Tarantino’s writing.Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope (1977)  92%It made a huge impression on me as a kid and I still have all my little action figures. In fact, my mom was too cheap to buy me the actual Star Wars case to hold them all in, so I have a case, but it’s called “Star World” and it has all these knock-off characters — like, there’s a Darth Vader who’s all in black, but just not quite the same. And there’s a hairy character who’s sort of like Chewbacca, but not — which is probably a collectors’ item when I think about it because they would never get away with that now. There’d be copyright infringements.Rotten Tomatoes: You’re going to be really geeked-out about the new Star Wars, huh?Oh, man. I already am. I’m super-pumped about it. I just showed my two-year-old son my collection of Star Wars figures the other day and he doesn’t know. They have zero regard for the preciousness of anything and the first thing he does is pick up my Lando Calrissian — and there are these little plastic capes that are in mint condition –and the first thing he does is pull it right off and tear it. And I’m like, “Nooooo! That thing’s been in tact since ‘77!”Lost in the Sun&nbsp;hits theaters, VOD, and iTunes on&nbsp;Friday, Nov. 6.","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"hidden, GIFs, 2015, Awards, Academy, 007, America, Apple, A24, show, Comic, festivals, 2019","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/03213004/Josh-Duhamel-600.jpg","slug":"josh-duhamels-five-favorite-films"},{"id":"47508832298162","title":"Joe Mantegna’s Five Favorite Films","content":"Five Favorite Filmsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Joe Mantegna's Five Favorite Filmsby Beki Lane | July 24, 2015 |  CommentsJoe Mantegna (Bugsy, Forget Paris, The Godfather, Part 3, and the TV series Criminal Minds) is&nbsp;starring in&nbsp;the upcoming mobster mystery&nbsp;10 Cent Pistol.&nbsp;RT talked to him recently about his Five Favorite Films. As he’d never really considered what his favorite movies were before, he went with&nbsp;the tried-and-true criteria of, “stuff that if, when I catch it on TV, would I keep watching it?”&nbsp;Here’s the&nbsp;straight-shooting list from this veteran actor.The Adventures of Robin Hood (1938)  100%It probably would be one of the original Robin Hoods, with Errol Flynn, from 1938. Errol Flynn was my hero, and then when I was fortunate enough to get a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, I asked to be put next to his, which they did.&nbsp;If you’re going to go back to what was my first favorite movie, that was it, and still would be in my top five, without question.The Godfather (1972)  97%I never had really thought about if I had to name five movies that I really love, but the Godfather trilogy would certainly be in there. I’d have to put the trilogy in because I’m in the third one, so you know. I’m not going to shill&nbsp;myself, but collectively I just think that they were incredible.&nbsp;I feel very blessed to have been part of it, because certainly 1 and 2 were two of the greatest movies ever made. 3, let the other people judge that. I would consider that trilogy as one thing, though, you know what I mean?The Producers (1968)  90%The Producers is one of my favorite movies, and I don’t mean the musical. I mean the original one that Mel Brooks directed, with Zero Mostel.&nbsp;I saw it when it first came out.&nbsp;I saw it in the movie theaters, back in the ’60s. I just think as a comedy, and also being in the business as I am, and coming from theater, it just had that much more impact for me. That’s a movie I like very much.Time After Time (1979)  87%There was a really good film, and a film I really liked called Time After Time. With Mary Steenburgen, and she wound up marrying the British actor from Clockwork Orange, Malcolm McDowell. My wife and I both really loved the film. It was a great film, and then the fact that they got married in real life. They didn’t stay married, but they had a couple kids together, and I’d like to think that at least for that period, that was real… where life imitated art. Because it’s such a beautiful movie, a love story. Two people from very divergent, different worlds, and I know them both, Mary and Malcolm, and they are two people from very divergent worlds. That’s probably why the marriage didn’t work out. Yet, there’s something about that that I thought was kind of sweet. It was a really good movie, too.The Wizard of Oz (1939)  99%I think you’ve got to go with the classics. You’ve got to go with The Wizard of Oz.&nbsp;That’s the one that I can think of as a kid you always looked forward to, because when I was a kid, they only aired it at Thanksgiving. You had to wait.

Rodriguez / Getty Images)You know him as teenager Manny Delgado in&nbsp;Modern Family, which is premiering its seventh season tomorrow night, Sept. 23 on ABC. But&nbsp;Rico Rodriguez&nbsp;has also been busy with his new film,&nbsp;Endgame, a drama about a young chess prodigy using his gaming skills to further the success of his school’s team and unite his own disjointed family.&nbsp;To celebrate both premieres, Rodriguez was able to share his Five Favorite Films with us, and he was eager to talk about&nbsp;his recent movie-bingeing sessions, when&nbsp;he caught up on some classics and popular favorites that he felt were must-sees. Here is his list:Psycho (1960)  96%One of the first ones on my list would have to be Alfred Hitchcock’s Psycho, just because I really look up to Alfred Hitchcock and what he did as a director. What’s so funny is that I never really knew the big reveal. After all these years, I’d never known the reveal. So when I saw it, I was genuinely&nbsp;shocked and freaked out by what I just saw. So it was really fun to be able to not have that kind of secret be revealed to me before and let me be surprised. It was a really great film and I really enjoyed it.RT:&nbsp;That’s a long time to go through life not having that revealed to you; that is really cool.And it’s crazy because they had Bates Motel come out — which is before Norman went crazy — but I never really dived into that before so I didn’t really know much backstory or anything. So when I watched it, I was genuinely freaked out.RT: You just saw it recently then?Yeah. A lot last year and this year, I have been on a movie watching phase&nbsp; — I just want to watch a bunch of movies: old, new — kind of, like, acclaimed. And I watched it around Halloween time so that’s what also kind of creeped me out as well. A lot of fun.Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back (1980)  94%Just because I’m a huge Star Wars fan, and that movie really took the movie into a turn that set up the last movie. And the big surprises and everything that happen in the movie were really kind of revolutionary. And I just love sci-fi films, so Star Wars had to be on this list. And what’s so cool about it is I went to the 30th anniversary premiere — and I had just watched them — so I had brought an old VHS tape of that movie to the premiere, and I got Harrison Ford to sign it for me, which is really, really cool. And Billy Dee Williams was in an episode of Modern Family, and I got him to sign that VHS as well. So now all I really need to get is Mark Hamill and Carrie Fisher to complete the actors in that movie. It’s one of my prized possessions.RT: You must be really excited for The Force Awakens too.I am super excited for the new movie. And that’s why I’m re-watching them now, just to get back into it and see if I missed anything — make sure I’m all caught up with everything when the new movie comes out later.RT: The new toys came out recently.I saw one of them and they just look so cool!Nosferatu, a Symphony of Horror (Nosferatu, eine Symphonie des Grauens) (Nosferatu the Vampire) (1922)  97%I really, really enjoyed that one just because I watched [it] around when I watched Psycho, and I’d always heard about it. They make references in some shows that I watch. I was like, “You know, I might as well watch it.”&nbsp; It was my first — and so far the only — silent film I’ve ever seen.&nbsp; It was really cool just to watch back then how they did it and, again, it was revolutionary for its time.RT: It’s a creepy one.It’s really, really creepy. Again, it freaked me out. You’d think a silent movie from the 1920s wouldn’t be that scary. It was actually kind of scary; the beginning sequence as it described the vampire, that freaked me out [laughs].RT: And there’s something just creepy about silence, too when we don’t have the words. Once we add dialogue, it’s so easy to ruin the mood.It really is, and so you get to see their faces and body language — how they acted without sound, without words — which I thought was really cool. When I went to go watch it, I was like, “OK Rico, it’s a silent film. I don’t know how I’m going to react to it. I’m not sure if I’m going to like it or not.” I wanted to see it because it’s been so long since it came out. And when I watched it, I just really enjoyed it and now it’s one of my favorite movies.RT: Lots of classics on your list.Yeah, like I was saying, I’ve been into that movie phase and I just want to watch a bunch of classics.Nightcrawler (2014)  95%Now I’m going a little more up-to-date modern. My fourth one would probably have to be Nightcrawler with Jake Gyllenhaal. I just really liked it. It was one of those movies that’s creepy but really entertaining and just different, and I really, really enjoyed that. When I saw the previews for it last year, I was like, “Man I really want to see it.” And I never got to because — we go to the movies often, but not as much. But whenever I do, I always want to go see a good movie; I want to see a movie I’d been wanting to see. So since I wasn’t able to watch it, I rented it the first day it came out, and I thought wow this movie is really, really good.RT: And it’s scary in a very real way. It’s like this person could exist.Which is the weird part, I know! Jake Gyllenhaal gave a great performance and that was really great to watch.Straight Outta Compton (2015)  89%I’m a big fan of rap music and that group kind of revolutionized that style of music. And the acting was great. It was such a great film. I thought it was awesome , though, that these people — most biopics are of people who have passed away — these people are [pushing 50]&nbsp;and they already have a movie&nbsp; made about them. That’s so cool! Ice Cube and Dr. Dre — that’s so cool — they’ve really reached, like, awesome status.Endgame opens Sept. 25 in limited&nbsp;release.Modern Family‘s&nbsp;seventh season&nbsp;premieres Wednesday, Sept. 23 on ABC.","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"The, Grant, critics, sequels, Horse, of, disaster, Apple","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/GettyImages-489368000-1.jpg","slug":"rico-rodriguez-five-favorite-films"},{"id":"47508832300211","title":"Tarsem Singh’s Five Favorite Films","content":"Five Favorite Filmsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Tarsem Singh's Five Favorite FilmsSelf/less Director Discusses the Films that Have Inspired Himby Kerr Lordygan | July 9, 2015 |  CommentsSelf/less director Tarsem Singh is no stranger to epic films. Having begun as a successful music video and commercial director (R.E.M.’s “Losing My Religion,” En Vogue’s “Hold On,” and the “We Will Rock You” Pepsi campaign), Singh’s eye for visual splendor embarked him on a film career made up of optical wonders like The Cell, The Fall, Immortals, and Mirror, Mirror. Self/less, starring Ryan Reynolds and Ben Kingsley, will follow suit this Friday. We wanted to know what films served as influences for his work, and we got his top five here:La Jetée (The Pier) (1962)  93%I think the greatest film of all time. It doesn’t even care about anything. It has the best MacGuffin. The audiences in the west — if you’re going to transfer somebody from one place to the other, you want to spend all the money on the big gadgets that do all of the — as Monty Python says “the machines that go BING” kind of stuff. Whereas in La Jetée, just two guys lie down on a hammock, they drug intravenously, and they go, “Voila! We’re in the future.” I just love that. It’s just a Macguffin in a different culture, the different time — they’re used to different things. And for me, having traveled a lot, I always have to find out — when you show a movie to people they just say, “Would you buy this?” That’s one of the reasons you have origin films — like Superman or whatever — that takes so long in the west whenever you start to originate one, because you have to set up that this guy can fly because he is from another planet, has a nemesis, you can make him grounded when you give him kryptonite, and all that stuff. You watch a Hindi movie, and they just say, “Hey this guy can deflect a bullet with his ring because he is [Indian film actor] Amitabh Bachchan, so next question.” Literally, it is all about what each culture takes — to take as a MacGuffin and where they want the money spent. And La Jetée just doesn’t care. It’s got the greatest story and the movie — the images don’t even move except in one particular instance — I don’t want to spoil it for someone who hasn’t seen it. But it is just one of the greatest. It was made the year I was born, I was obsessed with it forever and when Terry Gilliam made 12 Monkeys I knew it was done.The Conversation (1974)  96%It is the greatest film in the english language ever made between the two Godfathers. Almost drove him bankrupt, but there you go. It is the greatest thriller of all time. If ever you’re talking about a character to which — how to get you biting your nails without any slaps or gunshots going off, that movie’s it. It’s just so terrifyingly correct. I’m not really a [Michaelangelo] Antonioni fan or any of those; Blow Up and all that never did it for me. But The Conversation, somehow, whoa. And I kind of find Mamet the same way. I know everybody holds correctly Hitchcock, you know, as high as you can, but I find Mamet delivers more shock and awe to me, and twists in a correct way than I ever found with Hitchcock. But of course we’re watching Hitchcock movies when 20 things have copied his films and they’ve become cliché at a particular point. The Conversation holds up like that for me.The Decalogue (1998)  100%The reason I love it is it’s the ultimate adaptation. You know, memes coming out in your films. This guy makes a film every two, three years, is making, making, making, and all the money goes away and they come to him and they say, “Okay, you can make it for TV. You can make whatever you want,” and he walks up to a building complex and he goes right, The Ten Commandments in that building. How do you do that? He makes 10 movies in a year — three of them I think they released later on as features. And you look at them and they have the balls of a student movie, like a short film about killing. It’s just all about the process. It isn’t about hanging the guy or not hanging the guy, it’s just what it takes to hang a guy. And just stuff like that, that I just think, “How do you do that?” I don’t think it’ll ever happen — at least in my lifetime.The Mirror (1975)  100%This used to get me when I was in college. I haven’t watched [Tarkovsky’s] films for years now, but they really got my goat. I did not understand anything. I just watched it, and I used to have a visceral reaction with them. And I haven’t seen them for about 20 years, but any of his [would make the list]. I think The Mirror, or even The Sacrifice, or Nostalghia — any one of those just blew my rocks off. Somebody like Polanski, he does a film with the devil or he does a thriller and his DNA is all over it. So when I look at the Tarkovsky films I just think like I could interchange all of them and watch them, each one of them just shook my world.Caché (2005)  89%I do remember talking with [filmmaker David] Fincher. He was telling me about the original one that [Michael Haneke] did, Funny Games, and I was telling him about Hidden. And we didn’t realize in that conversation that we were talking about the same filmmaker. But it is truly, for me, the God of cinema, that just does not breathe a step wrong, and is contemporary life apart from Kieslowski’s time — is Haneke. I looked at that film and I thought it the most thrillingly, chillingly, correctly timed movie that I have ever seen.Self/less opens in wide release on July 10.","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"Reality, Mystery, Moore, in","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Tarsem-Singh.jpg","slug":"tarsem-singhs-five-favorite-films"},{"id":"47508990133874","title":"Total Recall: Best Stalker Movies","content":"Total Recallvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Total Recall: Best Stalker MoviesWith All About Steve hitting theaters, we run down some of film's most noteworthy sneaks.by Jeff Giles | September 2, 2009 |  CommentsIn the real world, stalking is a crime that tends to be taken pretty seriously — and from Hitchcock to Tarantino, Hollywood’s finest filmmakers have always taken it pretty seriously too, albeit for different reasons. Simply put, whether you’re looking for laughs or chills, the irrational, dogged pursuit of one human being by another tends to make for a good story. This weekend’s entry in the stalker genre, the Sandra Bullock/Bradley Cooper comedy All About Steve, looks to add to that tradition — so we thought now would be a good time to take a fond look back at some of the most memorable stalkers in movie history.To make our list, we looked at films across a wide spectrum of release dates (our oldest entry was released in 1951 — no fair peeking!) and genres, pulling from suspense thrillers, comedies, dramas, and horror. We even made room for a certain extremely persistent paperboy. So which of your favorites made the list? Which classic stalkers have we overlooked? Join us on our latest Total Recall, then let us hear all about it in the comments. We’ll be watching you![tomatometer]MuzeID=1009699[/tomatometer]10. The HitcherBy the mid-1980s, good old-fashioned stalker flicks seemed rather quaint. By this time, audiences had grown numb to garden-variety knife-wielding crazies, and filmgoers raised on supernatural nutjobs like Jason and Freddy weren’t really looking to understand their antagonists’ motives; they simply wanted to hoot and scream at the sheer unadulterated spectacle of gory violence. Consider 1986’s The Hitcher, then, a quintessentially ’80s hybrid of stalker thriller and slasher. Starring Rutger Hauer as the titular transportationally challenged wacko and C. Thomas Howell as his quarry, The Hitcher infused the genre’s relatively staid conventions with bursts of over-the-top horror, an increasingly absurd plot, and a seemingly superpowered villain. Predictably, critics were generally less than impressed — Roger Ebert, for one, called it “reprehensible” — but a fair number of scribes had fun with the movie, mainly because of Hauer’s memorably menacing performance. “It’s like a sadistic version of Duel,” wrote Widget Walls of Needcoffee.com, adding, “instead of a semi, you get Hauer in all his creepy manic splendor.”[tomatometer]MuzeID=1179452[/tomatometer]9. Death ProofA gleeful, high-octane inversion of the stalker thriller, Quentin Tarantino’s Death Proof initially led its audience down a familiar path, laying out a plot in which a sadistic loner (played by Kurt Russell) uses his car — a souped-up 1970 Chevy Nova that’s been “death-proofed” for his stuntman’s work — to terrorize, maim, and murder a succession of young women. Tarantino being Tarantino, however, the movie culminates with a role reversal in which the victims turn the tables on their tormentor — and have a grand old time doing it, too. Initially part of Grindhouse, the three-hour-plus double feature Tarantino shared with Robert Rodriguez, Death Proof aspired to recreate the grimy, low-budget aesthetic of the exploitation films popular in down-market theaters during the 1970s — and as far as some critics were concerned, it succeeded a little too well, with James Christopher of the Times UK calling it “garbled, spotty, and tedious” and David Edwards of the Daily Mirror saying it was “so profoundly dull, so relentlessly misguided, so criminally self-indulgent you almost feel bad criticizing it.” More often than not, however, writers shared Tarantino’s affection for the bygone grindhouse era. As Kevin N. Laforest of the Montreal Film Journal wrote, “I’ve rarely seen a filmmaker, in current Hollywood at least, expose his sexual and sadistic kinks on screen with such shameless glee.”[tomatometer]MuzeID=1115942[/tomatometer]8. One Hour PhotoHe rose to fame on the strength of his maddeningly energetic comic persona, but there was always a melancholic element to Robin Williams’ work — an element he explored more deeply in the 1990s and early aughts, first with dramedies like Mrs. Doubtfire, then with more serious fare, such as Patch Adams and What Dreams May Come. Some of these projects were more warmly received than others, but each of them gave audiences a glimpse of just how deeply Williams could sublimate the frantic restlessness that defined his public image, and they culminated with 2002’s One Hour Photo. Here, Williams plays Sy Parrish, a profoundly lonely photo technician whose desperate, hidden attachment to his customers sends him down a dark path, and it’s a testament to his skill as an actor that even though Parrish is an obviously disturbed and frankly disquieting character, Williams makes it hard not to identify, if not outright sympathize, with his sad plight. Photo was a moderate success at the box office, but critics were nearly unanimous in their praise for its star’s performance. “Sy is a complete character with a physicality, inner monologue and motivation that we haven’t seen from Mr. Williams in a long time,” wrote Joe Lozito of Big Picture Big Sound. “And it’s a pleasure to watch.”[tomatometer]MuzeID=1007141[/tomatometer]7. Fatal AttractionThe 1970s might have been the “Me Decade,” but selfishness was pretty solidly in vogue during the 1980s, too; it was, after all, the decade that gave us Leona Helmsley, the savings and loan crisis, and Michael Douglas, as Ivan Boesky-inspired banker Gordon Gekko, telling us that “greed, for lack of a better word, is good.” Douglas highlighted another kind of self-centered behavior in 1987’s Fatal Attraction, playing a character who impulsively cheats on his wife (Anne Archer) with a woman he meets at a party (Glenn Close) — and who quickly discovers that his actions have horrible, wide-ranging consequences, including an unplanned pregnancy, a crushing wave of guilt, and the violent instability of his would-be fling. Attraction shadowed the plot of Play Misty for Me, and like Jessica Walter before her, Close turned what could have been a shrieking cartoon of a villain into a three-dimensional character audiences could occasionally sympathize with — or be terrified of: the movie did for infidelity what Jaws did for sharks. Though a considerable number of critics had problems with Attraction‘s portrayal of women, most were willing to forgive; in the words of Nick Davis of Nick’s Flick Picks, “the movie’s sexual politics are a little acrid, but its construction is so persuasive and the lead performances so inspired that the film is hard to resist.”[tomatometer]MuzeID=1016423[/tomatometer]6. Play Misty for MeClint Eastwood, toughest of the tough guys, being terrorized…by a dame? The late 1960s and early 1970s were a time of tremendous upheaval for American gender roles, and with his directorial debut, Eastwood proved that stalkers don’t have to have Adam’s apples to be frightening. In what would end up becoming her most well-known role (at least until she surfaced as Lucille Bluth on Arrested Development), Jessica Walter played Evelyn Draper, the mentally unstable woman whose fixation on radio disc jockey Dave Garver (Eastwood) escalates from sort of annoying (e.g. repeated call-in requests for “Misty”) to brutally violent madness. We tend not to expect a whole lot from our thrillers — either they scare us or they don’t — but Play Misty for Me was somewhat groundbreaking; Walter’s nuanced performanced helped pave the way for other female antagonists (such as — foreshadowing alert! — Glenn Close in Fatal Attraction), and Evelyn’s ability to cheat seemingly certain death in the final act went on to become a staple of the genre. Dave Kehr of the Chicago Reader summed up the movie’s charms when he wrote, “Clint Eastwood wisely chose a strong, simple thriller for his first film as a director, and the project is remarkable in its self-effacing dedication to getting the craft right.”[tomatometer]MuzeID=1083936[/tomatometer]5. There’s Something About MaryAs you can tell from most of the films on this list, stalking generally isn’t played for laughs in Hollywood. If anyone was going to squeeze guffaws out of such a serious subject, though, it makes sense that it would turn out to be the Farrelly brothers — and that they’d do it in There’s Something About Mary, a film that reduced audiences to helpless side-clutching with its less-than-delicate handling of such topics as the mentally disabled, homosexuality, masturbation, animal abuse, and the effects of gravity on elderly sunbathers’ mammary glands. Its more shocking moments got most of the attention, but at its heart, Mary is a comedy about stalking — both benign (as practiced by Ben Stiller’s painfully awkward Ted Stroehmann) and creepy (as personified by Matt Dillon’s unctuous Pat Healy). At the center of it all is Mary (Cameron Diaz), the winsome surgeon whose faith in human nature is shadily abused in countless ways, none of which should really be all that funny. The unlikely fact that the movie is hilarious anyway was not lost on critics like the New York Observer’s Andrew Sarris, who pronounced it “remarkable for all the sick and politically incorrect sight gags it gets away with in its rule-breaking romp through the supposedly sacred laws of what makes people laugh, and what doesn’t.”[tomatometer]MuzeID=1098263[/tomatometer]4. Chuck &amp; BuckHollywood has given us loads of movies about men and women stalking each other, for all sorts of reasons, but 2000’s Chuck &amp; Buck is almost certainly the only one we’re ever likely to see about a man’s long-delayed (and, at the very least, sociopathic) efforts to rekindle a sexual relationship he had at the age of 11 with his male best friend — who has since repressed his memories of said relationship so deeply that he doesn’t even seem to remember it happened. Filled with coal black humor and incredibly uncomfortable moments, Chuck &amp; Buck didn’t resonate with everyone (Time’s Richard Schickel wrote that “any movie that sentimentalizes stalking ought to be shunned”), and its unusual plot — to say nothing of its frequently unsettling overtones — helped kept it from doing huge business at the box office. Still, the vast majority of critics applauded the intelligence and originality of the script (written by Mike White, who also starred as Buck). Lisa Alspector of the Chicago Reader called it “possibly the most daring and honest drama about sexuality I’ve ever seen,” and Goatdog’s Movies’ Michael W. Phillips, Jr. mused, “it was often painfully difficult to watch. It was never predictable, though, which is saying something.”Warning: NSFW — language.[tomatometer]MuzeID=1003077[/tomatometer]3. KluteDirector Alan J. Pakula kicked off his “paranoia trilogy” with this 1971 thriller about a jaded call girl (Jane Fonda, who won an Oscar for her work) who works with a private investigator (Donald Sutherland) to catch a killer who’s been targeting ladies of the evening. “Lots of guys swing with a call girl like Bree — one guy just wants to kill her,” cooed the poster, and that’s pretty much Klute in a nutshell; there wasn’t anything particularly innovative or unexpected about Andy and Dave Lewis’ screenplay, and neither was Pakula’s direction the film’s main selling point (Roger Greenspun of the New York Times described it as “a tepid, rather tasteless mush”). Its real strength was the interplay between Sutherland and Fonda, both of whom drew raves from critics. Roger Ebert was one of the duly impressed, writing, “with Fonda and Sutherland, you have actors who understand and sympathize with their characters, and you have a vehicle worthy of that sort of intelligence. So the fact that the thriller stuff doesn’t always work isn’t so important.”[tomatometer]MuzeID=1020292[/tomatometer]2. Strangers on a TrainTalk about your terrible misunderstandings: A seemingly random encounter between tennis star Guy Haines (Farley Granger) and a fellow train passenger named Bruno (Robert Walker) takes a strange turn when a conversation about Haines’ public marital problems leads to Bruno offering to do away with Guy’s wife in exchange for the murder of Bruno’s father. Guy, somewhat understandably, doesn’t take Bruno seriously; unfortunately, Bruno’s offer is real, and when he holds up his end of the “bargain,” Guy finds himself the subject of a police investigation — as well as the target of Bruno’s increasingly deranged wrath. Another in a string of triumphs for director Alfred Hitchcock, Strangers on a Train was adapted from Patricia Highsmith’s first novel, and helped jumpstart a literary career that would later grow to include the film-friendly Ripley series. “Two men, a problem, and a crime is an old theme,” wrote Filmcritic’s Mark Athitakis, “but the list of works that exploit it perfectly is a short one. Strangers on a Train belongs on it.”[tomatometer]MuzeID=1020915[/tomatometer]1. Taxi DriverYeah, you knew this one was going to end up here. Robert De Niro is something of an expert cinematic stalker, having explored darkly obsessive characters on a number of occasions (see: The King of Comedy, Martin Scorsese’s Cape Fear remake, and The Fan), but if you have to choose just one of his stalker pictures — and, for the purposes of this list, you do — it has to be 1976’s Taxi Driver. A lonely, depressed insomniac, Travis Bickle (De Niro) is a tight bundle of rage looking for an outlet, and he finds it in Senator Charles Palantine (Leonard Harris), a politician whose presidential campaign staff includes a volunteer (Cybill Shepherd) who spurns Bickle’s affections, thus unwittingly triggering his violent rampage. Though certainly not for the squeamish, Taxi Driver combined scuzzy grit with some truly sophisticated filmmaking, and critics responded immediately to Scorsese’s assured direction and Paul Schrader’s lean, bleak script (to say nothing of remarkable performances from De Niro and Jodie Foster). It is, in the words of the Sunday Times’ Shannon J. Harvey, “Scorsese’s first masterpiece.”Take a look through the reviews for All About Steve, as well as the rest of our Total Recall archives.Finally, we leave you with a clip from Better Off Dead, which features what is unquestionably one of the funniest stalkers in all of moviedom — and you know exactly who we’re talking about.

I hope the genius&nbsp;who&nbsp;decided to go to Peter Bogdanovich for his Top 5 before asking yours truly has a fun time explaining that to the boss! I mean, COME ON!Now when it comes to film, I mostly just like sayin’ ‘oeuvre’ and watchin’ the blank look on Drax’s face, but I do keep a personal library of my faves. So here they are in no particular order…Dirty Harry (1971)  89%Dirty Harry Callahan would make a GREAT Guardian of the Galaxy. We don’t hardly count as 100% heroes, but we ain’t 100% outlaws neither. We’re… a bit of both. This should be required viewing for anyone in law enforcement. I’M LOOKING AT YOU, NOVA CORPS. I only have one tiny critique — Callahan was wasting time with that puny “.44 Magnum.” He needs my “.88 Maxnum,” my quad-blaster, or even better, my Hadron Enforcer! NOW ask yourself, “Do I feel lucky?!” OH, YEAH!Rascal (1969) When I first met Peter Quill in Kyln, I ain’t never heard of a “raccoon,” but he made me watch this movie and… aww flarg, I loved it! It’s a gritty tale about a wily raccoon that gets abducted by one of Quill’s ancient ancestors in some cheese hut called “Wisconsin.” The little guy unleashes a whole lot of krutack on his captors and eventually cons the kid into letting him go free. It reminded me of my own childhood, when I got stuck in a lab on Halfworld. That’s where I met my best bud Groot. This flick had us bawling like saplings. BUT DON’T TELL QUILL! I don’t want him to know we was gettin’ sentimental…&nbsp;First Blood (1982)  85%Ohhh yeaaaaahhhhhh. Rambo. Greatest krutackin’ warrior this side of the galaxy. Listen, after me and Groot escaped from Halfworld, we had it tough. We started collecting bounties for units, and fell into plenty of “misunderstandings” with Nova Corps — we know how this guy feels! What I like best about Rambo though — he weren’t out there to hurt nobody. And me and the Guardians, we’re savin’ lives now!Actually, you know what? That ain’t what I like best about Rambo — I like when he BLOWS THAT D’AST TOWN TO SMITHEREENS. What can I say? I love anything that goes BOOM!&nbsp;Pocahontas (1995)  55%A fascinating character study of how another rebel raccoon Meeko manipulates a buncha useless fleshbags into arguing over a buncha Earth units that weren’t even real, just to feed his bottomless appetite — FOR POWER! I always say there ain’t no thing like me, ‘cept me, but Meeko’s pretty d’ast close. He’s even got his own talking tree sidekick, Granny Willow! And look, Groot’s great, but he ain’t got the powers of persuasion that this barky broad had. But Meeko and Granny, they took it too far — they almost started a WAR! Me an’ Groot, we’re all about protecting our galaxy (YOU’RE WELCOME, BY THE WAY). But trust you me, Meeko is the greatest antihero of Earth cinema. Five stars!Guardians of the Galaxy (2014)  92%You know d’ast well this is my favorite film! Adapted from my super-violent memoirs, Marvel Studios brought to Earth the formerly little-known story of how a one-of-a-kind hero, YOURS TRULY, united a group of Kyln prison rookies and saved the whole krutackin’ galaxy! Bradley Cooper, an acclaimed cinematic thespian, starred as ME, while TV’s Chris Pratt turned in a surprising performance in what was SUPPOSED to be a supporting role (Don’t worry, Rocket fans, I got a “call” into his agent!). Still, this biopic was mostly factualistic. Only thing is, they messed up the title — the more accurate nomenclature is Rocket and Some D’ast Useless Flargs. I’ve offered it up free of charge for the sequel.And that’s it, cinephiles!

He talked to Rotten Tomatoes recently about his “if not brilliant, I hope at least understandable” Five Favorite Films. Here’s his-more-than-understandable&nbsp;collection:Bedazzled (1967)  78%Number one is easy, Bedazzled. The original 1967 piece with Peter Cook and Dudley Moore.&nbsp;It’s pretty simple. It’s really funny, and strange____. It’s like I think it was a big influence on my. I saw it in the ‘80s when I was a kid. I think it was on my grandma had, I mean she has seen it before we did, and she had few, we had video types, and I remember seeing the words all handwritten in ____ “Bedazzled”, and it big effect when I’ve seen it, and even the word interested me. Dudley Moore is a meek man who’s in love with this woman, and he makes a deal with the devil, played by Peter Cook to keep trying to change himself to be the kind of man that she would like, and I don’t know of course none of them are going to work. There’s always something wrong with the situation.Heavenly Creatures (1994)  92%Heavenly Creatures; put a New Zealand one in here, for national&nbsp;pride, but I do think it’s a beautiful and interesting film. It’s the most beautiful film about matricide he ever made.Rushmore (1998)  90%Rushmore. That must come up a lot.&nbsp;But it’s funny, and I know that the movie Harold and Maude is probably a big influence on that; but I hadn’t seen that when I saw Rushmore. I hadn’t seen anything like it. It’s really funny. I think Wes Anderson is really hilarious and most people don’t notice, because of the style of the film. Grand Budapest Hotel, to me, was the funniest film of the year, but people saw it as an art film. I think I related to Max as well, because I grew up poor like he did, and when I went to University I did feel like I was kind of pretending of fitting in this world. I related to Max.ABCD (Any Body Can Dance) (2013) I’m going to put in a strange one now, Any Body Can Dance. This is my favorite movie for the last two years. It’s a Bollywood musical dance movie, and I don’t watch enough Bollywood movies. I watch them on the plane sometime, and you know because I travel a lot from place to place, and this one has been my favorite Bollywood films. It’s nearly unpredictable, you know if you’re coming from a Western point of view, but I _____ the same way Bollywood has a different theater role.&nbsp;So for me it’s always surprising what happens in the story, at least it still is, and this is amazing music and dancing in it. It’s like 20 Indian Michael Jacksons.&nbsp;I’ve seen it twice, and parts of it I’ve seen three times. It’s crazy. It’s unusual for a recent movie for me. Yeah, it’s a weird one. It’s not going to be for everyone, I know.RoboCop (1987)  90%Well the film I’ve seen most in my life is the original RoboCop. So I’m going to put that in. I can’t ignore it. I’ve seen that about 15 times. I think I was too young (to see it in theaters), but I remember being excited about it, and somehow someone had given me these RoboCop stickers. I use to cry if I was out of stickers. Cop, man, part machine, all cop, so you would have had all the stickers on my bedroom that said, “Look out! Protected by RoboCop.”&nbsp;You know it was on my window in the shape of a shield, and you know it was very original at the time. It had a great sense of modern time through it the whole way, which is still appropriate today. The thrill of that, I would want people to value it.People Places Things&nbsp;opens in wide release on August 14, 2015.","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"criterion, target, a, video, unscripted, cancelled, Fox, south, docuseries, war, TruTV, Bravo","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Jemaine-Clement.jpg","slug":"jemaine-clements-five-favorite-films"},{"id":"47508831168679","title":"Colin Hanks’ Five Favorite Films","content":"Five Favorite Filmsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Colin Hanks' Five Favorite FilmsThe star of Life in Pieces and director of All Things Must Pass talks about the allure of Tower Records.by Marya E. Gates | October 16, 2015 |  Comments(Photo by Andrew H. Walker / Staff / Getty Images)He’s the son of the nicest guy in Hollywood, Tom Hanks, but&nbsp;Colin Hanks&nbsp;has carved out a distinctive niche of his own in the movie business. He made his debut in That Thing You Do!&nbsp;and broke out as a star in his own right in 2002’s Orange County. He’s worked steadily in film and television, including gigs on Roswell, The Good Guys, Dexter, and Fargo, and he can currently be seen on the sitcom Life In Pieces. After directing a documentary short last year, Hanks’ first documentary feature film, All Things Must Pass: The Rise and Fall of Tower Records, opens this Friday. We spoke with Hanks about his Five Favorite Films and the allure of Tower Records.The Big Lebowski (1998)  83%Let’s start with The Big Lebowski. I remember seeing this film. I was studying in Germany at the time, and I remember loving Fargo so much — that was my first introduction to the Coen brothers — and I was so excited that they had a new movie out. So I went to some German cinema to go see The Big Lebowski.&nbsp;It was in English, but with German subtitles. I remember watching the movie and just being incredibly disappointed. I really did not like the movie. Probably about four years later, I rewatched it and I instantly said, “I’ve never been so wrong in my entire life.This is one of the funniest films I’ve ever seen.” It’s incredibly well-written, the characters are hilarious, the performances are so nuanced and so deep it’s almost mind-boggling. A lot of the times you do scenes and you just sort of come up with these happy accidents and it just seems like almost everything in there could not have been a happy accident; surely it must have been thought out. I just think it is such an original, fun film and it is quite honestly one of the most quotable films of the last fifty years in my opinion. I think there are so many quotes in there that I realized how foolish I was that first time. I think maybe I was just so excited that I was drinking a beer in a movie theater; maybe that’s why.Pulp Fiction (1994)  92%Pulp Fiction was a very big deal for me. That was the first film I remember seeing where I felt compelled to have a conversation afterwards with anyone who saw it. Prior to that, I was still a young kid; I was still in high school, and I would see movies and I would be like, “Oh that was great,” and move on. But that was one that stuck with me for so long; the performances and the dialogue were just so memorable. I just wanted to talk to whoever had seen it. I just felt like it was something you needed to talk about. And obviously that was a film that really changed the direction of film history for a great many people, myself included. &nbsp;Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back (1980)  94%I really, genuinely don’t like favorite lists because you always leave stuff out. So there are a lot of important films I could put in like The Godfather Part II, perhaps, or The Godfather Part I, but I’m going to go with The Empire Strikes Back&nbsp;for number three only because it’s Empire Strikes Back! I don’t think I need to say why. It’s so good. It takes what arguably could be just a simple science fiction movie and really takes it to this other place that is just so engaging and so believable and dramatic as well. Not overly dramatic, but dramatic. I love that film a great deal.Dazed and Confused (1993)  92%Number four would be Dazed and Confused. That was the movie that you saw and you wished it were your life. [laughs] That was a movie that I would watch all the time. I had it on VHS and whenever I was lonely, I’d throw it on. Whenever I wished I was out and about with friends from school, I would just throw that on and felt like I knew [the characters]. That was just one of those films that I just related to at that time. It was incredibly important and it’s another quotable film. I love it.Red Hot Chili Peppers: Funky Monks (1993) The last film I’m going to list is a documentary about Red Hot Chili Peppers recording Blood Sugar Sex Magik that was called Funky Monks. It’s about an hour long, it’s shot in black and white, and it’s about them recording Blood Sugar Sex Magik in this house in Beverly Hills. Blood Sugar Sex Magik was arguably the most important album of my young adult life. It sort of put me on my musical path. I guess now, looking back on it, it’s not at all ironic that Funky Monks was the first documentary that I ever watched. It sort of set me on a documentary path, where it wasn’t just narrative movies that interested me, but also real-life stories told in documentary form were now available to me. It greatly influenced me, not only in the Tower Records documentary, but also in all the documentary work that I’ve done. It is, I find, an incredibly engaging film about a subject that I am very passionate about, which is that particular record, and that particular time, not only for that band, but for music in general.Marya E. Gates&nbsp;for Rotten Tomatoes: What is it about Tower Records that moved you to make a documentary on the company?Colin Hanks: I spent a lot of time at Tower Records. I bought the Red Hot Chili Peppers doc there. I bought albums there. It was very instrumental for me growing up. I didn’t have a sweet tooth, so I spent all my money at the record shop, not at the candy store. So Tower was one of those places where you could really discover yourself and decide who you wanted to be. I was able to do that at Tower Records, and although I have a deep connection to the store, there was a lot about it’s history that I didn’t know and I saw an opportunity here in which here’s this incredibly beloved company, that everyone sort of thinks they know what the history is, and chances are they don’t. Chances are, there’s a lot about its history that people are not aware of, that is not only engaging storytelling, but also the characters that worked at Tower, the people that shopped at Tower, the people that spent 30, 40&nbsp;years of their life working at this company, they’re all incredibly engaging, fun people to speak with. I hope that when people see the film, they not only learn a little bit about a company that they thought they knew a lot about, but hopefully they realize that Tower closing its doors wasn’t just a big company, some faceless corporation, but it was actually people that had spent 30, 40 years of their lives getting to know each other, getting married, having kids, getting divorced, going through all of the big moments of their lives and then all having to fire each other, and how difficult that was. Hopefully it puts a little personal perspective onto a company that a lot of people have a great affinity for.All Things Must Pass: The Rise and Fall of Tower Records opens this weekend&nbsp;in limited release.Life in Pieces airs on CBS at 8:30/7:30c on&nbsp;Mondays.","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"of, monsters","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/ColinHanks.jpg","slug":"colin-hanks-five-favorite-films"},{"id":"47508834034874","title":"Tony Jaa’s Five Favorite Films","content":"Five Favorite Filmsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Tony Jaa's Five Favorite Filmsby Grae Drake | May 7, 2015 |  CommentsKnown for his explosive martial arts stunt work, Tony Jaa broke out in 2003 with Ong Bak: The Thai Warrior, which earned him international recognition and spawned two sequels. Most recently, he co-starred in the megahit Furious 7, duking it out with Paul Walker inside a speeding bus. This week, Jaa stars alongside Dolph Lundgren in the action thriller Skin Trade, and he took some time to share his Five Favorite Films with us, offering up five Certified Fresh choices that run the gamut from ’80s classics to epic blockbusters.Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom (Steven Spielberg, 1984)  84%I love adventure and this was a near perfect adventure. The character of Harrison Ford was cool and amusing. He was part cowboy, part naughty boy, he was smart and the character was different and fresh. You had a sense of movies from the old days but done in a modern form. The movie had a great pace, it just kept moving. The sets and back drop were interesting and dramatic. I am a big fan of Spielberg and this was a great movie.Enter the Dragon (Robert Clouse, 1973)  95%This is classic Bruce Lee and defined the martial arts movie genre for generations to come. Bruce Lee has a power and presence that will never be equalled. He was the first and this will never change. Enter The Dragon was really the first martial arts movie to break out internationally. Bruce had a fluidity and a look that was unique and very exciting to watch. The movie itself was not high budget, but everyone knows it and they never forget it.Back to the Future (Robert Zemeckis, 1985)  96%I just like Michael J. Fox. Michael was perfect for the role, he was funny, he kept the story moving and his character was engaging and sympathetic. I was young when I saw the movie, and I loved the idea of time travel. I dreamed I could be in an adventure like that and go everywhere in my time machine. The special effects at the time were very impressive to me. As a kid I felt this was a real adventure and I am an adventure nut.Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon (Ang Lee, 2001)  97%This is a classic Chinese style story and I enjoy that type of film. It appeals to Asian audiences, but this film appealed to audiences everywhere. It showed the best of what this type of film can be. The Director was brilliant, and the photography was really beautiful. The action was well choreographed and the cast did a great job. For this genre the movie really hit its target. When I saw this movie I imagined what it would be like to fly and do Kung Fu. Anything that sparks the imagination this well is exciting to watch.Furious 7 (James Wan, 2015)  82%Ok this is indirectly a bit of self promotion because I was in the film and it was my first international film which was always a life long dream. However the movie is total non-stop adrenaline. I got to know my fellow cast members well and really enjoyed the time I spent with them. Everyone was so nice and welcoming. Seeing my new friends on screen was both exciting and satisfying. They did a great job and the movie is epic. I was terribly sad when I saw Paul Walker on screen. Paul and I had become friends during the shoot and he was a genuinely wonderful person. My sadness was tempered by the fact that this movie was a great tribute to Paul. I think when it comes to a high energy movie it will be hard to top Fast and Furious 7.Skin Trade opens in limited release on May 8.","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"45, PaleyFest, bond, TV, Paramount, Seed, Vudu, joker, live, marvel, Tyler, Fox, comic, Month","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Tony-Jaas-Five-Favorite-Films.jpg","slug":"tony-jaas-five-favorite-films"},{"id":"47508834044095","title":"Scott Glenn’s Five Favorite Films","content":"Five Favorite Filmsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Scott Glenn's Five Favorite Filmsby Grae Drake | March 25, 2015 |  CommentsVeteran actor Scott Glenn has a resume that stretches back more than half a century and includes films as varied as Urban Cowboy, The Right Stuff, The Silence of the Lambs, W., and more recently, HBO’s The Leftovers and Netflix’s upcoming Daredevil series. This week, however, Glenn stars in a thriller called The Barber about a serial killer whose unsolved case haunts a detective’s son for decades. RT got a chance to chat with Glenn, who had this to say about his favorite movies: “I’ll talk off the top of my head, and probably what will happen is an hour later I’ll be talking to my wife or one of my kids and I’ll say, ‘Oh s–t, I missed that one.'” With that in mind, here are Scott Glenn’s Five Favorite Films:Ashes and Diamonds (Andrzej Wajda, 1958)  95%I just really responded to the performance of Zbigniew Cybulski. This is the story of someone who spends their young life in the sewers of Warsaw knowing nothing but war, and then carrying that life without any real reason for living other than continuing on as an urban warrior, falling in love with a bar maid, too late in your life, and essentially discovering lust and passion and maybe the love of his life — in the same day that his life catches up to him and kills him. [Director Andrzej] Wadja is one of my favorite filmmakers. I love Canal and all of the whole trilogy, but Ashes and Diamonds is a film I still think about.The Treasure of the Sierra Madre (John Huston, 1948)  100%I remember one time, Robert Altman asked me what I thought the greatest movie that I had ever seen was, and I said Citizen Kane. Bob correctly said “Oh bulls–t, everybody says [in mocking voice] ‘Citizen Kane, Citizen Kane.’ Do you really feel that?” And I went, “No, not really.” [laughs] He said, “Give me an honest answer,” and I said Treasure of Sierra Madre. He thought for a minute and he said, “I can’t believe you said that. That is, for my money, the most perfect film ever made.” And I said “Why?” He said it was because “There’s not one frame that I would cut from it, or one frame I would add to it.”The African Queen (John Huston, 1951)  98%This is a continuing theme, because it’s the same lead actor [Humphrey Bogart]. For me, this is the best love story ever, ever, ever shot. You could make an exciting, complicated, hot, sexy relationship between a pot-bellied alcoholic and a dried up, skinny spinster… Well, what it really tells you about is Humphrey Bogart and Katherine Hepburn, and what f—ing monsters they were.‘Round Midnight (Bertrand Tavernier, 1986)  100%This is an odd one, and it’s only because of the performance. Dexter Gordon’s performance is maybe the best acting I’ve ever seen. How spontaneous and organic it is, and people say to me, “Yeah, but Gordon isn’t an actor; he’s playing himself,” and I say I don’t care.Last Tango in Paris (Bernardo Bertolucci, 1972)  83%The other actors that I would mention [for similar reasons as Dexter Gordon] — maybe because I’m an actor — is Marlon Brando in this film and David Thewles in Naked. Those are my three.RT: I can see parallels between the three of them. They’re intense.They all get me. The worst thing you could say about art is that it’s predictable. And there’s an unpredictability about the work that Brando, Gordon, and Thewles do. Even through the parts are different, when those guys are working, you’re really not sure what’s coming next and I love that.RT: Not knowing what’s coming next from an actor’s performance reminds me of your role on The Leftovers.That’s almost like I told Damon [Lindelof], who’s become a friend. I said, “Have you been bugging my house, sneaking around?” It’s like he’s channeling me, most of the work I’ve done. Everything that any actor does is themselves. Usually when actors talk about parts that they’re in, they talk about the part that they’re doing like it’s a person separate from them. He’s this way, she’s that way, and I think no, it’s you. It’s not “he” or “she.” It’s buried parts of all of us — but having said that, my kids say the closest to who I really am is [Kevin Garvey] Sr. in The Leftovers. And I find out that HBO has bought the second season, so who knows, I may be back doing it.The Barber opens in limited release this Friday, March 27.","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"Company, Arrowverse, Esquire, Hear, stand-up, spanish, TV, teaser, golden, know, to, blockbusters, Awards","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/SCOTT-GLENN-S-FIVE-FAVORITE-FILMS.jpg","slug":"scott-glenns-five-favorite-films"},{"id":"47508834042046","title":"Nikolaj Coster-Waldau’s Five Favorite Films","content":"Five Favorite Filmsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Nikolaj Coster-Waldau's Five Favorite Filmsby RT Staff | April 7, 2015 |  CommentsIf you’ve been keeping up with HBO’s megahit fantasy drama Game of Thrones, the man pictured above will be immediately recognizable. Nikolaj Coster-Waldau plays Jaime Lannister, the master swordsman who fathered an illegitimate boy-king with his own sister and began a long journey of redemption over the course of four seasons. As the premiere of season five approaches, we spoke with Coster-Waldau about Jaime Lannister’s transition from villain to conflicted man of honor and what his friends thought when he first landed the role. But first, here are his Five Favorite Films:Last Tango in Paris (Bernardo Bertolucci, 1972) 83%I would start with Last Tango in Paris by Bernardo Bertolucci, which I think is amazing. Marlon Brando’s performance is just out of this world. It’s funny; today, I don’t think it would get the same kind of debate because of the sexual nature of some of the scenes, but for me, what was shocking was more the emotional intensity that he brought to the role. There’s a scene he has where he’s sitting at the bedside of his dead wife, and it’s just the most amazing scene of grief. And later, there’s a scene at the end where he’s in this dance hall, and he’s drunk. It’s just a beautiful performance. I think it was just unbelievable.And, of course, there’s also the romantic idea of Last Tango in Paris. I think everyone loves the idea of just him having an affair with a stranger and insisting on staying strangers. It’s a very simple idea, and the beauty of it is that they swap. She wants to know his name in the beginning; he refuses. And then slowly he needs her, he falls for her, and they change roles, and now she doesn’t need him any more.Once Upon a Time in America (Sergio Leone, 1984)  87%Another would be Sergio Leone’s Once Upon a Time in America. I know they finally did a new complete version; they restored it back to the original as close as they could. I think Scorsese was involved with that. I haven’t seen that. I think there’s another 12 minutes added; that’s what I’ve heard. Anyway, that’s been one of my favorite movies forever.I think it’s one of the most important movies I’ve ever seen, because I was like a young teenager when I saw it the first time, and I was so… I mean, I grew up in the countryside in a small village in Denmark, as far from the Lower East Side of New York as you can possibly get, and still I remember just identifying 100 percent with Noodles, the main character. I was feeling everything. I was going through his heartbreak. And I do remember at the time feeling like, “I want to do that. Imagine if I could be in something where someone else could have the experience I just had watching this movie.” So that was a very important film for me. I’ve seen it many times, and it’s just beautiful.RT: When you saw that film, at that time, did you already know that acting was something you wanted to do?Well, I mean, I was young. It was something I wanted to do. I think it was the first time it really struck home how deep you can get, how profound the work of an actor can be if it’s done right, like De Niro did in that movie. How you can actually impact people on an emotional level. I’m a kid in a rural town in Denmark, but I’m 100 percent involved with this New York kid at the turn of the century. It doesn’t make sense, but, of course, it makes sense on a human level, and that is what acting is. It’s digging into “What does this human experience mean?” It was a huge eye-opener and motivator for me.Force Majeure (Ruben Östlund, 2014)  94%There’s a recent film, the Swedish movie Force Majeure. I just thought it was brilliant. I’ve been married for 17 years myself, and I thought the way he captured this relationship, all the tension, I thought it was amazing. And what I also loved about it in a cinematic sense was the way he shot it. The fact that he stays wide; he doesn’t do any coverage in the scenes. It took me a long time to realize that that was what he was doing. The way he blocked the scenes was so exquisite and so organic, if you will. If you go back, suddenly you go, “Oh my god, he’s just letting the scene roll.” There are very few cuts within the scene. It’s beautiful. I thought it was a great movie, and I thought I should put something recent in there. [laughs]RT: It’s a terrific film. I know it was submitted for the Oscars, but it didn’t make the shortlist.No, no it didn’t. They lost out. The director actually made quite a funny YouTube video on the morning of the nominations. If you’ve seen the movie, it made sense, and if you hadn’t seen the movie, you’d think, “What a nutjob.” [laughs] He’s crying like the male character in the movie cries.Play It Again, Sam (Herbert Ross, 1972)  97%I need to get something with Meryl Streep, but there’s so many movies. But then I started thinking about Manhattan, and then I came to Woody Allen. The funniest bit I’ve ever seen in a movie is in Play It Again, Sam. There’s a scene early on where he’s — you know, he’s playing another version of himself, this guy who’s just a mess — and he’s trying to go on dates. Of course, his friends are trying to set him up, and they set him up with this beautiful girl. Basically, they’re going to pick him up at his place, and he’s getting ready, and there’s this scene where he’s got the sports medals he’s been out buying. I mean, it’s the funniest scene; it’s slapstick, you know, physical comedy at its best. It’s a very funny movie.Birdman (Alejandro González Iñárritu, 2014)  91%I’m a fan of Ed Norton. He had quite an amazing double act this year with Birdman and The Grand Budapest Hotel. I remember I read the script of Birdman at one point and I thought it was brilliant, but then when I saw his performance… I mean, it’s wonderful when you’ve read something and when you then see the performance, you go, “There’s no way anyone else could have done that but Ed Norton.” I thought he was very, very good.What I love about Birdman is that most movies — when I see movies and television shows — dramatic things happen, and then people act dramatically, and sometimes you go, “Would you really do that?” Horrible things happen all our lives; we all experience loss and death and trauma. Usually, most people, I think, we just get on with it. We don’t have a whole soliloquy in the middle of something. [laughs] You just deal with life, right? But then when you see Birdman, one of the places where it actually works is in the theater, because people are so dramatic. That’s just the way it is. So it was very true in that movie. Of course, on a technical level, that movie was just insane.RT: There’s a reason I’m asking this, but before you started Game of Thrones, were you familiar with the source material?Coster-Waldau: No, no. I didn’t know they existed. I’d never heard of the books.RT: That sort of answers my next question, but even in preparation for the series, were you aware of the kind of character turnaround that Jaime Lannister was eventually going to have?Coster-Waldau: No, I didn’t, but, that was one of the things that, when I had my first meeting with [executive producers] Carolyn Strauss, Dan Weiss, and David Benioff, they told me about the character. They also told me what would happen the first three seasons, that if we were lucky enough to get three seasons, I would be very happy. I would have a very quiet season two, but then come back in season three. So I knew what was in store, and I thought that arc was really interesting and exciting.I read the script for the pilot and I thought it was brilliant, but I also thought it was impossible to shoot, with so many characters and so many huge setups, that you kind of go, “How the hell are you going to do that?” But of course, now it seems like obviously they’d be able to do it. At the time, it was a different story.RT: You said, “if we were lucky enough to get three seasons.” You guys were never sure this was going to be a hit.Coster-Waldau: Oh, no. No, are you kidding me? I remember telling friends about this show. At first I would say I got this show with HBO and they would be like, “Wow! My god, that’s amazing!” And also, you could tell they were a little envious, but in a good way, like, “Yeah, great for you, you bastard.” And then they would say, “Well, what is it? Is it like Entourage? Is it a gangster story? Is it current? What is it?” And then I’d say, “No no, it’s like a fantasy with dragons and sh-t.” And they would go, “Oh… That’s… Wow, that’s cool. Great, man. So it’s like, what, Highlander or something?” Because that’s the reference you have, right? [laughs]RT: It’s common for actors who have played both protagonists and villains to say that playing the bad guy is more fun. Game of Thrones is full of characters that inhabit sort of a grey area, and Jaime Lannister is probably the best example of that. So is it more satisfying to you to play the version of Jaime Lannister that threw Bran out the window or the version that saved Brienne from the bear?Coster-Waldau: I mean, both. I think it’s the same guy. What’s interesting with this show is that the characters are consistent, and what changes a lot is the audience’s point of view. How much information do we get, and when do we get it? I’ve said this before, but if you told the story of your life, and there must have been one time in your whole life when you did something really horrible, and then you start the movie about you at that exact moment, it might take a while before the audience goes, “Well, hang on, he’s actually a nice guy.” We define people by their actions.What I’ve also loved about Jaime from the beginning is that he’s been smart and he’s also been very honest about everything. Even when he’s been under extreme pressure, when he was captive, he would still refuse to bow down; he would still use his honesty and his wit to target his enemies. Those scenes were the most fun. And all the scenes with Gwendoline Christie as Brienne were brilliant because they had that whole dynamic. He has to get out of this situation, and he only has his words, his mind.RT: Without spoiling anything, can you give us any hint of where Jaime Lannister’s journey will take him this season? [WARNING: SEASON FOUR SPOILERS BELOW]Coster-Waldau: The hint would be that his actions at the end of season four when he set his brother free came with some severe consequences that he didn’t foresee. [laughs] He has to deal with those consequences. Tywin’s gone, the Lannisters are extremely vulnerable, and he has to step up somehow and try to protect his family, so we’ll see if he can do that.Season five of Game of Thrones premieres on HBO on Sunday, April 12.Check out our Game of Thrones Character Guide for a quick refresh before the new season starts!","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"Swim, History, Golden, DGA, CW, game, Reality","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/NIKOLAJ-COSTER-WALDAU-S-FIVE-FAVORITE-FILMS.jpg","slug":"nikolaj-costerwaldaus-five-favorite-films"},{"id":"47508834047169","title":"Method Man’s Five Favorite Films","content":"Five Favorite Filmsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Method Man's Five Favorite FilmsThe Cobbler star really hates shoddy shaky-cam work. A lot.by Ryan Fujitani | March 11, 2015 |  CommentsIf you were listening to hip-hop during its early 1990s “golden era,” you know who the Wu-Tang Clan is, and if you know the Wu-Tang Clan, you know Cliff Smith, aka Method Man. The charismatic Grammy-winning rap artist was the first of the Clan’s emcees to release a solo album, which met with both critical and commercial success, and while he continued to work on music through the years, he also expanded his resume to include a significant amount of film and tv work. Most notably, Mr. Meth played supporting roles on acclaimed HBO series Oz and The Wire, held a recurring role on CSI, and appeared in films like Garden State, The Wackness, and The Sitter.This week, Smith plays a hefty supporting role in Tom McCarthy’s The Cobbler, which stars Adam Sandler as a frumpy cobbler who discovers a magical stitching machine in his basement. RT spoke with the Ticallion Stallion about his Five Favorite Films, and he proceeded to describe exactly how much he hates shaky-cam:Frailty (Bill Paxton, 2002)  74%I love that movie. I love the premise behind it. I love how we all thought that the father was insane, and then it pays off in the end. I don’t want to put spoilers in there for people who haven’t seen the movie. Great freakin’ movie.The bottom line is, any time you put Powers Boothe in a movie… This f—in’ guy, man. I just love Powers Boothe. I don’t care what you put him in. When he was on Deadwood, he killed it; Sin City, whatever. He was the best part of Sin City 2, if you ask me.Just the premise of God instructing this man, and do we really believe that this guy is talking to God? Is it true? Is this some form of abuse with these kids? They even did something from the Bible: “He gave his life so that his son could live,” type of thing. There’s so many levels to that freakin’ movie, man. And [Bill] Paxton did an excellent job. First time directing a movie. Oh, and the “God’s Hand” killer. I love that name, too.The Station Agent (Tom McCarthy, 2003)  94%For obvious reasons, because I was big on Game of Thrones. I had seen The Station Agent about six months ago. “Let me check this out. Let me see what Tom’s about. I just worked with him; let me see what his work’s like.”Yo, I couldn’t take my eyes off the screen. Peter Dinklage, I mean, the way he carries that thing. Michelle Williams, Patricia Clarkson, and Bobby Cannavale? Just that cast alone, man. The way these people interacted together, you could tell this wasn’t words on paper. These were people living these lives, man. And I was like, “That is f—in’ acting right there.” I was pulling out my pad and pen and taking notes, brother. And then the way it ended, I was like, “Yeah. Yeah. Why not end it like that? It’s been real life through this whole thing. Why not end it right there?” I loved that. And that showed me right there that Tom’s not afraid at all.Napoleon Dynamite (Jared Hess, 2004)  72%Loved that movie. When me and Redman were doing Method &amp; Red — because I hadn’t seen it; I’d heard about it because I used to see pictures on the lot — when I used to drive to lunch, I would see the poster. I’m like, “Who the hell is this Napoleon Dynamite kid?” I thought it was some direct-to-DVD thing. You know, I saw someone one day, and I was like, “What is this thing about?” He’s like, “Oh this movie? You’ve never seen it?” Gave me the DVD. So I go home — I mean, the thing sat there for like two weeks. I got bored, watched it. Incredible.Now, I hang around nothing but real, you know, killers, thugs, right? I’m like, “Yo, y’all gotta check this movie out.” And I’ve thrown on movies in the past, because comedy is comedy to me. I don’t care if it’s white, black, whatever, but they usually shoot down a lot of the white comedies because they don’t get that white innuendo, whatever. I threw on this Napoleon Dynamite, they looked like they were gonna shoot me down again. I mean, they still use some of the quotes from the movie to this day. From there, it was cool for me to play Walk Hard and Anchorman and stuff like that, you know? Now it’s cool.And the fact that they didn’t use a curse word. They didn’t use one curse word that whole movie. And there are so many quotes, so many quotes. And the payoff was the dance at the end. Brilliant.Snow on tha Bluff (Damon Russell, 2012) It looked like a documentary. It’s like a found footage movie, but in the hood, and this s–t is incredible, the way he flipped it, because you could tell some of the elements were reenacted, but some of those elements look real as s–t. No lie. And this guy that’s starring in it — his last name is Snow; I don’t remember his first name — he’s not an actor. Not an actor. This is his real life. I’m tellin’ you man, this movie…The Raid (Gareth Evans, 2012)  87%My last one is a “slash.” The Raid / Dredd. Basically the same movie, but both of them were dope. I had to throw a little foreign film up in there, you know, in my taste.RT: If you had to choose between the two, could you?Oh, absolutely. The Raid, because The Raid came out first. I love how it was shot. I think that some of these people that make these comic book movies need to take note. The guy who made Captain America: The Winter Soldier, I salute you, I take my hat off to you, because you get it, sir. We are tired — I’m speaking for all the comic book fans out there, because I’ve been a comic book fan since I was seven years old — our movie dreams are becoming a reality now. We need to demand quality s–t.I’m not talking about story. I’m talking about that f—in’ shaky cam. Why do they do the shaky cam? Get the f—in’ shaky cam the f— outta here unless you know how to use it correctly, okay? When they did it in the Bourne films, they did it correctly. These dudes are losing their minds. I asked. I said, “Why do you guys have the camera so close when the guys are fighting?” “We want the people to experience what it’s like being in the fight.” No! When you’re watching a fight out on the street between two guys, do you want to be up close in the fight? No. You want to stand back and see the whole scenery. You want to actually see the fight. People are jockeying for position in the circle around these dudes so they can get a better look at the fight. They’re not in the middle of it! All you’re gonna see is a fist or an elbow.And I get it. Sometimes the lead actor can’t fight. They don’t know the moves. But they get paid enough that they can go train for a month and learn how to do the ballet moves in order to get in the fight and make it look convincing. Because Scarlett Johansson is killing it, murdering it. Come on! Let’s go! Stop playing with us. We want quality s–t, and y’all giving us half-assed s–t.The Batman movies, I give [Christopher] Nolan credit. He took it from where it left off with Joel Schumacher, the campy nipples-on-the-batsuit s–t and brought it back to what core Batman people love. Now, mind you, Batman is a detective, so, you know, you want to see the detective work. You want to see him in the shadows. But when he’s fighting… That fight between him and Ra’s al Ghul, man, come on! We’re talking about two ninjas. I didn’t see a flip or nothing! Oh my god, are you serious? And that first scene in The Dark Knight when he busts Scarecrow and the criminals? Are you kidding me?We need to demand that these hack-ass camera guys go away, or go to the school of shaky cam and learn how to do it correctly. I know I’m not a director, and I don’t know how those things work, but I’m a fan and I know what I like to see.RT: Is this all coming from the way The Raid was shot, where you get the full view of all the fight scenes, and it’s really visceral, but at the same time, you can see everything that’s happening?Exactly, exactly. But their argument would be that those guys are trained martial artists. Okay, well what about 300? He pulled that camera back slowly; he slowed the action up, even. The audacity, the balls of this guy, to actually slow it up and let us see the fighting, let us see the beauty in the ballet moves of the fight. The nerve of Zack Snyder, the nerve of this f—in’ guy! I love it.The Cobbler opens in limited release on Mar. 13, 2015.Check out Method Man’s complete filmography.","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"golden","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/MethodMan.jpg","slug":"method-mans-five-favorite-films"},{"id":"47508834048194","title":"Adam Carolla’s Five Favorite Films","content":"Five Favorite Filmsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Adam Carolla's Five Favorite Filmsby Matt Atchity | March 6, 2015 |  CommentsWhether it was as the co-host of Comedy Central’s The Man Show, the popular radio program Loveline, or any number of his film and TV appearances, chances are you’ve encountered the wry, acerbic wit of Adam Carolla. The multi-talented comedian, actor, media personality, and podcaster extraordinaire takes another big step this week with his feature directorial debut, Road Hard, about a washed up comedian who attempts to put his life back together. RT Editor-in-Chief Matt Atchity got a chance to speak to Carolla, who gave us his Five Favorite Films:Love and Death (Woody Allen, 1975)  100%One of the best joke-for-joke movies ever put together, and many people haven’t seen it. That’s part of the reason why I’d like to [mention it]. I don’t want to create a list of movies that everyone has seen before; I want you guys to dig it out a little bit. A lot of physical humor, a lot of intellectual humor, just an insane movie for Woody Allen to make. Tons of jokes. People remember Sleeper and they remember Bananas, and Take the Money and Run and stuff like that. Love and Death gets lost a little in the Woody Allen shuffle. He has better films, like one I’ll name in a second, but he does not have a film with more jokes — just jokes — than Love and Death.Crimes and Misdemeanors (Woody Allen, 1989)  94%I love how thought-provoking that film is. I love that there’s a lot of great laughs in it, but there’s a lot of pathos. Alan Alda has never been better at being a douchebag than in this. It’s just got so much humanity, and it’s a comedy but it’s not pushing the comedy, it just is. There’s so much I like about that movie, I just thought it was a great combination. Sometimes Woody gets a little jokey and slapstick and sometimes he gets a little lost up in his head a little bit; this movie had a lot going on. I felt like it explored morality and the human condition.Defending Your Life (Albert Brooks, 1991)  97%I always mention this but no one goes out to see it. I love this idea of courage and that’s what gets you to the next level. I think Meryl Streep — who’s always good — it was so nice to see her as just a person and not a refugee who had to make a choice between her two children or whatever it was. No accent, no anything, just sort of Meryl Streep being sexy and being Meryl Streep. You’re not used to seeing her that way.RT: She’s got that great moment where she says, “And I was a good swimmer.”Yeah. That whole notion, the look on Albert Brooks’ face when they turn the chair around, and, “Let’s just do another session before lunch,” and he had that look like, so beleaguered, “What are we going to look at now?” The scene where they flash back to the classroom and the teacher’s going “How much did we pay for these paints, children?” and half the class says four dollars and the other half says 4.50. “And how much for the brushes? 5 dollars? What does that add up to?” And they both say in unison, “9.50 and 9 dollars,” and I don’t know why… It’s just a little weird moment that Albert Brooks probably just did for himself but it cracks me up every time.Wedding Crashers (David Dobkin, 2005)  76%Vince Vaughn made me laugh like all the way through this film. There’s plenty of dialogue, but the part where he’s sitting at the dinner table and he’s getting the rub-and-tug under table is just… He’s doing everything with his face, like, he’s not really saying anything. What’s coming out of him is awesome, pardon the pun. Will Ferrell is great too, but just watch Vince Vaughn in that entire movie where he gets strapped down to the bed and they want to play tummy sticks and stuff. “No, no tummy sticks.” The scene where he goes into the kitchen and he’s angry, and he’s like “We’re not talking,” but he’s loading up on carbs and stuff and announces he’s going to “sit over here,” dumping syrup on top of everything. It’s slapsticky and over the top, but there’s room on everyone’s queue for something big that has celebrities in it but a great score, and it looked great, they’re taking the boat out, there’s big weddings. It’s a big movie, but it didn’t feel big and overpowering; it felt intimate. There was a direction, there was a sense, and they went. And they didn’t deviate, and it also has such a sweetness and lessons learned and all that kind of stuff.Saving Private Ryan (Steven Spielberg, 1998)  93%The opening 18 minutes of that thing, I mean, when the door dropped on the Higgins craft and it all of a sudden was World War Two in color, seeing blood, seeing guys walking around looking for their arm that had been blown off. Weird poignant scenes where the medic was like stopping the bleeding and the bullet would just go right through the guy’s head. Also the story was strong too; there’s a bunch of guys named Ryan spread out all over the place and they think they’re finding him, and his guys kind of going, “Why are we killing ourselves trying to save one guy, and we’ve lost two or three of our own?” That thing that would never go on today. And all the stops along the way, there’s no way an hour into that movie I went, “Nah, I don’t care if they find him or not, I’m moving on.”RT: It’s the hope.The part at the end where the old guy sort of turns to his wife and says, “Tell me I’ve lived a good life” — I’m tearing up now — “Tell me this was worth it.” Soup to nuts, that one was just a great movie. In a way it’s almost too Hollywood-y to get on people’s lists, but I don’t care. That was a fucking good movie.Road Hard opens in limited release on Mar. 6, 2015.Listen below to hear Carolla talk about his film on this week’s episode of the Rotten Tomatoes Podcast:","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"Studios","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Adam-Carolla-s-five-favorite-films.jpg","slug":"adam-carollas-five-favorite-films"},{"id":"47508834051268","title":"The Backstreet Boys’ Five Favorite Films","content":"Five Favorite Filmsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})The Backstreet Boys' Five Favorite Filmsby Grae Drake | February 3, 2015 |  CommentsBack in the late 1990s and early 2000s, you couldn’t go anywhere without hearing a Backstreet Boys song gently thumping in the background, whether it was “Quit Playing Games (with My Heart)” at the mall or “As Long As You Love Me” at the local burger joint. They helped usher in a wave of boy-band jams that would permeate the airwaves for a decade, and they continue performing to this day. They’re also the subject of a new documentary by Stephen Kijak (pictured above with the Boys) called Backstreet Boys: Show ‘Em What You’re Made Of that explores their rise to stardom, leading up to their 20th anniversary relaunch. Grae Drake got the opportunity to chat with them about their Five Favorite Films, but since five films each for every member would be a bit overwhelming, we asked Nick, AJ, Howie, Brian and Kevin to name just one. It’s okay, you can admit it: You want it that way. So read on for the Backstreet Boys’ Five Favorite Films:Jaws (Steven Spielberg, 1975)  98%Nick Carter: I have watched this movie — I can’t even tell you [how many times]. Jaws. It’s typical, but Roy Scheider, Richard Dreyfuss, Steven Spielberg, I mean, it’s one of his first films, and the acting is superb. You put these guys on a boat and you have to sell this movie for 30 minutes. It’s some of the best monologues you’ll ever get.RT: How scared did it make you to go in the water?Completely terrified, and I’m a SCUBA diver and I love the ocean. It gives me nightmares.Dirty Rotten Scoundrels (Frank Oz, 1988)  88%AJ McLean: My all-time favorite, and it’s a remake of, I believe, a French film. With Steve Martin and Michael Caine, it’s phenomenal. Probably my favorite highlight is when Steve Martin is playing the slightly stupid little nephew, and he’s at the dinner table and he asks if he can use the restroom and they say yes, and he just waits… “Thank you.” That’s the best part; it’s so good. It’s my all time favorite. It’s so good.The Outsiders (Francis Ford Coppola, 1983)  63%RT: “Stay gold, Ponyboy.”Howie Dorough: “Do it for Johnny.” It’s one of those movies where you can definitely see why it started the careers of so many actors, and why they became superstars. Patrick Swayze, Tom Cruise, Ralph Macchio, Matt Dillon, it’s a lot of great actors all in one movie.It’s a Wonderful Life (Frank Capra, 1946)  94%Brian Littrell: I’m going to go soft on you for this one. It was a flop back then. It’s a story of inspiration, the guy that gives up everything to rebuild his community and share his life and his work, and it is returned to him in the end, and his family is stronger for it.RT: Does it make you cry?Yes, makes me cry every time. But if it’s not that [making me cry] it’s Hoosiers or Rudy.Weird Science (John Hughes, 1985)  57%Kevin Richardson: I was going to go all deep on you, but instead I’ll keep it light and say Weird Science. It just makes me laugh to this day. Me and my best friend in high school, we knew all the lines, and we’d get in trouble in geometry for sitting in the back of the class and just laughing our asses off. Also… Kelly LeBrock.Backstreet Boys: Show ‘Em What You’re Made Of is currently in theaters in limited release.","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"movies, YA, MCU, Arrangement, Music, HBO","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/The-Backstreet-Boys-five-favorite-films.jpg","slug":"the-backstreet-boys-five-favorite-films"},{"id":"47508834029751","title":"William Sadler’s Five Favorite Films","content":"Five Favorite Filmsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})William Sadler's Five Favorite Filmsby Grae Drake | June 9, 2015 |  CommentsWhen I picked up the phone and heard William Sadler‘s voice on the other end of the line, I got hit with flashbacks to some of his characters from numerous films on other people’s Five Favorite Films lists, like Die Hard 2, Bill &amp; Ted’s Bogus Journey, The Green Mile, Kinsey, and Iron Man 3. It seemed appropriate that we begin the conversation by him asking if he was allowed to pick one of his films to be on his list. I told him absolutely, because of the movies he’s been in. He expressed gratitude for being in the particular film that seems to “grow in stature” over time, but ultimately decided to leave The Shawshank Redemption off the list and go with these instead.The Verdict (Sidney Lumet, 1982)  88%Paul Newman, Milo O’Shea, and James Mason. I met Paul Newman a couple of times — he saw me in two of the three Broadway shows that I’ve done in New York. He came backstage and said how much he loved the shows, and I’ve just been a fan of his work forever. This [pick] was a toss up between this and Cool Hand Luke, another monster Paul Newman movie. There was something wonderful about his lost soul that he found in The Verdict. The [characters are] on opposite ends of the scale. Luke can’t be broken, apparently. He’s got that grin and that spirit. In The Verdict he’s already broken, he’s hanging on by a thread and hoping he can pull this out. Wonderful actor, underrated.Singin’ in the Rain (Stanley Donen, Gene Kelly, 1952)  100%Again, toss up between The Wizard of Oz and Singin’ in the Rain. This one is perfect. Not a frame is off. There’s not a weak character, there’s not a weak moment, it’s just a delight all the way through. There’s Donald O’Connor doing Make ‘Em Laugh. They turned him loose and he just went. [And there’s] that wonderful scene where they’re talking to the voice coach. They make it look so easy and effortless — and if you’ve ever danced on stage, if you’ve ever tried tap dancing and singing at the same time, there is nothing easy about it. It is just astonishing. “Whaddya think, I’m dumb or something?” Oh, Jean Hagen.Unforgiven (Clint Eastwood, 1992)  96%With my friend Morgan [Freeman]. It’s so funny, these movies, the ones that I’m pulling out, they all have the same element. They feel perfect. I can’t find a false note, I can’t find a scene or a moment that you could lose and the movie would still be as good. There’s not a wasted breath. I think that Unforgiven is some of Clint Eastwood’s best work. I love westerns — I grew up on them — watching them and playing them around the barn in Buffalo. This is a different western, again, this is a broken guy who’s hanging on by his fingernails. He’s been a dirt farmer, he’s lost his wife, this is his last shot. That’s funny, it’s a little like The Verdict in that respect. None of it is pretty. It’s not slick, it’s not the balletic gunfighting that you see in some movies. It’s ugly and awkward and it’s not easy to kill a man. That was one of the themes that just stuck out like a sore thumb. This is not an easy thing to do, kill a man. For all the glamour and all the romance of the old west and the gunfights and so on, this is awful work, guns. They brought that to life. Gene Hackman can do no wrong. He’s sort of an acting god.The Godfather (Francis Ford Coppola, 1972)  97%I saw it when I was in college and I went back and saw it again, and then I went back and saw it again. It has all my favorite actors in it. Big as life, absolutely in their top form. It doesn’t get any better than that anywhere. I saw them up on the screen and I thought “I want to do that, that’s what I want to do.” That had a big impact on me when I was a kid, coming up. We learn these movies like old friends, they’re like songs that when you hear them enough you know every note and moment, you know when he’s going to look over and you expect the lines, you’re doing them along with the film. Brilliant, brilliant piece of filmmaking. On everybody’s part. Robert Duvall. Spectacular stuff — [Duvall has] forgotten more about acting than most of us will ever learn.The African Queen (John Huston, 1951)  98%A romance between a beat up, tired, old, raggedy-ass drunkard hanging on by a thread and one last hurrah. There’s a theme in the film that I love. To see the two of them [Humphrey Bogart and Kathryn Hepburn], the chemistry was so magical. It was so easy and fun. They were having so much fun. Clearly. It was like watching a tennis match between two of the best players of all time. Just effortless. And they tell this phenomenal story. I’m a sucker for those. [Hepburn] had a similar chemistry with lots of people, with Spencer Tracy in the Pat and Mike film, it was just sparkle and fun. Going back and forth between her and Bogie and they let Bogie play this guy, this stumbling bumbling [does impression “Well, Ma’am”] which was great, he just went there. John Huston did a brilliant job with that thing.Freedom is in theaters, on VOD, and iTunes on June 5th.","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"emmy","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/William-Sadlers-Five-Favorite-Films.jpg","slug":"william-sadlers-five-favorite-films"},{"id":"47508835674310","title":"Martin Starr’s Five Favorite Films","content":"Five Favorite Filmsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Martin Starr's Five Favorite Filmsby Grae Drake | January 29, 2015 |  CommentsThough perhaps not as immediately recognizable as his Freaks and Geeks co-stars Seth Rogen or James Franco, Martin Starr has made a career out of playing understated supporting characters who linger in the background, only to jump in and steal a scene with his deadpan delivery. Since that breakout role on the beloved Paul Feig-Judd Apatow sitcom, Starr has been a comedy staple on film and television, with major roles in Starz’s Party Down and HBO’s Silicon Valley, supporting turns in Knocked Up and Adventureland, and guest spots on Community, New Girl, and Drunk History.Starr is capable of more than just dry comedy, though, and this week, he takes the lead in Amira &amp; Sam, a romantic drama about an army vet adjusting to life back home who develops a friendship — and more — with a young Iraqi woman. We got the opportunity to chat with Starr, and he gave us his Five Favorite Films, which helped shed some light on what draws him to the types of characters he likes to play. Read on for his list.&nbsp;The Big Lebowski (Joel Coen, Ethan Coen, 1998; 80% Tomatometer)Easily The Big Lebowski is one of them — it’s a little cliche, but it’s a great movie. Sam Elliot’s voice: warm and inviting. From square one, you’ve got an inviting narrator, which is hard to find these days. If nothing else, [Jeff] Bridges is one of the most incredible performers, and I never would have assumed that he had similarities to that character. I hadn’t seen anything like that that he had done up until that point, and it feels like the more I get to know him — not personally, but through his work and since Lebowski until now — he has a very Buddhist, easygoing, “everybody needs to chill out” vibe to him that’s awesome, and it totally reinforces my love of the movie. John Goodman is always great, but I feel like he really got to show his aggressive side — he’s so good. And Buscemi. And the nihilists. I’m not good at explaining movies.Groundhog Day (Harold Ramis, 1993; 97% Tomatometer)I was talking about this the other day. We were talking about best romantic comedies, and what falls into that category. The love story that develops between Andie MacDowell and Bill Murray is incredible. How they really do fall in love makes it a rom-com at its heart. Even though it’s this really high concept movie, it’s such a beautiful little love story at the same time. So good.Whiplash (Damien Chazelle, 2014; 95% Tomatometer)Now for a more contemporary movie. What a phenomenal third act. What a triumphant moment at the end. There’s so much build up — some movies just don’t pay off the way they should. The performances were beyond incredible, but to have that triumphant moment be as strong as it really was, you just don’t find it. And so simple too. The story didn’t have to be about explosions and car crashes to really hit as hard as it did. It didn’t need the Hollywood spin on it — not that that story could have ever been told with a Hollywood spin on it — but that this simple story about this relationship could have as big an impact as anything I’ve seen is incredible. JK Simmons is so good; he doesn’t have any tells, so you only get clues to where it’s going. But he’s so good at playing that asshole.Goodfellas (Martin Scorcese, 1990; 96% Tomatometer)Goodfellas, because Kevin Corrigan is in it. He’s phenomenal. I met him before I had seen Goodfellas, and so afterward I think we were at a bar at some point and it was just playing. It was funny to see him 15 years earlier onscreen, and then right there standing next to me. Also, gangsters are cool. I am honestly picking this one because of Kevin Corrigan. It’s simple but the complexity in the others make up for it, right?Harold And Maude (Hal Ashby, 1971; 86% Tomatometer)This is not just because the movie has an ampersand in it like Amira &amp; Sam. Even still, an off-color romantic comedy — it’s a comedy, but off-color because of the older woman and a younger man. It’s still something that movie artists don’t touch on and it’s not an impossible scenario. It’s one of those things that is difficult to get right, and Hal Ashby told such an amazing story of friendship and caring and love and fun and life.Between this choice and Groundhog Day, I can see a parallel to your work. Your characters are comedically dark, but there’s a sweetness to them somewhere, and they always go down a path that I wasn’t expecting.That’s what life is. That’s why I really connect with them. It doesn’t err on one side or the other; it’s not all the dramatic “woe is me” side, nor does it err on a broad “this doesn’t belong in reality” side of things. There’s always a humanity to the decisions that are made and the characters to connect to.There’s humanity in them.Hopefully if I’ve succeeded in my job I allow an audience to connect to my characters in the same way I connected to these.Amira &amp; Sam opens Jan. 30, 2015, in limited release and Vimeo On Demand.","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"Music, SXSW","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Martin-Starr-s-Five-Favorite-Films.jpg","slug":"martin-starrs-five-favorite-films"},{"id":"47508835680456","title":"Hugh Bonneville’s Five Favorite Films","content":"Five Favorite Filmsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Hugh Bonneville's Five Favorite Filmsby Tim Ryan | January 12, 2015 |  CommentsOrthodox and fond of ceremony but flexible and fundamentally decent, Robert Crawley, Earl of Grantham isn’t just the patriarch of Downton Abbey — he’s also arguably the most representative embodiment of the tug of war between tradition and modernity that undergirds the show. And the role has elevated Hugh Bonneville from BBC supporting player to movie star. In Paddington, Bonneville stars as Henry Brown, who’s less enthusiastic about having a bear as a tenant than his family is. In an interview with RT, Bonneville shared his favorite films and discussed the Brits’ obsession with Paddington, the books’ political subtext, and why he’s both delighted and mystified by Downton Abbey‘s international appeal.Being There(Hal Ashby, 1979) 95%I think it’s because it is about a truly simple character in a truly extraordinary situation, and the way that simplicity can be misconstrued as genius and vice versa. I just think it’s a beautiful, beautiful performance [from Peter Sellers]. I think it’s his finest performance. But apart from that… well, I adore Shirley MacLaine in it. I think it’s beautifully cast, [and] I think it’s richly evocative as a gentle satire on the way that political gurus can function. I just think it’s enchanting, and I think it’s an often neglected film. And I can’t find it on DVD or download and I’m really fed up with that.It’s a Wonderful Life(Frank Capra, 1946) 94%I change my selection every six months depending on my mood, and I’m in a Christmas mood. I just think it’s a really great piece of cinema and a great piece of storytelling and a sublime performance at the heart of it, and reminds us all about our shared humanity.My Life as a Dog(Lasse Hallstrom, 1985) 100%Another film that always floats around in my top five would be a film by Lasse Hallstrom called My Life as a Dog, which is not such a well known film but it was probably the one that brought him most to prominence. It’s a coming-of-age story, really, of a young boy with a very sick mum, you know, trying to find their way in the world, a young child finding their own way in the world, and seeing the exploration of space as a metaphor for their own dreams and adventures. I just think it’s a very poignant and evocative film that’s stayed with me for many years.Paddington(Paul King, 2015) 97%I think I’m going to really nail my colors to the mast and say a movie called Paddington, which is yet to come out. I saw it for the first time the other day, and even though I am in it, I do think it is a glorious film. I’m incredibly proud to be part of it, and I think it’s a film that families will watch, I hope, for generations to come and enjoy it in the same way that I [do].Pulp Fiction(Quentin Tarantino, 1994) 92%RT: Being There is about someone who’s in the middle of all these things happening beyond his control. It’s a Wonderful Life is about the general decency of human beings. My Life as a Dog is about a relationship between kids and an animal. It seems that your favorites share some of the same themes as Paddington.Well, maybe that’s why David Heyman and Paul King cast me in Paddington, I don’t know [laughs]. You’ll be surprised by my fifth one, then. OK, try and find the link with this: Pulp Fiction. I think that’s the exception that proves the rule. I think it was great, it was such a breath of fresh air. That same year, I remember, I was completely enamored by two films: The Lion King and Pulp Fiction, so you couldn’t get more extreme than those two. They both have death in them, I suppose. But Pulp Fiction was such a great breath of fresh air when it came out, and I think it still remains such a cool and fantastic piece of the cinema. Obviously it was the second film after Reservoir Dogs that brought Tarantino into the fold, but I think it’s a gloriously slick and entertaining piece of movie-making, structurally and cinematically, with these great, legendary performances that were instantly loved, and instantly classic and endlessly imitated. The number of people I’ve seen doing Christopher Walken impressions — or Bruce Willis impressions from that movie — or indeed Samuel L Jackson… It’s sort of a great cinematic feat and [it’s filled with] dark, dark humor.&nbsp;RT: I remember enjoying Paddington as a little kid, but as an American, it’s been interesting reading the reviews coming out of the UK. A lot of the critics sound a lot more possessive over the character, and the tone of the reviews is, “Oh, don’t worry, they did it right, they did a good job with it,” you know? It seems that for a children’s film, the stakes for getting it right were pretty high.Hugh Bonneville: Well, I think you shouldn’t underestimate the power of this character in the UK psyche, the consciousness of the British people, because Paddington, as a character, is as much part of British life as Buckingham Palace, really. It’s become that central a part of our collective imagination. There’s even a statue to him on Paddington railway station. So yeah, there was a great sense of responsibility from the filmmakers to get it right, and a great sense of skepticism from a great many commentators that this would be a travesty of Michael Bond’s original creation. But to have the author himself say, after the first screening, “I came, I saw, I was conquered,” is a good testament. It of course has taken on a different form, moving from one form of storytelling to another, from the genre of a short story to the big screen with its 90-minute arc and its big 70-foot canvas. There are different needs for a movie, and I think this is what people felt wasn’t going to sustain the character. I think, as you’ve alluded to, the reaction has been extremely positive and there’s an awful lot of love for this incarnation of the beloved bear from Peru.RT: Here at Rotten Tomatoes, we recently did a big list of the best-reviewed fantasy films of all time, and I was going back and reading some of the contemporaneous reviews of Disney’s 1950 version of Alice in Wonderland. There were howls of dissent from British critics at the time that it was an Americanization of a very British story. How do you take something that’s quintessentially “British” and make it accessible to a global audience?Bonneville: That’s the challenge, and that here is the danger that they will fail. But when you have someone like David Heyman, who of course was behind bringing Harry Potter from the page to the screen with such care and attention to detail and with the approval and endorsement of the author, then I think, while there is always a risk, you sort of felt you were in relatively safe hands. If anyone was going to get it right, it would be him, along with the imagination of Paul King as director/writer, who again, was very protective of the beloved bear. You sort of feel you’re on a hiding to nothing, but golly, they stuck with it and they absolutely stayed true to the spirit of the story. I think one of the key things is they haven’t diluted it for the international market. They absolutely wanted to bring to life Michael Bond’s bear onto the big screen. First and foremost, that was the intention. That was the biggest risk and the biggest payoff, I suppose. The biggest gamble.RT: When you’re a little kid reading this stuff you’re like , “Ooh it’s a funny bear,” but there’s an undercurrent about acceptance for outsiders that runs through the Paddington stories. At a time in the United States and in England when there are ongoing debates about immigration and nationalism, do you see this film having any impact of that on younger viewers?Bonneville: I think any film that asks its audience a degree of tolerance and acceptance of those less fortunate than themselves isn’t a bad thing from whatever culture you’re in or from whatever part of any political spectrum. I think we should bear in mind that Michael Bond created this story when the image of young people on the platforms of railway stations across Britain with gas masks around their necks was a very strong, recent memory. When also the Windrush immigrants [from the West Indies] were first settling in West London, bringing a new sense of multicultural inhabitance in that part of the UK. When also you’ve got the character of Mr. Gruber who talks about having to travel across Europe because there was trouble in his own country and he had to flee — It doesn’t take a lot for the grownups to know what he’s talking about. So you’ve got [instances] throughout the film, as you say, of displaced people, displaced strangers in a strange land looking for a home, and I think if there is any message it is about accepting those who reach out a hand for help.RT: Shifting gears just slightly, I want to tell you that I am a red-blooded all-American male who likes American football, loud music, and violent video games. And I love Downton Abbey. [Bonneville laughes] I’ve heard cast members talk about how you’re still a bit gobsmacked about how it’s taken on a life of its own beyond the UK. Do you have any sense of why it’s had such broad appeal, especially in America?Bonneville: I think I’m the least qualified person to be able to answer that, because I’ve always likened it to being a bit like in the middle of the eye of a hurricane. You’re not aware that there’s carnage that’s going on around you, only a few feet or miles away, because you’re just getting on with it being in the middle of it. It took me a while to realize quite the impact it was having. I suppose that image isn’t quite the right one to draw of it, the cause of death and destruction, but the effect that it’s having, nevertheless, has been something of a whirlwind and it’s taken me a while to realize that, I suppose. You know, by now, traveling in many countries around the world, seeing the reaction is pretty much the same in each country. These people come over and say hi, and it’s usually because of the Downton Abbey rather than some obscure thing I did in 1978. And it’s an endlessly mystifying — that’s not to be derogatory of the show — I adore the show and always have done — but it’s a mystery to us why it has touched a chord so strongly around the world, and a delightful one, and long may it remain a delightful mystery, because I think if you over think it, then the magic disappears. It’s a happy accident.It’s a combination, as you say, of these rich characters that people want to spend time with, and a writer [Downton Abbey creator Julian Fellowes] that is fueled with great stories who keeps the pace up. He referred in the past to Coronation Street, which is a British soap, and The West Wing being two great shows he adores. So I think if you put those factors together, plus a series of departments that are working to the top of their game, and the great location, then it’s one of those happy accidents that happens once in a career, really. Once a generation, you get a show that people latch onto and care about to this extent. There are others, I think we are genuinely going to — have been in the last 10-15 years — been going through a sort of golden age of long-form drama on TV and it’s very exciting. The business model is being proved to work. That If you build it, they will come. If you invest in good drama and take risks in drama and write these big shows, then people will come and watch them, be it Game of Thrones, or Breaking Bad, or Downton Abbey, and it’s a wonderful world in which those three shows can be mentioned in the same sentence.RT: I think it might partially lie in the fact that these characters seem to be people living in the 1920s, who are actually reacting to the period mores and the changes around them, as opposed to winking to a contemporary audience.Bonneville: There may be something in that. I mean, we’ve never claimed to be some sort of historical document or, indeed, trying to tell some sort of history lesson any more than the Tudors was trying to or inspired by these engaging relationship dramas that happen to be set in a particular period with the odd reference to something that’s going on in the real world outside. The fact is that it has seemed to have turned a lot of people onto the fashions of that era, to re-explore the fashions of the Edwardian era and onwards, or indeed just consider for the history of that time. And it’s probably spawned in the same way that films like Gladiator spawned whole other sword-and-sandals programs for 10 years. I think we’ve already generated some interest in that era, from the turn of the century and onward both in Britain and America. So I don’t know; ultimately it’s a piece of telly. People can write essays about it or do their PhD on the relationship between Mary and a fan, or indeed a corset. But I think for the most part it’s just entertaining Sunday night telly.RT: Given the popularity of the show, and the many places you’ve traveled to promote it, do you sometimes feel like Paddington — a stranger in a strange land?Bonneville: Yeah, of course, of course. I mean, it is a strange world when you’re off doing publicity on either show that you’re swept into a world of interviews and strange hotels, strange environment. Yeah, I think all of us has felt like a stranger is a strange land at some point in our lives, and certainly doing press tours accentuates that.RT: Anything else you’d like to say about Paddington?Bonneville: Only that it’s adorable and I hope it’s going to be around for a long time to come.Paddington opens in wide release on Jan. 16, 2015.","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"green, Cartoon, dramedy, PaleyFest","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Hugh-Bonnevilles-Five-Favorite-Films.jpg","slug":"hugh-bonnevilles-five-favorite-films"},{"id":"47508835706068","title":"Simon Pegg’s Five Favorite Films","content":"Five Favorite Filmsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Simon Pegg's Five Favorite Filmsby Grae Drake | September 19, 2014 |  CommentsSimon Pegg, an actor who I often identify with fun and freewheeling characters like Shaun in Shaun of the Dead or Scotty in the new Star Trek films, and now the main character in Hector and the Search For Happiness, doles out his list exactly how I would expect.“I sort of thought I’d wing it. I find that if you start thinking about these things, you end up in a terrible mire of indecision, so I’m just going to try to go off the top of my head with it. There’s no particular order because there will be discriminatory glitches. So here they are.”Dawn of the Dead (George Romero, 1979; 95% Tomatometer)This was a mythic, elusive film because it was banned from the UK. It took me a long time to track it down, but I heard many a story about it — helicopter decapitation and the guy with the screwdriver in his ear. That stuff was just so fascinating to me as I grew up, and when I finally saw it, it did not disappoint. It obviously eventually led to me making a film with a similar title.How did you find it?I found it on VHS video in a shop in Bristol in the UK, and I sat in my university viewing room and put it on and it just was everything I wanted it to be. I love it as a piece of cinema — I think it’s very, very funny, and it is a great horror film. But Romero was always a maverick and had the surviving members of the team at the end of the film are a black guy and a woman. In 1978, it was years later — 10, 12 years later, Ridley Scott was being celebrated for that in Alien, when Romero had been daring enough to do that 10, 12 years before. It was always the white male who was the survivor who would take revenge for the death of his black partner or wife who would have been killed along the way — and he did that in 1968 in Night of the Living Dead as well, as a big civil rights metaphor. So I really love that movie for its sort of shlock horror and also for being a clever, smart political statement.Raising Arizona (Joel and Ethan Coen, 1987; 90% Tomatometer)I remember seeing that film and having a sort of epiphany in terms of realizing that comedy didn’t have to just be about writing and performance, it could be about the way that the camera moved. I loved the way that that film is structurally really poetic and visually inventive in a wacky and delightful way. I think that Edgar Wright cites that as a favorite film of his, and I think it’s one of the films we bonded over as youngsters before we started making films together. You can see a lot of that film in our films, in the way that they rhymed scenes and they had recurring motifs and set ups and payoffs which were quite delightful to decipher. For me as a fan of the Coen brothers, even as I’m loving their more sober, serious stuff later on, I do feel that one is my favorite.Let’s get you in a Coen bros. movie.I’d love to work with the Coens; I think they’re extraordinary. There are certain directors that retain vision — these days there are a lot of directors that make films for studios, but there are certain directors and directing teams which maintain a kind of way of making films which mark them out. I’m thinking of like the Coens and Wes Anderson and Paul Thomas Anderson. It’s good that those people exist, because directorial vision is important, I think.Annie Hall (Woody Allen, 1977; 98% Tomatometer)I just think it’s the most perfect romantic comedy ever made. I love its honesty and its kind of slightly bleak kind of view of relationships which I think is daring and real, but at the same time it’s not cynical about relationships. It celebrates when relationships can be great, and the joy of meeting someone. It is romantic, but it’s not romanticized.I love the scene with Christopher Walken talking about going over the cliff.Hilarious. There’s also moments of such subtlety when you have the scene with Annie and Alvy and the lobsters, and then later he’s doing it again with someone else who just doesn’t get it like she does. It just serves to completely remind you of just what a perfect catch she was at that point, if you pardon the lobster-based metaphor. She is luminous in that movie. Diane Keaton is so great, so watchable, it’s one of the truly great female comedic performances I think ever. It’s a film that I can return to again and again. It’s really inventive — [Woody Allen] uses lots of different devices like narration and speaking to the camera and animation — it’s quite an avant garde film in some respects, but it is the template by which all romantic comedies should be measured.Taxi Driver (Martin Scorsese, 1976; 98% Tomatometer)In terms of performances, I still watch that film and am stunned by Robert De Niro. It’s such a carefully studied performance and he’s extraordinary in that movie. I watch it just for the glee, even though it’s quite a dark film — I watch it and I love him in that film, it’s just like watching someone do an amazing guitar solo. But I also love Scorsese’s sort of sleight of hand in that movie; the way that the story is told, every performance in the film from Peter Boyle and Cybill Shepherd, and everyone in between –Scorcese himself in that awful, cokey, monstrous revenger in the back of that car. It’s like watching a very slow car crash and there is great value in that, I think.It’s interesting to go back and see scenes that have permeated society, like him talking in the mirror.There’s a reason why it’s been parodied and recreated, because it’s utterly, utterly affecting and it’s unforgettable. And the brilliant ending as well, in a film which is so gloomy and yet has this strange kind of happy ending, which you don’t expect, it’s a brilliant switcharoo. And that weird moment of discombobulation in the mirror, I watched that and think “What is he saying, and is it what I think he’s saying?” I love a film which stays with you, and that film has never left me since I first saw it.Star Wars:Episode V – The Empire Strikes Back (Irvin Kershner, 1980; 96% Tomatometer)I would probably have to go with the first one because it shaped my view of cinema as a kid, and as pure entertainment has a real place in cinema. It is one of the most seismic and significant events in recent cinema history — some might say detrimental — but it certainly led to a culture of whiz-bang cinema which we see now, but it meant so much to me as a kid, and Empire is the best of the first three. It also had that slightly weird edgy bleak sheer sort of joy of the first; suddenly everything went to s*** in the most spectacular way and it was kind of cool. I remember coming away from it so thrilled that they all got really beaten up. It’s widely regarded as the best of the three and it would be too obvious to say Star Wars.We won’t have the Empire vs. Jedi argument. And for the record, I was glad to see on your Twitter feed that you met Bill Murray.It was awesome. I was really cool as well. I just sort of went, “Hey Bill, what’s up?” and then ran away saying, “Woo hoo!” [laughs]Hector and the Search for Happiness opens today in limited release.Click here for more Five Favorite Films.","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"drama, Cannes, CW, It, Star, Guide, Dead, Disney, news, Alien, drama, australia","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Simon-Peggs-Five-Favorite-Films.jpg","slug":"simon-pegg-five-favorite-films"},{"id":"47508835699921","title":"Corey Stoll’s Five Favorite Films","content":"Five Favorite Filmsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Corey Stoll's Five Favorite Filmsby RT Staff | October 15, 2014 |  CommentsThough he’s been acting in film and television for a decade, Corey Stoll‘s most recognizable roles have come all in a flurry over the past few years. Fans of the short-lived Law &amp; Order: LA knew him as Detective TJ Jaruszalski, but more recently, Stoll impressed as Pennsylvania congressman Peter Russo in Netflix’s acclaimed political drama House of Cards, which earned him a Golden Globe nomination. If you missed both of those shows, you may have caught him on FX’s recent hit The Strain, in HBO’s Emmy-winning original film The Normal Heart, or in a brief appearance on the season four premiere of Showtime’s Homeland.But Stoll’s talent isn’t limited to the small screen; his feature film appearances include the Angelina Jolie actioner Salt, Woody Allen’s Midnight in Paris, and the Liam Neeson thriller Non-Stop, among others. Currently, he stars alongside Reese Witherspoon in The Good Lie, a based-on-true-events film about a woman who helps four Sudanese refugees adjust to life after they win an opportunity to relocate to the US. Stoll took some time out of his schedule to give us his Five Favorite Films:Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb (Stanley Kubrick, 1964; 100% Tomatometer)No movie is funnier or more scary. Kubrick somehow ramps up both the very real stakes and the increasingly weird humor throughout the movie. Most of the praise usually lands on Peter Sellers’s multiple performances, but don’t sleep on George c. Scott. The man who played the ultimate military authority in Patton plays the ultimate military buffoon. Fun fact: this movie has the longest title in film history.Do the Right Thing (Spike Lee, 1989; 96% Tomatometer)This was the first movie where I was aware of what a director did. There’s a scene near the climax where the camera zooms in and rotates 45 degrees into an extreme Dutch angle close-up on Giancarlo Esposito’s face. “Someone made that decision!” I thought. I also love the fact that it was our last president and irst lady’s first date.Dead Man Walking (Tim Robbins, 1995; 95% Tomatometer)Sean Penn’s performance is brutally raw. He starts off so cocky and impenetrable and hateful. Slowly he strips away his armor until he’s left with nothing but love. Some actors can give a perfectly calibrated performance and some can strip themselves bare — Penn does both.Goodfellas (Martin Scorsese, 1990; 96% Tomatometer)Kinetic, profane, and operatic. This movie has the most simply badass shot in motion picture history: Robert De Niro sitting at a bar sucking down a cigarette as the camera slowly pushes in with “Sunshine of Your Love” on the soundtrack.Annie Hall (Woody Allen, 1977; 98% Tomatometer)I find a lot of comedy from this period to be dated, but I never feel that way about Annie Hall. Somehow even references to psychoanalysis and Marshall McLuhan feel vital. And you’ve got to love Paul Simon as the most unlikely lothario in film history.The Good Lie is currently in theaters.","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"show, Marvel, San, Ghostbusters, IFC, crime, movie","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Corey-Stolls-Five-Favorite-Films.jpg","slug":"corey-stolls-five-favorite-films"},{"id":"47508835688650","title":"Five Favorite Films with Ethan Embry","content":"Five Favorite Filmsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Five Favorite Films with Ethan Embryby Kerr Lordygan | December 3, 2014 |  CommentsEthan Embry began his career at the age of 13, co-starring with Ed O’Neill in the 1991 John Hughes film, Dutch. Since then, he has shifted into an accomplished film and TV actor through his work in White Squall, the comedy cult favorite Empire Records, and ABC’s Once Upon a Time. Now, following the twisted Cheap Thrills, Embry appears in the werewolf horror flick, Late Phases. So we chatted with him about his favorite movies, the similarities between horror and comedy, and why he’s reluctant to watch his own films.&nbsp;Midnight Express (Alan Parker, 1978; 95% Tomatometer)No matter how much my vibe changes I think this one probably stays on [the list] consistently and that’s Midnight Express. That one is always in my top five. I think it goes through all the emotions. It puts you on the edge of your seat, it breaks your heart, it scares the crap out of you. I even laugh a little when they do that yoga scene. That’s the one thing I’ve never really understood. Do you remember that part? When they do naked yoga together? I understand what they’re conveying, that these two people find companionship and peace inside of all the insanity going on around them. The blond guy and your main character, Billy, have this, like… it’s not romantic, but it’s very… it is sensual in a way, this yoga scene, together, and the way they shot it with the light coming through the window. It always makes me chuckle. But yeah, Midnight Express, man, it’s always on the top five.Oldboy (Park Chan-wook, 2005; 80% Tomatometer)A little earlier, I got on a binge of Korean thrillers and… Oldboy. As far as Korean thrillers go, Oldboy and I Saw the Devil exchange places [as] my favorite Korean film. [For the remake of Oldboy], they manage to completely ruin it. And I don’t know how they managed to so thoroughly ruin it, but they… They could have just re-shot it shot-for-shot and have the American screenplay be the subtitles of the Korean film and it would have been a fantastic movie. And they managed to poop all over celluloid. But the original one, phew. I highly recommend that whole… There’s a trilogy. It’s Oldboy, Sympathy for Lady Vengeance and, what’s the third one [Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance]? It’s a Vengeance trilogy and I love them all three. But that whole Vengeance series is amazing. Those Koreans know how to scare you.Oh yeah, one of my favorite movies is The Host. Did you see that one?Great film. Yup, great film. Yup. They perfectly do thriller without the overly gruesome slasher, you know? I think that I Saw the Devil… it is one of my favorites, I don’t know that I’d put it in my top five, but it’s so incredibly graphic but it still manages to fall under “thriller,” although it’s probably the goriest film I’ve ever seen.They do a lot of things better than us and then we try to recreate it and it’s miserable.It’s because they don’t hold back. They really just don’t. It’s been said that the society is oppressed and socially they live in a more censored world, but when their art comes out, all of that censorship and boundaries that their society puts on them just come flooding out in their films and other forms of art.The Neverending Story (Wolfgang Petersen, 1984; 81% Tomatometer)I think we have to throw out the ones that we grew up with, which would be The Neverending Story, which is also interchangeable with The Dark Crystal. Can we do that? Can we name two movies that take one place [laughing]?As a tie? Well, we can say that one is a runner-up, how’s that?Right! Okay, close runner-up. There you go, there you go, yeah. Because I think, as a film, I think Neverending Story is a better film than Dark Crystal. Um… but if you watch the making of The Dark Crystal, which comes on that super-limited-edition DVD that was released a couple years ago, and you watch that one hour documentary of the making of The Dark Crystal, you have a whole new respect for the Gelfings. But I think I’ve seen Neverending Story probably as many times as I’ve seen Midnight Express. Sometimes I watch Neverending Story just to cleanse myself of what Midnight Express has left me with.Election (Alexander Payne, 1999; 92% Tomatometer)  For a comedy, I’d say probably Election you know? Frickin’ Alexander Payne, dude? Come on. Yeah, Matthew Broderick, Reese Witherspoon? So good. The perfect blend of real and absurd. Completely buyable characters… just turned up a couple notches. And these completely realistic scenarios and situations just turned up just a couple notches. Complete believable absurdity. It’s not just over the top.You believe these people could actually exist.Yeah. Which makes it all the more funnier. Or more funner? I don’t know. I don’t know what the correct word would be for that one. I, myself, unlike the characters in Election, didn’t go to high school.You’re living vicariously through them.Yeah, and that’s the other thing. I would want my high school experience to be like that, you know? I would want to be the um… God, what’s the kid’s name? Klein. He was in so many of the movies in the 1990s.Chris Klein.Yeah, Chris Klein, yeah. Right? Isn’t it Chris Klein? Love that kid. Great kid, too.Shut Up, Little Man (Matthew Bate, 2011; 67% Tomatometer)You know, I really get into… I can just throw it out there, because it was a great… it really was really good, but Shut Up, Little Man. It’s a documentary. I thoroughly enjoyed it. It’s about these two guys that move into an apartment in San Francisco. And their next-door neighbors are the worst neighbors you can possibly imagine. It’s these two older gay gentlemen that have the worst relationship that anyone could ever have. And they spend all hours of the day just screaming at each other. And so these two guys started recording these arguments.I remember in the 1990s, back before the Internet, if you wanted these odd, like, socially passed-around… Remember like Faces of Death? You could get a VHS copy of it? And so this was… You could go to certain independent record stores and they’d have a small collection of these bootlegged cassette tapes of their arguments. And I remember when we were doing Empire Records was the first time I heard these. And it’s the story of the guys that recorded… They track down the two guys that recorded all these things that were passed around through our generation. It’s a pretty amazing documentary. It’s pretty good.You have a sentimental memory of hearing these tapes. I’ve never heard them.Yeah they were passed around. I remember I got hold of those and listened to them. And there was a Chuck Berry sex tape that I had on VHS. [Laughing] Before YouTube and before the internet, you know, there would be these little pieces of gold we would get. Like folklore, you know? So there is a nostalgic element.Late Phases is really good.I have to see it. I still haven’t seen it.Really?Sometimes I don’t. Sometimes I’ll go a really long time before I watch the stuff that I’m in.Why is that?Because it’s fun to see it with an audience. Because then I get a really good gauge of the film itself, you know?Ever just go buy a ticket and watch it in the theater?Oh yeah, I love that. Because you get a really good gauge of what the film is. But since this is mostly screening on the East Coast…And digital download.Yeah, yeah. You can get it… If I wanted to I could log on and just watch it. It just makes me a little self-conscious to sit there by myself, you know? And I’ve learned not to listen to that, because that’s the least… I think my appraisal is the least honest one. Especially after working with those… like Jane Fonda and Lily Tomlin have the same thing. It’s just, it’s an actor’s curse. And it doesn’t way. And I’ve stopped listening to it and that results in my stopping watching sometimes.But this movie is good.People are liking it.It’s got my friend Lance Guest (The Last Starfighter) in it.Oh yeah! Dude, Lance Guest is rad! My favorite thing about Late Phases, having not seen it, is the classic filmmaking, the way they went about doing things with lost art forms, like building the monsters. Having these true craftsmen come in and make these handmade suits. They spent months and months. And the makeup that they did on Nick [Damici], the lead. You know, they aged him a good 25-30 years. And they did that every single morning. And it looks amazing. They don’t do that s— anymore. Those are lost art forms that have been replaced by people who are really good at typing up ones and zeros.It’s refreshing.Yeah. Yeah. And it stays true to that classic filmmaking art. Also, if you’re a werewolf fan, it stays true to that genre as well because, he doesn’t have more abs than nipples, you know?So is horror one of the more fun genres to be on set doing?I think it is. I keep saying it, but, I do what I do because we’re trying to elicit an emotion in our audience. Some sort of emotional reaction. Thriller and comedy, those are, to me… If you can make a person laugh, or if you can scare the s— out of them, that’s the strongest reaction. To me, breaking an audience’s heart is very elusive and it almost has to be done accidentally. I haven’t figured out that formula, how to pull on those heartstrings. But I can scare ’em. And I can make ’em laugh. Being on a thriller or a horror set too, there’s a lot of, like with the monsters and the scares and whatnot, there’s a lot of practical techniques. It’s very, very technical to get certain scares right. And doing that stuff.Comedy is the same.Yeah, yeah. Comedy, with the timing. Yeah, yeah. With horror, it’s more of a team effort though, because you have to sell things to the camera. Like there’s… I don’t know if you saw Cheap Thrills, the last horror film that I did, that end scene. If we’re going to make the whole audience jump back, I have to sell it, the camera has to sell it, you throw in some sound design. It’s a real team effort to get that jump across. And that’s so much fun for me, to be a part of that. For comedy, it’s all up to me. Unless it’s physical comedy. But to be a part of that team effort to be on a horror or a thriller, it’s my favorite part of filmmaking.And it’s got a fresh score, which is rare for a horror movie. I was just telling someone if a horror film is even in the 30s, to me, that’s a good score for a horror film. But you’ve got a fresh score here.Yeah, we’re doing alright. Because, the thing with Late Phases, when we were making it, we wanted to make a film before we made a horror film. We wanted it to stand on its own without the blood and gore. And I think that most of the complaints I’ve heard about it is, they’re expecting more of the gore. That the gore happens and then where does it go until the end? So it’s that… I mean, opinions always vary. Some people want more, some people love where it’s at.Late Phases is now open in limited release and for digital download on Amazon and iTunes.","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"Television, ITV, Guide, Black, PlayStation, CW, movies, A&E, VICE, Geo","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Five-Favorite-Films-with-Ethan-Embry.jpg","slug":"five-favorite-films-with-ethan-embry"},{"id":"47508835696847","title":"Eduardo Sánchez’s Five Favorite Films","content":"Five Favorite Filmsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Eduardo Sánchez's Five Favorite Filmsby Kerr Lordygan | October 24, 2014 |  CommentsWith 1999’s The Blair Witch Project, Eduardo Sánchez, along with Daniel Myrick and Bob Griffin, largely contributed to a filmmaking movement, influencing years of found-footage films to come. Now, with his new film, Exists, we are witness to what Sánchez calls a hybrid found-footage film. This time, instead of a witch, the mythological subject is Bigfoot. We had a chance to ask Sánchez about his five favorite films. Does the list surprise you?&nbsp;Star Wars (George Lucas, 1977; 93% Tomatometer)I wouldn’t be a filmmaker if it wasn’t for Star Wars. Like most filmmakers in my generation, it showed us the power of cinema, showed us the power of creating another world. It’s so immersive. That’s the first movie that got me into how they made movies. Got really into the special effects and all that stuff. And now I have a huge Star Wars collection that has completely taken over my basement, to my wife’s chagrin.I just got rid of a bunch of mine.Like the old stuff?I kept some of the old stuff that I had, but in the 1990s when they were going crazy again, I had a lot of that stuff so I unloaded a bunch of it.Yeah, like all the pumped-up stuff [laughing]? I love that stuff.Yea. Monkey-face Leia was my favorite.Yeah, Monkey Face Leia, she’s all… They’re all pumped up like they’re on steroids or something [laughing].Awesome. But I can see how that’s influential and the effects back then, I still like them better than CGI today.Yeah, because they were all physical. And there’s just something about that and about the painstaking process that they went through. And also the limitations of it, I think, is kind of, like, part of the creativity. Becuase now you can do anything with CG, you know? And I think the idea that there were limitations, it’s kind of the same way we did the Bigfoot for Exists. It’s like, we made the decision to not do CG and we kind of stuck to our guns so we’re pretty happy with how it looks.Raiders of the Lost Ark (Steven Spielberg, 1981; 95% Tomatometer)I guess the next one, chronologically, would be Raiders of the Lost Ark, even though it’s hard to choose just one Spielberg film. First of all it’s George Lucas and Spielberg, which is kind of like Jesus and Moses collaborating on a movie [laughing]. But it was just, you know, it was so different, it just came out of nowhere. I mean Harrison Ford who had been Han Solo and all of a sudden he’s late ’30s and battling Nazis. It was just such a ride and it still holds up. Just movie magic, know what I mean?I saw it a couple years ago. We were doing a sound mix at Skywalker Sound, it was right before the new one came out, The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, and they showed a pristine 35mm print of it. It just brought back all those great memories and, again, no CG, you know. Just really good filmmaking.Blade Runner (Ridley Scott, 1982; 91% Tomatometer)Again, I think chronologically, is Blade Runner. It was the movie right after Raiders. And Harrison Ford is, you know, my favorite actor. He just has this… He’s just such a likeable guy. He’s obviously been one of the biggest stars in the last 20, 30 years. But he’s really been underappreciated now. And Blade Runner, to me, was such a cool film. And I know it didn’t do well at the box office, but I saw it opening night. People were expecting a lot because Raiders was the film that had just come out before. I just thought it was so ballsy, you know, especially for Harrison Ford to do this, because it wasn’t an action film, it was more of a noir/science fiction movie. And just that opening sequence of going over Los Angeles and those big fire plumes, and the spinners and the angelic soundtrack, it was just, it was religious. It was like a religious experience.Again, I really got into how they made it. I had already been a fan of Ridley Scott but this really solidified him as one of my favorite directors. Just the mood of that movie, it’s just beautiful. It’s one of those weird movies where I’ve seen all the versions and I actually like the original studio version better. I really love Harrison Ford’s narration. To me it was just kind of classic noir, crime/mystery film, you know? But it was set in this frickin’ crazy science-fiction future and I just loved it.You’re into a lot of the exciting, effects-heavy classics.Yeah. Especially early, you know? I was still in high school when Blade Runner came out so it was very much… actually I was in middle school, I guess. Damn, that was a long time ago. But yeah, the eye candy definitely appealed to me. There were plenty of movies with effects back then, but to me, the effects and then Harrison Ford, and the mystery and Sean Young was so frickin’ beautiful… She hadn’t gone off the deep end yet. You know, it was just a great film. One of my favorite soundtracks too.Do the Right Thing (Spike Lee, 1989; 96% Tomatometer)Spike Lee’s third film. I had just started doing films in high school and Do the Right Thing came out, and there was just this burst of creativity in a drama, of creative energy, and also just the social commentary, and Spike being in it, and the music, and the color, the production design. Then I read the book on the making of it. I read the book that he wrote for She’s Gotta Have It. I really became, like, a Spike Lee connoisseur, you know? But again, just to kind of open my eyes, it took me from kind of like what we were talking about before, like the shiny effects, you know, that kid of shiny object interest of childhood, to movies that can really make you think, and make you talk, make you think about what is going on, and his social commentary really affected me. It really took me from kind of like a Spielberg/Lucas type of filmmaker toward a more socially conscious filmmaker.I actually did a film that was very inspired by Do the Right Thing called Gabriel’s Dream that never got distributed. But it was about these workers in a particularly hot summer in Maryland, and they were trying to get A/C in their factory, and that was basically the story. Like, workers’ rights. It kind of really took me in a direction that I never thought I would go in. And it never came out, it did some festivals, and we never got distribution for it, this was like early 1990s. But it definitely opened my eyes to the power of cinema as a social statement, as a social tool. And I wrote two or three scripts after that that were very much inspired by Do the Right Thing, kind of touching on social issues.I was really that kind of filmmaker when I was in film school. But then we came up with the idea for Blair Witch and all of a sudden, we became “horror filmmakers.” But still, I love the idea of always having a little bit of the deeper meaning in material. And some films are just for fun and made that way, but there are others where you want to dig a little deeper. If you can get one person coming out of the theater thinking about what happened in the movie, I think it’s great. And Do the Right Thing consumed me. It was such an important film in my upbringing, you know?Notting Hill (Roger Michell, 1999; 83% Tomatometer)One movie that’s always kind of a runner up, and I never really mention it because it’s so different than my other favorite films, is Notting Hill. It’s kind of a weird film to put in the group. But it’s such a perfect romantic-comedy and such a perfect vehicle. It’s like a fantasy, every man’s fantasy of meeting a beautiful movie star and being absorbed into her world and somehow making it work out. I love Julia Roberts, but that movie really made me fall in love with her, and Hugh Grant, he was such a likable guy in that movie. The supporting roles are so strong. And just the story of, just the world that… you know, I live on the very edges of this world, but just the world that Hollywood, that these people live in. It was just kind of a really interesting story. It wasn’t just a basic romantic-comedy; it had a lot of things going for it. But that’s definitely one of my favorite films. That’s one of those films that I watch every couple years. I just pop it in.I remember when it came out, I was like, “I don’t need to see that,” because I’m not much of a rom-com kind of guy, and it was on one day and I totally got drawn into it. Very good storytelling, very good performances.Yeah. And you know they’re gonna end up together at the end. I mean, that’s what you want. But it just works. It’s very formulaic but it somehow works. I think it’s a lot of the idea of the fantasy of, like I said, of meeting somebody… a random encounter with someone that is just not a part of your world and somehow having a spark. And that person having interest in your kind of every day existence. It’s a really fun show. And [Julia’s] so beautiful in it; she’s just, you know, she’s a movie star.So Exists is just out now. It looks great. You mentioned how you chose not to use CGI, which I’m a fan of. Tell me how Exists exists, how you found it, or how it found you?Well, I’ve been obsessed with Bigfoot for, you know, since I was a kid. And really, a lot of those early Bigfoot films and documentaries speared the creation of Blair Witch for both me and Dan [Myrick]. And so it’s always been this kind of pivotal monster or mythological creature, whatever you want to call it, in my life. I was always disappointed in Bigfoot movies by the creature not being what I wanted it to be, what I thought it would be, what I thought it could be. Actually the first script I wrote after Blair Witch was a Bigfoot movie, and this is the third version of that kind of same idea as far as a Bigfoot movie’s concerned. We got the money, raised the money, we shot it and we’re very happy with it. My thing is, it was very much kind of an experiment. I had this idea for what the creature would look like in my head, but I honestly didn’t know how I was going to pull it off. We hired some great people. Spectral Motion and Brian Steele, who’s known as “Creature Boy,” he played he monster. He did a fantastic job, you know? I’m proud of it. It’s definitely a little fun, kind of popcorn film.I can imagine Steele going into auditions with Bigfoot on his resume. “Hi, I was Bigfoot.”Yeah, I know. But his resume is, he was Predator, he’s been in Lord of the Rings, he was in Hellboy, he has a f—ing resume compared to nobody, know what I’m saying?And sort of reminiscent of Blair Witch, it’s a bit of a found-footage style film.Yes, it’s found-footage. It’s kind of a hybrid because there’s obviously stuff where the camera just is in a place where logically it doesn’t make sense that it would be there, even though we tried to make it as logical as possible. This is a different kind of movie. You know, with Blair Witch, reality was the only thing that we prided ourselves on; it had to look 100 percent real. Everything had to be 100 percent genuine. And now fifteen years later, found-footage has definitely evolved. I think audiences are more open for the idea. It’s just a style of making a movie. There’s music, it’s a movie, it’s got a 5.1 surround soundtrack, you know, it’s an action film, a monster movie, you know. Things have definitely changed since Blair Witch.And do you sort of give yourself credit for starting this big found-footage movement in film?Yeah. Again, I and the rest of the guys that I did The Blair Witch with didn’t know what we were doing. The technique was born out of the idea of the movie. We didn’t call it found-footage. We called it first-person POV. Then years later when Cloverfield came out, and Paranormal Activity came out? We knew it was coming, because even after Blair Witch we were kind of… You can do all kinds of movies with this technique. But for us, we didn’t want to be known as the found-footage guys.It was a different time back then. It really was not the first of its kind but there hadn’t been that kind of movie in a very long time. We didn’t want to pigeonhole ourselves even more like, “Oh, all they do is found-footage movies.” So the technique was born from the idea. But then Exists, we started off as a conventional film and then the more we wrote the script, and the more we thought of it, we thought this could be a return to found-footage, because the story makes sense that these people would have video cameras, that they’d be obsessed. It’s like the YouTube generation that videotapes everything. We thought it was a good opportunity to get back into that style. Also Bigfoot is the perfect subject matter for that style because all we’ve seen of Bigfoot is basically found-footage. It’s people videotaping in the woods and photographs and stuff like that, so he’s kind of a creature that existed in that world. So we thought it would be a good idea to keep him in that world, a world that the audience was familiar with.And what’s so great about it is it’s scary because you make us wait for it.Yeah, we follow the Jaws model which I think is the greatest monster movie ever. The idea that you tease it, you show little bits, and then at the end, you give the audience what they want. Like I said earlier, that was the thing I was most frustrated with with Bigfoot movies. Like, you tease me the whole movie and at the end you don’t give me what I want. I want to see the creature, I want to see the creature in action. That’s what monster movies are kind of about. Same thing with Alien and pretty much every great monster movie. Just hold back the creature, and then you show it at the end and you give the audience what they wanted in the end, so that’s sort of the formula we followed with this.Exists is now open in limited release and available on VOD.","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"Now, Critics","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Eduardo-S-nchezs-Five-Favorite-Films.jpg","slug":"eduardo-sanchezs-five-favorite-films"},{"id":"47508835694798","title":"Baymax’s Five Favorite Films","content":"Five Favorite Filmsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Baymax's Five Favorite Filmsby RT Staff | November 5, 2014 |  CommentsBest known for his appearances in the trailers for Disney’s upcoming Big Hero 6, Baymax is the helpful, loving robot companion of Hiro Hamada, a brilliant young inventor living in the city of San Fransokyo.

Now, he shares five faves of his own.Given Turturro’s body of work as a writer and director, it may not surprise you that his favorites lean toward classic and foreign cinema — or that he had a hard time paring down the list to only five.The Godfather (Francis Ford Coppola, 1972; 100% Tomatometer)I guess definitely I would say The Godfather is one of my favorite films. It’s beautifully written and beautifully shot and performed… it’s very entertaining, but it also has a lot of layers to it. It has a lot of fantastic actors in the film and in the script. It’s one of those films that works on many levels, and I think that the movies that stay with you, [they] work on many levels. I have so many movies that I’ve loved, it’s very hard to make it down to five — it would be hard to even make 20 — but I’m going to go for five, so I’m going to put The Godfather on that.Le Notti di Cabiria (Nights of Cabiria) (Federico Fellini, 1957; 97% Tomatometer)Then I would also put Nights of Cabiria — Le Notti di Cabiria — by Fellini, which I love. It’s a movie about a woman who’s a prostitute, but it’s a fantastic movie with Giulietta Masina and I think it won, like, Best Foreign Film or something in 1957. It’s a film I look at again and again. I’m a big Fellini fan.And is that one you watched while you were preparing for Fading Gigolo?Well, there’s so many movies about that world, and so many [actors] have played roles — from Jane Fonda to Barbra Streisand to Barbara Stanwyck to Joan Crawford, Anna Magnani — it goes on and on and on all the way up to Midnight Cowboy. I’m not gonna put Midnight Cowboy as one of my five. But it’s close… That movie really influenced me wanting to be an actor actually because I saw Dustin Hoffman and I was like, ‘Wow, we could be related.’ I couldn’t see it when it came out because it was rated X… but if you see it again, it holds up really, really well. Maybe I’ll put that on my five. I don’t know.Casablanca (Michael Curtiz, 1942; 97% Tomatometer)I would definitely have to put Casablanca on there because I think it’s such a great, entertaining film. It’s so witty and funny and it influenced so many people, including Woody Allen… I remember watching it when I was a kid and thinking like, ‘Wow, this is just perfect,’ so I would put that in there.On the Waterfront (Elia Kazan, 1954; 100% Tomatometer)And then I would put On the Waterfront in there too… I remember I broke my leg when I was in eighth grade and I actually taped it on my audio cassette. I taped the entire movie, so I know a lot of the movie by heart. So, these are movies that just have had big influences on you at different times of your life.La Grande Illusion (Grand Illusion) (Jean Renoir, 1937; 97% Tomatometer)Number five is a toss-up between The Seven Samurai and Grande Illusion. I still don’t know what to say. I’ll just say… Grande Illusion, which I think is a perfect film. And it doesn’t follow any rules because it’s very episodic. I’m a huge Jean Renoir fan, and I’m a huge Kurosawa fan too, and those guys made movies that — that’s as good as it gets. Jean Renoir’s films have such a tremendous intelligence and humanity, and there’s all this great depth and there’s this great joie de vivre — there’s this great joy in the film. It’s almost like commedia dell’arte, but then it exposes something really deep down. And so those are just great pieces of work, and there are so many other films that I love too, so it’s hard.In Fading Gigolo, the fifth film written and directed by Turturro, he plays a New York City florist who takes up the world’s oldest profession in order to earn some extra cash for himself and his friend, Murray (Woody Allen). Sofia Vergara, Sharon Stone, Vanessa Paradis, Liev Schreiber and Bob Balaban co-star.Fading Gigolo is currently in theaters.","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"trailers, Tubi, ABC, spanish, series, Alien, anime, Month, hispanic, Oscars, comedy, GoT, Travel, Freeform","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/turturro.jpg","slug":"five-favorite-films-with-john-turturro"},{"id":"47508837186779","title":"Emmanuelle Chriqui’s Five Favorite Films","content":"Five Favorite Filmsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Emmanuelle Chriqui's Five Favorite FilmsThe Entourage star also talks about her new film, A Short History of Decay.by Matt Atchity | June 11, 2014 |  CommentsMainstream audiences probably know Emmanuelle Chriqui best from her starring role opposite Adam Sandler in 2008’s You Don’t Mess with the Zohan or for her work on popular TV series like Entourage and The Mentalist. But the Canadian actress has also done extensive voice work (TRON: Uprising, Thundercats) and found time to appear in smaller indie fare like A Short History of Decay, which arrives on DVD today.In an interview with RT, Chriqui had a difficult time narrowing her favorite films down to just five. In addition to her choices below, she cited childhood favorites like Flashdance and Dirty Dancing, about which she explained, “It was at that age, really the beginning of my sexual consciousness. I was like, ‘Whoa, that’s really sexy. I want to have that happen to me one day.'” Read on for her full list and our chat about A Short History of Decay.The Shawshank Redemption (Frank Darabont, 1994; 91% Tomatometer)I’m going to say The Shawshank Redemption. It’s just one of those films that… The acting is brilliant — it knocks you over the head, it really does — and just the story.Dead Man Walking (Tim Robbins, 1995; 93% Tomatometer)You know, I think love the antihero a little bit. The one that you just end up going, “Come on, you can make it. You can turn yourself around.” I loved Dead Man Walking. One of [Sean Penn’s] most brilliant performances. The fact that he manages to get you, by the end, wanting him to live, even after the most heinous crimes, is jaw-dropping to me. You start hating him, and you’re like, “You’re despicable.” And then… I just find it amazing. Only Sean Penn could do that. I think he’s amazing.Jacob’s Ladder (Bruce Joel Rubin, 1990; 70% Tomatometer)I also love Jacob’s Ladder. That movie is amazing. Terrifying, horrifying, but so good, and it stands the test of time. Like, if you watch it today, it’s still terrifying.The Intouchables (Eric Toledano and Olivier Nakache, 2012; 75% Tomatometer)I also love The Intouchables. Did you see it?I haven’t seen that one yet, no.You know you need to run, not walk, and go see that movie. [laughs] It is amazing. It’s a French-language film; I think they’re going to remake it. But it was also just a huge success here [in Canada]. And I love foreign films; I actually shot a French film last summer. It was really amazing; I want to shoot more French films.Y Tu Mamá También (Alfonso Cuarón, 2001; 91% Tomatometer)And I loved Y Tu Mamá También. Love that film. I think I’ve watched it a thousand times.RT: We need to talk about A Short History of Decay. That’s been out for a while, but it’s coming to DVD. How did that project end up on your radar?Emmanuelle Chriqui: Actually, they had sent it to me. They offered me the part, and Bryan Greenberg, who is a very good friend of mine… I had read the script, and I really loved it; just a real life story, something that everybody can relate to on some level. I lost both of my parents, but just the notion of having aging parents and all the things that come with it really resonated with me. Bryan and I were just like, “Should we do this?” “Hell yeah. This is so good. Let’s do this.” It’s such a little gem. I’m so proud of this movie, and I feel like the people who do see it are really taken by surprise, because it’s a real indie film. It’s super indie in the true meaning of the word, but it was such a beautiful story. I thought it was really well executed. My part sort of bookends the movie. It was like, it opens, it’s got a couple scenes in the middle, and then it ends. I was sort of the catalyst to Bryan’s character’s life change; we’re a couple, and I end up breaking up with him, and his whole world spirals out. So it’s really Bryan’s story with his parents, and Linda Lavin plays his mom. How cool is that? And Harris Yulin is so amazing, it’s insane. Such a powerful performance.RT: So what’s coming up for you? Situation amoureuse?EC: That already came out in France, but it will be subtitled and brought over here at some point. I wrapped the Entourage film, but that’ll be out next summer. It’s going to be fun. I don’t know what Rotten Tomatoes is going to rate it, but I’ll tell you what, people are going to love it. [laughs] And then I have the second season of my web series Cleaners that I also executive produced for Crackle. It’s coming out in August. Super fun. I play this badass assassin, so, you know, out-of-the-box for me; really cool, fun stuff.A Short History of Decay comes out on DVD today, and you can catch Emmanuelle’s web series Cleaners on Crackle.","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"razzies, Television, OneApp, Box, women, versus","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Emmanuelle-Chriquis-Five-Favorite-Films.jpg","slug":"emmanuelle-chriquis-five-favorite-films"},{"id":"47508837194976","title":"Gillian Jacobs’ Five Favorite Films","content":"Five Favorite Filmsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Gillian Jacobs' Five Favorite FilmsThe Walk of Shame and Community star chats about her new film, partying sober, and Darkwing Duck.by Ryan Fujitani | April 30, 2014 |  CommentsWhen Gillian Jacobs won the role of Britta Perry, the rebellious activist and armchair psychologist of the Greendale gang on NBC’s Community, the world had yet to see what comic potential she possessed. Until then, Jacobs had primarily taken darker roles in films like Choke and The Box. But she positively sparkled alongside a talented cast that included Joel McHale, Chevy Chase, and Ken Jeong, and it’s paved the way for further comedy roles.Next up for Jacobs is Walk of Shame, which opens this week and stars Elizabeth Banks as Meghan Miles, a TV news anchor who finds herself stranded in the wrong part of town after a night of partying. RT spoke with Jacobs about her role as Meghan’s BFF Rose, working with comedy vets, and what it’s like to party “stone cold sober.” But first, here are Gillian Jacobs’ Five Favorite Films:American Movie (Chris Smith, 1999; 94% Tomatometer)You know, a movie that I always come back to, which is a documentary — I hope that’s okay — is American Movie, which I think is one of the funniest and saddest movies I’ve ever seen. So quotable. And it really says a lot about hope, optimism, naivete, the movie business. Even though they’re hundreds of miles away from LA and have no real access to Hollywood… I just love that movie so much.Fanny &amp; Alexander (Ingmar Bergman, 1982; 100% Tomatometer)A movie that I’ve seen probably the most is Fanny &amp; Alexander, the Ingmar Bergman movie. I even dragged my friends to the super long version that had an intermission. I don’t know how much they liked me that day.The Philadelphia Story (George Cukor, 1940; 100% Tomatometer)Well, I was a super fan of Katharine Hepburn as a kid, so let’s say The Philadelphia Story. I also really loved Cary Grant as a kid, so you could do a subset of, like, His Girl Friday; you know, Rosalind Russell, Cary Grant, incredible movie. The dialogue is just mindblowing. The pace at which they manage to speak, I find to be incredible.Was it someone in your family who introduced you to these classic films?I think maybe my mom thought that Katharine Hepburn would be a good role model of like a strong, smart, independent woman. Maybe she steered me in that direction. You know, because she was really so ahead of her time. Like, she bought the rights to the play of The Philadelphia Story and made that movie when she was considered box office poison and no one wanted to hire her. I think she was pretty amazing in terms of how she controlled her career and gave herself second chances when people totally counted her out. So it might have been my mom leading me in that direction, but I really responded to her as a kid, and watched Bringing up Baby and Holiday and all of those movies.The Raid (Gareth Evans, 2012; 85% Tomatometer)Okay, let’s go for a more recent movie. How about that? You know what movie I loved recently? The Raid, to go in a completely opposite direction. I really enjoyed that movie. That was so fun to watch in the theater. That’s one of those movies where like, it’s so cool to sit there and watch it on the big screen.Are you a big action fan?I really enjoy them. I have a hard time watching people getting punched on screen; I have to close my eyes a lot. But somehow, maybe just the sheer number of punchings overwhelmed me and I was okay.A Fish Called Wanda (Charles Crichton and John Cleese, 1988; 93% Tomatometer)Okay, let’s do something completely different. Here’s a movie I was watching the other day on cable that I loved as a kid and it still made me laugh: A Fish Called Wanda. It’s still funny.Next, Jacobs talks about Walk of Shame, working with comedy vets, the future of Community, and how she feels about six-pack abs.RT: People may not know this, but you’ve got bona fide acting credentials. You started when you were eight years old, and you trained at Juilliard; it’s something you basically always knew you wanted to do. And almost all of your early roles — before a certain show called Community came along — were serious roles. You’ve clearly proven your comedic chops since then; did you always know you could do comedy this well, even when you were reciting Shakespearean monologues on stage?Gillian Jacobs: Not really. I mean, no, you kind of don’t know you can do it until you do it. I remember doing one scene in college that was funny, and the teacher said, “Okay, well you can do that, but never bring in a scene like that again.” [laughs] So he didn’t really encourage me to be funny in college. So maybe it was just something in my back pocket that I just always loved comedy, just as a viewer. But I don’t think I was entirely sure I could do it until I got the chance to actually do it.RT: Was it ever something you hoped to break into at some point?GJ: Definitely, definitely. You can only do so many serious dramas in a row before you want to break. You want a change.RT: You’ve worked with people like Chevy Chase, Ken Jeong, and now in Walk of Shame you’ve got Elizabeth Banks, Kevin Nealon, Bill Burr, and Tig Notaro, who sports an awesome mullet-like creation, by the way.GJ: I know, I know. I just saw Tig last week and I was reminding her of that mullet.RT: Was it intimidating to work with all these people, or were you like, “Pshh, I can hold my own. Ken Jeong ain’t got nuttin’ on me!”GJ: [laughs] I’m always intimidated. I mean, I love and respect all those people. Somebody like Tig, for example, she did an episode of Community in maybe our second or third season, and she’s someone that I’ve become and stayed friends with, and she makes me laugh so hard. I think she’s just one of the funniest people I’ve ever met. She makes me want to be funnier, but I know I’ll never be as funny as her.RT: I’m sure there’s a mutual respect there, though.GJ: I don’t know if Tig respects me. I won’t speak for her.RT: Now, in Walk of Shame, you play Rose, who is one of Elizabeth Banks’s character’s BFFs, and you’re super protective of her in the film. Are you that friend in real life? Are you the one threatening your friends’ potential dates with castration if they hurt them?GJ: I don’t know that I’ve ever done that, but I’m sure I give a really good mean stare. I’m sure I give a good evil eye. [laughs] I don’t know that I intimidate anyone in real life. They’d probably laugh if I said that.RT: So you’re not the one organizing a lynch mob if one of your girlfriends gets dumped, or that sort of thing.GJ: I’m more organizing the ice cream.RT: Elizabeth Banks plays Meghan, who’s this good girl who just happens to have the worst luck on the one night when she decides to cut loose and gets stranded in the bad part of town. If the same thing happened to you, who would be the first person you would call?GJ: My mom. Well, my mom is the only person whose number I have memorized at this point, so she’s actually the only person I could call if I lost my phone. That and my now deceased grandfather’s number at the nursing home. Those are the only two numbers I know. I called my grandpa a lot; that’s nice, right?RT: That’s really nice. I loved my grandpa a lot too, so I get it. I don’t think you’ll need the number though, because somehow, I don’t actually see what happened to Meghan happening to you; at least, not any more, since you’re a responsible working adult now and all. But back in the day, were you a more disciplined partier, or did you get a little crazy?GJ: I don’t drink, so it’s kind of hard to go that crazy stone cold sober. So yeah, I’ve always kind of been a grandma, as my friends would tell you. I much prefer to go home and get a good night’s sleep. [laughs]RT: Well I don’t drink either, and I’ve been known to love my sleep, so we’ve got that in common.GJ: All right. There you go. See, yeah, when you’re stone cold sober, it’s harder to excuse bad behavior.RT: Now, another thing I want to point out about your character Rose is that she ends up going home with a rather older gentleman, and she’s visibly disturbed by it. But come on, that dude was ripped!GJ: Dude, he’s a model! Yeah, he’s f***in’ ripped.RT: As a contemporary, modern woman, sometimes isn’t that enough when you just want to hook up?GJ: That’s intimidating to me. I don’t want any part of that. That six-pack was too much for me. That was too much. It was too much.RT: I do want to mention Community, because that show kicks ass, and you are so good as Britta. The fifth season just ended; have you heard anything at all, through the grapevine or otherwise, about a sixth season?GJ: You know, I’ve not heard anything definite. The grapevine for me is Twitter, so I probably read about things at the same time you do. You know, we find out about our renewals on Deadline Hollywood, same as everyone else. That’s how I found out about everything that’s happened to my show, basically, the last couple of years. [laughs] So I have no definite word, but you know, I’m feeling pretty good about it. I’m feeling less stressed, and more… I don’t know if it’s blindly optimistic or not, but I’m feeling good right now.RT: As a child of the 1980s and a fan of classic G.I. Joe, I have to ask, is there any place where I can purchase a Buzzkill action figure?GJ: Oh my God, they should do it! You should tweet Sony and NBC and ask for it. Start a campaign. And I think they should make the “Britta, the One True Five” poster available for purchase, too.RT: That would be amazing. Tell me they at least let you keep the one they made for the episode.GJ: You know, Rob Schrab, who directed the episode, he made that art — that’s his work — and so he gave me a copy, and I framed it and it’s in my house now.RT: What TV shows did you watch growing up?GJ: I watched a lot of animated cartoons. I watched X-Men and that Batman cartoon that was on, and Animaniacs and Tiny Toons and Darkwing Duck. I watched all those shows.RT: Community should do a Darkwing Duck episode next season.GJ: Oh, that would be awesome. Or Count Duckula.Walk of Shame opens this weekend in theaters, and if all goes well, you can catch Gillian Jacobs as Britta on NBC’s Community again next season.","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"name","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Gillian-Jacobs-Five-Favorite-Films.jpg","slug":"gillian-jacobs-five-favorite-films"},{"id":"47508837190878","title":"Griffin Dunne’s Five Favorite Films","content":"Five Favorite Filmsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Griffin Dunne's Five Favorite Filmsby Grae Drake | May 16, 2014 |  CommentsI wish I could say that my first introduction to Griffin Dunne in the 80’s was An American Werewolf in London so I seem like I was a really savvy moviegoer even as a kid, but it wasn’t. It was Who’s That Girl, where he co-stars alongside Madonna as Loudon Trott, a tax attorney who, thanks to her, who goes from “uptight squaresville” to “knock knock jokes on the back of a bus-ville.” Even though I was young, I could tell that they had to cast someone rock solid against The Material Girl to anchor all that bleach-blonde pizzaz, so I dug into his filmography and was delighted by the likes of After Hours and Johnny Dangerously, just to name a few. In decades following, my fandom increased as I noticed that Dunne delivers the same kind of solidity and confidence regardless of the film genre, year, or role. The same can be said for my latest fix directed by Justin Schwarz called The Discoverers, where Dunne plays a dad who drags his family on a Lewis and Clark re-enactment trip.&nbsp;The following Five Favorite Films are specifically categorized as the handful that, if they are on television, will get Mr. Dunne to stop channel surfing and settle in, dinner plans be damned.Scarlet Street (Fritz Lang, 1945; 100% Tomatometer)This stars Edward G. Robinson, and is directed by Fritz Lang. Edward G. Robinson, of course, was always known as the tough guy, the gangster, the one you do not mess with, and Fritz Lang had the brilliance to sort of counter-cast him as a man having a mid-life crisis. He falls for a younger woman and just throws his life away, and it is so contemporary and so touching and tragic. It’s the kind of thing that I saw probably 30 years ago and couldn’t believe the bravery and vulnerability that Edward G. Robinson put himself through. I always thought of him as a guy holding a gat intimidating Humphrey Bogart. It’s the kind of thing as you get older, his character and the themes of the movie just have more and more resonance. It’s one of those movies that stills holds up because of what it’s about. It’s a timeless subject.Ace in the Hole (Billy Wilder, 1951; 87% Tomatometer)It’s sort of the first–and I think still the best–about the media circus, the kind of the vulture culture of descending onto a place where’s child’s life is in danger, the “boy in the well” kind of thing, and how the press is either hoping that the kid dies or is heroically saved so they have a good story. They’re supposedly covering what they think will be a heartwarming story of bravery, but it’s really the darkest cynical tale about popular media culture. It was too dark for people to deal with at the time. Billy Wilder had such a heart of darkness in him, in such a funny way.RT: You can’t go wrong with Kirk Douglas either.He’s brilliant, he was just so uncompromising, unrelenting, unsympathetic. And Wilder just had a tough dark vision of journalism, and told a story when movies were particularly reliant on print journalism. Outside of Citizen Kane, I don’t know of many other movies at that time that were as brutally critical of the media. It was really attacking the hand that promoted him, and consequently, it didn’t do very well, much like Citizen Kane at the time it came out.Saving Private Ryan (Steven Spielberg, 1998; 92% Tomatometer)I think this is one of the best war movies ever made. It covered the heroics of World War 2 which we’re all familiar with from the greatest generation, but it was the first movie to ever capture the absolute terror of being a soldier in the war. It was okay to be absolutely terrified during that world war. Every other movie is mostly about showing bravery in such an unrealistic context, it’s like every soldier that fought there died gracefully. But I know people who fought in that war who saw that movie when it came out, and it brought back a lot of memories and fears and terrors. You weren’t encouraged to get help after the war for the trauma back then. And that movie did more for a lot of those soldiers and veterans, and it is just great filmmaking.Reds (Warren Beatty, 1981; 94% Tomatometer)I always see this every couple of years to remind myself how difficult movie making can be and how much hard work and vision can be rewarded. What Warren Beatty did in that to star, produce, write, and direct was just one of the most colossal achievements in moviemaking. And how he was able to offer such an incredibly strong performance and direct himself and create one of the most heart-wrenching scenes at the train station with Diane Keaton, I look at that and wonder how the hell did he do that? How does any human pull that off, let alone get the tens of millions of dollars for a movie about an American communist at the turn of the 20th century? On so many levels, that movie leaves me in awe.RT: That came out right around the same time as An American Werewolf in London. What was it like being a working actor participating in an amazing movie while amazing things are happening around you in cinema?It was always special because it was my first part. I was always amazed to be in London, let alone have a driver outside my flat, with an apartment I could even call a flat, that would take me to the studio to film a movie that I knew would be of a very high caliber. I didn’t take anything for granted at that time. The 1970s was the first genus of cinema since the 30s of filmmaking, where one week after the other was yet another amazing movie. The Godfathers and the Hal Ashby movies, I figured they’ve been covered in these Five Favorite Films series so I won’t go on about them here.Dr. Strangelove (Stanley Kubrick, 1964; 100% Tomatometer)If I had dinner plans and I happen to be scrolling through the television channels and this is on, I’m gonna be late for dinner. I just can’t take my eyes off this movie. I was at the Kubrick exhibit at the LA County Museum of Art, and it was incredible to see the production details on this–the script, and what the bomb looked like, and the props. And that’s another movie that just was so far ahead of its time, and effortlessly combined humor and horror. In such a profound level the subject was terrifying and real, and prescient to the Cold War at that time. That absurdity of war and the military, it’s just still so great and hilarious and terrifying.RT: I can’t believe it was released in 1964.It’s amazing isn’t it? I think it might have been released even earlier in November of ’63, so they changed the date quickly. The Kennedy assassination did have some sort of effect on its release.RT: It’s like they knew the power of the film and what they had.It’s almost like wives tales: how the Air Force freaked out that Kubrick knew exactly what the inside of their bombers looked like. How did he know that? A lot of people participated in this crazy documentary about how Kubrick established a relationship with the Air Force and military in the pre-production of this movie and they shared materials with him, and they went back and said we need you to stage a fake moon landing.The Discoverers opens in limited release this weekend in New York City theaters, and continues to expand May 30th into Los Angeles.","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"revenge, service, CBS, latino, books","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Griffin-Dunnes-Five-Favorite-Films.jpg","slug":"griffin-dunnes-five-favorite-films"},{"id":"47508837184730","title":"Zach Galligan’s Five Favorite Films","content":"Five Favorite Filmsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Zach Galligan's Five Favorite Filmsby Grae Drake | June 12, 2014 |  CommentsIt’s been three decades since that fateful post-midnight snack that resulted in devoured hands, terrified citizens, and broken microwaves. To celebrate, Gremlins is getting an impressive 30th Anniversary Edition available now for digital download. Zach Galligan, the brave soul who faced those maniacal monsters a couple of times in his career, gave us his Five Favorite Films growing up in honor of the film that some argue is a children’s movie.The Exorcist (William Friedkin, 1973; 88% Tomatometer)This happens to be a Warner Bros movie [like Gremlins]. William Friedkin is one of my favorite filmmakers, I love everything that he does. I loved Killer Joe, I loved a lot of stuff that he did, he’s just great. But The Exorcist is really one of the few perfectly done movies. I also had a huge thrill because later in my career, Ellen Burstyn played my mom [in Surviving], so I got to know her. She’s magnificent. Lee J. Cobb is great in the movie, Jason Miller is incredible, Max Von Sydow is also amazing in the movie — the guy’s like 40 years old and they made him up to be a 70 year old man. Now he actually looks like Father Marin, but back then, he was 10 years younger than I am now. Everyone goes “Oh, Brando is great in The Godfather because he does the accent.” He was 47. He plays like a 66 year old man, maybe a little older, and he’s three years younger than I am now. Google “Marlon Brando Godfather makeup” and there’s a series of pictures of him sitting in the chair, this handsome late 40s guy, and when he’s done the transformation is unbelievable. It’s so trippy.Taxi Driver (Martin Scorcese, 1976; 98% Tomatometer)Certainly Taxi Driver would be on the list, because it’s probably the greatest character study ever put on film, with some of the most surprising twists and turns. It also has such a perfect exploration of the feelings at the time of the mid-70s. Politically and socially, it just captures that time in an amazing way — captures New York, which is my home town, in an amazing way. It’s an incredible time capsule.Do you remember the first time you saw it?I was pretty young. Too young. There was this cable channel called Uptown, and it was only available if you lived on 86th street or 79th street in Manhattan and above, which is how it got its name. To be perfectly candid, it catered to a combination of exploitation film lovers and cult film aficionados. So those types of movies were pretty well represented. My guess is, they chose Taxi Driver because it was gritty, was set in Times Square, and had an urban flavor to it. And it also had a lot of shooting and violence in the conclusion. So I would watch the trailer relentlessly and they would show Steven Prince, who played the gun dealer; he’d do the scene with DeNiro where he’d lay the guns out and kind of whip off his kind of gun dealer patter. The trailer absolutely fascinated me, and then I finally saw the movie, and I think for the last hour my jaw was open. I saw it at midnight, and my mom had gone to bed, and I’d kind of snuck into the TV room and was being naughty and was watching something a 14-year-old had no business watching. That made me think, “Is Manhattan really like that? Is Times Square really like that?” And at the time I was 14, yeah, Times Square was exactly like that. The first few times that I would go on auditions, in ’81, a lot of them were on 42nd street, and I can tell you 1981 was exactly the same as 1979 — nothing really changed in Times Square until about the mid ’80s. It was a scary neighborhood man. It was tough.And then came [former New York Mayor Rudy] Giuliani.Right, and he cleaned it up and turned it into a big outdoor mall.The Thing (John Carpenter, 1982; 79% Tomatometer)A perfectly executed movie; flawlessly executed. Incredible movie. And the thing — haha — the aspect of it that I like the best, is that I love the ending. I absolutely adore and love the ending, where you’re left ambiguously hanging and wondering what’s gonna happen. Kurt Russell is so underrated as an actor; he’s such a great anchor in every movie. I love him in just about everything he does.I remember one of my fondest memories of shooting Gremlins. I’ve never really talked about this. Right next door to Gremlins was the movie that Kurt Russell met Goldie Hawn on, a movie called Swing Shift. Their trailers were right next to us, so we were on Stage 16, and Kurt Russell and Goldie Hawn were on stage 15, and we were literally 20 feet away from each other. You would exit the stages and walk towards the commissary and you’d have to walk past them. We’d have frequent breaks from Gremlins because the special effects would snap sometimes and there would be fixes that were needed and whatnot, so I would go outside and get some sunshine because it’s LA and it’s beautiful. So I’d go outside and sit on the steps and play with my Calico football or whatever game thing I had, and because I loved Kurt Russell already from The Thing and I loved Goldie Hawn, I was this interloper. Somehow I’ve managed to star in a movie — I don’t know how I did it — and I would watch Kurt Russell and Goldie Hawn and their relationship unfold. I’d see them chatting a little the first couple of weeks, and the next couple of weeks they would go to the commissary together. A few weeks after that, they’d walk to the commissary a little slower holding hands. I thought even then, “That’s some chemistry right there.” And they’re still together. You’d see bits and pieces everyday, and if you had any inkling about how to read body language, it was pretty self-evident.A Clockwork Orange (Stanley Kubrick, 1971; 89% Tomatometer)A Clockwork Orange. I was absolutely stunned by the entire thing. That’s a Warner Bros movie too, so they’re smiling right now. That’s an amazing movie. Everything about the execution is flawless.You would have been way too young to see that when it came out.I saw that at a revival house when I was about 19 years old. There was a theater on 99th and Broadway called The Metro and all they did was show old movies, so in 1982 I went and I saw something from 1971 and it was 11 whole years old, and it was considered an old movie. Can you imagine seeing something from 2003 and having it being considered an old movie? That movie just blew me away. I couldn’t believe the level of violence at the beginning, then I couldn’t believe the social satire and everything, the execution, the slow motion, the way it was composed. And Malcolm McDowell’s performance? I was just riveted by the whole thing. It blew me away.Close Encounters of the Third Kind (Steven Spielberg, 1977; 95% Tomatometer)I have to throw more Spielberg in because he’s such a genius filmmaker. There’s so many other movies that I could say: The Godfather, The Empire Strikes Back, Inception–but I would go with Close Encounters because the movies of your youth are the ones that really stay with you, the same way that the music you listen to when your brain is forming at 12, 13, 14, 15 years old is the music you always go back to. What decade is that for you?The ’90s. Salt n’ Pepa, baby.Oh man. I did a movie with Salt called Raw Nerve, with Mario Van Peebles and Nicolette Sheridan.Oh my gosh.You want a real ’90s moment? I was at the Sunet Marquee, 1997, and I’m at the bar. This guy comes up and taps me on the shoulder and goes, “Uh, hey, Brian wants to meet you.” He grabs my sleeve and tugs me through the crowd, as I’m weaving my way through the crowd with a drink, saying, “Excuse me, pardon me, I didn’t mean to spill on you,” et cetera, and I get to these couches over in the corner surrounded by candles. This is where the old Whiskey Bar used to be; I don’t know if it’s still there. Anyway, sitting fully dressed in all of his glory and makeup is Marilyn Manson. And I walk up and I go, “Hi,” and he goes, “Hey I’m Brian.” In this hair and makeup and costume, he doesn’t go, “I am Marilyn Manson,” he just goes, “Oh, hey dude, I’m Brian.” He goes on to say, “I’m just wondering if you would you sign my Gremlins lunchbox?” I couldn’t believe it. I said, “If you can get it, I’ll sign it.” He said, “Cool man. I’m trying to get Corey to sign it too.” Probably the least likely thing you’d ever expect to hear coming out of Marilyn Manson’s mouth.It’s nice to know Marilyn Manson is just a guy with lunchboxes.I was amused by it. I asked if he had the thermos too and he said he didn’t. So here we are in this nightclub, having a long detailed discussion about whether Marilyn Manson has the Gremlins thermos or if he lost it. It was madness.That’s how you know your life is complete.You know you’ve made a cultural impact, at the very least.Gremlins 30th Anniversary Edition is available for digital download now.","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"book, crime, One, biography, cooking, movies, anime, Amazon, zombies, winner, of","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Zach-Galligans-Five-Favorite-Films.jpg","slug":"zach-galligans-five-favorite-films"},{"id":"47508837198050","title":"RZA’s Five Favorite Films","content":"Five Favorite Filmsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})RZA's Five Favorite FilmsThe Brick Mansions star talks about parkour and offers a killer fish recipe.by Ryan Fujitani | April 22, 2014 |  CommentsOne of the most influential hip-hop producers of all time, Robert Diggs — better known as RZA of the Wu-Tang Clan — has always had one foot firmly planted in the world of cinema. Since rising to prominence with the rap supergroup he founded with his cousins GZA and Ol’ Dirty Bastard, he’s continued on to score films for the likes of Jim Jarmusch and Quentin Tarantino, and just last year he made his feature directorial debut with The Man with the Iron Fists.This week, RZA stars opposite David Belle and Paul Walker in Brick Mansions, a remake of the parkour-flavored 2004 French action film District 13, which was written and produced by Luc Besson. Speaking to RT about his Five Favorite Films, RZA admitted, “it’s very hard for me to say five favorite films, as a man who watched thousands and thousands of movies. But I want to just give you five highly recommended films from me, and the reasons why I recommend them.” Here, then, are RZA’s Five Favorite Films:The Godfather (Francis Ford Coppola, 1972; 100% Tomatometer)Number one is The Godfather. The Godfather, for me, is because it represented family. Even though this family was on the opposite side of the law, and they were criminals at the end of the day, they were family, struggling, an immigrant family in America trying to find their ground. One of the most compelling scenes to me in The Godfather — it happens in Godfather II, actually — is when Vito Corleone is young, and he comes home to his wife, and all he has is an apple. He rubs it, polishes it, and puts it on the table, and they appreciated it. You know, that is very powerful to me. Those films resonated with me throughout the rest of my life because of the family values they instilled.The 36th Chamber of Shaolin (The Master Killer) (Liu Chia-liang, 1978; N/A Tomatometer)The second film that I suggest is called The 36th Chamber of Shaolin, also called The Master Killer. This film moved me so much not only from the martial arts action and the philosophy of Buddhism that was instilled in the movie, but also the overcoming of oppression. Growing up, I knew that I was being oppressed; I knew the black man’s struggle was oppressive in America, you know, reading Malcolm X and Martin Luther King. I knew of our struggle. But I didn’t know that that struggle was all around the world. I didn’t know that struggle was in all time periods. And when I saw this movie, it resonated with me in a way that I was like, “Wow, the government is just oppressing them, coming in and taking their homes, destroying their property. How they gonna win?” And from a single word, which was “Shaolin,” our hero was able to go find himself and find the way to help bring the end to that oppression.Pulp Fiction (Quentin Tarantino, 1994; 94% Tomatometer)My third film I want to say is highly recommended — and I’m sure many people have seen all these films, but I’m gonna tell you why — is Pulp Fiction. Pulp Fiction was the first film to me that had a descrambling formula of storytelling, accompanied with the power of perfect dialogue. This moved me artistically. I remember watching this film for the first time in the movie theater, and seeing the character get killed, and then seeing the character come back… He was my favorite character, right? It was John Travolta; at the time, I’m a big John Travolta fan, and Sam Jackson was just breaking out on the scene, but I loved him in the movie as well. But to see the story go into its own twists and turns really resonated with me as an artist and kind of related to the way that hip hop tells our hip hop stories. That’s why I suggest that movie. It descrambled the formula of Hollywood storytelling.Carmen Jones (Otto Preminger, 1954; 74% Tomatometer)A fourth movie I want to recommend is Carmen Jones, with Dorothy Dandridge and Harry Belafonte. First of all, the musicality of it, the acting, the dance numbers, you know. Rodgers and Hammerstein wrote a remarkable play [ed. note: only Oscar Hammerstein worked on Carmen Jones], but these people brought it to life in a magical way. And for me, the slang that was used by the females, and the power of a woman in that movie, when she drove a man to madness. [laughs] It was very magical to me. This movie I watched dozens of times; it’s a very long movie, so to watch it dozens of times shows you that I’ve committed some of my life to this film.American Gangster (Ridley Scott, 2007; 80% Tomatometer)And the last movie I want to recommend is a movie that I’m a part of and it’s called American Gangster. I started to say Man with the Iron Fists. [laughs] Man with the Iron Fists because of the power of dreams, to show that a kid who watched movies and loved movies could one day grow and work with his favorite actors, and bring a movie to life. But that’d be number six, alright? Number five would be American Gangster, because not only is it a film that I’m a part of, but the reason I’m so invested into this movie is because Hollywood invested over $100 million into a black man’s story. This doesn’t happen a lot. It’s a story that captured a time in Harlem when drugs were rampant, music was growing, this whole culture was building up. And even though it shows a negative black man, it still showed the same thing The Godfather showed: the power of family. He did it for family. And it also showed the genius of the black criminal mind when it comes to being an entrepreneur and branding. He had a brand. And being a guy that started a brand like Wu-Tang Clan, when I heard how he made his brand Blue Magic and how he tried to protect his brand, and how he had to fight against others who were infringing upon his brand, it really resonated with me. Denzel Washington gave a great performance, Russell Crowe did as well, and that was a big breakout role for me as well, that movie.Next, RZA talks about Brick Mansions, parkour, and a killer fish recipe.RT: So let’s talk a little bit about Brick Mansions. I want to go back to something you said about 36th Chamber, which is that you found it interesting because it was a story of oppression. Now, although that theme isn’t as much a focal point of Brick Mansions, it is there, and I’m wondering if that partially drew you to the film.RZA: Well for me, really, the main draw for this project was I saw the original. Being a Luc Besson fan and watching Taken and all his movies, I wanted to get a chance to work in his world. But parkour is a unique art form that started in the streets of France and has grown to be a worldwide sensation, like hip hop started in the streets of New York with breakdancing. So I was happy to know that parkour was going to be brought to America, and to be a part of it, for me, was something that was like, “Oh, that’s cool.” I read the role for Tremaine Alexander maybe a year and a half before we started filming. And it came on and went off, came on and went off, and when they finally got the green light to do it, finally got the crew together to do it, and they reached out to me to be a part of it, I was very easily convinced to join. It wasn’t a hard sell for me.First of all, the character… Some of my friends who know about the character said that it’s a great character for us as well. You know, it’s a weird thing in Hollywood that I don’t know yet, because I’m naïve — I’m naïve because of my music thing and me being me, like a self-made person — but it’s a weird thing they say, like, complain about some of the stereotypical things that happen with different actors and different races of actors. Usually, you know, the black guy, he has to be the pimp, or this or this or this. But to me, a character is a character if you accept the character; once you accept the part of being somebody, you have to find that specialty of him in you, or in him. I didn’t find Tremaine, I didn’t understand Tremaine until halfway into filming. I remember the scene. It’s the scene when he walks in with the suit on and the silk scarf, and the girl’s held hostage. That’s when I found him; that exact scene is when I realized who this guy was, and that’s when I embodied him. And you’ll notice, that’s the first time he speaks a little bit more intelligently.RT: And that scene is the first time you get the sense that he’s not just your everyday thug or crime lord. That’s when his personality comes out. I’ve seen the original, District 13, as well, and what’s interesting is that — not to spoil anything for anyone — your character, Tremaine, meets with a very different fate than the boss in the original. I’m wondering if your interpretation of the character had anything to do with that plot change.RZA: I wondered why Luc did that, actually. I wondered this myself. When I was reading it, I wondered who was this guy in Luc’s life? Like, who did he meet that made him feel this way? Because when somebody writes, they’re usually writing from experience or something. I didn’t get a chance to ask him why he wrote the character this way. But, that moment is when I realized that I better make sure to deliver him a certain way, so I made the decision that he was this kind of guy. Because I realized his fate, and thought, “How is anybody gonna give a care that that’s his fate? Who will care? Who is he?”RT: You have to make him somewhat sympathetic.RZA: Yeah. “Who is this guy that his fate is this?” And I thought okay, he has to be different, and I said to myself, “He’s not the toughest guy here.” Even though he’s tough, he’s not the meanest and ugliest guy. Even though somebody would say he’s ugly; he’s kind of handsome, probably, to some people too. But he’s not the dirtiest; he’s not the biggest. What is it about him? And I tried to find that, and I found it in the middle of filming.RT: How much input did you have in interpreting your character in specific ways, like your dialogue or Tremaine’s love of cooking, which you also happen to enjoy?RZA: I’ll say, as an actor, you get to bring some of your elements to the table. But at the same time, some of the elements, you have to take the material and make it into your own. So no, a lot of the material was the material. I got a few lines in there, especially the “Cash rules everything around me,” which I was surprised the director kept. I wasn’t sure if he was going to keep it. The cool thing is that the director, Camille [Delamarre], is a fan of Wu-Tang, and he put certain things in there on his own love. But for me, there was times when I tried to go against the dialogue because of my cadence, and no, he came and corrected me. He’d say, “Luc wants us to say it like this.” And we would say it the proper way, so I had to rehearse it and rehearse it so I could make it feel natural. Some of it wasn’t natural, but I mean, 85-90 percent of it was what was written. Ten percent of me slipped in, and I guess the director liked it because he didn’t edit it out.RT: I mentioned your love of cooking; what’s your favorite recipe?RZA: I don’t eat meat any more, but I could hook up a great steak for you. I make the best fish. I make fish, whether you want it steamed or fried. Actually, my favorite thing to do with fish is to wrap it up in foil — first cut up all your seasonings, whatever you want to season with — wrap it up with foil, a little vinegar, butter, and olive oil; close it, then you start the grill. You take it and you sit the fish on the grill for 30 minutes, and you cut holes in the foil so the smoke can seep in. Listen, it’s so good that — I don’t eat fish — my family wakes me up every few weeks and be like, “Can you go make the fish?” [laughs] Like, man, I don’t even know how it tastes any more.RT: You’re releasing a new Wu-Tang album this year, but only making one physical copy. What, for you, is the ideal scenario you foresee coming out of this unique idea?RZA: For the Once Upon a Time in Shaolin album, I see us recognizing and accepting the artistic value of our music once again. To return us back to understanding the value of our music. That’s more important.RT: Can I get an advance copy of that?RZA: [laughs] Uh, wow…[Ed. note: I took that as a “no.”]Brick Mansions opens this weekend in theaters.","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"Critics, mockumentary, Rocky, song, TV, Character, e., 24, Sabrina, on, 2021","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Five-Favorite-Films-with-RZA.jpg","slug":"five-favorite-films-with-rza"},{"id":"47508839082212","title":"Five Favorite Films with Saoirse Ronan","content":"Five Favorite Filmsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Five Favorite Films with Saoirse RonanThe star of The Grand Budapest Hotel tells RT about her love for Martin Scorsese and Steve Martin.by Matt Atchity | April 11, 2014 |  CommentsSaoirse Ronan is all over the multiplex these days — the Oscar-nominated Irish actress stars in Wes Anderson’s The Grand Budapest Hotel and has a cameo in Muppets Most Wanted. In an interview with Rotten Tomatoes, Ronan talked about her love for classic cinema, her appreciation for David Lynch, and her experience on the set of The Grand Budapest Hotel.Taxi Driver (Martin Scorsese, 1976; 98% Tomatometer)[Taxi Driver is] a film that really kind of struck me on an emotional level and as somebody who works and can kind of appreciate how films are made. I remember when I saw Taxi Driver for the first time, and I saw the creativity and the imagination that went into the shots that Scorsese chose, and to really kind of capture a very particular kind of New York. I thought it was really wonderful. You know, you can watch certain films and there are certain things that will stick out for you. It can be a great character or a performance or an ensemble performance or whatever, but when everything seems to come into play, it’s always really impressive, I think, when every single cast member is very strong. So I felt like with this film, cinematically, it just kind of ticked all those boxes for me.On the Waterfront (Elia Kazan, 1954; 100% Tomatometer)I remember when I saw On the Waterfront for the first time. With that, it was kind of the chemistry between Brando and Eva Marie Saint that was so gorgeous to watch on screen. And that’s a wonderful film to go back to. And actually, in the film I’m just about to do, one of the relationships that I have with another character kind of really reminds me of their relationship. So that’s lovely.I’m intrigued by your expertise in older films.I’m not an expert.But I’ll tell you, I think a lot of times it takes a while for someone to appreciate something like On the Waterfront. That’s pretty advanced film-watching.Well, I mean I remember when I was younger and someone that I worked with got me the book The Story of Film by Mark Cousins. It’s a fantastic book. It’s actually really great because there are so many people who are real film buffs who kind of eat, drink cinema. Whenever I have the time, especially over the last few years, I’ve tried to see as much as I could. But, you know, I grew up watching older films and listening to older music and things like that. My mom’s mother actually was a real film buff when she was growing up in Dublin, and used to write letters to, you know, Cary Grant and people like that, and Humphrey Bogart. She always had a real love for cinema. I think my mom kind of just passed that on to me a little bit. So I grew up with that kind of stuff.Three Amigos (John Landis, 1986; 56% Tomatometer)And then just, even like comedies of the 1980s, I mean the Three Amigos, I grew up with…That’s such a great movie.It’s such a great movie. I was just talking to someone about it actually and I haven’t seen The Jerk before and we were both saying… she’s a director I just worked with and she grew up watching Three Amigos and loved, obviously, Steve Martin and Martin Short and Chevy Chase. It’s such a simple and ridiculous storyline that it just works. It’s like from the off, you’re just in on this little joke, you know. It’s so great. So I loved that when I was growing up. She was telling me The Jerk, I’d never seen The Jerk before, and I watched it a couple of weeks ago for the first time and it was, again, just really great, kind of like, SNL humor that I really love.Eraserhead (David Lynch, 1977; 91% Tomatometer)I remember, like, telling everyone ‘cuz I felt really cool, that I’d seen this older David Lynch film, watching Eraserhead…(Laughing) Oh God.…just trying to figure out what the f— it was about. And I kinda loved it, you know. And then I looked up Q&amp;As that he had done afterwards, and that was kind of the point for him, I think, was to have people kind of ask questions and make up, in a way, their own story for this bizarre character. And I really loved that, and I hoped, God, if I ever got to make a film or anything, it would be such an interesting way to go about it, you know. To kind of make everything so nonsensical that people are forced to make sense out of it themselves.Right. It’s like abstract painting in a way.Yeah. Yeah. Almost. Which is great. And it’s always great when films can do that as well. (Laughing) Maybe not quite as abstract as Eraserhead; I mean it’s nice to know what it’s about. But, yeah, just to be able to almost leave your own mark on a film or take what you want away from it is a lovely thing.Windy City Heat (Bobcat Goldthwait, 2003; No Tomatometer Score)What’s the name of that film? Was it Jimmy Kimmel that was involved in it? Windy City Heat? It’s this guy, oh God, what’s his name again? I can’t remember. [Editor’s note: Perry Caravello.] He’s Italian-American and, you know, he’s been in the game a long time, and you see footage of him going into auditions and things like that, and he literally thinks he’s, like, the next Marlon Brando. He really believes he’s gonna be the next Marlon Brando. And his friends create this whole film, this fake movie, that he lands the lead part in. They like shoot the film, there’s loads of things that go wrong. And he’s got an awful attitude, like, he’s really cocky and everything. Anyway, the film came out. They released it. They released, like, the making-of, and I think he kind of put two and two together. And he’s done interviews since then and says, “I was in on the joke the whole time! I knew what was going on! I knew what was going on!” And I don’t think he did. And it’s really heartbreaking then to go back to it then and realize that he didn’t know. He really heard that he had gotten this lead part in the film, you know. You should check it out. It’s funny. Jimmy Kimmel’s involved in that, I think.RT: How much fun was it to work on The Grand Budapest Hotel?Saoirse Ronan: It was amazing. It was literally like stepping into a world that you know can only be created by one man, and that unless you’re asked to come back, you’ll never be a part of again. From the hotel that we stayed in to the food that we ate to just the set that was built for us to play in, it was all so Anderson-esque. It’s great because for the likes of me and Tony [Revolori], and even Ralph [Fiennes] as well I’m sure, we were the newbies. And everyone else had worked with Wes before, and he does have a very particular way of working. I mean, everything was planned out beforehand. And that comes down to the time allotted for each shot in the film. It’s kind of that meticulous. So to come into that, it kind of throws you for a second and you need to adapt to it. So being around people who have been working with him for… you know, some people like [cinematographer] Bobby Yeoman had been working with him for over 20 years. And I think that just puts you at ease to be with these people who are so, so good at what they do and kinda know Wes and respect Wes so much. Yeah, we had a great time. Costumes were great and, you know, it was lovely.Do you feel like you can bake particularly delicious delicacies? Because you looked like you knew what you were doing in that movie.(Laughing) I did look like, yeah… that’s why I’m called an actor. I got paid to do it too! No, I’ve only baked a little bit.The Grand Budapest Hotel is currently in theatres.","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"Disney, female, awards, what, Heroines, Pirates, 2015, Valentine's, Ice, Mindy, movies, Golden, emmy, Fox","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/saoirse.jpg","slug":"five-favorite-films-with-saoirse-ronan"},{"id":"47508837180632","title":"Zoe Kazan’s Five Favorite Films","content":"Five Favorite Filmsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Zoe Kazan's Five Favorite Filmsby Catherine Pricci | August 5, 2014 |  CommentsZoe Kazan‘s accomplishments include films such as Me and Orson Welles, Fracture, and Revolutionary Road, as well as Ruby Sparks, which also marked her writing debut.When asked about her Five Favorite Films, she said, “That is so hard. I feel like, to make a list of five favorite films, it would take twenty years.” This week, she stars alongside Daniel Radcliffe in What If, an indie dramedy about the instant chemistry between two people and the friendship that bonds them. But first, read on for Zoe Kazan’s Five Favorite Films.Contempt (Jean-Luc Godard, 1963; 93% Tomatometer)Contempt would definitely be on there. I’ll start by pitching that one out. I just think Contempt is one of the most perfect movies ever made. Just the blend of dark comedy and tragedy and the acting in it; the way it’s shot, I mean everything about it. I think I saw that movie for the first time maybe at twenty-two? And it just had my mind blown. It felt like I had never seen anything remotely like that before.Notorious (Alfred Hitchcock, 1946; 94% Tomatometer)I’m going to put Hitchcock’s Notorious on there — the Ingrid Bergman and Cary Grant film — because I think that was one of the first films that I saw as a child where I felt like, “Ok, that’s my favorite movie.” I thought it was the most romantic movie I had ever seen. It’s impeccably written, impeccably constructed, and her performance in it, I think, is really peerless actually. She’s so simple and detailed. It’s a kind of perfect spy movie. I really love that genre and I think she’s incredible in it. I actually think she’s a really under-rated actress.The Apartment (Billy Wilder, 1960; 93% Tomatometer)I’m going to put The Apartment on there. Shirley MacLaine and Jack Lemmon. You know, Billy Wilder is just one of my favorite filmmakers ever. That movie is one that has grown with me. That’s another movie that I definitely saw as a child and have felt differently about as I’ve gotten older. Its really about two lonely people and it’s so sweet and so funny, and the score — I think it’s the Charles Williams orchestra that does the score on that. I’m not going to get that right, but the score is just so, so beautiful. I feel like I can just hear the refrain of that and cry. I think it’s really a perfect movie.Murmur of the Heart (Louis Malle, 1971; 90% Tomatometer)I’m going to go with Murmur of the Heart, the Louis Malle film. That’s one that I’ve seen in the last couple years that has become a new favorite. It’s about a little boy growing up and his love for his mother and the complication of being a child and becoming an adult and living in that liminal space. That movie really broke my heart and surprised me in just one hundred ways.Groundhog Day (Harold Ramis, 1993; 97% Tomatometer)I think that film is just one of the funniest movies ever made. The writing is impeccable. I don’t even think any other comedy has come close to being that smart and original and meaningful and funny. Bill Murray is just insanely good in that part and doing the same thing over and over again, but making every [scene] new. Tracking his progress in that film as he becomes a better person, it’s such detailed work. And we don’t often acknowledge comedy acting in awards or other things. I really think his performance in that is completely brilliant — everything about it. Even down to the stupid song that they sing on that little green in the center of the movie and the Sonny &amp; Cher song that plays every time his alarm clock goes off. Every touch to it is clever and poignant. I genuinely think I’ve seen that film more than any other movie. That movie’s high on my list.What If opens in limited release this week.","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"Infographic, Musicals, supernatural, Channel, comiccon, toy, heist, telelvision, Month, Tarantino, YA, the, Network, Oscars","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Zoe-Kazans-Five-Favorite-Films.jpg","slug":"zoe-kazans-five-favorite-films"},{"id":"47508839096555","title":"Five Favorite Films with Joe Swanberg","content":"Five Favorite Filmsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Five Favorite Films with Joe SwanbergThe director of Drinking Buddies and this week's 24 Exposures shares his love for the early 1970s.by Tim Ryan | January 24, 2014 |  CommentsYou could make a case that Joe Swanberg is the hardest working man in indie cinema. In 2013, he acted in four films (most notably the Certified Fresh slasher flick You’re Next) and directed two more: the critically-acclaimed comedy Drinking Buddies, starring Olivia Wilde and Jake Johnson, and a low-key dramedy about an aging actress (All the Light in the Sky). His latest, 24 Exposures, hit theaters this week, and it’s a dark thriller about a fetish photographer who becomes the target of an investigation when a model is murdered. Given his thematic range, it’s no surprise that Swanberg has diverse taste in movies, as he demonstrated in an interview with RT.Bob &amp; Carol &amp; Ted &amp; Alice (Paul Mazursky, 1969; 91% Tomatometer)That’s probably my favorite film right now. Drinking Buddies was very inspired by this movie. I just love how it managed to be a real successful mainstream Hollywood comedy but it’s really complicated. The characters in this film are married, they have children, they’re still talking about open sexual relationships, and doing drugs, it just… it feels real to me, is how it feels. I’m very impressed by it, not only for its sense of humor which I think is spot on, but also for its sort of willingness to dip into dramatic elements and to have central characters who are not necessarily likeable all the time, who are, you know, sort of confused and behaving in very human realistic ways.The Heartbreak Kid (Elaine May, 1972; 90% Tomatometer)I think it’s one of the funniest movies ever made. I think Charles Grodin is hugely underrated as a comedic actor. I think he’s brilliant. Jeannie Berlin who recently got a lot of attention again because of Kenneth Lonergan’s movie Margaret is amazing in this movie — she was actually nominated for an Oscar for it. Cybill Shepherd is great. I just love it, I love how what a s— the central character is, he’s really totally selfish and also really confused, in a great way. I also love that a lot of the comedy typically in movies like this, with sort of high concept plots, the comedy and the drama are driven by the central character lying to the people around them. But weirdly in The Heartbreak Kid, most of the drama comes from him telling the truth, he’s sort of excessively honest and straight forward, and it still manages to complicate these situations and cause a lot of tension and hurt feelings, but I just love Elaine May, I like all of her movies.Even Ishtar?Even Ishtar. I think the first 20 minutes of Ishtar is some of the best filmmaking of the 1980s, certainly some of the best comic filmmaking I’ve ever seen. The movie loses steam for me when they get to Ishtar, and I’ve seen that movies 15 times, I have a lot of theories about why it stops working as well, but it’s never bad even when it sort of slows down, but the first 20 minutes I think are genius.That’s the funny thing about movies that have a toxic reputation — I remember watching Heaven’s Gate and thinking, why did everyone think this is bad?A lot of these stories leak out before the movie’s finished and they really paint the way people end up watching the thing. Ishtar is great, Mikey and Nicky‘s great, I think she’s really, one of the biggest tragedies of modern filmmaking that we don’t have more movies from her. Ishtar stopped her career right when it was getting great. If she had worked more, we would have several more masterpieces from her.Stop Making Sense (Jonathan Demme, 1984; 97% Tomatometer)It’s one of the movies I’ve probably seen the most number of times. It’s almost perfect. It’s really, just beautiful to look at. The music’s incredible, I’m a big David Byrne/ Talking Heads fan. The show that they put on is great. I love the way that it sort of builds over the course of this film and starts with this very simple set, and at the end is this elaborate rock concert. Jonathan Demme does an amazing job pointing the camera at the right things all the time and not making a big deal about it, letting the performers sort of be the center of the action. It’s got a great sense of humor, but it’s also serious, and kind of captures that band at the height of what they were doing. [David Byrne’s] presence in that movie, he’s a movie star. As the lead of that movie even though it’s a concert movie, I think he’s so amazing.Nashville (Robert Altman, 1975; 95% Tomatometer)You seem to really like the early 1970s, don’t you?Yeah, it’s maybe a problem.Not at all, they made great movies then.I do like movies from other time periods, by the way. There is something, it’s sort of a sweet spot for me — societally, culturally, artistically, whatever sort of groove they hit right there — that appeals to my sensibilities. Nashville is endlessly inspiring to me, everything that I do is aiming for that sort of mixture of casualness and kind of amazing f— it sort of attitude, but combined with these incredible performances and story and structure. It’s probably been the single biggest influence, since the first time I saw it, over how I approach movies. That movie fills me with a tremendous sense of freedom when I come into a new project, that I can do whatever I want. There aren’t rules for how to make movies and I also love that Altman was like 50 when he made that movie. That’s inspiring to me as well, that we sort of live in a culture that values, like, people’s first films or first books or first record, fully formed right out of the gate, or whatever. Most of my favorite filmmakers didn’t have careers that looked like that. They sort of kept challenging themselves and trying new things. And for me, Nashville is this amazing thing, whenever I feel pressure that my career should maybe look different than it looks right now. I’m 32 years old right now. Altman made Nashville when he was 50. I have time to keep getting better and pushing towards this stuff. The best is yet to come. So that’s great. Beyond that, I love the music, I love the way it looks, it’s just a great movie.Crumb (Terry Zwigoff, 1995; 95% Tomatometer)It’s in my top five list of best films ever made. I just think it’s perfect. It’s an amazing portrait of an artist, an amazing portrait of a family, Crumb is an incredible central character. I feel like whenever I watch that movie — I sort of watch it every couple years — I start talking like him afterwards. I mean he really infects me in a way that totally changes the way that I look at the world. All great artists have that sort of ability. When I read some of my favorite novelists after I put down one of their books, I’m thinking in their words. I’m seeing the world through their eyes and it’s the same with Crumb. I’m a big fan of his comics, but that film does such an amazing job putting you kind of in his headspace. It also looks amazing, it’s shot on film, Zwigoff does an incredible job framing Crumb’s world, and the Jazz music. it’s just great, I just think it’s great. I think the movie’s a pleasure to watch. I mean, his brother Charles is f—ing incredible, man. Like, the idea that this family produced not one great artist, three great artists. And that Crumb was actually the one who was political enough and sophisticated enough and just barely enough of a people person that his art got seen. But, you know, Charles and Matt also were like really pushing the boundaries of the stuff and also hugely influential on Crumb’s stuff. You don’t get Robert without Charles. You just never sort of have access to those stories the way that this documentary has access to that family. It’s a lot to think about, the artwork that we end up getting as a culture, you know, often times is less about what’s better, and more about how savvy the artist is and how able they are to kind of be in the right place at the right time so that there’s an audience for the work.I love that you said R. Crumb is more of a “people person.”Barely, barely. Barely, but just enough. I watched that movie and even though he’s, like, a completely selfish, misogynistic piece of s—, I wanna’ be near him, you know, he’s got whatever that sort of quality is. And it is his intelligence and his talent and his sense of humor and all that stuff, but it’s also he’s incredibly self-aware and self-analytical. It’s not that he’s this kind of idiot savant guy who’s socially awkward or whatever. He really has a very clear-eyed view of himself that’s actually worth striving for, I feel like, as a person, to sort of be that comfortable with yourself and unashamed. In a really healthy way, in a way that feels really healthy.24 Exposures opens in limited release this weekend.","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"reboot, Box, Returns","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/swanberg.jpg","slug":"five-favorite-films-with-joe-swanberg"},{"id":"47508839108849","title":"Five Favorite Films with Matthew McConaughey","content":"Five Favorite Filmsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Five Favorite Films with Matthew McConaugheyThe star of Dallas Buyers Club offers up his favorite movies.by RT Staff | November 8, 2013 |  CommentsMatthew McConaughey has played a wide variety of characters over his career, and his resume includes a fair share of popular favorites: Dazed and Confused, Frailty, Killer Joe, Tropic Thunder and even a guest stint on the HBO television series Eastbound &amp; Down. Recently, he’s earned a lot of praise for his performances in The Lincoln Lawyer, Magic Mike, and Mud. We’ll have to wait for Christmas to see him next in The Wolf of Wall Street, but right now, McConaughey’s impressive portrayal of real-life HIV-infected cowboy Ron Woodroof in Dallas Buyers Club is already stirring up a whirlwind of acclaim. In other words, we know what we like, but what movies make Matthew McConaughey tick? He indulges us now with his Five Favorite Films.&nbsp;Hud (Martin Ritt, 1963; 79% Tomatometer)Family, generations, hero worship, a classic American landscape and anti hero… Paul Newman, a lead with no arc. A bastard, an ass, a great character who never wavers in his ornery and despicable ways, yet I loved him. Great example of how brilliant drama can happen even if the lead character never changes. P.S. – Patricia Neal, “You want an orange? I’ll peel it for ya.” Wow.Angel Heart (Alan Parker, 1987; 78% Tomatometer)The thriller; superstitions, New Orleans, Mickey Rourke, a barefoot Lisa Bonet in soft white eyelet cotton dresses on sandy roads… The sex scene where the blood drips from the ceiling, intercut with the boy on the street tap dancing for change… Ceiling fans.Adaptation (Spike Jonze, 2002; 91% Tomatometer)The scene in the swamp at the end when the brothers talk about love and betrayal and he says, “It didn’t matter if she loved me. I loved her.” Poetry. A life lesson. Also, most effective car crash I’ve seen on film: jarring and lethal, it makes me feel like I’m the one getting hit every time I see it… Nicolas Cage acting with Nicolas Cage.The Indian Runner (Sean Penn, 1991; 74% Tomatometer)Brothers, family, blood, loyalty, and the thin line between civilization and human nature. Viggo Mortenson.The Master (Paul Thomas Anderson, 2012; 85% Tomatometer)A fictional screenplay with fictional characters made so well that it felt like a biographical nonfiction drama, like a considerately staged documentary. Identity of place and people. I could smell and taste it.","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"TCA, Cartoon, Films, Pet","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Untitled-1.jpg","slug":"five-favorite-films-with-matthew-mcconaughey"},{"id":"47508839100653","title":"Five Favorite Films with Michael B.

JordanThe star of Fruitvale Station runs down his all-time faves.by Luke Goodsell | January 15, 2014 |  CommentsMichael B. Jordan’s star is making a rapid ascent. Following a breakout performance in the surprise sci-fi hit Chronicle, the young actor took on the lead role in Fruitvale Station, Ryan Coogler’s Sundance darling that went on to find both commercial and critical success in 2013. As Oscar Grant, the 22-year-old Bay Area kid gunned down by cops at a BART station, Jordan delivered an impressive performance that some are pegging as an outside shot at an Oscar nomination. With Fruitvale Station hitting Blu-ray and DVD this week, Jordan called in to drop his Five Favorite Films.GoodFellas (Martin Scorsese, 1990; 97% Tomatometer)GoodFellas is one. You know, Scorsese’s an amazing director. It set the tone for a lot of gangster films and mob films.Rounders (John Dahl, 1998; 65% Tomatometer)Rounders, with Matt Damon and John Malkovich. Incredible movie. I love poker. I mean, I’m not amazing at it, but I love watching it. That was a cool film; a cool poker film. I loved it.Sugar Hill (Leon Ichaso, 1994; 20% Tomatometer)Sugar Hill is one of my favorite movies. I love that one. Wesley Snipes, man. He’s gotta come back around.Trading Places (John Landis, 1983; 88% Tomatometer)Trading Places, another one of my favorite movies. [Laughs.] Dan Aykroyd and Eddie Murphy are so funny in it.I was just watching Coming to America. Remember when the old guys show up in that?Yeah! [Laughs.] “Randolph, Randolph! We’re back!” I love the callbacks they do in that movie. Eddie Murphy does some great callbacks in his movies.Bad Boys (Michael Bay, 1995; 43% Tomatometer)I’m gonna go ahead and say Bad Boys — the first one. Definitely one of my favorites. There’s something about those movies that I can watch over and over again. It’s like asking a musician what their favorite song is. It’s so hard. But those are five of my favorites.Fruitvale Station is released this week on Blu-ray and DVD.","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"Reality, Christmas, parents, romantic","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/safd.jpg","slug":"five-favorite-films-with-michael-b-jordan"},{"id":"47508839090407","title":"Five Favorite Films with Jake Gyllenhaal","content":"Five Favorite Filmsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Five Favorite Films with Jake GyllenhaalThe star of Enemy can't stop gushing over his favorite films.by Catherine Pricci | March 11, 2014 |  CommentsJake Gyllenhaal pulls double duty in his new film Enemy, which hits theaters this Friday, March 14. With great movies like Donnie Darko, Brokeback Mountain, and Prisoners — in which he teamed up with Enemy director Denis Villeneuve for the first time — on his resumé, it should be no surprise that Gyllenhaal is also a fan of some great films himself.Like many stars we interview, Gyllenhaal found it difficult to narrow down his choices; when the question was posed, he cited the play The Real Thing, saying, “It starts off with a guy talking about how he has to basically do a top ten of his favorite songs of all time. It is so hard and, it’s hard to stay true to who you are and who you want to be, so let me just explain this and say that, there’s no particular order. I’m going with my unconscious here, which I don’t think believes in order or hierarchy.” Read on to see how much he geeks-out over Josh Brolin and how sentimental an old Italian film makes him.Searching for Bobby Fischer (Steven Zaillian, 1993; 100% Tomatometer)The first movie that comes to my mind when somebody asks me about favorites is Searching for Bobby Fischer by Steve Zaillian. First of all, it’s a beautifully, beautifully shot and acted movie. I mean, the screenplay is brilliant, but more than anything, Conrad Hall shot the movie, and it’s one of the best performances I’ve seen by an actor of any age in a movie. The honesty and the presence of the lead kid in the movie is amazing. And every actor surrounding him is extraordinary, from Joan Allen, and Laurence Fishburne, Joe Mantegna, Ben Kingsley; Laura Linney plays like a one scene role in the movie. Like a virtually unknown at the time, Laura Linney. And just the story of father and son and the score is beautiful. It is inevitably one that I am always drawn to, and I think it’s filled with hope but also like a real darkness and the beauty of childhood.La Strada (Federico Fellini, 1954; 97% Tomatometer)The next I would say is La Strada because, well, do I really have to say? I feel like it’s sort of self-explanatory. Like [laughs] Giulietta Masina, I mean every performance, but particularly the last scene in the movie, with Anthony Quinn and just being on the beach, and everything about that movie is beautiful. And there’s something always about his films that, knowing that audio was recorded post shooting the film — I’m pretty sure that’s true with that movie — just to know, in a way, if it is true, it’s just to know that there are two sort of performances happening simultaneously. You can see and hear that. And I love that idea and what skill and sort of the presence to this day that movie has. And it’s also personally really resonant because my father said after he saw that movie, it was what made him want to make movies, and when I finally saw it when I was a teenager, I understood why. So it inevitably has a resonance beyond the brilliance of the movie itself.So it was just something that was prominent in your family, growing up?La Strada? Yeah when I was an infant we were just talking about it. [laughs] No, I just think it sort of tied to that. I mean, I just wonder sometimes if my father hadn’t seen that movie and been so moved by it, you know, would he have met my mother? Would my sister have been born? You know, there’s a lot of “would-haves” and eventually all of us have found our way into the movie business, so you know, that’s just an interesting thing. And you know, you never know how a movie will inspire someone and how it will lead not just one life but many to come. Sort of an interesting idea.Jerry Maguire (Cameron Crowe, 1996; 85% Tomatometer)Another is Jerry Maguire, because inevitably it’s just something I can never turn off whenever it’s on the television, and I think that has a power of its own. I also think that… What is it about that movie? I’m trying to think.Was something going on in your life at the time? That was mid-1990s, right?Yeah, I feel like it’s a quintessential ’90s movie. You know what I mean? I would actually put Jerry Maguire and Fast Times at Ridgemont High right up there with each other, in the same spot. I know I’m filling up two spots but I know Cameron Crowe wrote Fast Times at Ridgemont High, didn’t he? God, I’m really flying by the seat of my pants here. I just want you to know that, like, I have not really thought about this, so you’re getting some legit unconscious. One of my favorite things about that is I watched the DVD commentary and the scene where Phoebe Cates comes out of the pool, and she like takes off her top — apparently Cameron Crowe said that during the time when — the youngins will remember this — but when you would rent VHS tapes, that it was rewound so many times in that one spot that every time she did it would go fuzzy.The Goonies (Richard Donner, 1985; 67% Tomatometer)Goonies, yeah. I mean maybe Goonies is better than Jerry Maguire, though I do love Jerry Maguire. Goonies is just like… I have no words for how awesome Goonies is. I happen to be working with Josh Brolin on this Everest movie I’m about to do, and I still geek out. You know, I want him to wear a headband in the Everest movie because it’s such an amazing character choice. If I remember correctly I feel like he wore sweatpants over jeans in that movie? I’m pretty sure. I might be wrong about that. And that was a pretty dope character choice as well. Just incredible acting, and the scenes with Chunk still move me. And Butterfinger… Oh wait, no. Snickers? What is it, Snickers? My first crush was in Goonies too: Kerri Green. She was in Lucas. She was in Summer Rental. OK? Dude, she… Lucas is a very formidable… I had such a crush on her. Oh my god. If you see her in Lucas, you’d understand.Woman of the Year (George Stevens, 1949; 90% Tomatometer)I don’t know if you can say one of them but Adam’s Rib and Woman of the Year, like the Hepburn/Tracy movies. The two of them together will never, ever age. There are scenes in those movies together that could be when you’re watching them today, in this moment. I remember those movies and my mother would always love those movies, and I would watch those movies with her, particularly Woman of the Year. I remember feeling very specifically about that movie that I love so much, which is how Spencer Tracy cracks his eggs while he’s making an omelet. I will always crack my eggs like Spencer Tracy because of that movie. [laughs]Enemy opens everywhere this Friday.&nbsp;","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"DirecTV","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/jakeg.jpg","slug":"five-favorite-films-with-jake-gyllenhaal"},{"id":"47508839101678","title":"Five Favorite Kung Fu Films with Keanu Reeves","content":"Five Favorite Filmsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Five Favorite Kung Fu Films with Keanu ReevesThe Man of Tai Chi director reflects on his favorites, filmmaking inspirations and his career; plus, watch an exclusive behind-the-scenes clip from the making of the movie.by Luke Goodsell | December 13, 2013 |  CommentsLike a cool breeze blowing through the mountains of modern movies, Keanu Reeves has endured as something of an unlikely cinema icon. Not just the star of summer smashes such as Speed and The Matrix, he’s also amassed an impressive resume that includes performances in left-field American classics like River’s Edge, A Scanner Darkly and My Own Private Idaho, while continuing to flourish in the popular imagination, of course, as the irrepressibly excellent stoner, Theodore “Ted” Logan.Having served as the inquisitive anchor on last year’s digital-vs-film documentary Side by Side, Reeves recently made his feature directing debut with Man of Tai Chi, a kung fu tournament movie wrapped in a reality-TV-style satire. With the movie releasing on Blu-ray and DVD this week, we talked with Reeves about his filmmaking inspirations, his acting career, and more.First up, he ran down his five favorite kung fu movies.Enter the Dragon (Robert Clouse, 1973; 95% Tomatometer)Alright, so to begin this list I’m going to start with one of my first impressions of kung fu films; my childhood experience. So: Enter the Dragon. As a young child, you must see Bruce Lee, and Enter the Dragon.It’s ground zero for kids getting into kung fu movies.It is. It is for many people. I grew up in Toronto, and in the late ’70s, early ’80s, there was an independent channel that would show kung fu movies late at night. And as a young kid I had a little black-and-white TV set, and so I was exposed to these films — but I couldn’t tell you their titles, because I was 11- and 12-years-old. [Laughs] I didn’t write them down in my diary. But I remember really enjoying them: the costumes, the fighting, the stories, you know; I mean, just all the different styles, and watching these people do these amazing things. But then there was Enter the Dragon, which I actually saw in a movie theatre. I saw it in Times Square; I was taken there by my stepfather. And that film — I mean, what a charismatic performance, right? And that story. The drugs, the mystery, the sex; it was very James Bond-ian, wasn’t it? I’d been exposed to that kind of storytelling. But again, the drama, the music, the flashbacks, the beginning — as the tournament fights are starting — very, very cool. The super fight at the end, the fight in the mirrors, the claw! [Laughs] So that was fun.5 Fingers of Death (Chang-hwa Jeong, Chung Chang-whu; 1973; 83% Tomatometer)Then at the time there was also a film called 5 Fingers of Death. That might have been a Shaw brothers film. Oh wait, no, no, no — who are those other cats?I think it might be a Shaw brothers one.Yeah? Well, what struck me as a kid was when the guy jumps up in the air and takes the eyeballs out. I mean, I was a young person; I was just like, “What?!” [Laughs] Yeah! And I saw that on the big screen, so I always remember that making an impression. And I’m sure there were things going on in there — about the gangs, and the betrayal, and the student and the revenge — that were a bit above my consciousness at the time. I don’t know, but I always felt like there was some kind of political and social agenda in there somewhere.It does, but when you’re a kid, what you remember is the guy getting his eyeballs snatched out.Yeah… but even there, I mean, the film had a duplicity, right? People were lying and pretending to be things, and he kind of goes on this quest to avenge all of that. He’s a truth-seeker and he gets used. [Laughs] And it was moody. I remember it as being moody. It was night-time. And also the composition: people just huddled on one side of the room, talking. And it had some martial arts. I don’t remember it having a lot of [camera] under-cranking in it. I’m sure there was. You know, doing 22-frame, 22-23-frame stuff.Was this sort of thing on your mind when you were shooting Man of Tai Chi? ‘Cause there’s not a lot of slow-mo. I mean, there are a few shots, but it seems like you were consciously going for a more old-fashioned style.Yeah, I mean there’s a lot of old, and a lot of modern. There’s the Steadicam stuff — there’s a lot of Steadicam stuff in the fight scenes.I feel like a lot of your conversation scenes in this were just as active in terms of camera movement.Sometimes. [Laughs] Absolutely, sometimes. And sometimes it’s just two-shots. I think what I tried to do, especially with out Hong Kong stuff, was to try and have a lot of angles. So also, in the fights, you’re seeing the scene, but you’re seeing it from different perspectives. You know, when someone gets a phone call, it’s like “Whoosh!” Up-top. On-the-side. Down-below. You know? A lot of what the film’s about is perspective. I tried to put people there for the moment, whatever that moment may have been. [Laughs]Fist of Legend (Gordon Chan, 1994; 100% Tomatometer)Let’s go to Fist of Legend. Yuen Woo-ping directing [choreography for] Jet Li. I was shown that film by the Wachowskis before shooting The Matrix, and that was like, “This is amazing.” The storytelling and the fights are what I really like. It’s just good, hard, Yuen Woo-ping choreography; Jet Li’s awesome; there’s a lot of fighting… yeah, I’m definitely gonna say that one. A good, clean, awesome fight movie.Tai Chi Master (Yuen Woo-ping, 1993; 86% Tomatometer)I kinda wanna go to Jet Li again, which is kinda not right — we should probably do some Jackie Chan, right? Drunken Master, Drunken Master II, maybe? I don’t know, I just wanted to do a costume one, you know — like Tai Chi Master. There’s something really beautiful about that one, the scope. Sometimes the scope doesn’t have power to it. This one does. I’m gonna put that one in here as a “highly recommend.”The Matrix* (Andy Wachowski and Larry Wachowski, 1999; 87% Tomatometer)You know, I’m gonna throw The Matrix out there, I think.Whoa.[Laughs] I think I’m gonna throw The Matrix out there as a seminal, modern kind of “keeping the dream alive” of the kung fu movie. Does it need an asterisk? I don’t know. Is it a kung fu movie? I would say there’s enough kung fu in there to make it a kung fu movie. I think so.The kung fu is solid in that movie.It’s solid! I think the subway fight is pretty good. Yeah… I don’t know. But I think if we were just going by kung fu fight, then I think you’d have to take Reloaded. If we’re just going by fights. Even just that one sequence, with the Smith fight, and the choreography in that — when all those Smiths come out — I mean, that’s just insane, that fight sequence.I’ll put an asterisk next to it for you.Okay, yeah.Next, Keanu Reeves on his unlikely inspiration for Man of Tai Chi, which sequels he would and wouldn’t do, and his future plans for directing. Plus, see an exclusive behind-the-scenes clip.Reeves directs star Tiger Chen in Man of Tai Chi&nbsp;Was there any particular film, or films, that you looked at to prepare for Man of Tai Chi? You obviously have a head full of kung fu movies.Keanu Reeves: You know, we looked at the cinematography of the films Tiger [Chen] had acted in. We looked at a lot of films. I was looking at them mostly for camera angles and editing, just to see how they were shot and what people were doing. I kinda just went into the library. But mostly, for me aesthetic-wise, the film that I was probably looking at the most was Funny Games by Michael Haneke.That’s interesting. I guess you’ve got the whole “reality TV/ fight” angle going in Man of Tai Chi.Yeah, ’cause I wanted to play with the subjective and the fourth wall a lot in Man of Tai Chi, and with Funny Games I liked the composition and those characters looking into the camera. I liked how that worked. So that film, I would say, had the most impact for me, cinematically, on this one.Looking at your career, you basically went to the best film school in the world; I mean, the people you worked with — from Francis Coppola to Gus Van Sant to the Wachowskis to Richard Linklater, the list goes on — was there a specific moment where you caught the directing bug, or did it happen organically over time?I mean, catching a bug is pretty organic. [Laughs] You know, when I was acting, I always loved the floor — where was the camera going, you know? I’m one of those actors who likes to see the finished film, as opposed to not, ’cause I wanna see what the directors did.So many actors never watch their film, which is weird.Yeah. I mean, I get it. But for me, I like to see, when you go to tell this story, how did they tell it?You’re a student of cinema, as you showed in Side by Side.Yeah.With River Phoenix in Gus van Sant’s My Own Private Idaho&nbsp;Was there any film of yours where you went, “Wow, I didn’t know it was going to turn out like that“? I guess The Matrix might be the obvious answer there.For sure. If only for the simple reason of having the visual effects in it. But I would say another experience of that, for sure, would be My Own Private Idaho. Gus [Van Sant] did such a lovely story. And River [Phoenix], of course. That film, definitely; I was very curious to see what that would be.There were some stories recently to mark the 20th anniversary of River’s death. Was he on your mind?Yeah, of course. Absolutely. I miss him very much.Okay, I’m not gonna ask you about Bill and Ted ’cause I’m sure you’re sick of answering the third movie questions — and don’t get me wrong, I love those movies.[Laughs] Okay.But let me ask you this: Are there any other of your movies that, in a fantasy world, you’d love to do a sequel to?Ah, I wish I had a chance to play Constantine again. I liked that character. I wish the producers had followed up on that more than they did. I think that Francis Lawrence did a great job. It’s definitely an adaptation of the source material, but I thought we did it in the spirit of it, certainly. I really did enjoy playing that role.Have you ever talked to Kathryn Bigelow about making a sequel to Point Break?[Laughs] Yeah… I don’t know. I think there was talk of it many, many, many years ago, but I guess it never came to pass. I guess that journey was done, you know? Vaya con dios. [Laughs][Laughs] Don’t mess with what’s perfect.Yeah.I’d like to see you revisit the characters from River’s Edge.Oh my gosh, like, “Where are they now?”Where do you think those guys would be now, if they’re even alive?I just hope [Reeves’ character] Matt’s not selling insurance. [Laughs][Laughs] That’s the worst possible outcome.Yeah, I know. That’d just be bad.Now that you’ve made your first film, are you gonna be directing more? It feels like, between this and Side by Side, your interests might be gravitating to behind the camera.Yeah, I would love to. I really enjoyed it, and I’m looking for a story to tell. Absolutely.How about you just direct the third Bill and Ted?Well, I’d go direct it with Alex Winter. [Laughs] No, absolutely not.You know, I think it’s time Alex got back behind the camera — Freaked is really something.Ahhhh, yes!

In time for the 2014 Winter Olympics kickoff, Legendary Olympic diver Greg Louganis discusses his five favorite films and Back on Board, the new documentary about his life since his historic Olympic wins.by Kerr Lordygan | February 7, 2014 |  CommentsIn honor of the 2014 Winter Olympics commencement, we decided to hit up an Olympic superstar for his Five Favorite Films. We all know Greg Louganis swept the diving events of the 1984 and 1988 Olympics, winning gold medals in both (even after he tragically hit his head on the board during one unfortunate dive). But diving isn’t Greg’s only competitive aptitude. He’s been strongly active in dog agility competitions and will be acting as commentator this Saturday, February 8, for the The Masters Agility Championship at Westminster live on FOX Sports (7-9pm ET / 4-6pm PT). Greg tells us this will be the first year that mixed breeds will be competing. Many don’t realize, though, that Greg also has an acting background, and has been in films such as Watercolors, Touch Me, It’s My Party and an episode of Portlandia. Greg’s autobiographical book, Breaking the Surface (New York Times #1 Best Seller for five weeks) was turned into a film of the same name, and he was the diving coach on last year’s celebrity competition show, Splash. Most importantly, though, Greg has been a role-model and coach to young athletes and artists, and those struggling with sexual identity and bullying. A new documentary film about Greg called Back on Board: Greg Louganis is currently hitting the festival circuit. We were thrilled to have him dive into his Five Favorite Films for us.Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Alfonso Cuarón, 2004; 91% Tomatometer)Generally, if any of the Harry Potter movies comes up, it’s like, I drop everything and I watch (laughing). But that’s, what, that’s eight movies.Do you have a favorite of them?I’d have to say that my favorite one of them… You know, I like the first two Dumbledores, Sorcerer’s Stone and Chamber of Secrets. I like that Dumbledore. The other Dumbledore, I mean, later on he was much better, in the later ones. But Prisoner of Azkaban was a little over the top for me, for the Dumbledore. He was a little kooky. Which was disappointing because, I would have to say, that Prisoner of Azkaban was my favorite story of the series.So would you claim that as your favorite one, or did Dumbledore ruin it for you?Yeah kind of… It didn’t ruin it completely. But I still use Prisoner of Azkaban as an example in teaching kids how to deal with fear. I use that as an example in teaching, you know, young divers, young athletes or young kids how to address their fears. You know, I ask them, OK what’s a Boggart? “Well a Boggart is a shape-shifter that turns into your greatest fear.” How do you transform a Boggart? “The spell is Riddikulus, you change it into something really, really ridiculous.” Well, how do you banish a Boggart? “You laugh at it.” And so that’s the same way you deal with your fear. You turn it into something really, really ridiculous, so ridiculous that you laugh at it, so it takes the power out of the fear.Very powerful. And these are kids that you’re training?Uh-huh, yeah. I do that for, you know, dive camps. Because kids will be learning new dives, they’ll smack and they’ll get scared. And then the fear inhibits their ability to be successful. It’s a little exercise that I give them in order to try and overcome those fears. Because those are some of the things that I did kind of naturally as a kid through my diving career, but I didn’t realize I was doing it. I mean, I didn’t call it a Boggart, I didn’t call it a spell Riddikulous. I didn’t call it those things. But I knew that if I could make it something ridiculous and I could laugh at it, I was able to relax and be more successful. That [film] kind of stands out for that reason since I use it so much. I was just up at Tualatin Hills, you know the dive club there. And somebody asked, “How do you address fear, how do you deal with fear?” And I always use that. It’s getting so the younger kids are, like, scratching their heads, “What is he talking about?” But some of the older kids are like right on it.Breaking the Surface (Steven Hilliard Stern, 1997; No Tomatometer Score)[Laughs] You know, why not? Breaking the Surface. Because it was just sort of revisiting… coming full circle with my dad. It was a real powerful time in my life. A powerful time of healing. And to have it, you know, to have it in a movie? That’s kind of weird, you know?And you were sort of distanced from it a bit, right? I mean, you wrote the book, and you were a consultant and you did the dives.I did the dives, I narrated it, yeah.But did you have much control over it?No, I didn’t have much say-so in the creative end. Although, because I was friends with the director, after the fact when I was up there preparing to do the diving sequences, I saw the dailies and I made a comment about what I saw in the dailies. Like, the Tom character, you know, they show him drinking and lighting up a cigarette. That was totally not Tom — well his real name’s Jim — that was so not Jim at all. Because he was so into control, and was raised Catholic and then Morman. He would not light up a cigarette, would not imbibe in alcohol, would not do any of that stuff. Because he was all about the control.You have to at least try to portray real people correctly.Yeah. So when I made that comment, the director, Steven, he said, “Oh my God, I wish I had known; we don’t have the money to re-shoot everything.” I was like, “No, it’s fine.” Oh, and it was funny because Jeff [Meek], who played Tom in the movie, we went to school together at UC Irvine. I was like, oh my God, whoa. It was really… Because, like, I showed up to the set and I said, “What the hell are you doing here?” “Oh, I’m playing your boyfriend.” I’m like, “Oh, great. OK.”That’s awkward.Yeah. It was funny. I haven’t seen him since, I don’t know what the hell he’s doing.And you were happy? You were pleased with the end product?Yeah. I really was, for what it was. I thought it was really good.Touch Me (H. Gordon Boos, 1997; No Tomatometer Score)Probably the other movie is Touch Me. And that was the one with Amanda Peet and Michael Vartan, that I was in. And that shows up every, like, World AIDS Day, or something, on the Family Channel. It’s a sweet story. You know, it’s a sweet love story. Basically what happens is, Amanda’s character, her college boyfriend, unbeknownst to her, kind of swung both ways and actually was exposed to HIV and he is basically on his death bed, years later. On his death bed, wants to come clean. And I play the boyfriend’s lover. So I reach out to her, say her ex boyfriend was in a car accident to get her to the hospital, so she’ll come and see him. And then he tells her he has AIDS and now he’s dying and asked her if she’s been tested. He wanted to make sure that she was OK. It’s a sweet story.So what did they do right? What made it a touching film for you?Well, I think it’s that journey through, you know, some of the realities of HIV. And those being diagnosed and the insecurities of, “Oh God, nobody will touch me, I’m damaged goods” and that whole emotional roller coaster. Self-destruction, and all of that stuff.Old Yeller (Robert Stevenson, 1957; 100% Tomatometer)I mean this is like total, total nostalgia; the last two would be total nostalgia. That would be Old Yeller. It just, you know… Break out the tissues, have a good cry. I can watch people die left and right, but seeing a dog die, oh my God, it just tears me apart (laughing). It’s like, “Ah yeah, kill the bastard,” you know? “But you hurt that dog, I’ll come after you!” So yeah, Old Yeller is good for a good cry.The Wizard of Oz (Victor Fleming, King Vidor, 1939; 99% Tomatometer)And of course, being the good homo that I am, The Wizard of Oz. It’s gotta be Wizard of Oz. Yeah, because [ex-boyfriend and E! News personality] Steve Kmetko, he had that movie memorized. He could do all of the numbers, you know, from when she lands in Oz and all the little Munchkins… Yeah. I’m not that bad. I’m not that bad.Do you remember the first time you saw it?First time I remember seeing it? They used to air it, was it, Thanksgiving? I know it was around a holiday that they would always play it. I wanna’ say it was Thanksgiving? I was always looking forward to that. Probably my earliest memory would have been when I was, like, 5 or 6, I think. Oh it was fun. It was, it was magic. I loved the magic and, you know, the Scarecrow, the Tin Man, the Cowardly Lion…Did you ever do the play?Hmm… did I ever do the play? You know what, I must have. I’m trying to think. I probably was the Tin Man. Yeah.Because he can dance.Yeah.I guess they all had to dance. But is that who you are in life, you think? The Tin Man?Hmmm…Or are you Dorothy?Yeah, I’m probably Dorothy. Kinda clueless you know. Meandering around, but having a little bit of direction.A little bit of direction… but having a positive attitude and helping people.Yeah.RT: Now, about Back on Board: Greg Louganis, did you produce this?Greg Louganis: : No, no. This is a documentary of my, uh… the twenty years that I disappeared from the public. [laughs] I disappeared for, like, twenty years, and all of a sudden I came back in time for the London Olympics, to work with the divers. It’s kind of what happened all in between there and what I was up to. And there was a lot there. They were planning on ending it at the Olympic Games in London, that was supposed to be the end of it. But things started happening after, like Splash, and then I got married…Congratulations, by the way.ThanksSo when do we get to see it?We’re making the rounds at the film festivals. We didn’t make it into Sundance, unfortunately, but we’re shooting for Tribeca. From there, I’m not certain where else they’re aiming for. I’m going to see it for the first time this Thursday.Back on Board: Greg Louganis is currently entering the festival circuit, so be on the lookout for it soon.","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"Mary, transformers","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/greglouganis.jpg","slug":"five-favorite-films-with-greg-louganis"},{"id":"47508839093481","title":"Five Favorite Films with Ben Wheatley","content":"Five Favorite Filmsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Five Favorite Films with Ben WheatleyThe director of A Field in England offers some insights into his filmmaking process.by Luke Goodsell | February 6, 2014 |  CommentsWith just a handful of features — Down Terrace, Kill List and Sightseers — writer-director Ben Wheatley has established himself as one of the most compelling filmmakers currently working in the UK. His latest film, A Field in England, takes Wheatley’s cinema even further, alchemizing a comic scenario about a gang of 17th-century civil war deserters into a hallucinogenic, black-and-white nightmare that isn’t easy to shake.With the movie arriving in American theaters and on VOD this week, we had the opportunity to speak with Wheatley about his favorite movies — which, in turn, revealed an insight into the filmmaker’s own creative process.“It’s always a hard thing, this listing stuff,” says Wheatley. “I don’t ever have a definitive list of things, I don’t think, and they kind of change around all the time depending on what I’ve seen and what I’m looking at at that point. There are films that I watch a lot — again and again and again — but they’re very particular kinds of movies, you know, they’re movies that will stand that rewatching; and there are some films that I’ve seen once, and will never forget, which could make the list as well.”Here, then, are his Five Favorite Films.Blade Runner (Ridley Scott, 1982; 91% Tomatometer)I guess I’d start with Blade Runner, which is a film I’ve watched many, many times, and bought many times on different formats, and seen in the cinema many times, and bought books about it and read about the making of it, and watched, you know, all the documentaries that I could get my hands on. I think why I like it is that it’s a film that so transports you to somewhere else. It’s not even just about the story, which is reasonably straightforward, it’s the texture of it — every frame of it, every grain of film, or every pixel on Blu-ray or what not, holds information. It’s so densely packed. You can watch it again and again and see different things in it all the time. That’s the genius of it. I think that period of Ridley Scott, with Alien and all his adverts around that point… I mean, it’s just never dated. If you watch something like Black Hole, which is kind of around the same period, and you look at it, Disney’s Black Hole looks like a films from the ’40s in comparison to Blade Runner. Blade Runner could be made today and it wouldn’t look any different.Which version of Blade Runner do you enjoy? Because there are several variations of it now.Yeah, I mean there’s only really two, isn’t there? The modern-modern version where they’ve cleaned it up. I must say I’m a fan of the non-voiceover version. That’s the better one for me. I’ve never really experienced the voiceover version on anything other than VHS.You were too young to see it when it came out?Yeah, I was too young to see it in the cinema, but I was very aware of it. Probably the first time I ever came into contact with it was the Marvel comic. It’s a brilliant adaptation. So that for me was the only real concept I had of it for a long time, and then I read the Philip K. Dick book. I think I got to the film quite late on. It was a grower, for me, just like one of the other films on the list, which is The Shining. It’s the same thing, where you have a relationship with it over time, and it gets better the more you watch it. Also, Blade Runner isn’t the kind of film that’s suited to VHS. There’s just too much stuff in it. I watched it again recently on Blu-ray and it was just incredible. That alone justified buying a big TV and a Blu-ray player.It’s fitting that you choose The Shining, too, because the theatrical cut of Blade Runner, of course, infamously uses outtake footage from Kubrick’s movie for the final scene.[Laughs] Yeah, that’s true. I forgot about that. The music at the end of it also reminds me, weirdly, of Sonic the Hedgehog as well. There’s a whole level of that set in a city that I’m sure is very heavily influenced by Blade Runner. But yeah, the music is really incredible, as well. Vangelis’s music is just unbelievable in Blade Runner.The Shining (Stanley Kubrick, 1980; 92% Tomatometer)So yeah, The Shining is a film that I watched initially when I was a kid. I remember we used to just get like piles of videos out from the video rental places and so I’d watched it with, you know, Videodrome, Cannibal Holocaust, Carrie, stuff like that.All the children’s favorites.[Laughs] Yeah. And I remember not being that impressed by it, because it was built up as being the most terrifying movie ever, and when it’s up against Videodrome you kinda just go “Ahhhh, well, it’s not as scary.” But over time I came to terms with it, and watched it again and again. I had to grow up a bit and realize how absolutely brilliant it was — again, buying it on many different formats, and finally seeing it in the cinema as well. So that was that. The thing I always take away from The Shining is I started to understand that film is not necessarily just a forward momentum — it’s more like a matrix that you can plug the meaning into; and that meaning can come from different rhythms to the traditional three-act structure. So there’s different senses in that movie that come through over time, and your perception changes with it as well. Your relationship with the characters change — as they do in a lot of movies, but specifically with that one. When I became a father, you know, I felt very differently about The Shining than I did when I didn’t have a kid.That scene in Room 237 where they showed The Shining simultaneously projected in forward and reverse — and certain scenes aligned by chance or design — supports that notion of being able to plug into the movie in different sort of temporal ways.Totally, yeah. I think that’s why the film is rewatchable — because you receive that information and you slowly unpack it. It reminds me of a Philip K. Dick book. I mean, Philip K. Dick stories, when you read them, are very basically written, but the underlying intelligence of them is hidden in a way. You get like 30 pages in and all of a sudden you feel the floor is moving underneath you, in your mind. You find you’re somewhere else. I think that’s what you get in The Shining. It’s a very basic plot. It’s a very B-movie plot. There’s nothing that clever about The Shining‘s story at all, you know. But the film itself is a trap. I love that. Elements of that we definitely used in Kill List — I mean, Kill List is a symmetrical film that plays one way and it plays the other; if you fold it in half, things correspond across it, to the minute. That kind of thinking I picked up from The Shining.I love that description of it: “The film is a trap.”Well it is; it’s a mental trap. Kubrick’s films are all like that, and that’s why they’re so special. They’re so unlike the rest of cinema, ’cause most of cinema is just filmed plays, isn’t it? It’s like words being put to pictures, whereas with Kubrick, every frame of it figured. It always feels like there’s a great intelligence behind it, pushing forward all the time. And to be honest, you don’t feel that in most movies. [Laughs]Not to get sidetracked, but I felt a little something of that trap watching A Field in England. It sets itself up as quite a simple scenario and then unexpectedly folds in on itself — quite literally, in a visual sense at certain points.I think we tried to make things experiential, rather than just a story. Story has always got to be an element of it, unless you’re making absolutely abstract cinema, but, you know, the story is a paste that goes on top of something else. That’s where things are at their most interesting, I think.Seven Samurai (Akira Kurosawa, 1954; 100% Tomatometer)I think probably Seven Samurai, by Kurosawa. I think I saw that when I was about 15 or 16 in the cinema. It’s such a big old chunk of a film, and it’s always a treat to sit down with that movie. It’s so perfectly framed, and perfectly judged; it’s basically the blueprint for most action cinema — expect that it’s much more intelligent than most action cinema. There’s characters in it that hardly only get a couple of lines, but you feel that they’re totally fleshed out. The massive battle scene at the end, which should be completely confusing, is instead just completely clear — you never worry about where you are, you never don’t understand what their plan is — and I think that’s something that you rarely see in cinema now. The closest you get to it, sometimes, is I think in James Cameron’s work — where it’s very, very methodically plotted and planned, and you feel the mechanics of everything that’s been very carefully formulated.Cameron does cover action very well, I agree.Yeah, he does. But Kurosawa’s stuff is just amazing. It always makes me cry. So that was the gateway film for me, for Kurosawa — then I went in and watched all the other stuff like Rashomon and Hidden Fortress and Kagemusha. I love Seven Samurai. I love also the cultural interplay, where it’s basically a cowboy film, but then it gets remade as a cowboy film [The Magnificent Seven]. Kurosawa is making movies that are like John Ford movies and selling them back to America. And then you’ve got the Movie Brats’ stuff, where you’ve got Coppola producing Kurosawa’s movies and then Scorsese appearing in Kurosawa’s movies, so it’s all in there, lovely and interlinking.It makes me think of that relationship that Japan has with France, as well, where you’ve got something like Nausicaä being based on Moebius’s artwork, so the French cartoonists and the Japanese animators were having, you know, a cultural moment in the mixing together of styles. And the Moebius ends up calling his daughter Nausicaä. I love all that stuff.Did he really? Wow.I think so, yeah. [Laughs] That’s probably worth fact checking. [Editor’s note: He did.]Goodfellas/Casino/The Wolf of Wall Street (Martin Scorsese, 1990/1995/2014; 97%/80%/77% Tomatometer)I guess there would have to be a Scorsese movie, but there are so many to choose from. You could go for the trilogy –the Goodfellas, Casino, Wolf of Wall Street trilogy — which I absolutely love. I mean, the rise and fall, it’s a classic thing in cinema — all our lives are a rise and fall, aren’t they, if we’re lucky; it could be just a bit of a rise as we go from adulthood to old age and then we die. [Laughs] But Goodfellas and Casino, the journey of those movies to The Wolf of Wall Street, is where the morality is slowly sucked out of them. So Goodfellas is a film where they have a system, a moral code, which is eroded in Casino, where they have a slight system or morals, but it’s all slightly tarnished. But by the time you get to The Wolf of Wall Street, there’s no moral code at all.Seems that’s why a lot of people are up in arms about Wolf: the movie has a moral code, but the characters have none. There’s no center for an audience to latch on to, whereas in Goodfellas, as you say, the audience can identify with their sense of morals to some extent.Yeah, and I think that’s it. It’s a modern — it’s an ultra modern — film, The Wolf of Wall Street. It’s the moment; it’s talking about right f–king now, and the whole thing is disgusting. And it is disgusting. What’s happening to everyone is disgusting, and he’s rubbing everyone’s faces in it. And that’s brilliant. For him to be so vital at this point in his career is just top. I love the editing in his stuff, too. I love Thelma Schoonmaker’s work, and the fact that they have come from this kind of weird, documentary background — their films are incredibly muscular, but they also use these documentary forms; they’re so wild, you know. Wild use of music. Wild use of cutting and camerawork. It’s like nothing else. And people try and copy it, and use the moves, but they don’t have the wit. It’s the comedy, and his vicious sense of humor, that makes it work so brilliantly. I recently watched After Hours a couple of days ago, and it’s just f–king phenomenal, that film.Come and See (Elem Klimov, 1985; 95% Tomatometer)The last one, well, I think for me — at the moment — it’s Come and See, the Elem Klimov film about the Russians fighting the Nazis. I’ve only ever seen it once, and I don’t know if I ever want to see it again, but it is an incredibly, profoundly affecting and terrifying experience. I just thought it was amazing. I saw it maybe two years ago, and it’s just stayed with me so much. It was a film I had and I was scared of watching. I don’t know why I bought it. I buy a lot of films all the time, and I’ve just got cupboards and cupboards of movies. I saw it on the shelf and looked at it at like midnight one night and thought, “I’ll just watch five minutes of it and see what it’s like,” and then at two in the morning I was still watching, going “Oh my god, I’ve never seen anything like this.” What I like about it is that it’s a mixture that shouldn’t work on so many levels, because it’s very arty and it’s very self-conscious, but yet it’s utterly realistic, and it feels emotionally realistic. It feels like you’re totally transported into that situation.I’d also double that with The Ascent, the Larisa Shepitko movie. She was married to Klimov and made a movie 10 years earlier on almost the same subject, and her film is just unbelievable as well, you know. It’s well worth checking out, that Criterion box set. Mind-blowing stuff. Have you seen Come and See?I have, yeah.It’s interesting when you talk to people and you say, “Have you seen Come and See?” and they get a look in their eyes where you can tell if they’ve seen it or not — they kind of look a bit sad and beat.

Thanks to Mullally’s zippy one-liners and undeniable charisma, Karen won both an audience of fans and a bigger spotlight on the show, and though this is the Emmy-winning role she’s best known for, Mullally has hosted Saturday Night Live, co-starred on shows like Party Down and Children’s Hospital, and appeared in recurring roles on 30 Rock, Happy Endings, and Parks and Recreation (alongside her husband Nick Offerman, whose interview you can read here).Mullally’s career doesn’t begin and end with television, either. Her comedic chops are certainly second to none, but her resume runs the gamut from music, live theater (she’s currently starring in a play called Annapurna), and Broadway musicals to animated programs and, of course, film. Her latest feature role comes in The Kings of Summer, a coming-of-age film about three teens who flee their home lives to build a house in the woods and live off the land. RT spoke with Megan over the phone about her work in the film, her chemistry with husband Nick Offerman, and her musical choices as half of vocal duo Nancy and Beth. Naturally, she also gave us her Five Favorite Films, which we had to expand to six because she just couldn’t narrow down the last three:[Note: There is some colorful language in this interview.]The Graduate (Mike Nichols, 1967; 88% Tomatometer)I would say The Graduate. I just think it’s such a chic, sophisticated comedy that, at the time, was so groundbreaking. The cinematography so captures that era. Obviously all of the performances, the screenplay, the direction… I mean, I think that’s probably on a lot of people’s top five.Mary Poppins (Robert Stevenson, 1964; 100% Tomatometer)I’m gonna have to say Mary Poppins. I’m really gonna say it. If it was on right now, I would hang up on you and start watching it. There’s no way I could ever not watch it if it was on, so I think that’s a sign of it being one of your top five. It’s so… merry. You can’t watch that and not feel good, and I love Glynis Johns, the woman who plays the mother, and I love Julie Andrews. I mean, when it was windy in Oklahoma City when I was a kid, I used to get my umbrella and go out and try to fly. I think I actually did a few times, but don’t tell anybody. Just the magic of it all. I love it.Sexy Beast (Jonathan Glazer, 2001; 86% Tomatometer)This is going back a few years, but I remember really loving the movie Sexy Beast. It’s a little bit of a departure from Mary Poppins. [laughs] The screenplay was so excellent and the acting was amazing, and there were so many surprises in it.Barry Lyndon (Stanley Kubrick, 1975; 94% Tomatometer)I have three more, but you can tell me which two to pick. Barry Lyndon…The Crowd (King Vidor, 1928; 95% Tomatometer)…The Crowd, which is a silent film…Harvey (Henry Koster, 1950; 83% Tomatometer)…and the other one is Harvey with Jimmy Stewart. I like that invisible rabbit.Next, Mullally describes how she got involved in The Kings of Summer, what it’s like to have a relationship with Nick Offerman, and the practical advice she gleaned from a hip hop group called Riskay.RT: Give us a little background on The Kings of Summer and how you got involved.Megan Mullally: My part’s not big enough to get asked the important questions. [laughs] Nick [Offerman] has a lead in the movie, and I think he’s really great in it; he’s the dad of one of the kids. He’s the only adult who has a lead, and I think what he’s doing is, he’s sort of being the glue. So once he was cast, Jordan Vogt-Roberts — the exceptional director, who I think was 27 when he directed the movie, and is 28 now — said something to the effect of, “What about the old ball-and-chain?”I had read the script already, because when Nick and I get offered things, we usually ask the other person to read it to get their take on it, and I had loved it. And I remembered the part that they ended up offering me. You know, she’s just a crazy, silly, annoying, overbearing mother, so I was thrilled, and that’s how that happened. Then, the movie itself, Nick and I both saw it together at Sundance, and we were just blown away by it.RT: Did you have some expectation of what the movie was going to be like before you saw the final product?MM: I had no idea how beautifully ambitious the movie was going to be. It’s shot so well, and it’s directed so well. And Jordan did a lot of really smart things. One of the really smart things he did was, he brought in all of these top-of-the-line improv- or sketch-based comedy actors to do all of these cameos, and it just brings the comedy to a whole other level. The thing that stands out the most for me about the movie overall, I would say, is he somehow manages to seamlessly blend this real comedy with a lot of passages that are kind of lyrical, for lack of a better word. Beautiful and lyrical and evocative. And, I don’t know… I can’t think of a movie where I’ve seen both of those things in the same movie.RT: You and Nick seem to get offered things together pretty often.MM: We do. Like, a lot.RT: You two have amazing chemistry on screen, like your cameos on Parks and Recreation.MM: That’s nice of you to say. I feel like it just comes from the fact that we have a history together, but we have this trust, and we genuinely like each other, and we enjoy each other’s work, and also we just enjoy each other, period. So that helps a lot. But it’s gotten to the point of, like, we’re getting into Hume Cronyn-Jessica Tandy territory with the amount of work we’ve done together, you know? It’s spinning out of control. [laughs] But we just really like working with each other, and we have a lot of ideas for things down the road that we’d like to do, that we just haven’t had time to pitch to anybody yet. Right now, it’s just chance, but we have things that we want to do.RT: Do people typically pitch you guys on doing things together, or do you seek out opportunities where you can work with each other?MM: We have never actively sought out an opportunity to work together. Usually it’s just kind of synchronicity; it’s weird. We met doing a play in 2000, and after we were a couple for real, Nick guested on Will &amp; Grace, and I’ve guested a few times on Parks, and then all the other stuff is just… You know, we started out doing Children’s Hospital together, but then NBC won’t let you do more than one or two episodes of another show, so he can only do like one episode a year of Children’s Hospital. I don’t know, it’s crazy the way it all happened. I think because we have such a good relationship, people don’t hesitate to ask us to do things. You may or may not know couples who might not be the most ideally suited to one another, so I think there might be certain couples that people would be like, “I don’t know. Should we ask them?” I don’t think they have that hesitation with us, because we get along.RT: Whenever you and Nick appear together, it looks like you two are having so much fun. Is that manic chemistry a reflection of what it’s like at home?MM: Well, we do bits — we definitely try to crack each other up — but we’re pretty quiet, and we’re essentially homebodies. First of all, we don’t have time to go out and do anything. We love to just stay home with our dogs. I think we’re pretty understated in real life, but then when we get together for acting purposes, if the roles call for it, then that’s when we really let it rip.RT: I get the impression that, despite Nick’s reputation, you wear the pants in the relationship.MM: You are a very intuitive man. [laughs] Well, in what marriage is that not the truth? You must be single. [laughs]RT: You are… not wrong about that, and maybe that’s why. Do you think you could actually get Nick to wear cornrows in his hair if you wanted him to?MM: Are you kidding? I wouldn’t even have to ask him twice. He loves that shit. I mean, he’ll do anything. He’s had every possible hair configuration known to man since I’ve been with him. One time he had a little role in an indie movie, and he had — let’s see, how do I describe it? — a bleached white Mohawk that wrapped around over his ears into an under-chin beard. And I had to have sex with that, so if anyone should be getting the fuckin’ kudos, it’s me. And it was all his hair. The man’s got a good head of hair, and it extends to most other parts of his body. “Hirsute,” I think, is the word.RT: So you and Nick and also Alison Brie have put out a number of promotional videos for another film you guys are doing together. Is there some sort of exclusive NBC club of comedy vets who just get together and talk about how great you all are?MM: [laughs] That’s so funny. Well, yes, there is a secret club, to answer your question. The funniest part about all of that is that those weird videos that we’ve done with Alison are in support of a movie called Somebody Up There Likes Me, which, you’d think it was for The Kings of Summer, because we are all in The Kings of Summer, but Alison is not in Somebody Up There Likes Me, so it’s pretty confusing. We shot that first promo — where we’re smoking bongs — we shot that first one on the set of Kings of Summer, and Jordan shot it, and we only did two takes. So yeah, it’s all kind of incestuous.RT: I know you also do some music. First of all, where did the name “Nancy and Beth” come from, being that neither of you in the group are named either Nancy or Beth?MM: [laughs] You know where it came from? We were knocking around some ideas, Stephanie [Hunt] and I and Nick. We were in Austin, and we were out to dinner one night, and we were kicking around some ideas, and they were funny and they were kind of good, but nothing was really quite right. So I went home and, on my phone, I wrote a list of about 30 or 40 different titles I thought were interesting. I just emailed the list to Stephanie. “Nancy and Beth” was totally, by far, my favorite, but I buried it somewhere in the middle and I didn’t editorialize at all; I just sent the list to Stephanie. She instantly emailed back, “Nancy and Beth.” We have a crazy, like, one brain, Siamese twins thing happening. I think we just like it because it’s kind of funny and nobody knows why it’s called that, which is sort of what we like.RT: I have unfortunately not had the pleasure of seeing you perform as part of Nancy and Beth, but I have seen a clip of you performing a certain song with Nick, pertaining to certain aromas of a genital nature.MM: Yes. Whoever wrote that song is a very practical lady.RT: Was it the poetry of its lyrics or its feminist message that inspired you to cover it?MM: Well, let’s bring this full circle. This is a good callback. So, the guy who plays my husband in The Kings of Summer, Marc Evan Jackson, is a great improv comedy-based actor. He’s so funny and he’s so everything you have to be to be funny, but he kind of seems like he could be a CPA, because he dresses very conservatively — he wears, like, khakis, you know? It’s really odd. So, he’s the one who suggested that song. He came to see Nancy and Beth and then he texted me, “You gotta do this song called ‘Smell Yo Dick’ by Riskay.” I was like, “Okay?” Nick and I have an assistant who’s a gentleman, and I asked him if he would transcribe the lyrics of the song, and the poor guy’s a Christian. I mean, he almost had to, like, move out of his own skin. He almost didn’t recover, but he did it. And the second that Stephanie and I sat down and went through the lyrics, we… were.. dead. We were dying. It just seemed so right, somehow. So I don’t know, anything beyond that, it just felt so right. [laughs] We had already done Cypress Hill’s “Hits from the Bong,” and Nick does that; we sing “Son of a Preacher Man” and then he does the rap. So we already knew Nick could do the gentleman’s rap in “Smell Yo Dick.” We knew we had money in the bank there.RT: I’ll have to ask Nick about his burgeoning rap career.MM: You know, he’s pretty good, I have to say. And he’s got some moves, too. [laughs] Once you see it, you’ll never forget it.The Kings of Summer opens in limited release this week, and if you’re in the Los Angeles area, you can catch Megan and Nick performing their play Annapurna at the Odyssey Theatre until June 9th.","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"71st, comedy, The, BET, talk, Turner","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/xzvc.jpg","slug":"five-favorite-films-with-megan-mullally"},{"id":"47508840958207","title":"Five Favorite Films with Dennis Quaid","content":"Five Favorite Filmsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Five Favorite Films with Dennis QuaidThe star of this week's At Any Price on his all-time favorite movies.by RT Staff | April 25, 2013 |  CommentsDennis Quaid came into his own as one of the astronauts in 1983’s The Right Stuff, and has since been one of America’s hardest-working, most consistent actors, appearing in everything from Innerspace and Wyatt Earp to Far from Heaven and Traffic. (And lest we forget his gallant, if doomed, effort to hold together Movie 43.) This week he plays dad to Zac Efron’s rebellious son in Ramin Bahrani’s At Any Price, and with the film opening in limited release, we had a chance to sit down with Quaid recently and talk about his favorite movies.Lawrence of Arabia (David Lean, 1962; 98% Tomatometer)I think my favorite movie is Lawrence of Arabia. To me, it’s just about a perfect film; in the performances and what it means to me. I saw it as a boy — and I just can’t stop watching it, every time it comes on. All David Lean’s movies, really. I love Doctor Zhivago, too.Five Easy Pieces (Bob Rafelson, 1970; 86% Tomatometer)Five Easy Pieces is a film that hit me as a young man. Most of my favorite movies, I think, come from the ’70s, in that period where I really wanted to become an actor. Jack Nicholson’s performance in that… it’s a film that would never be done by a major studio today.Bonne and Clyde (Arthur Penn, 1967; 90% Tomatometer)There’s Bonnie and Clyde. That’s a film that kind of started the new wave in the ’70s. That was incredible. I saw that when I was in about the eighth grade, I think. Those characters, and also the history of Bonnie and Clyde, you know… it was something new. I remember, in fact, Bonnie and Clyde came out in either late Spring or early Summer, and then it was pulled. I think it flopped when it came out, and then they brought it back out in the Fall. I mean, I loved it when I first saw it; then they brought it back out in the Fall and it was a huge success.Scarecrow (Jerry Schatzberg, 1973; 71% Tomatometer)There’s another movie back then called Scarecrow, with Gene Hackman and Al Pacino. They play two hobos that are going across America to open up a car wash. Both performances are just amazing.The Godfather (Francis Ford Coppola, 1972; 100% Tomatometer)I’m gonna say The Godfather — the first one. That’s another movie that’s just about a perfect film, you know, from a great filmmaker in his prime.At Any Price opens in limited release this week.","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"Animation, discovery, Awards, female, New, Music, chucky","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/24324.jpg","slug":"five-favorite-films-with-dennis-quaid"},{"id":"47508840960256","title":"Five Favorite Films with Vivica A.

FoxThe star of Home Run also chats about sports and her new film.by Tim Ryan | April 19, 2013 |  CommentsShe survived an alien attack in Independence Day and battled Beatrix Kiddo in Kill Bill. In Home Run (which opens in limited release today), Vivica A. Fox is up against a different kind of adversary. Fox stars as the agent of a hotshot ballplayer (played by Scott Elrod, who had a bit part in Argo in the script-reading scene) whose alcoholism and memories of childhood abuse are threatening to derail his career. In an interview with Rotten Tomatoes, the versatile actress shared her favorite films, as well as her love of sports and the wide variety of parts she’s played over the years.Terms of Endearment (James L. Brooks, 1983; 87% Tomatometer)Terms of Endearment. I absolutely love that movie, with Debra Winger, Shirley MacLaine, and Jack Nicholson. One of my first tearjerker films. It was so good to see that mother-daughter dynamic, the love story kind of playing out, and just to see their love, and dealing with men. Shirley MacLaine — the acting between her and Jack Nicholson was just awesome. It was just really one of my first tearjerker movies. I remember going, “Oh my God! I love that!” That was a good movie.”Independence Day (Roland Emmerich, 1996; 61% Tomatometer)I hate to say it, but it’s one that I starred in — is Independence Day. I was so happy about that film, because, first of all, it grossed close to $1 billion worldwide back in the day, and it really was a great film. To see Will Smith and Jeff Goldblum — to see an African-American and a Jewish guy save the world — I just love that. It was so cool. And the fact that I was a stripper that got to save the First Lady. It just had so many elements of people that normally don’t become people’s heroes save the world.RT: You know, I’ve had a beef with you for that movie for 15 years. There’s that scene where you’re talking with Bill Pullman, who plays the president, and you say, “I voted for the other guy.” And I’m thinking, “Who’s this other guy? Did he have much better policies? Did he give better speeches?”I think that was just a line, because if it was Mitt Romney I would have never voted for him. [laughs]Memoirs of a Geisha (Rob Marshall, 2005; 35% Tomatometer)And then Memoirs of a Geisha. First of all, so beautifully shot. A wonderful love story. I cried. My friend who took me — she said, “This movie’s great.” And it took me 10 to 15 minutes after the movie to calm down because it was just such a beautiful love story that was so wonderfully shot, and the actors… It was just gorgeous.Marley &amp; Me (David Frankel, 2008; 64% Tomatometer)And then Marley &amp; Me. I know, what a surprise. I went to the movie because it stars Jennifer Aniston and Owen Wilson, and thought, “Oh, I’m going to laugh. It’s going to be a comedy.” And I own animals. Four cats. Once again, tearjerker. I’m such a sucker for a good film, and it was a great message that I absolutely loved.He Got Game (Spike Lee, 1998; 80% Tomatometer), The Shining (Stanley Kubrick, 1980; 90% Tomatometer)My last one is… I’m torn between He Got Game and The Shining. Can we say that those two came in a tie?RT: You’re Vivica Fox; you can do whatever you want.So it’s a tie. He Got Game with Denzel Washington and Ray Allen, which I thought was just a wonderful movie. I’m an athlete, I love basketball. And then The Shining with Jack Nicholson, where he just kills it. And that’s probably about the only horror film you’ll ever see Vivica Fox love.Next, Fox talks about being a sports nut and working on smaller films like Home Run.RT: I understand that you’re a big sports fan. In Home Run, you can tell that Scott Elrod had played baseball before. That’s part of what makes it convincing.Vivica Fox: He did such a wonderful job. Let me tell you something; I was so impressed that I said, first of all, not only did they get a guy that looks he could actually be a baseball player, but someone that can act. He had good heart. I think he’s got a wonderful future ahead of him. My makeup artist said, “Oh my god, I couldn’t take my eyes off of him. He’s stunning.” So it’s gotta be somebody that draws you in, that has heart, his comedy was great. He just had all the wonderful elements that were needed.RT: In addition, you were absolutely convincing as an agent. Have you hung around with a lot of sports agents in the past?VF: Oh, not even sports agents. They just told me that my character was a female version of Jerry Maguire. That’s another of my favorite films — sorry it didn’t make my top five! I [watched] Tom Cruise, and I was like “Show me the money!” And then I’ve got a lot of friends that are athletes, former athletes, and I was an athlete growing up myself — played basketball, volleyball, track — and I was a cheerleader, so the world of sports isn’t foreign to me at all.RT: Home Run is a small indie drama, but you’ve also been in big blockbusters, and recently, you were also in Hitman Absolution, a video game. It seems that would be a much different type of acting.VF: Well, they put those little knobs all over you, so what they do is great. They’re making video games now more like movies, which is beautiful to me, and another reason why I was really interested in it. So, it’s got a whole storyboard, they’ve got all these knobs all over you on this black suit, so they get every essence of you when you’re acting it out, and you go onto a sound stage, and you act it out. So now I’m immortalized in a video game too, hey!RT: It’s gotta be much more of a controlled environment than, say, something like Curb Your Enthusiasm which is more improvised.VF: Yeah, Curb Your Enthusiasm, that’s a tad bit different, especially working with Larry David, who, you know, you gotta have on your big girl boots to get in the pond with him, because you are your [own] actor, director, writer, producer. It makes it a little more difficult, but I love working on Curb Your Enthusiasm because it got to show people me raw. Like, he would be like, “No makeup.” I’d be like, “Alright, I got you. I look good without makeup. I’m cool.” But literally, I would come to the set, and he’d be like, “You have on makeup?” and I’m like, “No, I have on lip gloss.” But I got to show people that I could be raw. It wasn’t about the glam, it wasn’t about special effects. It was raw and in your face, and they loved it. Now when I come to New York, everyone knows me.RT: But that’s not the role you’re most recognized for.VF: Nooo… I’m going to be honest with you. I’ve been so blessed to have a career with so much versatility that I get recognized from Set It Off, Independence Day, to Curb Your Enthusiasm, to Kill Bill, from hosting things. That’s been the key to my success, I believe, has been versatility.RT: Obviously Home Run is a smaller project than those movies.VF: Yeah it is, but indie films are great films where you get a chance to act. Like this part, Helene, was originally for a guy, and they decided — Carol Matthews, the executive producer, decided — “You know what? We’re going to go with a girl, and I want Vivica Fox. Not only do I want to go with a girl, but I want to go with an African-American woman, because I love her and I really think that she’s the right one for this part.” And I was so honored by that. I didn’t have to audition; they called me. It’s a wonderful little indie film, down in — of all places — Oklahoma. And I had a great time. I did. So smaller films — sometimes you get to do those roles that people don’t normally see you in.RT: Home Run is a faith-based film, and I read that you said you felt that movies needed more positive messages.VF: Yes. Well, can I also say that too about independent film? Like, I’ve done two Christian films. Christian films are making a big comeback this year, as well. So hopefully faith is being restored in our country, which we need right now.Home Run opens in limited release this weekend.","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"child's, Hallmark, crime, Pirates, potter, Action, SXSW, Grant, New, independent, CBS, spider-man, Paquin","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/fdsf.jpg","slug":"five-favorite-films-with-vivica-a-fox"},{"id":"47508840947963","title":"Five Favorite Films with Nick Offerman","content":"Five Favorite Filmsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Five Favorite Films with Nick OffermanThe Kings of Summer star also talks stunt choreography, typecasting, and what he considers manly.by Ryan Fujitani | May 30, 2013 |  CommentsMuch like his wife Megan Mullally on Will &amp; Grace, Nick Offerman‘s mustachioed visage became a pop culture phenomenon when his character on another NBC sitcom, Parks and Recreation, simply refused to fade quietly into the background as a small, supporting role. The legend of Ron Swanson has grown exponentially since the show’s debut in 2009, and he is among the most popular characters — if not the most popular — on a hit comedy chock full of popular characters played by grade-A talent.The truth is, Mr. Offerman is a seasoned veteran of the stage and screen who emerged from the Chicago theater world back in the late 1990s and began securing parts in film and on television (including a guest spot on Will &amp; Grace) before landing his big break on Parks and Rec. These days, he finds it difficult to dissociate himself from the Ron Swanson mythos, but that doesn’t stop him from trying different things, like the play he and Mullally are currently performing in Los Angeles or his latest role in The Kings of Summer, in which he plays a single father whose frustrated teenage son escapes to the forest with two friends to fend for themselves. RT spoke with Nick about the film, what it’s like to be pigeonholed as Ron Swanson, and how his love of carpentry helped get him into acting. First, of course, here are Nick Offerman’s Five Favorite Films:[Note: There is some colorful language in this interview.]Midnight Run (Martin Brest, 1988; 96% Tomatometer)I’ll start with Midnight Run. Just one of the finest Goddamn movies I’ve ever seen. Charles Grodin and Robert De Niro. If there’s a better buddy comedy, show it to me, and I’ll shake your hand. It’s so funny. It’s also where I learned what chorizo is. Being from Illinois, not a lot of truck stops serve chorizo and eggs. It was part of my “goin’ out west” legend, like, “One day, I will go to California, and on the way there, I will experience chorizo and eggs.”When you finally experienced it, was it all that you hoped it would be?And so much more. It’s still one of my mainstays. You can’t beat the spiciness of the chorizo mixed with the sort of creaminess of the eggs. It’s so delicious with a fresh salsa, preferably of the tomatillo variety. Forget about it. I just made my mouth water.Blazing Saddles (Mel Brooks, 1974; 89% Tomatometer)As a kid in the middle of Illinois, it was really a culture vacuum. I mean, we had the Eagles on the radio and John Denver, which are fine in their own right, but you want a little more variety, especially if you’re going to end up being an underground hedonist like myself. When Mel Brooks movies came my way, it was just like, “Holy shit. These were made in heaven and sent straight to my VCR.” You know, come on, just Mongo. If you’re 12, all you care about is Mongo farting and punching out a horse. Literature does not become any more refined than that of the great Mel Brooks.The Big Lebowski (Joel Coen, 1998; 80% Tomatometer)If I had to pick just one movie, I’d say, “Give me The Big Lebowski,” because I can watch that thing 20 times in a row. I’m such a fan, and really, no one’s busted me on it yet, but all I really want to do is be John Goodman when I grow up. He’s so incredibly intelligent and full of pathos and hilarity, while at the same time, being this crazy linebacker of a man. His work in that and Raising Arizona, which I’ll put in a subset under The Big Lebowski, when he eats that fucking bowl of cereal while smoking a cigarette in Raising Arizona, I’m like, “Alright, there is room for me in the pantheon of actors.”The Quiet Man (John Ford, 1952; 89% Tomatometer)Taking a slight turn, I love the John Wayne film The Quiet Man. It’s quite something. It’s a John Ford movie, it’s John Wayne and Maureen O’Hara. It’s kind of like John Wayne’s Brigadoon. He plays this boxer who killed a man in the ring in the States, and so, to escape his past, he moves to his ancestral little home in Ireland. It’s this quaint little village, and I believe it’s called Innisfree — I know Innisfree is from a Yeats poem, and it sort of represents the small Irish town of heaven; it’s sort of a fantastical place — but the town in The Quiet Man is Innisfree, which makes sense. So he goes there to escape his past, falls in love, of course, with Maureen O’Hara — who wouldn’t? — and her brother turns out to be the enormous, pugilistic, evil, Bluto-like landlord. So the movie cannot be resolved, nor can their love, without one final fistfight. It’s funny; just the other day, I sent a message to my agent, “Remake idea: The Quiet Man?” I have two fists. I can swagger.Rashomon (Akira Kurosawa, 1951; 100% Tomatometer)[Akira] Kurosawa’s Rashomon. I mean, any Kurosawa blows my mind out my ass. We did a production of Rashomon that was actually a play. We did that at my college. We had this amazing sword teacher named Robin McFarquhar, and that was one of his big triumphs, was this production of Rashomon. It’s such a cool play, because you do it four times in a row, and you get everybody’s perspective. You know, one time the samurai is brave, one time he’s a coward. It’s really delicious for the actors.Next, Offerman talks about The Kings of Summer, swashbuckling, being Ron Swanson, and woodworking.RT: I want to go back to something you said earlier when you were talking about remaking The Quiet Man. You probably could handle a fistfight just fine, considering you were a fight coordinator when you were with the Steppenwolf Theatre.Nick Offerman: It’s true, yeah. I was really terrible at acting when I went to theater school, because I was brand new, fresh off the farm, and basically trying way too hard. So I couldn’t really get cast very well, but what I could do, I was a great athlete. I’d been a football guy, so, of course, like any red-blooded young person, I picked up swords and was like, “Well, I can do this shit all day long, and I can do a backflip. Check this out.” I could also build scenery, so those two skills enabled me to be around great theater and be contributing even before I knew what the hell I was doing with dialogue.I still hope to get in a good swashbuckler project or two, because I feel like that’s something that’s really gone missing from the modern pantheon of films. Jackie Chan is the last guy who could impress with what he could do with his props, you know? This sort of Oliver Stone editing style — which has now become, you know, The Bourne Identity and the James Bond movies — you can have super cool weapons and fighting sequences without the actors needing to be able to juggle at all. And I just miss that. If you go back and watch Gene Kelly in The Three Musketeers, he has these moves as d’Artagnan. He’s fighting three dudes on a staircase, where they’re backing him down the staircase; he jumps backwards off like five steps, lands on his upper back, presses his knees to his nose, and flips back up the five steps. You know what I mean? That’s the kind of thing that youngsters will watch and say, “Oh my god, I want to be Robin Hood, Superman, whatever.” I really love that sense of swashbuckle.RT: Let’s talk about The Kings of Summer. Your role is the biggest adult role in the film. Can you provide some context for your character?NO: The lead of the film is the character Joe Toy, deftly and brilliantly played by Nick Robinson, and my wife, his mom, has died, and we’re both in terrible pain. But he’s fifteen in the movie, and he’s coming of age. He’s at that awkward place where he wants to bristle against his dad, but it’s just me and him in it together, and so we’re butting heads. You know, at any other age, we probably would have said, “Hey, I’m really hurt.” “So am I.” “I love you; let’s hug.” But we’re just at the father and son age where we’re like, “The fuck are you looking at?” And so we have the period of the film to come to the realization that we’re feeling the exact same pain, and that we need to throw our arms around each other and do it together.Reading the script, it’s full of really deftly and finely wrought humor. It’s really a funny movie, and we’re thrilled. It’s like nothing we’ve ever seen, in that it’s a really unique hybrid of… It’s one of the funniest comedies I’ve seen in a long time, and that has nothing to do with me; it’s all of this incredible cast that Jordan Vogt-Roberts assembled, this crazy 27-year-old wunderkind. I think he’s 28 now, actually. This is his first feature, and it will blow your tits off. Even when we were shooting it, Megan and I were like, “Man, this kid has got his shit together.” It’s really great. He comes from the world of comedy shorts in like Chicago and then LA, you know, sketch and improv masters, and so every little cameo is the funniest person from the LA stage. It allows little throwaway scenes to become the jewels of the film. The meal is laced with bon bons and pigs in a blanket, where you’re like, “Oh, god, that was a delicious mouthful. Now, back to my entrée.”So when I read it, I said, “Okay, this is super funny. We can have a lot of fun here.” But I’m also so drawn to this nice emotional arc, which is not something that comes my way every day. It’s funny because people will say, “Oh, Nick Offerman’s playing himself in this.” You know, many people say that I am Ron Swanson. For me, there’s a vast gulf between Ron Swanson and Frank Toy in this movie, but it is a man with a beard, you know, who talks like me. Unfortunately for both Ron and Frank, I have to use my body and voice, so there are a few nods to similarity. But Ron is a cartoonish character in a very funny sitcom, and Frank is a much more fully realized human being in a very touching, funny film about teenagers coming of age. Ron is written in much broader strokes than Frank Toy; Frank Toy is more of a human being.RT: Did you know Jordan Vogt-Roberts prior to this film?NO: I didn’t. We share an agent, and my agent fortuitously thought that they should get a manly guy with a sense of humor. Jason Statham was not available, so they called Russell Crowe, who also told them, apparently, to go fuck themselves and hurled one of his Blundstone boots, which is a fine Australian boot, at my agent. And then they came crawling to me.RT: Megan mentioned that, when either of you are offered something, you’ll bounce it off each other. Do you find that when that happens, the two of you have similar tastes and sensibilities about what you should and shouldn’t take?NO: Yeah, pretty much 100%. [laughs] Yeah, it’s funny, we both come from Chicago theater, and I know that we’re known for these comedy characters we’ve done, but we both are actors. We’re prepared, we’ve got the chops, especially Megan. She can do anything Meryl Streep can do. She is as high end of a talent as you can come across, and that’s something that we often kind of combat in the way that we’re perceived in town, where people are like, “Well, I wasn’t really thinking of someone so funny for this.” But you know, look at Bryan Cranston, who was so funny on Malcolm in the Middle for so many years, and then he turns around and plays this chillingly dramatic character on Breaking Bad. I’d be happy to be the sixth man on Bryan Cranston’s bench, but still, I’d like to play on his team, where I could be a scary evil sheriff just as soon as I could be a chuckleworthy parks and rec. director. So when we bounce things off each other, we definitely find we have similar sensibilities.RT: In fact, you and Megan just recently opened a more serious stage production here in Los Angeles.NO: We did, yeah. We’re doing this play that’s called Annapurna at the Odyssey Theatre with our company the Evidence Room, and it’s a two-hander. It’s just the two of us on stage for ninety minutes, barreling through this drama that leaves the audience devastated. It’s like an early Sam Shepard, with some different, more poetic laughter. It’s some deep dramatic work, and we’re just loving the meal.RT: Do you think that when people come to a show like that and they see you and Megan on stage, they’d be surprised by the kind of material you’re doing?NO: Certainly. Absolutely. The good thing is, when we take part in anything, theater, TV, or film, a) it usually doesn’t suck; b) it’s usually really interesting, it’s usually really thought-provoking material, and sometimes, especially in Megan’s case, it’s sublime. So I think people certainly will come to see our play because they love Will &amp; Grace or because they love Parks and Rec, and they’ll be like, “Whoa, this is not like Ron and Karen.” But, I think this play is very effective. We’ve had four or five audiences and even though we’re still figuring out what the hell we’re doing, we’ve been very gratified with the audience’s reaction. And, you know, that’ll be true for the rest of our lives. When you’re on a show that gets syndicated, you’re in people’s living rooms with one particular clown mask on, so when they come see you play your other clown character, they’re like, “Oh, well, this is not like the other one, but that juggling’s not bad.”RT: Since I have the opportunity, I have to ask: What words of advice would you offer to those strapping young men striving to achieve Nick Offerman-like manliness?NO: Mind your manners, tell the truth, and make the relationships in your life a priority. When you give to those you love around you as much as you can, you can’t help but, I think, come across as having those decisions be seen as manly.RT: Lastly, do you accept apprentices at your woodworking shop, and if so, what does one need to do to become one?NO: It’s a tricky crucible that one must be put through. We do have a couple of apprentices, but it’s weird. With an operation like mine, where everything is handcrafted, the main thing we try to do is keep it small. The couple people that have come around, we sort of make them prove that they’re interested in being there to learn woodworking and not to rub elbows with a guy who once did a movie with Sandra Bullock. What I would say is, there are many shops that work in many artisan hand crafts, and most of them are probably doing way better work than I am, because I’m an actor, and they’re just practicing their craft all day. The way to get involved in any shop — or theater, for that matter — is to just show up and start hauling shit for them and start sweeping, and if you’re a decent person, eventually they’re going to say, “Oh hey, I need a set of hands. Come here.” And eventually you got the keys to the truck, and then you’re good to go. Sweeping. Sweeping is the secret to success.The Kings of Summer opens in limited release this week, and if you’re in the Los Angeles area, you can catch Megan and Nick performing their play Annapurna at the Odyssey Theatre until June 9th.","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"Box, anthology","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/xzcvzv.jpg","slug":"five-favorite-films-with-nick-offerman"},{"id":"47508993187478","title":"Total Recall: Hail to the Chiefs!","content":"\n\n                                            Total Recall\n                                        \n                        \n                        \n                            var mps=mps||{}; mps._queue=mps._queue||{}; mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[];\n                            mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function() {\n                                mps.rt.insertlogo('#article_sponsorship_ad', 'ploc=articlesponsorship');\n                            });\n                        \n                    \n                    \n                        Total Recall: Hail to the Chiefs!\n                        We pick our favorite big-screen Oval Office inhabitants.\n                        by RT Staff | October 15, 2008                          | \n                          \n                              Comments\n                          \n                     \n\n                     \n\n                     \n                       \n                         \n                           \n                         \n                           \n                         \n                           \n                         \n                           \n                       \n                     \n\n                    \n                                                With the presidential race\ngetting down to the wire, and Oliver Stone’s long-awaited \nW. hitting\ntheaters this week, we at RT thought it would be the perfect time to present\nyou, the electorate, with a list of some of our favorite movie presidents.

Here are Mr. Korine’s all-time favorite movies.Brewster McCloud (Robert Altman, 1970; 83% Tomatometer)After I saw this film when I was a kid, I went hang-gliding with my next door neighbor and we crashed into an abandoned missile silo. My neighbor lost his right leg. This movie was a big influence on that.Pam &amp; Tommy Lee: Stolen Honeymoon (Tommy Lee (uncredited), 1998; 69% Tomatometer)I remember seeing this in a Nashville movie theater when it was first released in Dolby. I didn’t know what to expect. I still think it’s very underrated and misunderstood.Pixote (Hector Babenco, 1981; 100% Tomatometer)My favorite film of all time.Battle in Heaven (Carlos Reygadas, 2005; 44% Tomatometer)This film is next level.Every Which Way But Loose (James Fargo, 1978; 31% Tomatometer)It’s the first time I ever saw an orangutan drink beer out of a can.Spring Breakers is in theaters now.","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"TV, aliens, Fox, comedies, National, Guide, league, GLAAD, slashers, Masterpiece, movies, Television, TV, Originals","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/zcxvxz.jpg","slug":"five-favorite-films-with-harmony-korine"},{"id":"47508840945914","title":"Five Favorite Films with M.

Night Shyamalanby Grae Drake | June 3, 2013 |  CommentsM. Night Shyamalan’s latest film, After Earth, is a movie about finding the essence of your power in the face of great adversity. My feelings about my interview with the director seemed similar to those of Jaden Smith as he exited his grounded ship in the film, not knowing what lurked outside, but not having the luxury of letting it stop him, either. Would an interview with M. Night Shyamalan require a decoder ring? An encyclopedia? A tranquilizer dart?As it turns out, I didn’t face anything like what Jaden’s character faces in the film. All I had to do was introduce myself and mention to Shyamalan that I know exactly where I was and who I was with when I saw all of his movies from 1999 on. His excited response was how special that was, and how he thinks of movies that way, too. He knows that he saw Back to the Future on the Jersey Shore while he was wearing a black sweatshirt (note: the twist being that the guy was the one to remember what he was wearing when he saw important movies).Once we established a bond over crystal-clear recollections of transformative cinematic experiences, he began to lament only being able to pick five films. He decided to start with the ones that hang on the wall of his office and go from there. Here are M. Night Shyamalan’s Five Favorite Films:The Godfather (Francis Ford Coppola, 1972; 100% Tomatometer)Favorite movie of all time, what I think is the best crafted movie of all time, is The Godfather. It was the perfect confluence of the source material being so intimate and true, and having within its DNA, it just so happens, is an incredible plot in the most organic matter. It is so not contrived, or “your IQ’s dropping,” which is almost the case of all other combinations, right? In this one, it’s inherently built into the life of these people.&nbsp; And there are stakes, there’s threat, and that’s just built in, so the source material had all of that.&nbsp; And the confluence of one of the great artists of his time for sure in Coppola, the great kind of forward thinking artists, and a leader in — he was a cult figure for artists that followed him for a long time. I got to meet him a couple times, and I feel the same way, if I was born on that time, I would have been on his ashram for sure. He’s coming from such philosophy, and depth about art, and this guy was kind of forced to do something with a hair more structure and a hair more chance of connection to people than he would normally want. He used all those tools of artistry and introspection and craft — he has an incredible handle on the world and a pushing of the envelope to bring depth and humanity to it, which makes it a perfect combination of everything.Jaws (Steven Spielberg, 1975; 100% Tomatometer)Jaws is the next poster on my wall, I’m staring at it right now.&nbsp; You are about to be introduced to, in my opinion, the greatest craftsman storyteller the cinema has ever seen and with a vehicle that had literally the perfect balance — and he brought that. It was [Steven Spielberg’s] balance of humor and artistry and the genre.&nbsp; It was the culminating of that balance. I screened that movie for my crew — I forgot which movie, two or three movies ago, and it’s just incredible to watch the balancing act of the humor.&nbsp; Roy Schieder’s trying to understand about what’s going on in the town about the shark and there’s this lady complaining to him about the kids that are karate chopping the fence.&nbsp; It’s genius because life moves on, and this is like real life. It’s the collision of a perfect story from the book with great sensibilities for entertainment and humor. Spielberg gets the precision of the craft and thinking about the shot with the me lieu of the time, and does in that docu-1970s style, which is my favorite time period in cinema ever.The Exorcist (William Friedkin, 1973; 87% Tomatometer)These are all based on books, right? And the most amazing source material, tonal source material. The Exorcist has, again, a collision of the time period with that style of cinema, but Friedkin’s kind of unlike the previous two. They did a bunch of ad-libby stuff, but The Exorcist was the most with regard to that contemporaneous kind of shooting. The story is about a reality-based story about the Devil, done at a time when docu-style was predominant, and it felt really natural. Friedkin spent an enormous amount of time shooting the movie and did it with reverence, and the structure is perfect. It starts in the Middle East, goes to a Georgetown bedroom, and gets smaller and smaller until you meet a side character, the second priest. The plot is this incredible kind of twisty thing, and then he ends up sacrificing himself. It’s awesome.Being There (Hal Ashby, 1979; 95% Tomatometer)Was this a comedy, straight drama, fantasy? I don’t know. It’s so incredible. This has one of my favorite endings to a movie, just incredible.&nbsp; When he walked on the water my jaw dropped, I just freaked out, freaked out, that we were making fun of him the whole time, we thought he was an idiot the whole time, thought he was like this mentally handicapped person, and all he was was simple. The things that were happening, and the people that were following him, and the potential future for him, makes sense when you just turn your perspective that way.&nbsp; Bold, bold, bold genre-breaking filmmaking, and will always be kind of a beacon of originality for me.Rebecca (Alfred Hitchcock, 1940; 100% Tomatometer)Also based on a book. Coming from a super, super anal place as a filmmaker, the idea that the greatest hands-on auteur [Alfred Hitchcock] in cinema history made a movie with his hand buried in there perfectly–a lot of his movies, his hand is on top, and in this one, his hand was buried perfectly in there. Again, I’m not sure what genre it is and I love it because of that.&nbsp; Is it scary? I’m not sure it is. Is it a drama?&nbsp; For sure.&nbsp; Is it a romance?&nbsp; Yeah.&nbsp; And I love it, so elegantly done, I so fell in love with those characters, the performances were amazing. It was epic and haunting, and it was just its own perfect little gem that will never be re-created.After Earth is in theaters now.","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"2020, Ovation, Apple, ID, History, based, Competition, Stephen, comedy","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/vcxzvcxv.jpg","slug":"five-favorite-films-with-m-night-shyamalan"},{"id":"47508840937719","title":"Five Favorite Films with Amanda Seyfried","content":"Five Favorite Filmsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Five Favorite Films with Amanda SeyfriedThe Lovelace star also chats about her new film.by Matt Atchity | August 9, 2013 |  CommentsAmanda Seyfried began her career as a young model and daytime soap actress before she caught her big screen break in Mean Girls, the high school comedy penned by Tina Fey. She went on to play supporting roles in films like Nine Lives and Alpha Dog before sharing screen time with legends like Meryl Streep (Mamma Mia!), Vanessa Redgrave (Letters to Juliet), and Glenn Close (Albert Nobbs), among a slew of others. This week, she stars in Lovelace, a biopic of the adult movie star who was exploited and abused by her husband and starred in the famously controversial 1972 film Deep Throat. RT chatted with Seyfried about her preparation for the film and why she’s personally drawn to intimate storytelling, but first, here are her Five Favorite Films:Mother and Child (Rodrigo Garcia, 2010; 79% Tomatometer)Mother and Child by Rodrigo García, because he’s really incredible about dealing with human relationships and he’s not afraid to go as dark as you need. He’s one of my favorite directors of all time, and I think he can write for a woman almost better than he can for a man. (laughs) And he’s a straight man. His father is actually Gabriel Garcia Marquez. He’s got just a nice touch with women and the performances are outstanding. Annette Bening and Naomi Watts and Britt [Brittany] Robertson, just f***ing everybody in that movie is… oh, it’s just f***ing one of the most beautiful, flawless films I’ve ever seen.Romeo + Juliet (Baz Luhrmann, 1996; 71% Tomatometer)Romeo + Juliet. I was always a big Leo fan and Claire Danes fan. And Baz Luhrman just, I dunno, looked into my soul. I think I was maybe 12 when that came out, 11. It had an effect on me that made me wanna be an actor.You were looking up at the screen saying, “I want to be on the other side of that.”Yeah, and I want to feel that way. And also, I want to feel that love. I just want to experience what they were experiencing, in any capacity. It just made me feel so much; it made me realize my emotional capacity.Animal Kingdom (David Michôd, 2010; 97% Tomatometer)Another movie would have to be Animal Kingdom by David Michôd.That was a hell of a movie.Another flawless movie. Like, the way it starts out, it’s like, I wanna work with that guy forever. And a good friend of mine, or two good friends of mine, are in that Blue Tongue film group, that Australian filmmakers group. And, you know, they had to set up an incredible vision. Really, really human, really dark, really disturbing.Right. Jackie Weaver is so scary in that.Yeah, so great. But even just the way they start out the film with the kid sitting there for, like, two minutes, a minute and a half, next to his dead mother. It’s really profound. A look into, you know, another place that I’m just not aware of and I have no familiarity with. It’s just f***ing great.Hannah and Her Sisters (Woody Allen, 1986; 91% Tomatometer)I guess I’m gonna have to say Hannah and her Sisters because I only recently saw that in the last year and, I mean, Dianne Wiest… All the female characters are amazing. It’s like before they’re all, before everybody’s…A household name?Before everybody was a household name, before everybody had an image, before anybody has, like, a layer of the industry, like, before… I dunno, it’s just very untainted. Really great stuff from back in the day. God, I could study [Woody Allen’s films]; it’s unbelievable. But I guess I’ll have to say that one. Crimes and Misdemeanors is f***ing great but I’m not gonna say that’s one of my [five].Wet Hot American Summer (David Wain, 2001; 31% Tomatometer)Wet Hot American Summer is a classic comedy and if it’s on I’m gonna finish watching it. What’s to say? It’s just like a bunch of f***ing ridiculously funny people. It’s just so stupid. It’s so good.That movie’s a lot of fun though.It’s so fun. I mean, come on, I don’t have any comedies in there so that’s my fifth.Next, Seyfried talks about her new film, Lovelace, and why she likes improv and documentaries.RT: As I’m looking at this list, I see some dark movies on there. Do you have a propensity to like dark stuff?Amanda Seyfried: Yeah. I also have a propensity to like documentaries. Because it’s all really happening. It’s just, it’s not fiction. I prefer to read novels — fiction novels — but in terms of movies, I like biopics and I love documentaries.RT: Which, of course, gets us right into Lovelace.AS: Right. Yeah. I love studying people. Real stuff, real life stuff. I don’t like action movies because it doesn’t feel realistic. It’s really sad for me when I’m in a movie that feels unrealistic, but sometimes I do certain things for certain reasons but for the most part I’m attracted to movies that are real, and performances that are real, and it’s like… You just feel like you shouldn’t be watching it because you feel like you’re invading someone’s privacy, you know what I mean? That’s what I love. That’s why Animal Kingdom is so f***ing good. And Martha Marcy May Marlene. Like, I just love these movies because you don’t feel like you’re watching a movie. F***ing relationships, you know?RT: Are you more attracted to movies with roles that allow for that kind of intimacy you’re talking about?AS: Oh, absolutely. I mean, I love improv because of that. You watch two people kind of exploring some circumstances and a dynamic, and you don’t know where it’s gonna go, but there’s confines, there’s a structure there, but… I like watching something really take place, really develop. And I like being a part of that, too. One of the greatest moments of my career was on the beach with Peter Sarsgaard, shooting this movie, where we were allowed to improvise a little bit. Honestly three minutes of the film, like, rolling. We had two cameras on us, so we didn’t have to redo it. They didn’t use most of it but, man, it was so intense, because I was playing somebody else, but it was like, something was really happening, something was really being created out of the circumstances.RT: Is it hard to go to an intense place for a role like Linda Lovelace?AS: Yeah. Sometimes I’m just not in the headspace to be able to get deep enough, you know, the day-to-day. But sometimes I am. And then when you are, it’s harder, it’s really hard to f***ing pull yourself out of it, so… [sighs] That’s the scary part of this, because I did kind of, for the first time in my life, lose myself a little bit. It’s hard to reach back out.RT: So what’s next for you?AS: Oh what’s next? I’m gonna work with Noah Baumbach in September and October. And Naomi Watts, and Ben Stiller. I just finished a movie with Seth MacFarlane, which could push Wet Hot American Summer out of my fifth favorite movies.RT: That’s the western he’s been working on?AS: Yeah. I have a feeling, whether I’m in it or not, it’s gonna be one of my favorite movies of all time. Feels good to say that, too, ’cause I mean it!Lovelace hits theaters in limited release today.","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"movies, Bowl, italian, who, Oscars, laika, Paramount, Disney, serial, Studios, Food, 2017, John, zombie","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/dsf.jpg","slug":"five-favorite-films-with-amanda-seyfried-3"},{"id":"47508844219665","title":"Five Favorite Films with Joe Dante","content":"Five Favorite Filmsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Five Favorite Films with Joe DanteThe director of The Hole shares a handful of films that have impacted him.by Grae Drake | October 22, 2012 |  CommentsJoe Dante‘s movies root themselves into your psyche and refuse to let go. Those little guys with eating restrictions (Gremlins), watching movies during a national crisis (Matinee), having creepy neighbors (The ‘Burbs), and accidentally getting shrunk down and injected into someone (Innerspace) remain some of the most memorable of all time. It shouldn’t come as any surprise that his latest film, The Hole, is pretty much for kids, just not the ones who are faint of heart.Here are the great films that inspired this fantastic filmmaker. Watching them is kind of like going to film school for free. You can send Joe a thank you card.Touch of Evil (Orson Welles, 1958; 95% Tomatometer)This mesmerizingly brilliant film noir was Orson Welles’ last Hollywood movie. Dumped into second feature playdates, it’s finally become more popular than Citizen Kane. It was recut and reshot by the studio but a longer preview version surfaced a few years ago and is preferable to the well-meaning but bogus “reconstruction” edit which seems to be the extant version. Both are available on the dvd box set.The Ballad of Cable Hogue (Sam Peckinpah, 1970; 92% Tomatometer)Sam Peckinpah followed The Wild Bunch with a deeply personal, lyrical western love story which was promptly buried by its distributor. Its failure to find an audience nearly caused the director to abandon westerns altogether, but over the years its reputation has grown and it stands as one of Peckinpah’s finest.The Bride of Frankenstein (James Whale, 1935, 100% Tomatometer)One of the premier examples of a sequel that bests the original. Director James Whale received carte blanche to make this quirky, stylish and mordantly funny follow up to what was probably the greatest horror film of its day. The amped-up creation scene is still one of the genre’s most memorable.The Black Book (Anthony Mann, 1949; N/A Tomatometer)Originally issued as Reign of Terror, Anthony Mann’s Classics-Illustrated-meets-film-noir treatment of the French revolution is one of the most striking low budget period pieces to come from Hollywood, abetted by graphic b/w imagery from the great d.p. John Alton and striking production design from the always reliable William Cameron Menzies. Plus it’s witty moves like lightning.Once Upon a Time in the West (Sergio Leone, 1968; 98% Tomatometer)Sergio Leone cashed in his Dollars chips to make the Euro western to end them all. Thematically rich and generally regarded as the greatest spaghetti western of them all, brilliantly choreographed to Ennio Morricone’s unforgettable music. Impressive set-pieces abound and, combined with iconic casting and eye-filling US locations, mark this as a dreamscape of an Old West about to be invaded by “progress”.The Hole is in theaters and concurrently available on home video now.","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"name, medical, Yoda, football, Mystery, 20th","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/JoeDante.jpg","slug":"five-favorite-films-with-joe-dante-2"},{"id":"47508842207495","title":"Five Favorite Films with Ray Winstone","content":"Five Favorite Filmsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Five Favorite Films with Ray WinstoneThe enduring British tough guy and star of this week's The Sweeney on his all-time favorite films.by RT Staff | March 1, 2013 |  CommentsChances are that when audiences think “tough Cockney geezer” they picture Ray Winstone, the veteran British actor whose enduring gallery of rogues has practically given him trademark on the type. From his early roles as young punks and ne’er do-wells in movies like Quadrophenia, Scum and Ladies and Gentlemen, the Fabulous Stains through his unforgettable performances in Nil by Mouth and Sexy Beast, Winstone cornered the market in British hard men — and directors like Martin Scorsese (The Departed) and Steven Spielberg (Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull) took note.Winstone has just wrapped filming Darren Aronofsky’s Noah opposite Russell Crowe, and this week he’s in theaters as the lead in British hit The Sweeney — an adaptation of the iconic 1970s police show on which, coincidentally, the star landed one of his earliest roles. We had a chance to chat with Winstone recently about his all-time favorite films.Raging Bull (Martin Scorsese, 1980; 98% Tomatometer)Well, not necessarily in this order. You’ve got Raging Bull, for the reason that it’s a masterpiece of movie-making. I love it because, when you cut the boxing out, it’s about people. It’s beautifully shot. The slow-motion stuff, the music, the characters, the acting, the direction. It’s classic to me because I’ve been a boxer, and it emotionally touches me. The heart just got to me. I was sitting there with my mate watching that, and he’s a boxer and a champion boxer, and we were both crying at the end of the movie — [laughs] which sounds ridiculous, but it got to us, you know?Once Upon a Time in America (Sergio Leone, 1984; 87% Tomatometer)Another movie is Once Upon a Time In America, which is a bit of genius film-making, I think. That’s a film I can watch all night long. And I think it is four hours long, or something like that. It’s just a wonderful film to watch.Zulu (Cy Endfield, 1964; 93% Tomatometer)Then you could cut away from films like that and say a film like Zulu, with Stanley Baker and Michael Caine. It’s just a film that, no matter where you pick it up — like the first two — you have to keep watching. I think I watch that film three times a year.The Vikings (Richard Fleishcer, 1958; 71% Tomatometer)Another film would be The Vikings, with Kirk Douglas and Tony Curtis — with a Bronx accent, I guess, as a viking. But it’s a stirring film, you know, and one of the great films of the time.The Searchers (John Ford, 1956; 100% Tomatometer)I could go on and on. Like The Searchers, with John Wayne. It’s a wonderful film. Brilliantly shot, you know. And Wayne’s playing a bigot in it. A man who’s got a hatred about him, but by the end of it he changes. It’s such a great performance, hero playing a man like that. But you know, I got a million films; I could probably give you another five or 10 that would be totally different. You know a film that changed my mind about everything? I was in New York years ago, walking along on my own, and I saw a film called The Tin Drum. I went in and it started and I thought, “F–k, it’s a German film,” and they’ve got these subtitles and I thought, “I can’t be bothered with this.” But I sat there, and within 10 minutes I forgot about reading it and I just sat there watching this film. What a film. And it kind of changed my mind about film-making.The Sweeney opens theatrically in select locations this week.","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"star, comiccon, Western, story, Awards, Mary, york, of, Larson, new","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/lkcxv.jpg","slug":"five-favorite-films-with-ray-winstone"},{"id":"47508842210569","title":"Five Favorite Films with Jon Cryer","content":"Five Favorite Filmsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Five Favorite Films with Jon CryerThe Two and a Half Men star talks about his latest film projects.by Kerr Lordygan | January 23, 2013 |  CommentsTwo time Emmy winner Jon Cryer is one of the funniest men on TV, with Two and a Half Men still enjoying success in its tenth season. But we’ve also enjoyed his quite memorable film work for years. No child of the 1980s can forget his “Duckie Dance” in Pretty in Pink, Hot Shots! still makes us laugh, and some of us fondly recall him as a punk rocker in the Penelope Spheeris film Dudes. Now, after a DVD release of his stage performance in Stephen Sondheim’s Company and the upcoming Sundance debut of Ass Backwards with Casey Wilson, June Raphael, Alicia Silverstone and Vincent D’Onofrio, this terrific talent was gracious enough to take some time out and discuss his Five Favorite Films.Jon, like all of us, had difficulty pinpointing just five. During the discussion, he thought to switch in one of his runners up: Toy Story, The Iron Giant, Brazil, The Terminator, Broadway Danny Rose, Annie Hall and the original Rollerball: “Come on,” he says, “the original Rollerball holds up f—king great and it’s such a shame that the remake was so terrible, and it’s weird that nobody watches the original Rollerball anymore. I don’t see it playing and it holds up great.” Instead, here are the Five that he ultimately settled on:Goodfellas (Martin Scorsese, 1990; 97% Tomatometer)It is one of the most effective and, in my mind, realistic gangster movies ever made in that it shows you what the allure of that criminal life is, but it also shows how petty and dangerous and stupid it is. But all the time you’re dragged along. It has this incredible compelling force that drags you along whether you want to go or not. And, I think, a beautiful and brutal use of comedy along with absolute horror and fear and moments of sort of operatic beauty, like when they open up the back of the truck with the Eric Clapton song, and the camera goes in to find one of the dead gang members. That mixed with these incredible moments of subtlety like when Ray Liotta realizes that Robert De Niro may well be setting him up. It’s just this tiny little moment. It’s great because it’s incredibly small, mixed with these incredibly big things. And they shoot Michael Imperioli in the foot. You know, come on, that’s wonderful.All That Jazz (Bob Fosse, 1979; 87% Tomatometer)A great, great movie that was unjustly robbed of a lot of the recognition it would have gotten, but it came out in the year of amazing other movies, you know, like Apocalypse Now and a lot of other great stuff. To this date it is the most accurate portrayal of theater folk and what it’s like to produce and be part of theater. As a theater geek all my life, I was hoping that Smash would be like that, and boy it’s not. All That Jazz nailed it, just in terms of the reality of it. But again, it would go off into those fantasies that still totally worked, and worked as incredible dance numbers, but you know, were clearly fantasy numbers inside one of the most realistic portrayals of that subculture that had never been put on screen. It’s f—ing perfect. It’s just f—ing perfect. It’s great because it’s funny, it’s cynical about the theater but also clearly loves the subject matter. You know, I grew up backstage — my parents were actors — and it just captures that world absolutely incredibly accurately. Plus, it’s just a really ballsy, artistic movie from Bob Fosse in that it incorporates a lot of strange stuff, but all of it works.Aliens (James Cameron, 1986; 98% Tomatometer)Not Alien, which is great, but doesn’t quite hold up, partially because there is a couple of special effects issues. The chest-burster, as originally conceived, just doesn’t work anymore. But Aliens is, in my mind, the perfectly constructed thriller. People forget that it starts off real slow. I mean, there’s like 40 minutes of quiet. And then all of a sudden you can’t leave your seat. It’s beautifully constructed in terms of, every time you think that they’re gonna get some respite, they get a moment to get their stuff together and maybe get out of this, things get worse and yet they somehow keep going. It was one of the most pure moviegoing experiences I’ve ever had. I loved every minute of it and it made me feel lucky to be an audience member. You can’t get around an experience like that.Close Encounters of the Third Kind (Steven Spielberg, 1977; 95% Tomatometer)A beautifully done movie that now, unfortunately, tragically, as a parent you watch and has a very troubling ending. But I have to say as a kid when I saw it and I was unburdened with having my own children, it was absolutely transporting and, again, an incredibly subtle piece of work. Richard Dreyfuss and Teri Garr’s relationship falling apart, and Melinda Dillon’s journey… It’s full of wonderful, subtle acting in a movie that a lot of people thought was about spectacle, and it’s so not. And you can see the enormous influence that that movie had on all the big sci-fi movies after it. Nobody has quite duplicated the amazing sound design on it. People have tried — I mean that movie Twister, there were moments in it I looked around and was going “They’re totally doing Close Encounters.” People can try it, and try to mix that reality with the more spectacular stuff, but people have a very hard time achieving it. It’s really a very simple story. He believes something that his wife doesn’t believe. But it’s done so kitchen-sink and perfect and so influenced by the films of the ’70s with the overlapping dialogue and a very vérité sort of style to it. Also, when Spielberg wants to put on a show, he really can.Apocalypse Now (Francis Ford Coppola, 1979; 99% Tomatometer)Apocalypse Now is sort of a fever dream of a movie. When you watch the documentary about the making of Apocalypse Now, you suddenly understand what everybody went through while they were making that thing, and what a huge, unruly beast they got involved with, not even knowing what the movie was going to be. Everybody just decided to be a part of it even though it was just this evolving daily disaster. That being said, it is an amazing tribute to the film, that the beautiful cohesive piece that it is, is what emerged from that craziness. So many scenes that are just so memorable, the amazing lines, and how it just totally transformed war movies because it would have those incredibly realistic moments but also, you know, the huge “Ride of the Valkyries” helicopter attack. And it’s amazing that it worked at all, you know, besides the fact that it actually managed to work beautifully.Did the film become more powerful to you after you saw the documentary?Yes. And I’ve never seen the re-cut version that’s floating around that is an even longer version, which I don’t particularly need to see. But yes, it definitely seems… I loved the movie before that, and always thought it was an amazing piece of work, just in terms that it captured war in this incredibly realistic way, but also in this incredibly metaphorical way that was great. But yes, definitely seeing the documentary increased my fascination with it. To know that Martin Sheen was going through horrible health problems through all of it, to know that they didn’t know where the ending was going, to understand that Brando was just such a nutbag during the course of it that they had to feed him his lines with an earwig. And yet, you can watch those scenes and, even though you know they’re feeding it to him for each sentence because the man cannot be bothered to remember a sentence of his lines, it still works and it’s so surreal. It’s just an amazing piece of work.Next, Cryer talks about Company and Ass Backwards.RT: So Company came out on DVD not too long ago.Jon Cryer: Oh yeah, that was a show we did with the New York Philharmonic. A couple of things about that that were a little odd: When I signed on to do the thing, it was my understanding it was a one performance charity show that we were going to do with scripts in hand. It was all going to be very lighthearted and fun. And then I was informed by the director, “Oh no, this is a fully staged performance with costumes and choreography and the whole nine yards that we’re going to perform four times with the New York Philharmonic, and by the way, it’s going to be shot for a release.” And I thought, “Oh wow, okay. This is a lot of information for me to drink in!”But it was one of my favorite work experiences ever, because we had two weeks to throw together a show that people had huge expectations for, and we didn’t have the cast. I mean, Neil Patrick Harris was still shooting How I Met Your Mother — I, thankfully, had a little bit of free time because my costar had freaked out [laughs] and they had shut the show down — but we didn’t have Neil, the star of the show, for a whole week of the two-week rehearsal period. So we rehearsed with a bunch of Pace University students doubling us; we called them our avatars, because all the days that we missed, they would step in for us. So we had to rehearse it, they sent me MP3s of my parts, and I filmed the choreographer going through the steps so I could practice them by myself, and we basically had to do the show virtually for weeks before we got to get together to assemble it. Actually, the first time the entire cast was together on stage was opening night. [laughs] This wouldn’t have been that frightening if it wasn’t the hottest ticket in New York City at that time.And being immortalized on DVD.JC: Yes, exactly. [laughs] A bunch of us, like me, did not know that this was going to be the big deal that it was, and basically had a choice to either buy out or step up, and everybody chose to step up, and it was a great thing to do. It’s fun. If you’re a theater person, and you like the show, Neil Patrick Harris is amazing. I think, revelatory casting in that part. He made the show work in a way that I’ve not seen the show work before. He’s a terrific performer; in this particular case, it’s just a great matchup of performer and part. And Martha Plimpton, also, just an amazing standout. And Christina Hendricks, holy s—. Yeah, two words: holy s—. She’s really funny, really wonderful.And you worked on a film with Alicia Silverstone and Vincent D’Onofrio?JC: Oh, yeah, but unfortunately I didn’t shoot anything with them. Yeah, it’s with Casey Wilson and June Raphael, it’s called Ass Backwards, and it’s at Sundance. And sadly, I never got to work with Vincent D?Onofrio or Alicia Silverstone or Bob Odenkirk or any of the other people in the movie, but it was super fun. I haven’t seen the final movie; it’s not going to get seen until it makes its debut at Sundance, so I’m excited to see it.One thing I’m thrilled about is, the original script I got was called Ass Backwards, which I thought was a great title and it makes sense in the context of the movie, but then when we were actually shooting, I was informed that the new title was going to be Sister Spirit because some of the investors had come in and said they would not put money into a movie called Ass Backwards. In the last week of shooting, those investors fell out, and the movie had to stop production, and Casey and June had to go on Kickstarter to get the funding for the rest of the movie. The great thing about that was, not only did they get the funding, but they were able to call the movie Ass Backwards, which is what it should have been called from day one.Company is currently available on DVD and Blu-Ray, and Ass Backwards premieres this week during the “Park City at Midnight” program at the Sundance Film Festival.","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"24, One, Emmys, IFC, Holidays, Lifetime, Turner, Fire, TV, teaser, razzies, blaxploitation, camera, Disney","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/sdfff.jpg","slug":"five-favorite-films-with-jon-cryer"},{"id":"47508842351884","title":"Five Favorite Films with Ted","content":"Five Favorite Filmsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Five Favorite Films with TedThe furry star of 2012's biggest comedy waxes lyrical on the cinema he pleasures himself with.by RT Staff | December 10, 2012 |  CommentsHe’s the star (well, co-star if you count Mark Wahlberg) of 2012’s highest-grossing comedy (unless you count Breaking Dawn — Part 2), so we felt it only fitting to ask Ted, the titular furball from Seth MacFarlane’s R-rated hit, to give us his all-time five favorite films.“Besides Flash Gordon,” he says, “which you already know is my number one favorite film of all time.”Indeed, anyone who’s seen the movie will remember Ted and John’s shared affection for the camp sci-fi classic, and the bear also gave us another insight into his creative process: “Yes, the hotel room fight scene was inspired in part by Road House,” he reveals. So now you know that.Here now are the rest of Ted’s most treasured works of cinema, many of which, curiously, correspond with Sight &amp; Sound‘s list of the all-time greatest films. Possibly.You can catch the diminutive beast’s acting debut in Ted, which is out on Blu-ray and DVD this week.Flash Gordon (Mike Hodges, 1980; 80% Tomatometer)The best movie ever made. EVER. It has action, adventure, Sam Jones, epic space battles, hot space babes and a kickass theme song. And one day, I will realize my dream of sleeping with Princess Aura of Mongo, even if I have to pay an escort to wear the outfit.Road House (Rowdy Herrington, 1989; 43% Tomatometer)There is only one Patrick Swayze, and this is the ultimate Swayze flick. As a Mercedes-driving bouncer with a degree in philosophy, he is perhaps the second-greatest action hero of all time. It’s almost as if Walker, Texas Ranger and Billy Jack had a smarter, better-looking brother who also knew how to dance. I can watch this movie forever.Tango &amp; Cash (Albert Magnoli and Andrey Konchalovskiy , 1989; 39% Tomatometer)This is like Road House in stereo. You get a badass Stallone and a badass Kurt Russell as buddy cops who get framed and sent to prison. John and I used to pretend we were Tango and Cash when we were kids. In fact, we still do whenever we watch it, which was as recently as last week. It just never gets old.Up in Smoke (Lou Adler and Tommy Chong, 1978; 38% Tomatometer)Cheech and Chong were these stoned guys from the 1970s who got famous getting high and then made movies about getting high, which made them more famous. This is their first movie, and also their best. It is, quite possibly, the Citizen Kane of pot movies.Dude, Where’s My Car? (Danny Leiner, 2000; 18% Tomatometer)I cannot praise this film enough. It has given me (and John) the gift of laughter even when sober, which is the sign of a truly great movie. It has everything: hot babes, aliens, a refrigerator full of pudding — I really think everything came together in this one, and it shows. If a non-porn film can make you feel as good as this one does, then it truly is movie magic.Ted is out on DVD and Blu-ray this week.","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"A&E, APB, Captain","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/safsafsaf.jpg","slug":"five-favorite-films-with-ted"},{"id":"47508842205446","title":"Five Favorite Films with Noomi Rapace","content":"Five Favorite Filmsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Five Favorite Films with Noomi RapaceThe star of Prometheus, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo and this week's thriller Dead Man Down on her all-time favorite movies.by RT Staff | March 7, 2013 |  CommentsNoomi Rapace rose to international stardom as Lisbeth Salander in the original adaptation of Stieg Larsson’s The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo and its sequels, success she parlayed into roles in Sherlock Holmes: Game of Shadows and Ridley Scott’s hit Alien prequel, Prometheus. With a sequel to the latter in the works and two movies opposite Tom Hardy on the horizon, Rapace is balancing a burgeoning Hollywood career with acclaimed roles in her native Sweden. This week, she stars opposite Colin Farrell, Terrence Howard and Isabelle Huppert in the action thriller Dead Man Down, which reunites her with Dragon Tattoo director Niels Arden Oplev for his English-language debut. We spoke with the actress recently and got the scoop on her all-time favorite films.True Romance (Tony Scott, 1993; 91% Tomatometer)I love True Romance. When I read the script for Dead Man Down, it kind of reminded me a little bit of that one. It’s like some kind of thing similar to that crazy world around them: the violence, the criminals, the macho culture, and those two main characters with very complicated souls. So that one is one of my favorites.Raging Bull (Martin Scorsese, 1980; 98% Tomatometer)Of course, I love Raging Bull. And I love The Godfather. [Laughs] Maybe I need to find something a little fresher. But Raging Bull, you can always feel when an actor kind of goes into — I don’t know Robert De Niro, but I kind of get this feeling that he went really deep into it, and that the character and he melded together. I can feel like he’s not pretending. He’s actually living it. That’s always something that hits me, and I forget about the outside world; it’s almost like the movie I’m watching takes over and becomes my reality. I’ve seen Raging Bull so many times and it feels so pure and real. It’s beautiful and sexy and rough, and there’s so much pain in it at the same time. I think it always attracts me, you know, with people struggling and people fighting and people wanting to become something, wanting to change their lives or change who they are; people fighting with their own demons. For me, that’s such a beautiful example of that — someone who was really focused on being something, and becoming something, and how hard it is and how much you need to fight.When we interviewed Ray Winstone recently, he picked Raging Bull as one of his favorites, too.I love him, by the way, in Gary Oldman’s movie Nil by Mouth.Nil by Mouth (Gary Oldman, 1997; 65% Tomatometer)That’s one of my favorites. That one is on my list, too. When I saw it, it just blew me away completely. I saw it when I was quite young, and I remember thinking, “My god, are these really actors? Could a movie be done this way?” It was something I’d never seen before, and it was so brutal and so real; just like watching a documentary. Those kinds of filmmakers and actors kind of opened up things in me that gave me hope and inspired me. I felt less lonely in a way, because I thought, “Okay, there’s people out there exploring things that I would like to do.” People who were not afraid of darkness; people who were not afraid of going into things that were not charming and easy and, you know, sweet and cute. That one made a very strong impression on me.Frances (Graeme Clifford, 1982; 93% Tomatometer)And then Frances — do you remember the movie Frances, with Jessica Lange? I love that movie, too. It’s such an amazing portrait of a woman losing herself into a different reality. I did a movie called Babycall and it’s also about a woman with two realities, in a way, and she’s kind of drifting in and out. She knows that she should stay in this world and that she should be focused; she needs to pull herself together and sort out her brain, but at the same time she can’t control it. I think that Jessica did it beautiful and so strong. It just broke my heart, that movie. So when I did Babycall, I revisited Frances. So that one is a movie that I love. It always inspires me.Bullhead (Michael R. Roskam, 2011; 87% Tomatometer)I love the movie Bullhead. I’m working with the director now. He’s kind of putting the light into a business, a very dirty business — it’s not the cool gangsters, it’s not the kind of sexy gangster world; it’s the gritty, very uncharming world of criminals working in the meat industry in Belgium. And the whole backstory to this lead guy is so incredible. I was in tears a couple of times when I saw it. And now I’m gonna work with Matthias [Schoenaerts] and with Michaël R. Roskam, who directed it.Dead Man Down opens in theaters this week.","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"Set","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/xv.jpg","slug":"five-favorite-films-with-noomi-rapace"},{"id":"47508842354957","title":"Five Favorite Films with Charlie Hunnam","content":"Five Favorite Filmsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Five Favorite Films with Charlie HunnamThe star of this week's Deadfall -- and Guillermo del Toro's forthcoming Pacific Rim -- on his five favorite movies of the moment.by Luke Goodsell | December 5, 2012 |  CommentsIt’s a big, busy year ahead for Charlie Hunnam. Besides his ongoing role in TV hit Sons of Anarchy, the actor is starring in Guillermo del Toro’s massively anticipated sci-fi throwdown Pacific Rim, which marks the director’s first film in five years and looks set to be one of 2013’s summer smashes. In the meantime, Hunnam is appearing opposite Eric Bana and Olivia Wilde in this week’s snowbound neo-noir thriller Deadfall, in which he plays an ex-con boxer tangled up in a deadly game of survival.“I’d always been interested in telling the classic hero’s journey,” Hunnam says of Deadfall. “You know, told with the contemporary narrative of a man being released from prison. I felt like the psychology of that character resonated very deeply. Through this I had the experience of being a boxer. So I put myself through a boxing academy and completely gave myself over to boxing. I did that seven days a week for five weeks.”The rigors of such training paled in comparison to the Guillermo del Toro regime, however; which perhaps goes with the territory when you sign on for a role piloting a giant robot. “It was pretty torturous, I must say,” Hunnam laughs. “Guillermo likes practical effects. So do I, but the reality is that it’s incredibly difficult. It was the most demanding experience I’ve had in my life — partly because the nature of what I was doing was very difficult, and partly because Guillermo’s completely a slave driver.”He laughs again. “I say that absolutely adoring the man and everything about him, but boy, he will work you til you’re on the verge of death.”Well, Hunnam has survived to tell the tale. You can see him in Deadfall in theaters and on demand this week, and here now he talks us through five of his favorite films.Pusher III (Nicholas Winding Refn, 2005; 92% Tomatometer)My relationship to film is dictated to a lot by what I’m working on at the time, and right now I’m writing so there’s a few films that I’ve been watching a great deal of.My top three films at the moment are Pusher III, A Prophet and Bullhead. I think that how those films are constructed, tonally, is what I’m looking for, because none of them follow a narrative that I’m interested in — although the worlds have some similarities. I’m looking to do a very personal exploration of a man’s journey that is, for whatever reason, slightly outside of everyday society, but still has all of those hopes and desires of everyone else in America.I just think, of the three Pushers, for me as an audience member, enjoying those films I go backwards. I think Pusher III is a masterpiece; Pusher II I like a great deal; and Pusher is my least favorite of the trilogy, which is the only time I’ve ever had that experience. I mean, I guess I do like Godfather II more than Godfather one; well I don’t know if I like it more, I find myself watching it more frequently. I really like the struggle of that character through Pusher III. Unlike the other films, he’s really, really trying to do the right thing with his life over the course of that film. And you just see that, because of the environment he’s in and the forces that surround him, that he keeps getting pulled down over and over and over until he descends into total darkness at the end.A Prophet (Jacques Audiard, 2009; 97% Tomatometer)More than anything, with these three films, it was really the performances — which was certainly the actor, but it was also the writing and the direction. Powerhouse performances in all three of those movies, especially in A Prophet.Bullhead (Michael R. Roskam, 2011; 70% Tomatometer)You know, what I’ve really been studying are single-perspective narratives of grand character journeys, and A Prophet and Bullhead really achieve that in a wondrous way. What I’ve been trying to figure out is how to stay, as authentically as possible, within the single narrative of just the one character while bringing an entire world to life through that. It’s a challenge I’ve really been focused on.Valhalla Rising (Nicholas Winding Refn, 2009; 71% Tomatometer)Of the films I’ve seen of late, I adored Drive, also — another Nicholas Refn joint. You know another film I adore of Refn’s — and I seem to be in the minority on this — is Valhalla Rising.I loved that. That’s my favorite of that trilogy he did, with Bronson and Drive.Me too, yeah. I mean, Mads Mikkelsen is just spectacular in that movie. And it’s where I’m from, you know; it’s those hills. Well I guess it was a little further north than where I come from, but I felt a sense of pride — geographically — over that film.It was shot in… Scotland, right?It was shot in the highlands of Scotland, in Northumbria — which, if you go north, it turns into the highlands of Northumbria.So you’re really nostalgic for that grim weather, huh?[Laughs] I really am. I went from Newcastle to the Lake District and in the Lake District it rains about 275 days a year, so I’m a kid that’s used to getting rained on.Casino (Martin Scorsese, 1995; 80% Tomatometer)Hunger (Steve McQueen, 2008, 90% Tomatometer)&nbsp;&nbsp;You know what’s another film that I watch over and over again? Actually I just came up with two more films, both because I think they’re masterpieces of contemporary storytelling — non-linear storytelling. Casino, I think, is probably up there with Chinatown in the best screenplays ever written. I love the film itself, but if you look at the sophistication of that screenplay and how they effortlessly move between time periods and geographic locations with no problem whatsoever — and of course they use narration but still, I feel it’s a truly spectacular display of storytelling.And somewhat overlooked in the Scorsese filmography; at least compared to some of his other stuff.Oh I know, I know. And it’s a film I sometimes bring up and wax lyrical about its brilliance and get a lot of kind of blank stares in return; and I think, “Go back and have a look at the way they’re telling the story, the information you’re getting and the rapidity with which that world is set up, and the nuance.” It’s just a spectacular piece of storytelling.And then, for the same reason, I’ve been obsessed with watching Hunger.That is a great, great film.Yeah. More than anything, that’s a film that I’ve been watching over and over and over again, because the device with which they bring the audience into the world in that first act through a character that’s not seen in the film again, it’s just something I’ve never seen done before. It’s storytelling; it’s brave and fresh and non-linear in a way — I mean it is, it is linear, but in a non-traditional, non-linear approach to a linear narrative.Deadfall opens theatrically this week and is available to watch on demand.","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"VH1, Britbox, Vudu, christmas, quibi","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/dde.jpg","slug":"five-favorite-films-with-charlie-hunnam"},{"id":"47508842276106","title":"Five Favorite Films with West Memphis Three’s Damien Echols","content":"Five Favorite Filmsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Five Favorite Films with West Memphis Three's Damien EcholsWith the documentary West of Memphis in theaters, we talk to wrongly-convicted death row inmate -- and now free man -- Damien Wayne Echols about his favorite films, life on the inside, and the strange process of becoming a celebrity.by Luke Goodsell | December 25, 2012 |  CommentsIt’s hard to imagine just how surreal Damien Echols’ life must have been. In 1994, the teenager was sentenced to death for his alleged part, along with two others, in the gruesome 1993 murder of three boys in Arkansas. Convicted by state prosecutors riding a wave of public and media hysteria, the so-called West Memphis Three spent the next 18 years in prison — until an accumulation of new evidence raised doubts as to their guilt and, in 2011, they were finally set free.Having spent most of his adult life incarcerated, Echols has since become something of a celebrity, drawing the support of people like Peter Jackson, Johnny Depp and Eddie Vedder, who lent their weight to the campaign to free the falsely-accused men and expose the miscarriage of justice. Jackson also co-produced an extensive new documentary about the case — Amy Berg’s West of Memphis — and with the film opening theatrically this week, we had the opportunity to sit down and talk with Echols recently.“That’s the reason we’re doing this,” says Echols of the film, “just to get as many people to see this as possible, to try and get the word out. Cause in the end that’s all the state of Arkansas cares about, you know. They don’t care about justice or anything else: they only care about how many people are paying attention to what they’re doing. I mean, that’s what keeps them from getting away with stuff — how many people are watching.”Behind tinted shades he occasionally removes for a rich, lively laugh, an understandably haunted Echols is also exhausted by the process of promoting a movie. “Burned out doesn’t even begin to describe it,” Echols sighs. “It gets to the point where you wanna start screaming and throwing sh*t through windows,” he laughs. “[I’m] not used to this at all. Even actors get burned out by this stuff. I’m not an actor. At least then, if you’re talking to an actor, they’re talking about a project they worked on, like a piece of art they created. But when you’re having to talk about this for hours — we’re not even talking about something we created, it’s more like we’re talking about some f**kin’ horrible tragedy that was dumped on us. So it’s not like you can really take pride in the work that you’ve done.”Read on for more of the interview, in which Echols talks about life in prison, his admiration for Stephen King, how the support of those famous pals helped save him from death row, and his plans with Depp to produce a screen version of his memoir.First up, he took a moment to talk about his five favorite films.The Mothman Prophecies (Mark Pellington, 2001; 53% Tomatometer)Normally if a movie doesn’t have a monster in it, I’m not interested. All I like are horror movies; but I don’t like slasher movies. To me, just seeing people getting hurt, that’s not entertaining to me. My favorite things of all time, they have to have a supernatural element to them, and there has to be a sense of romance to them, and an otherworldly quality that makes you feel like there’s more magic in life. So for me, my five favorite movies of all time are the ones I’ve watched over and over and over.Number one, just first and foremost my favorite movie of all time — The Mothman Prophecies, with Richard Gere and Debra Messing. Have you ever seen that?I haven’t seen it, no. It sounded interesting.It’s great. It’s so subtle, but haunting at the same time. So that one…The Sixth Sense (M. Night Shyamalan, 1999; 85% Tomatometer)…and M. Night Shyamalan’s The Sixth Sense. That’s another one, it’s just got that — it’s like the otherworldly and the mundane just clash, and blend together in this way that you can’t tell where one ends and the other starts. I love that movie.The Fourth Kind (Olatunde Osunsanmi, 2009; 19% Tomatometer)Did you ever see a movie called The Fourth Kind?You’ve got me there again. I don’t think so.Milla Jovovich is in it. It’s another one of those ones that’s based on a true story, like The Mothman Prophecies. They use a lot of found footage in it — well not found footage, but like cop car cameras and things like that. This is one of those movies that, you know, it will make the hair stand up on the back of your neck. It’s horrifying.Bram Stoker’s Dracula (Francis Ford Coppola, 1992; 80% Tomatometer)Bram Stoker’s Dracula, that came out in 1992, with Gary Oldman.Now that movie I love.I love that movie. I watch that one over and over and over again. I love that one. The costumes, the people… even though the people… like Keanu Reeves, he may not be the greatest actor, but you don’t even realize that when you’re watching it — it’s like you’re so sucked into the world of the romance, and the visuals that are just so rich and decadent. And it makes you wanna live that life, you know. It makes you wanna live in a castle somewhere where you only use candles for lighting.But no mirrors, of course.[Laughs] Yeah.I think Keanu’s fine in that film, by the way. He’s perfectly hammy, in an almost Hammer horror way.I do too! But everybody else says he was terrible, that he was horrible in it.Halloween (Rob Zombie, 2007; 24% Tomatometer)Now I just said I don’t like slasher movies, but this is the exception to that rule — because it’s the exception to horror movies. The Rob Zombie remake of Halloween — that thing is f**king genius. It’s like he violates every rule of horror movie making and makes it work. Most horror movies are atmospheric, they’re really dark or they’re at night and they’re creepy; his is taking place in bright noon sunshine daylight, out in the yard. And the way he goes into the story of the Michael Myers character, you know, the reason why he’s making all these masks. That is a great movie.I guess I also like it because of the outside scenes. You know, when they show people walking down the sidewalk or something — it feels like Autumn. You see leaves skitter across the sidewalk as the wind blows ’em, and you feel Halloween when you’re watching ’em. I remember the first time I saw that was when we were in prison. They’ll show movies on holidays just to take the tension out of the air a little bit — and that was the movie we got to see on Christmas. On Christmas they showed us Halloween. And when it was over — it was Christmas night, about 9 o’clock — as soon as it went off I went into such a deep state of mourning, because it was like my favorite time of year was gone. From the Equinox to Christmas morning, that is like the richest, most velvety, delicious time of year.People always ask me, you know, they would say, “How would you describe heaven — in this perfect atmosphere where everything is exactly how you wanted it, how would it be?” And I say, “It would always be December.” So I realized that time of year was over, it was gone, and I was going to have to wait all the way around the will of the year to get back to Autumn and Halloween again. And seeing it in that movie, I just sat down and started crying when it was over, because I realized I was gonna have to make it through another long, hot, brutal summer, you know — prison guards torturing you, there’s nothing to look forward to. It was a horrible feeling. It feels like there’s a hole in you or something. But I can watch that movie now, and automatically feel that time of year again.Next, find out what movies they won’t play in prison — and just how many times Echols has seen The Shawshank Redemption. Plus, his thoughts on writing, the support of Depp and Vedder, and playing laser tag with the cast and crew of The Hobbit.&nbsp;So, do they have a policy in prison about any movies they won’t show you?Damien Echols: Yeah. They won’t show anything — this is the weirdest thing, they’re so paranoid — like, for example, they shut all magazines out of prison, except for TV Guide and Entertainment Weekly. All other magazines, like Rolling Stone, GQ, Esquire, Playboy — they said they promote homosexuality. So they block ’em out of the prison and say they’re not coming in. Which I always thought was kinda weird when you take into consideration that this is an institution that forces hundreds of men to shower together every day. But that was like their movie policy, too: They wouldn’t show anything like, say Brokeback Mountain. Doesn’t matter how many awards it wins, or how great it is, they just say, “No. It promotes homosexuality. It’s not in.” But they’ll turn around and show Rob Zombie movies, you know, on Christmas Day.Do they ever show prison escape movies? Did they show The Shawshank Redemption?DE: They showed The Shawshank Redemption, I’d say, 20 times in the time I was there.Was that just to torture you? You know, “This guy escaped but you’re stuck in here.”DE: [Laughs] I don’t know. [Laughs] I have no idea what their reasoning behind that was. There was another one that they would show over and over and over, too. What was it? The Shawshank Redemption and, oh, The Green Mile.You’re a Stephen King fan, aren’t you? There’s that scene in West of Memphis where they’re collecting your books and there’s a lot of his stuff in the box. Is that your kind of genre to write in?DE: Oh yeah. Well people say — I mean, I have a ninth-grade education, I never even graduated high school…But from what I’ve seen, you’re a good writer.DE: Well that’s what people say: “How did you learn to write?” And I learned to write by reading Stephen King novels. I started reading them when I was somewhere between 10 and 12 years old. Some of them now I’ve read in the double digits, because the characters feel like old friends that I like to go back and visit sometimes. And that’s how I learned how to write.One of the first things I did when I got out was — I’d self-published a memoir when I was in prison called Almost Home — and I looked it up online just to see what the reviews of it were, what people were saying about it. And I saw this one by this one woman that said, “The whole time I was reading this book I kept having this nagging sensation that I’ve heard this voice before, and about three-fourths of the way through I realized it’s Stephen King.” To me that was about the greatest compliment she could have given me.We’re writing about different things: He’s writing fiction and I’m writing non-fiction; he’s writing stories about monsters and the end of the world and I’m writing about daily prison life — but at the same time I tried to write to the beat. Like when you listen to music, you hear a beat, and you could write a new song to the beat of the old song — well it’s the same thing for me when I’m reading. It’s like I feel a beat to the writing style. So whenever I sat down to write, I guess I’d just read so many of his books, so many times, that I automatically started trying to match that beat while I was writing. And that’s where I learned how to write from.Now that Johnny Depp’s picked up the rights to your new memoir, Life After Death, what are the plans for it?DE: Well we’re still in the very early stages of it. We’re still sort of kicking around ideas now about who we would want to do it, but one of the things we’re really strongly considering — and it’s probably the direction we’re gonna go in — is, instead of making like a big theatrical movie, do something like a mini-series. Pitch it to someone, you know, like HBO and see if they would be interested in it. It gives you more time to tell the story. You could do it in a shorter time period — you know, it takes like two years to get a movie into theaters, and you could do this in a year. So it gives you more time to tell the story and it reaches a wider audience. And you can get really quality directors and actors and writers. I mean, you’ve got people like Martin Scorsese directing Boardwalk Empire.Is it weird to be in this position now? I mean, you were in prison for 18 years, and now you’re out and you’ve got people like Johnny Depp and Eddie Vedder by your side, supporting your cause.DE: You know, there were people that over the years that became such good friends with us that I have no idea what we would have done without them. Johnny’s become like a brother to me. I absolutely love him dearly. Eddie too, you know. The first place I went when I got out was to Eddie’s house in Seattle. When we left Arkansas I didn’t have a single penny in my pocket; I didn’t have a suit of clothes to change into and I had nowhere to go. We went to Eddie’s house and immediately his wife takes me out and buys me all new clothes, and Eddie walks up and hands me a wallet with money in it, and I had no idea what in the hell we would have done without these guys. Eddie, Johnny, Henry Rollins, Peter [Jackson] and Fran [Walsh] — they saved my life.One of my favorite moments in the film was when Eddie Vedder was reading from your diary, and I think it was that quote about time — it was really affecting.DE: I was always afraid it would come across as a little flaky.No, not at all. It really got to me. So has Peter shown you The Hobbit yet?DE: No, but I was on the set while they were filming it for a whole three months, so it feels like I’ve seen it, because I saw them go through each scene, you know.You must have seen Gollum in person, with his motion-capture suit.DE: I didn’t see Gollum, but I did see a lot of the other guys wearing them. I’m trying to remember the guy’s name.. the guy in Spartacus, he plays this, was it a troll?An orc? The Goblin King?DE: He wasn’t the Goblin King. The Goblin King was Dame Edna. That was really weird. We went to Peter’s place out in the country one time, and there was about 30 of us: me, [Echols’ wife] Lorri [Davis], Peter and Fran, Barry Humphries, Ian McKellen, Elijah Wood. All of us are out there playing paintball, and we’re all dressed in our camouflage — wait, not paintball, laser tag — and we’re all running through the woods and shooting each other, and that was an insane day. I think Barry Humphries ended up being a casualty of friendly fire.See, what’s funny about that is Barry Humphries plays laser tag. Did he do the Dame Edna voice? “I’ve got you now, possums.”DE: [Laughs]Alright, I think I’m getting thrown out now. Thanks for hanging in there, you’ve been great.DE: Thank you so much. And thanks for helping to get the word out.West of Memphis opens theatrically in select locations this week.","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"leads, furious, Schedule, dogs, in, Oscars, Swim","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/dfsa.jpg","slug":"five-favorite-films-with-west-memphis-threes-damien-echols"},{"id":"47508844261661","title":"Five Favorite Films with Mark Duplass","content":"Five Favorite Filmsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Five Favorite Films with Mark DuplassThe star of Your Sister's Sister and Safety Not Guaranteed on his five favorite sibling movies.by Luke Goodsell | June 12, 2012 |  CommentsOne of the breakout stars of the “mumblecore” movement that evolved during the mid-2000s, Mark Duplass has gone from writing, directing and starring in no-budget independent films to successfully adapting his brand of comedy-drama for a (relatively more) mainstream audience. Duplass and his brother/collaborator Jay scored indie hits with 2010’s Cyrus and this year’s Jeff, Who Lives At Home, while as an actor he’s currently starring as a self-styled time traveler in the critical fave Safety Not Guaranteed.This week, Duplass looks to continue his fertile run with Your Sister’s Sister, Humpday director Lynne Shelton’s well-reviewed comedy which finds him caught in a love triangle with two sisters — played by Emily Blunt and Rosemary DeWitt. To mark the movie’s opening, Duplass shared his Five Favorite “sibling” Films with us — which is both fitting and revealing, considering his working dynamic with his brother and how much of their stuff revolves around the strains of family.You Can Count On Me (Kenneth Lonergan, 2000; 97% Tomatometer)“Terry, I f–ked my boss.” That line defines this relationship. She’s supposed to be the “together” one. Maybe she’s not. This movie was a huge influence on me. The inherent sadness and comedy of two siblings forced together to get their crappy lives on track. So good.Say Anything… (Cameron Crowe, 1989; 98% Tomatometer)Here you have John and Joan Cusack playing on-screen siblings. It’s a smaller relationship in the film, but the authenticity of their dynamic always stuck with me. Watch this one again just to see these two at their best.What’s Eating Gilbert Grape (Lasse Hallström, 1993; 89% Tomatometer)The way that Gilbert loves Arnie in this film is so sweet and sad to me. The guilt, the exhaustion, even the jealousy. It’s a fantastic relationship and two of our best actors arein their prime here.Punch-Drunk Love (Paul Thomas Anderson, 2002; 79% Tomatometer)Adam Sandler and his gaggle of bitter, hateful, horrible sisters provide some of the most uncomfortable on-screen comedy in cinematic history. In one scene with his sisters, P.T. Anderson justifies all of his main character’s odd behavior for the entire film.Adaptation (Spike Jonze, 2002; 91% Tomatometer)These are my favorites. Donald and Charlie Kaufman. Both played by Nicholas Cage to perfection. I could go for days on this one. But the journey from Donald’s insufferable buffoonery to where they end up is like nothing I’ve ever seen. Funny, sad, beautiful stuff.Your Sister’s Sister is in theaters this week.","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"ABC, award, comedies, female, football, animated, Hulu, razzies, Book","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/MarkDuplass.jpg","slug":"five-favorite-films-with-mark-duplass"},{"id":"47508846001440","title":"Five Favorite Films with Director-Producer Oren Peli","content":"Five Favorite Filmsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Five Favorite Films with Director-Producer Oren PeliThe man behind Paranormal Activity and this week's Chernobyl Diaries lists his all-time favorite movies.by RT Staff | May 24, 2012 |  CommentsFilmmaker Oren Peli caused something of a box-office sensation with his no-budget, found footage spook show Paranormal Activity in 2009 — the 2007-shot horror frightened more than $100 million out of American audiences’ pockets, which is not bad considering the production budget was around $15,000 (or the cost of one of Michael Bay’s home video insert shots.) Peli found further success as the producer of the movie’s two profitable sequels, along with working on last year’s Insidious and TV’s The River. This week he serves as the producer on Bradley Parker’s Chernobyl Diaries, a horror about a bunch of tourists who decide it’s a good idea to take a holiday in the former Soviet Union’s most notorious nuclear waste zone — where they discover they’re not alone. (“In Russia, tour takes you,” etc. Thanks; we’re here all week.) While promoting the film, Peli took a moment to send in his Five Favorite Films via email — and here they are.Stand By Me (Rob Reiner, 1986; 91% Tomatometer)Amazing Stephen King story, great cast and direction by Rob Reiner. Love the sense of nostalgia and friendship of the boys.The Shawshank Redemption (Frank Darabont, 1994; 90% Tomatometer)Another amazing Stephen King story. This movie is just about perfect. Love the sense of hope, revenge, and triumph.Trainspotting (Danny Boyle, 1996; 89% Tomatometer)Beautifully directed by Danny Boyle, I can watch this movie over and over again and never get tired of it.City of God (Fernando Meirelles, 2002; 90% Tomatometer)Truly a masterpiece.The Blair Witch Project (Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sánchez, 1999; 85% Tomatometer)One of the scariest movies I’ve seen, and a direct inspiration to make Paranormal Activity.Chernobyl Diaries is in theaters this week.","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"streaming","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/OrenPeli.jpg","slug":"five-favorite-films-with-directorproducer-oren-peli"},{"id":"47508846003489","title":"Five Favorite Films with Bobcat Goldthwait","content":"Five Favorite Filmsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Five Favorite Films with Bobcat GoldthwaitPlus, the comedian-turned-filmmaker on his latest, God Bless America.by Luke Goodsell | May 10, 2012 |  CommentsComedian, actor, and filmmaker Bobcat Goldthwait became a fixture on the stand-up comedy circuit in the ’80s and ’90s, developing an idiosyncratic persona that he parlayed into a string of movie roles and TV gigs. But rather than ride that schtick into the nostalgia sunset, Goldthwait turned his talents to filmmaking. His debut film, 1991’s Shakes the Clown — aka “the Citizen Kane of alcoholic clown movies” — would become something of a cult classic (Martin Scorsese’s a fan), while 2009’s World’s Greatest Dad earned strong notices for its unique brand of black comedy and one of star Robin Williams’ finest performances in years.This week, Goldthwait returns with God Bless America, a delightful valentine to popular culture in which a disgruntled office drone (Joel Murray) and his teenage sidekick (Tara Lynne Barr) go on a cross-country killing spree designed to right the wrongs of contemporary bad manners, reality TV and other social ills (if you’re texting in a theater, fear for your worthless life.)We sat down for a chat with Goldthwait recently, and the first thing he did was send his camera crew on a break with a line from Albert Brooks’ Real Life — so right away we knew he was going to be great. Read through for more of his thoughts on the film and his career, but first, here are his Five Favorite Films.Harold and Maude (Hal Ashby, 1971; 85% Tomatometer)It’s hard to boil them down. I would say, well, Harold and Maude, obviously, because it seems like something… you know, when I saw Harold and Maude, I didn’t laugh; I was a boy and I just felt like a Starbelly Sneetch finding the other Starbelly Sneetches, you know. So that movie was a biggie, and still is. I’m thinking of movies that I go back and watch, ever time I see them.Young Frankenstein (Mel Brooks, 1974; 94% Tomatometer)Young Frankenstein, you know… I think Young Frankenstein influenced me because it was a comedy but they really treated it like the James Whale Frankensteins. There’s a real sadness in that movie.They replicated the Universal horror look really faithfully.Yeah, and they used a lot of the same effects and stuff, yeah.Do you find when people do something serious and then set the comedy within it that it makes the comedy better?Yeah — and a story, you know? In a lot of comedies the story comes afterwards. They’ll cram in a “friends are the most important friends” or some bullsh-t.I find that with your stuff, like World’s Greatest Dad, they’re almost dramas — and the comedy evolves out of that.Yeah, and that’s the way I approach it. I kind of don’t even consider… I mean, I think of all of them as comedies, but I don’t concern myself with the jokes at all. It’s more about staying true to the world and the themes that we come up with.Ed Wood (Tim Burton, 1994; 91% Tomatometer)I’d say Ed Wood; the Ed Wood movie I really love a lot. I love the idea of — I think it’s a great movie — but I identify with this kook who makes movies because he has to, and works with his friends. I don’t think Ed Wood is the worst director: His movies are personal, and you can’t take your eyes off them. [Laughs.] You know what I mean? There are way worse film directors.I read where Tim Burton said something like the difference between himself and Ed Wood was that he was lucky — which is why that movie is so affectionate. It’s not a mockery.Oh no, no, not at all. It’s very kind and sweet, and warm. I love that movie.Polyester (John Waters, 1981; 88% Tomatometer)I don’t know which John Waters to pick. The go-to would be Pink Flamingos — that was another movie that was pivotal, when I discovered that — but I would pick Polyester out of his movies. I’ve got a big soft spot for John Waters, ’cause again, there’s a guy who’s doing things on his own terms, and I think people would find his topics shocking but he has a lot of kindness towards these people, these characters. I love him. I just saw him this weekend when I was in Maryland.You two should do a movie together.Well I’ll tell you, he’s been so supportive. He and Todd Solondz and myself met, and I was like, “Wow, this is a harmonic convergence. This is the Mount Rushmore of f-cked-up.” [Laughs.] My wife dubbed it the — you know how they had the Million Dollar Quartet, with Elvis and Carl Perkins and that? — well she dubbed it the Hundred Dollar Trio. [Laughs.]Sullivan’s Travels (Preston Sturges, 1941; 100% Tomatometer)I would say Sullivan’s Travels would probably round out the five. That movie is kind of what I’m always wrestling with, you know — there’s the idea of, “Do I go out and entertain people [laughs], or do I go out and say something?” I love that movie. That’s just another movie that, you know, Preston Sturges movies — they’re not really set in the real world, or most of them aren’t set in any real world, but the characters are always very realistic; and then he has these great, oddball one-dimensional characters that show up. Clearly that’s something that’s kind of influenced me, ’cause I don’t think the world that my movies take place in, it’s not a real place. I always laugh at people who go, “Well, you know, they would have been caught” in [God Bless America] and I’m like, “It’s not real, man.” I don’t wanna have a scene where Harvey Keitel is in front of this big map of the United States going, “I gotta get inside their brains. I gotta figure out where they’re gonna strike next.”[Laughs.] Tommy Lee Jones ordering a search of every outhouse, farmhouse, henhouse…[Laughs.] Yeah, Tommy Lee Jones going: “Somebody! Get a patrol car to the Kardashians! I think I’ve figured it out!”You have to suspend some disbelief there.Yeah, yeah. And I think that maybe in this movie that works for people. We do a good job of hopefully suspending it by shooting a baby within the first 10 minutes. [Laughs.][Laughs.] That was a very enjoyable moment.Well thanks, man.Next, Goldthwait talks God Bless America, avoiding nostalgia comedy, and revisiting Shakes the Clown.&nbsp;You were talking about the tension between entertaining people and having something to say. How did you approach God Bless America — which is entertaining, but moreover feels like it has something to say — with that in mind?You know, it’s funny. Last night I was really exhausted and I was sitting there looking at it — there was a screening — and it played well and people were laughing and people liked the movie, but I also know that I lost some of the people. And part of me was thinking, “Why do I do this? ” I mean, it would be so much easier to just make a comedy, you know? I would not have to rent in the Valley. [Laughs.] Why is it so important for me to connect with such a small group? You know, it’s not very lucrative. Robin Williams is one of my friends, he’s probably my best friend, and we always laugh and discuss how with his neuroses, you know, he’s looking for the world’s approval, and I’m just looking for a couple of misfits to say, “Hey, we like you.” [Laughs.] “Gabba gabba, we accept you.”[Laughs.] I like that you stuck up for him in the movie.Yeah, there’s a little shout out. ‘Cause all my friends show up in this movie. Like, Tom Kenny is a guy I’ve known since I was six years old and he’s Spongebob Squarepants; so he shows up, and we shoot and kill him. All my best friends show up — and most of them get killed. [Laughs.] I think I was gonna have him play Robin Williams. ‘Cause this movie, you know, is the only movie I’ve written that takes place in our time — as in right now — so he probably would have been backstage at American Superstar.And you’ve known Joel Murray since — well, you did One Crazy Summer together. Have you just been waiting for the right role to cast him in?No, it was more like I was watching him on Mad Men and my wife was like, “He’d be a good Frank.” And I was like, “Yeah.” I didn’t think he wanted to work together, because I tried to get him for one of my other movies, and his agent, I found out, wouldn’t give him the script, which was Sleeping Dogs Lie. His agent was like, “This is a horrible movie.”[Laughs.] That would have been a tough sell for agents to deal with.Yeah. Most of the screenplays I write have a really hard time getting to people; as a guy who makes movies, and it’s frustrating. Understandable, but it’s a little frustrating, because it’s like, even if you don’t like my movies — and my movies do have their detractors — the actors in the movies always do well. Nobody’s ever said anything bad about them. The actors don’t get bashed in the press; the actors always get good notices. So it’s like, if you’re really concerned about your actors, you know, they’re not gonna get rich or anything but they might get to go to Park City. [Laughs.]God Bless America concerns a guy who’s fed up with the degeneration of popular culture and social etiquette, but do you think there’ll be a time in, say, 20 or 30 years, when this era seems polite? Is it just a generational frustration?Yeah. [Laughs.] That’s what really worries me. You know, when Frank says “Eating rats and maggots on Survivor was shocking, and now it seems quaint.” I do wonder, Where are we gonna go? The pendulum always swings back and forth, but what I’m afraid of is that the pendulum has just been let go. [Laughs.] It’s like, we’re not getting to the end of the swing, it’s actually only starting. [Laughs.] That’s the thing that kind of terrifies me. It’s funny when you go back and watch Network, the things that he predicted are tame compared to what we really did become.&nbsp;Right. You’re talking about John Waters before, and as outré as Pink Flamingos still is, a lot of his bad taste sensibility has been assimilated into the mainstream over the years.Right, yeah. But I still find him subversive, because, truly, sincerity is the ultimate form of being subversive. [Laughs.]Talking about you doing — or not doing, as it were — comedy, do you get offers to bring out the old Bobcat persona?Oh, as a comedian, as an actor? A little bit, but I always say that I retired from acting at the same time that they stopped hiring me — so that worked out well. [Laughs.] But I do get offers, you know; I did make a decision, as a comedian, to kind of stop performing in that persona, ’cause I didn’t feel it working out anymore. And I know that cost me money, because if I was willing to go on the road as a nostalgia act I could make money, but I just couldn’t really feel good about it. I’m always polite when people want to talk to me about things they recognize me from or known me from — and I understand that, and I am polite — but I’m usually more interested in what I’ve just made, or what I’m trying to make, rather than what I did 25 years ago.I don’t know if this falls into the category of nostalgia, but Shakes the Clown is a favorite comedy of mine.Ah!A friend introduced me to it, and he got into it, I think, ’cause he read an interview where [record producer] Steve Albini was saying how much he loved it…Oh really? That’s funny. That’s really crazy. I didn’t know that [Albini] liked the movie. That’s really funny because as a comedian I toured with Nirvana, which is funny. I never remember talking to Kurt [Cobain] about Shakes — I don’t know if he ever saw it — but he knew a lot of my standup, which was great.He was a fan.Yeah. In fact, [Dave] Grohl — when I first met Kurt, he wasn’t even in the band — but Grohl, ’cause he used to live with Kurt, he was like, “I used to have to listen to that album all the time.” Which was my album. [Laughs.]Is Shakes a world you’d ever consider going back to?Oh, no. I don’t think I’d have the energy to do it. But I jokingly would always love to do, like, the idea would be an origins story of Binky and Shakes as teenagers, and do an angry teen movie with those two, you know, and how the rivalry was formed and stuff.[Laughs.]God Bless America opens in theaters this week and is available to watch through VOD.","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"Dead, zero, criterion, Avengers, high, Christmas, Film, curtis, sports, america, CBS, archives, RT","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/BobcatGoldthwait.jpg","slug":"five-favorite-films-with-bobcat-goldthwait"},{"id":"47508844255514","title":"Five Favorite Films with Bob Balaban","content":"Five Favorite Filmsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Five Favorite Films with Bob BalabanPlus, the actor, writer, director and Moonrise Kingdom narrator on working with Wes Anderson, directing kids, and his memories of Steven Spielberg's Close Encounters.by Luke Goodsell | June 27, 2012 |  CommentsDroll, erudite and extremely affable, Bob Balaban is the kind of guy you could spend hours listening to — which is probably why Wes Anderson cast him as New Penzance’s all-purpose meteorologist narrator in his latest hit, Moonrise Kingdom. Balaban’s own career as an actor, writer and director goes way back, and via many curious avenues: He made his debut in the classic Midnight Cowboy, has worked with the likes of Woody Allen, Ken Russell and Christopher Guest, and famously appeared as François Truffaut’s interpreter in Spielberg’s Close Encounters of the Third Kind. He’s also directed and produced film and TV, appeared in theater, and been the NBC executive responsible for sinking Seinfeld — on TV, anyway. With Moonrise Kingdom expanding nationally this week, sat down for a talk with Balaban about the film, his experience working with Wes Anderson, and much more. During the course of the interview, he also talked about five of his favorite films.La Ronde (Max Ophüls, 1950; 100% Tomatometer)Well I always have a hard time with this. As we get older or grow or whatever, it’s always changing, because you just see more movies, for one thing, so you change. One of my most favorite movies, I think a perennial favorite movie of mine is La Ronde. I don’t know how well acquainted you are with it. It’s one of my favorite movies. Anton Walbrook is one of the stars, who also the stars of another one of my favorite movies, The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp. He’s the guy who’s that German who has the seven-minute monologue with the moving camera that never cuts, and he breaks down during it.The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp (Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger, 1943; 95% Tomatometer)Those are two favorites of mine.Colonel Blimp really is something else, isn’t it?Yeah — and I was surprised. I didn’t think I’d love it. I saw pieces of it and I kept avoiding watching it, because it seemed so artificial and I didn’t get the acting style, but when I watched the whole movie I just thought it was the most amazing movie. I loved it. And Deborah Kerr was just great. I always liked her, but she was just fantastic in this.The Palm Beach Story / The Miracle of Morgan’s Creek (Preston Sturges, 1942/1944; 100/90% Tomatometer)I do like… I’m a big Preston Sturges fan. I like all of them, but I especially like, probably Palm Beach Story, and Miracle at Morgan’s Creek is one of my favorites. I happen to love it. I think it’s maybe one of my favorite… 20 movies, ’cause there’s so many great things.The Lives of Others (Florian Henckel-Donnersmarck, 2006; 93% Tomatometer)Another foreign film was probably The Lives of Others. I thought that was pretty great.E.T. The Extra Terrestrial (Steven Spielberg, 1982; 98% Tomatometer)I love E.T., you know. I think E.T. ‘s great. Those scenes with the kids are quite amazing.Some of the greatest direction of kids there, that’s for sure.And that’s not an accident. He’s been consistent, Steven, in his whole career doing that.Next, Balaban on working with Wes Anderson on Moonrise Kingdom, directing kids and his memories of Close Encounters of the Third Kind.&nbsp;[Balaban looks over some of the Moonrise Kingdom promotional items.]They always have good promotional things for Wes Anderson movies.Bob Balaban: It’s funny — I saved a few things from Gosford Park, ’cause as a producer we had the promotional materials. We had the strangest promotional materials. And Catch-22, which was the first movie I was in — well along with Midnight Cowboy, but we didn’t get anything on that; I mean, what would it have been? Used condoms? [Laughs] But on Catch-22 we all got this amazing silver key chain. I remember it vividly: it had the logo of the movie done in a silver disc with this most gorgeous key chain, and I had it for so long that the disc eventually fell off from the key chain.It does pay to hold on to stuff, sometimes. Well, congratulations on the film. I very much liked it.Thank you.I’m sure nobody tells you how much they didn’t like it.[Laughs] Well sometimes they do, but they don’t at a junket.Well, I’m not just saying that; I genuinely loved it. I’m a fan of Wes.I am too. And now I’m even more of a fan, because to watch him do what it is that he does to get those movies that you love so much — he is all the time exhibiting all the traits, as a director, that you’ve come to admire in his movies. His movies and Wes, they’re like one and the same. And it’s very satisfying to see that.You have an amusing role: the omniscient narrator, presiding over the story.Yeah, I guess you could say it’s like the narrator, or the stage manager in our town. I just knew that it was a tradition in Wes’s movies that he often did have a narrator, so I was very happy to occupy it — “Oh, I have a place in his vocabulary.” I was very happy to be the narrator. And I knew that it was likely that I wouldn’t get cut. [Laughs] I also knew that, like all the parts in this movie, there are no small parts in a Wes Anderson movie. I felt like I had a small but really nice, secure thing to be in the movie. I enjoyed being both the commentator and then sometimes being a character in it as well.You’re almost an instrument in the film’s orchestra.Yes. I also think that some part of the narrator — which I didn’t think of too much actively when I was doing it — but at some point I thought, “This movie is really a book.” Moonrise Kingdom is the sixth book in what Kara’s character carries around with her in her little satchel of children’s books. So I think those kinds of books have first person narrators who also appear in the story, and I think of this as a sort of literary conceit that I thought worked very nicely on the page; and when I see the movie, I think Wes made great choices about that.Yours is a distinct and recognizable screen presence. Why did you think Wes approached you for this part?Oh I have no idea. [Laughs]He must have been a fan; I mean, you’re a fan of his.I’m a fan of his. I knew him, enough to say “Hello” a couple of times but I didn’t really know him. I guess as writers and directors do. I certainly do it when I’m planning to direct something. I’m always making lists of “Who can I think of that I haven’t seen in a little bit?” or “Who somehow has some great similarity to this thing that I’m doing, but that they haven’t done it before?” I guess I came to Wes’s mind. Thank god — that’s how we get jobs.He does appear to have a very specific list, in terms of his cast.Yeah. Well I certainly hope I end up being cast in another Wes Anderson movie.He reuses the same people, so you could be in.I know. But he can’t keep expanding, otherwise the cast will be so big. But I’d find it very gratifying to work with him again.His movies, especially this one, have very rigorous formal structures. What’s it like acting under that kind of direction?Well in my case, I didn’t have that many marks to hit. [Smiles] It was, “Stand there, put your foot there on the rock, and I’ll go over here.” But, as in all life, sometimes the very things you would think would make somebody not be good at the thing that they’re doing — for instance, an obsessive attention to clothing and scenery and stuff — in Wes’s case, it has a whole different form and it takes on a whole different meaning, because he does create a world in all of his movies. They’re all different worlds, but you can tell they all come from the same creator. Most people don’t make movies that way. There are very few people who do: there’s similarities, there’s shooting style, but there’s something about Wes that is deeply ingrained in his movies, and instead of making the same movie all the time — they may feel similar, but they have different themes, very different strengths, and the characters are really very remarkably different in all of these movies; and I thought that especially in Moonrise Kingdom.One of the pleasures I find in seeing the movie — ’cause when you’re in a movie there’s one kind of pleasure, and it was very fun to be in this movie — but watching the movie, the pleasure of seeing the stuff that you don’t [initially see], that you are not being made aware of all the time, is to me one of the strongest parts of the movie. And it exists because it’s existing in such a rigorous structure. I think Moonrise Kingdom has a very, very strong emotional current and a very strong core in it about love and disappointment and youth and, I mean there’s so many fun ways to analyze this movie when you see it. Because I did, and I think most audiences have a very powerful reaction to it. At first when you see the movie you might think it’s sort of a trifle: It’s fun, it’s beautiful to look at, the characters are funny. It’s sort of a romp, you could say, and I think it’s popularity is somewhat derived from that; but on the other hand, it’s a very deep and rather profound movie, and all the more profound because it’s a bit of a wolf in sheep’s clothing, you know. It sort of dares you to get involved with it, and then you really get involved with it. I was amazed from the first time I saw the movie at how invested I was, in the children and the adults: in the adults’ rather sad but understandable lives, and the purity and just the passion of those two little, both outcast children. I was just amazed that a movie that had that formal structure could have that kind of emotional life to it.Agreed. It’s a synthesis of style and content that he does so very well.Yes. And also, I don’t think it’s a choice Wes makes. I think that he, at some point, he just made what was in his heart, and he just keeps making it over and over again. But it’s also different in that there’s enough you really do feel — I mean that’s why they call it the auteur [theory], or whatever it is — it’s because you really get to know somebody. And it’s not — there’s no easy answer to what makes it. There is a surface to a Wes Anderson movie, you could say that’s why it’s a Wes Anderson movie, but really it’s a Wes Anderson movie because he subconsciously and consciously infuses every frame of the movie — yes visually, yes emotionally, and yes in the text; he infuses it with his unique vision of life. It’s so specific. And I think that’s what we crave in all art forms; something that’s so specific that you can identify with it, because it’s so specific. It’s the general stuff that can’t identify with, because it doesn’t engage you as much as one person’s vision –which isn’t your vision, but somehow you’re able to connect with it.You’ve said almost everything I needed to say about it. I think the interview’s over.[Laughs]You’ve worked with many interesting actors and directors, and one that comes to mind I’m sure for a lot of people is François Truffaut in Close Encounters of the Third Kind.Yes, one of my favorite directors.Did Wes ask you about working with him — given what a great admirer he is of Truffaut?I don’t know that we did talk about it. But I wrote a book about the making of the movie.That’s right, yes — I mean to read it.It’s kind of — it’s fun, you know. It’s very specific, because it’s sort of my impressions. It’s a small actor’s view of what it’s like to be in a really big movie. [Laughs] So it’s sort of from the ant’s point of view, I would say. But I don’t think we talked about it. I try to guard against telling too many anecdotes because I’m not very good at them, and it’s really boring to be with people who are all, “Oh yes, and then in 1968 this happened,” you know—[Laughs] I think we’d need another few hours to through the anecdotes you have.Well not all of them are that interesting. But Close Encounters was extremely interesting and very easy and fun to write about. Also, I liked everybody so I had nothing bad to say, which I would never write about anyway. It was a really interesting experience, and I think for people who love the movie — I think it’s survived and it’s still kind of a classic — I trust it’s fun for them to see the nuts and bolts of the scenes that were caught; what it was like working with [child actor] Carey Guffey, who was so amazing, and what’s it like to have a four-year-old in a movie. In many ways there are definite similarities between [Steven] Spielberg and Wes — if only talking about their affection, respect, and ability to understand and deal with both children and child actors; ’cause they really are both fabulous at that, and an awful lot of directors cannot deal with children. You know, having a child in a movie is like — a movie’s all about precision, and getting somebody to do what you need and want, and Can they do 15 takes, and will they match what they’re doing? And the beauty of children is that, when they’re well used, they’re unpredictable, hopefully — or at least they give the impression of that. And I know watching Wes work with these two kids — granted they were 12, they weren’t four, but there was the same kind of affection, respect, and not talking down; the idea that if you treat a child like they’re equals, they respond accordingly. He was great with kids, and I think the kids were great in the movie. As I do think the kids in Steven’s movies are uniformly fantastic.It’s a very difficult kind of film to get right, isn’t it — the adolescent romance.Yes, and very Truffaut like, I think. Very French, in way.Wes talked about Small Change a bit, which is a great film.Yes.When it comes to getting great performances from kids, how much of it do you think is successful casting, and how much of it is in the directing?Well I think it’s both. It’s an instinct and an ability, ’cause kids, you know, kids don’t memorize lines too well. I directed — have we talked about this? I directed a movie called Parents—It’s funny you mention it, because it always comes up in my Netflix recommendations of “Things you may like?”[Laughs] Oh. Because you’re strange. [Laughs] I wish I could say it’s some kind of perfect, great movie. But it’s really interesting and the lead is a nine-year-old boy, Bryan Madorsky, who had never acted before — so that whole issue of casting a leading role in a movie with a child, I was confronted with it immediately. There was nobody I knew who was a famous nine-year-old actor who would be right for this part of a very mysterious, withdrawn kind of disturbed little boy. You can’t act that, exactly. And the first couple of days we saw like 75 million children, all of whom had done Wonder Bread commercials recently, so they were all cheerful — they all fit a certain mold, because child actors who work a lot, work a lot because they’re sort of a type. And I wanted the anti-type person. So at some point I said, “This may seem radical, but I don’t think we need a child who can memorize lines ore is experienced.” And this one kid came in and he sat down, like you could just tell he was fabulous and interesting. I like kids and I probably knew enough to know that you try to find what they do best, and have that be what they do in the movie. I would say to Bryan, “Just say whatever you think you should say,” so he always seemed natural. The only thing he had trouble with was one scene — [laughs] — where he had to hit his father with a baseball bat.I’m going to watch Parents and finally read your Close Encounters book..Well you have a whole assignment!Moonrise Kingdom expands nationwide in theaters this week.","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"Paquin, 21st, thriller, Video, street, bad","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/BobBalaban.jpg","slug":"five-favorite-films-with-bob-balaban"},{"id":"47508844251416","title":"Five Favorite Films with Hugo Weaving","content":"Five Favorite Filmsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Five Favorite Films with Hugo WeavingThe star of this week's acclaimed Last Ride on five of his favorite movies.by Luke Goodsell | July 6, 2012 |  CommentsBetween playing Elrond in Lord of the Rings, voicing Megatron in Transformers and — most memorably — intimidating Keanu Reeves as the sinister Agent Smith in The Matrix, Hugo Weaving has been an integral part of three of the biggest film franchises of the past decade or so. The versatile Australian actor also delivered an uncanny Werner Herzog impression as Red Skull in Marvel’s Captain America, will star in the Wachoswki’s forthcoming Cloud Atlas and, of course, is reprising his role as Rivendell’s boss elf in Peter Jackson’s The Hobbit, due at the end of the year.Yet being one of Hollywood’s busiest character actors hasn’t stopped Weaving from returning periodically to his homeland for some compelling lead roles, like that in this week’s acclaimed Last Ride — which has been hailed by no less than Roger Ebert as “the performance of a lifetime.” A tough but ultimately moving (and beautifully lensed) road movie directed by Cannes’ short film winner Glendyn Ivin, Ride has Weaving as a grizzled ex-con on the run across the Australian countryside, where he bond with his 10-tear-old son in tow. The film debuted to much praise in its native territory, and this week finds its way to select theaters in the US. We had the chance to speak with Weaving for the release, where he talked about five of his favorite movies.The Rules of the Game (Jean Renoir, 1939; 100% Tomatometer)My five favorite films would change from, you know, day to day, but if you want five of my favorite films, one would have to be The Rules of the Game, by Renoir. A fabulous upstairs-downstairs look at French society in a very particular period. It’s both unbelievably sad and tragic, and moving and funny. And a delightfully humanist film. In fact, a lot of my favorite films are like that.The Tree of Wooden Clogs (Ermanno Olmi, 1978; 100% Tomatometer)For instance, A Tree of Wooden Clogs, which would have to be one of my favorite films. A year in the life of a peasant commune in Italy — again, it’s poor souls living through a year, so you’re getting a sense of seasons and hardship and community, and a simple, very basic deprived existence. I think that’s a masterpiece, that film.Closely Watched Trains (Jiri Menzel, 1966/1944; 100% Tomatometer)Closely Watched Trains, one of my all-time favorite films, by Jiri Menzel. Funny, wry, beautiful, entertaining; and subversive, in its own quirky way. A beautiful film.If…. (Lindsay Anderson, 1968; 97% Tomatometer)A film like If….. Lindsay Anderson’s If…., which I think is a work of genius.Barry Lyndon (Stanley Kubrick, 1975; 94% Tomatometer)And Barry Lyndon. Anything by Kubrick. [Pauses] 2001… no… Barry Lyndon, yeah. If we’re talking about Australian films, probably something like Ten Canoes. That’s probably my favorite Australian film ever made, actually. I think it’s a great, great film. I’ve probably listed more than five. And then there’s 8 ½… I could go on forever. There are some great films coming to mind, like The Return, the Russian film. [Laughs] I’ll stop.Last Ride opens in select theaters this week and is available to watch now through VOD.","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"Network, Pictures, Ellie, cats, Swim, See, competition, target, news, universal, Society, italian, Comedy","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/HugoWeaving.jpg","slug":"five-favorite-films-with-hugo-weaving"},{"id":"47508846007587","title":"Five Favorite Films with John Cusack","content":"Five Favorite Filmsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Five Favorite Films with John CusackThe man synonymous with the Top Five list runs down his favorite horror films; plus, he talks about playing Edgar Allan Poe and his underworld phase.by Luke Goodsell | April 27, 2012 |  CommentsIf there’s one actor who was made for the five favorite films quiz, it’s John Cusack, the man who spent the better part of High Fidelity dispensing his own top five lists on matters of girls, relationships, and of course, records.“Weirdly, I’m not a ‘top five’ guy,” Cusack smiles when we sit down with him to ask the question, before traces of his character start to emerge. “It depends on your mood and how you’re feeling,” he explains. “You gotta give this to me as a genre. I can tell you by different genres.” Since Cusack is in town to promote The Raven — a pulpy murder thriller in which he plays the Godfather of American Goth, Edgar Allan Poe — he decided to run through his five favorite horror films. “We could do the horror genre,” he says, “you know, the scariest movies. I’ve made a couple, but I don’t know how good they are –’cause I’m in ’em.”Read on for more of our chat with Cusack, in which he talks about his attraction to playing Poe and the many sides of the writer, but first, here are his Five Favorite (Horror) Films.The Exorcist (William Friedkin, 1973; 85% Tomatometer)As far as the horror genre, I think The Exorcist is the scariest movie of all time. It’s like head and shoulders above… there’s nothing more terrifying, or deeply sinister than that. When I saw The Exorcist, at that time when I was a kid, I may have slept with the light on. I can’t remember the exact time [I saw it], but I remember being literally knocked back. You have the pure theological question about, you know, “What is the role of evil and what is the nature of evil and what is its function?” And I think in The Exorcist the point is, the reason it’s here is to try and make us give up hope, and find the courage to not give up hope. Evil wants to so demoralize you that you abandon all hope; it’s only human beings’ capacity to love and to fight back. But that’s the role of evil: To challenge, and to make you choose. And growing up as a Catholic, too, I was immersed in the theology and doctrine of the church, so that movie was a serious, serious f-cking movie.Do you go back to it ever?Yeah — I mean, not all the time. But it’s an intense thing. Did you ever see the recut version of it?That was the one I saw for the first time.I didn’t like the recut version. I didn’t like it as much. I thought there were a couple of scenes that he added in that were improvements, but I think the original is pretty damn perfect.The Shining (Stanley Kubrick, 1980; 88% Tomatometer)Well The Shining I thought a lot about, because we did Stephen King’s 1408, which was another movie set in a hotel room, and the madness of that. But I think just seeing it in theaters, you know — I think it’s when you saw it. My mom was from Boston, so we used to go to Nantucket, and it was the summer and I remember I snuck away in the afternoon to go see it, at around 4 or 6 o’clock or something, and when I came back out it was dark and I had to walk down this dark street alone. And I remember being really, I mean really scared coming out of that theater; like, I did not want to leave the street lights to walk home. The other experience I remember was I saw Apocalypse Now in the theaters and I remember coming out of that and I almost couldn’t speak. Stunned.Night of the Living Dead (George Romero, 1968; 96% Tomatometer)There’s two Romeros. Night of the Living Dead and the 1978 Dawn of the Dead. I think they’re… well, it’s obviously about racism, and class issues, and consumerism and capitalism, you know, thematically and satirically.Dawn of the Dead (George Romero, 1978; 94% Tomatometer)I just think the premise of holding up in a mall… being that prescient about the kind of gated communities, and consumerism, and mixing that with zombies in 1978 is just beyond genius. If you look at, like, John Waters doing Female Trouble in 1974, saying things about crime and beauty and the rise of paparazzi, you know, this kind of crazy Kardashian, TMZ, beauty industry — I mean, as psychotic as that film is, it’s so ahead of the curve. It’s so amazingly looking into the future. So I think those kinds of themes I responded to. And Goblin did the original soundtrack.28 Days Later… (Danny Boyle, 2002; 88% Tomatometer)28 Days Later… is pretty damn good. I like that movie. I just liked how Danny Boyle recreated it. I liked its heart, you know. I loved all the actors.Great music, too. Some Godspeed You! Black Emperor in there.Yeah. I loved the music, too.Next, Cusack on the appeal of playing Poe in The Raven and why he’s in his “underworld” phase.&nbsp;Since we’re talking about The Raven, do you have a favorite Poe movie?John Cusack: Not a Poe movie, because the [Roger Corman] movies, the ones with Vincent Price, were so kitsch; I think they kind of realized that Poe, in his day, was kind of a satiric writer — he takes the ludicrous and heightens it into the grotesque — but that was only one side of his work. He had this side of him that was pop, pulp, Saturday afternoon thrillers, you know, murders and decapitations and playing on peoples’ neuroses. He had a story where a killer ends up being an orangutan with a razor. I mean, he knew he was being a sensationalistic writer. But then he had another side, which was a master of the English language, an esoteric poet, and just a genius. He had both things. In the same way that he hated anything coarse and saw himself as refined and an aristocrat, kind of a rock star and a regal person, and then he could go into the gutter with the sailors and debauch himself. He had so many extremes. And I think [The Raven] — the conceit of the movie — takes a pop conceit of his, which is Poe becomes a character in one of his own creations. That he gets consumed by his own story, by his own imagination, I think is a very Poe-like conceit — in the pop version of that. So I think that’s what the movie is. But then when Poe deconstructs Poe, we use Poe’s words and his letters and what he wrote; so the things that are coming out of his mouth when he’s discussing his own stories, we use a lot of accurate Poe, even within the fantasy. It’s a dream within a dream thing.The movie’s set in those last days of Poe’s life in which he was unaccounted for. Do you have your own theory about where he got to?Well, certainly he didn’t have a real serial killer. This is a fantasy. I think he was on a bender and he died of alcohol poisoning. I just think the body can only take so much. He did a lot of drugs to help him sleep while he was working, you know, and that was synthetic heroin.Did you enjoy playing him?Yeah. I mean, I wouldn’t want to stay there forever — it was kind of a dark headspace — but it was pretty exhilarating, becoming a vampire for a while.How do you approach playing someone like Poe? I mean, there’s a lot known about him but there’s also a mysterious side, and as you said, there were different aspects to his character.Yeah, you know, he did go to West Point, and he was athletic from an early age and held swimming records; so people don’t know that about him. They’re like, “Oh you’re trying to turn him in to an action hero,” but it’s like, they rode horses, and he was that guy that challenged people to duels, you know. But I think people don’t also know his kind of razor-edged satiric and absurdist style. He was actually kind of funny. I don’t think he was a funny person, I think he was a super serious, thoughtful person, and a sad person, but I think his writing could be very acerbic and cutting; he could be pretty funny.&nbsp;He was a pretty complex guy.Oh my God, so many paradoxes.Was that something that appealed to you about him?Yeah, I mean as an actor you’re like, “Oh my God, thank you.”Do you see your characters within a kind of continuum, and if so did Poe fit into this?Yeah, he did in a way. Sometimes it’s what you choose but sometimes things choose you, I think. It’s like they always say, “If you want to make God laugh, tell him your plans.” [Laughs] So it’s like, you think you’re trying to do certain things, but when I had an opportunity to play Poe of course I jumped at it. I was very excited. I spent basically a year doing movies where I was going into the underground, into the underworld; so I felt I was going into my own subconscious or whatever that space is, that darkness or the underworld. So I did Poe, and then I did The Paperboy with Nicole Kidman, where I play this kind of a Devil, and then I played Robert Hansen [in The Frozen Ground], who’s literally a serial killer. So I felt like I spent kind of a whole year in the underworld, and I didn’t plan it.You’re in your underworld phase.Yeah, totally. And I mean, I’ve been there before. I’ve done that kind of thing before. 1408 was certainly into that same kind of thing, in a perhaps more poppy way, but that definitely had some of that same stuff. Stephen King, that’s definitely underworld. But this time I went for a whole three solid films.Are there any of your characters that you’d like to revisit on film?War, Inc. was sort of a follow-up to Grosse Point Blank; it was the same kind of political tone and satire — we sort of just changed the character’s name. But I think it would be fun to do a sequel, to do a character again, ’cause I feel like you get to know them, if the movie works. Obviously if the movie doesn’t work you never want to have to think about it again, but if the movie sort of works, or if some people understand what you were trying to do and get it, you know, it would be fun. I just don’t know. I’ve never been kind of a sequel guy; I don’t know why. Basically because all the people die. [Laughs] You can’t do The Grifters 2, you know, ’cause he’s dead.The Raven is in theaters this week.","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"Black","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/JohnCusack.jpg","slug":"five-favorite-films-with-john-cusack"},{"id":"47508846005538","title":"Five Favorite Films with Kathleen Turner","content":"Five Favorite Filmsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Five Favorite Films with Kathleen TurnerThe enduring Hollywood actress and star of this week's The Perfect Family ponders an eclectic selection of her favorites.by Luke Goodsell | May 2, 2012 |  CommentsKathleen Turner began her career in the theater, before a sizzling film debut in Lawrence Kasdan’s 1981 thriller Body Heat established her as one of the screen sirens of that decade. Hits ensued: Romancing the Stone, The Man with Two Brains, Prizzi’s Honor, Peggy Sue Got Married and Who Framed Roger Rabbit? numbered among her critical and commercial successes, while Turner would gravitate toward the black comedy of The War of the Roses and, later, a delectably unhinged turn as John Waters’ Serial Mom. Mixing film, TV and acclaimed stage roles since, Turner remains busy, and this week she headlines the independent comedy The Perfect Family, about a woman about to be named “Catholic of the Year” just as her household is coming apart.We spent some time recently with Turner to talk about her favorite movies — a subject that proved to be both challenging and an entertaining glance back at her career. “I just don’t think that way, in terms of comparison and listing,” Turner said, considering the topic of her Five Favorite Films. Nonetheless, we soldiered on…The Music Lovers (Ken Russell, 1970; 67% Tomatometer)One of the reasons I did Crimes of Passion was because I saw The Music Lovers, Ken Russell’s film, with Richard Chamberlain. It was, and I still think it is, one of the most extraordinary films I have ever seen. Amazing. So when Ken came to talk to me about [Crimes], you know, I was thrilled. I got a wonderful note once from Isabella Rossellini and she told me that she did Blue Velvet because she saw Crimes of Passion. I thought that was a really nice compliment, because I think she’s quite wonderful. So that’s a movie.I love Ken Russell’s sense of excess; he’s just fantastic.Yeah. We talked a couple of months before he died. He wanted to shoot his version of Alice in Wonderland, and he wanted me for the Red Queen. But then, you know — he passed away.It’s a shame, ’cause that would have been something.It is a shame. I imagine it would have been something. Ken Russell’s [Alice] would be unique. But not anymore.Shrek (Andrew Adamson, 2001; 89% Tomatometer)Anyway, what else? I love animated films. I really do. I enjoy them tremendously. I loved the film Shrek. I thought it was great. I loved the animation, I loved the humor.You’re of course synonymous with one of movies’ more famous animated characters, Jessica Rabbit.Well Jessica, that was an extraordinary experiment, that film — putting together live film with animation. It was a wonderful job. Bob Zemeckis kept me informed all the way. He kept sending me the tapes of how the work was going and how they were doing it and all this stuff, when it got to the point where they were finally drawing in Jessica’s body — not her face, but her body — so that I could start to put in all the breath and everything so that you could see the movement in the body. And then when we worked up to the face, you know; that whole process, it was fantastic.You also did the voice in Monster House…Yeah, but they cut the hell outta that. There was tons of stuff before she turned into the house, when she was the fat woman.Still, I really liked that film. Did you and Bob ever talk about doing the sequel to Who Framed Roger Rabbit? I know the rumor has been floating around for years.Oh it’s been floating around for ages. First of all, I don’t think anybody’s gonna do that. Technology — again, it was incredibly demanding and expensive, and they don’t need to do it the same way now.It’d be too easy now. The magic was in the challenge…Yeah. It was drawing 300 frames a minute, you know. I mean, my God.The Accidental Tourist (Lawrence Kasdan, 1988; 79% Tomatometer)Alright, I’ve got an animated, I’ve got The Music Lovers… there must be something in between.[Laughs] Between Ken Russell and children’s animation? The first thing that sprang to mind — and maybe ’cause you did Serial Mom with him — would have to be John Waters.[Laughs] Yes. John Waters would be that middle ground.But I don’t want to pick them for you. Was there something you loved as a kid?I never saw many movies growing up. I grew up overseas, in South America, until we moved to London when I was in high school; and then, it was mostly theater that I went to, but not film. Films honestly didn’t play a major part of my life until university, I guess; until I came back to the States — and then of course there was very little else. [Laughs] I’m sorry! It’s just not my strength here.You’ve worked with some acclaimed filmmakers: Francis Coppola, John Huston, Robert Zemeckis, Lawrence Kasdan…Well I would have to pick… even though I’m in it… I think one of my favorite films is The Accidental Tourist — because I thought Larry [Kasdan] did such an extraordinarily wonderful transcription of the book. I mean, he was incredibly faithful to Anne Tyler, and people had been trying for years to do some of her books, and she’d never allowed it. She’d never been satisfied with film scripts, and when Larry did Accidental Tourist she felt that he really did capture the essence of her book. And I think we did, too. So that’s one I truly loved.You can include your own films, it’s okay.[Laughs] It’s a really good film! I’m not sure it was ever as appreciated [as it should have been.] There we go, we’ve got three! I only need two more, huh?The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo (David Fincher, 2011; 87% Tomatometer)Uh! Come on, there must have been something!What’s something you liked recently?Oh actually, I liked The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo. I didn’t really expect to, and I really did. I thought it was really well done. I liked it much more than I thought I would. That sounds like faint praise, but my expectations were that — like most big American studio films — it would be watered down and essentially de-toothed, de-clawed, whatever.I think Fincher likes to put the teeth back in.Yeah. [Laughs] So we can put that in, as a recent one.Auntie Mame (Morton DaCosta, 1958; 92% Tomatometer)Let’s see, what else… [Long pause]You’re in a film that I’d put in my favorites.Which one?The Virgin Suicides.Ah! Well, again, Sofia [Coppola] did an amazing transcription of the book, and again, Jeffrey Eugenides had never allowed anyone to do it because he was never satisfied with the film script. Sofia did that one on spec, really — she had no guarantee.It’s a very sad performance from you.Thank you. You know, it’s a really terrifying film for me. I mean, Why? Why did these children decide that there was nothing to live for? My daughter was a teenager then, so it was very frightening for me to contemplate. [Pauses] Come on, start listing some films.Classic films?Oh — if we’re talking classic films, we’ll go with Rosalind Russell. I adore Rosalind Russell. I think I’d have to go with Auntie Mame. That’s actually a character I think I’d like to do one day. [Pauses] Phew!Sorry to put you through all that.[Laughs] I wish my brain worked that way! I wish I had lists in my head, but I don’t.You did pretty well, under pressure.Thank you!The Perfect Family is in selected theaters this week.","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"revenge, Pop, cooking, Sematary, Star, Action, color, hollywood, nature, green, Nominations, wars, to","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/KathleenTurner.jpg","slug":"five-favorite-films-with-kathleen-turner"},{"id":"47508844259612","title":"Five Favorite Films with David Cross","content":"Five Favorite Filmsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Five Favorite Films with David CrossComedian, Arrested Development actor and star of LA Film Festival premiere It's A Disaster gives us five of his movie favorites.by Luke Goodsell | June 18, 2012 |  CommentsActor, writer and comedian David Cross is perhaps best known (in certain circles, anyway) for his role on TV’s Arrested Development, the cult show that will soon be resurrected, thanks to years of dogged fan enthusiasm, for a feature film. But his credits extend well beyond the role of Tobias — Cross has featured in numerous TV and film projects, including Mr. Show, Tim and Eric, Kung Fu Panda and Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, to name but a few. He’s also the only actor to play both Allen Ginsberg (in I’m Not There) and the beat poet’s father, Louis (in the upcoming Kill Your Darlings, with Daniel Radcliffe). So now you know that.This week, Cross stars in the ensemble comedy drama It’s A Disaster, which features four couples holed up in a house as the end of the world approaches. Directed by Todd Berger, making his feature debut, the movie plays at this week’s Los Angeles Film Festival en route to a theatrical release later this year.We had a chance to speak with Cross recently, and asked him to pick his five favorite films. “These are not my five favorite movies,” he explained. “They are five of my favorite movies (of which I have hundreds).”Matewan (John Sayles, 1987; 100% Tomatometer)This movie (like, Badlands a movie that’s not on this particular list) is almost perfect. Not a wasted shot, piece of dialogue, moment, or frame. John Sayles has made some amazing movies but this is my favorite of his. A beautiful, forceful movie that tells a dozen different stories wrapped around one specific, true pivotal moment in American history. And every single actor is perfect and perfectly cast.Bicycle Thieves (Vittorio De Sica, 1948; 96% Tomatometer)Just watched this again the other night. About every five years or so I throw it on and enjoy it. Perhaps as some sort of antidote or palate cleanser for all the bombastic, inane crap that comprises 99% of the movies out there. For every Battleship and What To Expect When You’re Expecting, or by-the-numbers, manufactured twee, Indie quirkfest you end up seeing, you should watch this movie to equalize your sense of what a “good movie” really is. As simple a story as one can conceive (an honest man in post-war Rome who needs his bicycle for work, has it stolen and he sets out to get it back before the end of the day) that’s easily as compelling and truthful as any movie out there.Salò, of the 120 Days of Sodom (Pier Paolo Pasolini, 1975; 68% Tomatometer)Easily, without hesitation, the most difficult, and disturbing movie I’ve ever seen. I knew after I watched it a second time (mostly to verify the feelings it instilled in me the night before when I initially watched it) that that would be the last time I ever saw it. In a culture crammed with “shocksploitation” movies that are really pornographic in their violence and depravity but empty of any symbolism or real meaning (Human Centipede anyone?), Salo is as bleak and depressing a movie for it’s “Banality of Evil” truth that permeates every moment. There’s no escape. This is the world we’ve created for ourselves.Quadrophenia (Franc Roddam, 1979; 100% Tomatometer)Of all the great (but few and far between) movies that truly capture the confusion, misplaced energy and anger of one’s teenage years, this, to me, is the best. At least the closest to nailing what I was feeling at that age. Even though it takes place decades before I was that age and in a country that is 4,000 miles away. There isn’t a false note in the whole movie. And it’s driven by one of my favorite albums of all time, of course The Who’s, Quadrophenia, which explores all those themes and more. And Phil Daniels does a supreme job at conveying all of those missed emotions.Modern Romance (Albert Brooks, 1981; 85% Tomatometer)Hey let’s lighten it up a bit shall we? This isn’t even my favorite Albert Brooks movie (that would be the amazing and prescient Real Life) but this is the funniest. Maybe one of the funniest movies ever. I’m not going to try to give written down examples as they will lose a great deal in that process. Just please go get it and watch it. The scene where he takes the Valium and then has to deal with a couple of — f**k it, trust me, every scene is funny and smart.It’s A Disaster plays at the Los Angeles Film Festival this week.","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"screen, Amazon, Games, Paramount, 99%, of","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/DavidCross.jpg","slug":"five-favorite-films-with-david-cross"},{"id":"47508848036146","title":"Five Favorite Films with Emily Blunt","content":"Five Favorite Filmsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Five Favorite Films with Emily BluntPlus, the star of this week's Salmon Fishing in the Yemen on working with Ewan McGregor, her forthcoming comedy with Jason Segel, and reprising that Devil Wears Prada role.by Luke Goodsell | March 5, 2012 |  CommentsEmily Blunt arrived proper for most audiences as Meryl Streep’s sarcastic, binge-dieting assistant in The Devil Wears Prada — in which she stole many a scene from the Oscar legend — and since then has proved a versatile star across all kinds of genres, be they comedy, drama, sci-fi and most things in between. She’ll soon be headlining The Five-Year Engagement, Nicholas Stoller’s comedy reunion with Jason Segel (for whom she appeared in The Muppets), trading quips with Colin Firth in Arthur Newman, Golf Pro, and starring in Rian Johnson’s (Brick) much-anticipated time-travel thriller, Looper.This week, Blunt co-stars opposite Ewan McGregor in Salmon Fishing in the Yemen, director Lasse Hallström’s picturesque comedy-drama about a fisheries expert enlisted by an eccentric sheik to bring a river to the Arabian desert. We had the chance to speak with the actress recently about the movie, her friendship with McGregor, and some of her forthcoming projects. Read on for that, but first — here are her five favorite films.Jaws (Steven Spielberg, 1975; 100% Tomatometer)Jaws is my favorite film of all time. I’ve seen it about 30 times. Even though it has a ludicrous backdrop of them trying to find this Great White shark, I think it’s a film about people and relationships — and I just think the performances are fantastic. It has amazing characters and it has this very commercial, suspenseful backdrop, so I do think it’s a perfect movie.All that, and the shark didn’t even work.All that for a shark that didn’t work. And you know what — thank god it didn’t, because not seeing the shark is just… I know so many people worldwide who became victims of Steven Spielberg and will not go in the water, so it’s probably a good thing that the shark didn’t work.Were you one of those victims?Yeah. For a long time, and I’m still terrified of them. I just started diving and I really love it, and that’s helped me become friends with the sharks again — ’cause I went diving with the Grey Reef sharks and Blacktip sharks, and that was extraordinary. And I realized they’re not actually out to just tear my guts out, they’re just wanting to be left alone.Not all of them — just that one.[Laughs] Yeah, just that one enormous one.Kramer vs. Kramer (Robert Benton, 1979; 88% Tomatometer)Kramer vs. Kramer makes me weep. I love that offset of the dynamic, of the father being the main caretaker and his life being put into uproar in trying adapt and take care of this little boy. I love the perseverance of that film, and it makes me bawl my eyes out. I think that little boy is extraordinary in it; obviously he’s not a little boy any more, but he’ll always be that little boy to me.The Princess Bride (Rob Reiner, 1987; 96% Tomatometer)Princess Bride is obviously a given; everyone loves that and can quote it. [Laughs] I’ve seen that many times as a child and it swept me away every time. I loved it.I’m picturing an odd childhood with you oscillating between that and Jaws.Yeah that’s it. My dad would always come home with inappropriate movies like The Terminator and Jaws and my mum would insist on me watching The Princess Bride and all the Disney films. [Laughs]One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest (Milos Forman, 1975; 96% Tomatometer)I think it’s a timeless movie. You watch it now and it hasn’t dated one inch. I think it’s incredibly… it’s just staggering, and it’s so moving. That’s a really brilliantly directed movie.The Lives of Others (Florian Henckel-Donnersmarck, 2006; 93% Tomatometer)I just really got swept away by it. I think that final moment when he gets the book — remember that scene? I’ll never forget the expression on his face when he gets that book. You realize there’re these moments in movies that just stay with you forever; it’s wonderful. You get these imprinted moments: a line or a word, or a look, and they stay with you forever.Next, Emily Blunt on working with Ewan McGregor for Salmon Fishing in the Yemen, her collaborations with Jason Segel, and reprising her Devil Wears Prada character.&nbsp;Well, speaking of fish — you just chose Jaws to promote Salmon Fishing, right?Emily Blunt: [Laughs] Exactly. Anything to do with sea life.So did you find yourself at that point in your career where you’re thinking, “I really want to do a fishing movie”?[Laughs] No. I don’t really like eating fish, apart from sushi, and I wouldn’t count myself a very good fisherwoman, but I loved how unique the story was, and how it just seemed to step out from the crowd of generic scripts that you read. It was just so hopeful and lovely and I loved the characters — I thought they were all kind of flawed and they were all going through something, these and life transitions. So I thought it would be fun to play.Your character’s name — Harriet Chetwode-Talbot — is somehow very amusing; especially every time Ewan says it in his accent.[Laughs] Yeah. I like the way he says it in his accent as well. I really loved her name and I thought it said a lot about her as well. I knew where she came from and what she was about. It’s a very revealing name in a way.You said you felt like you and Ewan were “separated at birth.” What was it that clicked so well between you?I don’t know, I mean we just seemed to have this very accelerated friendship and we got along like a house on fire. We laughed — we laughed so much together, and so it did sort of feel like I’d known him forever. I have found that whenever I have had a chemistry with someone on screen it’s usually benefited from having a really warm rapport with them off screen. I think I was really lucky with Ewan. I mean everyone has chemistry with Ewan — it’s impossible not to have chemistry with him. He’s one of the most well-loved people in this industry. Everyone loves Ewan.Part of the chemistry must come from having a good director, and Lasse Hallström seems to do this kind of movie so effortlessly. What’s he like?He’s incredible. He’s so wonderfully odd as a person. He’s quirky in the most lovely way. He has really wacky ideas for stuff, but mainly he just creates a really lovely environment on set — it’s very atmospheric set, so you can establish chemistry, you can just work without stress and find new bits of sparkle, new bits of nuance. He creates that, so it’s very much all about the actors. He’s heaven to work with, really.Were you bringing moments to the film that weren’t on the page?Yeah, and he was very encouraging of it. He was very encouraging to keep making the moments more and more alive. It wasn’t that we needed to change the script that much, it’s just that when you get there on set, sometimes — if the scene doesn’t read as you’d imagined it — you have to find a different route to make it work. Lasse’s all about adapting and making it work; and adding. He’s a very layered director.You shot in London and the Scottish Highlands and Morocco — it wasn’t just a holiday, I hope.[Laughs] No. We were doing six day weeks in Morocco, which is quite tiring; but the environment was so fabulous. We were sitting in Bedouin tents in between takes drinking coffee, and I was like, “Oh my god, I’m in heaven.” I’ve never shot in Morocco before. The people were lovely. We shot in this city called Ouzarzate, where I think every desert scene in every movie you’re ever seen has been shot. It’s a city that has been cultivated around a movie industry. I think you recognize sets from other movies, and there are camels drifting around that have probably been in Lawrence of Arabia, you know. [Laughs]&nbsp;Ever since your early roles it’s been apparent that you have a gift for comedy. Was it always that way, or did you work at it?I’ve always really enjoyed doing it. I don’t know if it’s something I necessarily work at, but I do make a point of trying to be in comedies, and bring comedy to roles when it’s necessary. It’s definitely something I really, really enjoy — that’s for sure.Would you like to be doing more comedy?Yeah, but I did a lot of it last year. I did Five-Year Engagement, which was a really big comedy, and then the one I did with Colin Firth [Arthur Newman, Golf Pro], which was another kind of dark comedy. So I do tend to gravitate to those roles quite a lot.You’re back with Jason Segel in Five-Year Engagement, after your cameo in The Muppets — what’s it like working together?He’s awesome. He’s a friend of mine. He wrote it with me in mind — at least that’s what he told me; he’s probably told five other girls the same thing. [Laughs] But yes, it was very easy working with him because we’ve known each other a while and we’re friends. We had a trust of each other straight away, and that made it very easy to do those scenes. I think you’ll probably see that. Hopefully the friendship comes through onto the screen. He’s great fun.Did that friendship lead to you reprising your Prada character in the The Muppets?Yeah. I was actually shooting the Muppets cameo, which he had asked me to do, and then he came into my trailer and that’s when he pitched me Five-Year Engagement.Just how many “highly-strung personal assistant” roles did you get offered after The Devil Wears Prada?[Laughs] Hundreds. I still get offered highly-strung roles. [Laughs]So you’ll only do one again for the Muppets.Yeah. Because it was for Jason, you know, and it was the Muppets. You don’t say “no” to doing a cameo in The Muppets. Those guys are icons.Was Miss Piggy difficult to work with?No. Miss Piggy was… Miss Piggy was quite difficult to work with, actually.Who was worse — Piggy or Streep?Ah… I would say Piggy. She’s more abusive. More openly abusive. [Laughs] Working with Meryl’s character in Prada, she was more deathly… deathly quiet, which I think was more intimidating.You have a couple of scenes with Kristen Scott-Thomas in this — who’s very funny, too. How was she?She’s ludicrous — she’s brilliant. She’s quite intimating when you first meet her and then your realize that the best way to approach her is to take the piss out of her — she really likes that. She’s a real laugh, actually.Looking at the roles you’ve taken so far, they’re pretty diverse. Is there a method? Are you attracted to certain kinds of characters?There’s not necessarily a strategy, no. It’s more just I’ll have really a instinctive reaction to a script. I’ll say, “Oh, that script I love,” or “That character I love,” or it scares me or it challenges me or I find it funny — but it’ll be very instinctive. It’ll usually be that the movie I’ve just done is very different from the one that I’ll do next. So I do try and vary it up as much as I can. I don’t strategize movies on where I think they’ll take me, or what I think will happen to me if I do them.What was it like working with Rian Johnson on Looper?He’s phenomenal. Rian is spooky-good. I mean, I think Rian’s gonna be a huge, huge deal in the industry and I think he’s my favorite director that I’ve ever worked with. He’s made a very cool, original film.Are you a time traveler from the future in the movie?I can’t say! I can’t reveal any details. I do wield a big gun. And I live on a farm.Salmon Fishing in the Yemen opens in theaters this week.","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"of, Trophy, Marathons, Nominations, superhero, Purge, Kaling, zero, screen","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Untitled-1.jpg","slug":"five-favorite-films-with-emily-blunt"},{"id":"47508846027051","title":"Five Favorite Films with Jennifer Lawrence","content":"Five Favorite Filmsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Five Favorite Films with Jennifer LawrenceThe Hunger Games star talks about blockbusters vs. indies and adventures in free-running.by Ryan Fujitani | March 22, 2012 |  CommentsA little over two years ago, Jennifer Lawrence was a talented yet relatively unknown young actress with a handful of television roles (including the TBS sitcom The Bill Engvall Show) and a few small indie films to her credit. All of that changed when, at age 20, she turned in a powerhouse performance in Debra Granik’s bleak 2010 drama Winter’s Bone and earned a Best Actress Oscar nomination (the second youngest ever to get the nod) for it. Her star then rose rapidly the following year, as she proved equally adept in big budget blockbusters like X-Men: First Class and indie fare like Jodie Foster’s The Beaver and the acclaimed romance Like Crazy.This week, Lawrence takes the next big leap forward, starring in the film adaptation of Suzanne Collins’ sci-fi novel, The Hunger Games. All eyes will be on her as she takes on the role of Katniss Everdeen, the central figure of a wildly popular epic trilogy set in a dystopian future, but her previous success playing strong, young women should indicate the character is in good hands. RT was fortunate enough to speak with Lawrence about her career thus far, her training regimen for The Hunger Games, and whether she approaches all films, both big and small, the same way, but first, here are her Five Favorite Films:&nbsp;Midnight in Paris (Woody Allen, 2011; 93% Tomatometer)Midnight in Paris, I saw this year, and I was just blown away. I think it might be my favorite movie now. I loved it. It was funny, it was inventive, imagination and dresses and all of our favorite writers. Owen Wilson was hilarious. It was just perfection.Are you a Woody Allen fan?Yes, yeah. But I think Midnight in Paris… I know he always gets skeptical when his movies go mainstream, but I love that one.I Heart Huckabees (David O. Russell, 2004; 62% Tomatometer)And then, I love I Heart Huckabees. I think that might be my favorite comedy. And I know it’s weird, because every time I tell people that, they’re like, “Oh, I’ll have to see it.” And I say, “You know, you might not like it,” because it’s just so weird. But I loved it. I was obsessed with it when I first saw it; I watched it four times in one week.Harold and Maude (Hal Ashby, 1971; 85% Tomatometer)Harold and Maude is a classic that I love.The Big Lebowski (Joel and Ethan Coen, 1998; 80% Tomatometer)The Big Lebowski. I love anything by the Coen brothers, so having to choose one movie is hard, but I think The Big Lebowski.Old School (Todd Phillips, 2003; 60% Tomatometer)So, for #5, I can either choose The Last Picture Show, Old School, or A Woman Under the Influence. Probably Old School, with Will Ferrell, when he goes “Hi honey, do you think KFC’s still open?” [laughs]Next, Lawrence talks about her extensive training to play Katniss in The Hunger Games, as well as the difference between making blockbusters and smaller independent films.&nbsp;You aren’t what they call “classically trained” in acting; you discovered a natural talent and desire for it, and you’ve stated that you rely more on your instincts. Now, it’s been a long time since I vanquished my first rival, so what did you draw from to portray a teen killing machine so effectively?Jennifer Lawrence: Well, I’m a method actor, so I went on a killing rampage. [laughs] No, I don’t really know, because I haven’t really gone through anything that any of my characters I’ve ever played have been through. I think that’s just something that all actors have to deal with. It’s just kind of like, “Well I think this person would react kind of like this.” But you never know. Yeah, instinct is big for me; it’s mostly like when you read it, like when you read a book and you kind of imagine how the person is saying things, and what they kind of look like when they do it. You just kind of go with it.So you have a knack for empathizing with characters’ plights and their situations, getting through to what they’re feeling.Yeah, well, I don’t know if it’s a knack. It’s more like I don’t really know what I’m doing — it might just be out of sheer desperation of showing up on set and not knowing exactly what to do. [laughs]I assume you had to have some training in archery for the role.I did. I mean, I had training in every aspect. I had many weeks of archery, then free-running training, then track running, hand-to-hand combat, climbing… Just everything.Did you say free-running? As in parkour?Yeah. Yeah, I can wall jump! And one time, I had to do ten in a row, and on the tenth one, you know, you have to run as hard as you can to the wall, and I ran, jumped, and then something happened with my legs where they just went “meh” and they just stayed down, and I hit my stomach on the wall so hard and landed. All the stunt guys were like, “Oh my God, I haven’t seen somebody hit the wall that hard in so long!” I was like [breathless voice] “That’s great.”Did you do that without safety wires?Yeah, this was during training.Well, at least now you can tell people you know parkour.Yeah, now I can walk by stairways outside and say, “Yeah, I can jump that.”&nbsp;You’ve obviously proven your solid acting chops, particularly with Winter’s Bone, but now you’ve added X-Men: First Class and The Hunger Games, which are two big action blockbusters, to your resume. Did you ever picture yourself as an action star?No, never. I like it. It’s definitely exciting. They’re fun scripts to read, and they make you think, “Well, that’ll be fun to make.” And then it’s fun to watch, too. Honestly, it’s script by script. I’ve never been like, “Well, I want to do this kind of movie, this genre, or that genre.” I really loved the X-Men: First Class script; I thought it was really cool and great, I loved that it was set in the ’60s, and I really enjoyed reading it. And then, the same with The Hunger Games; I had read the books, and I was a huge fan of them — I loved them — and it was kind of by coincidence that they were both action movies.Being that X-Men had a lot more CGI effects and that sort of thing, how different was the training you had to go through for that, compared to The Hunger Games?X-Men training was very different to The Hunger Games. Hunger Games was more outside, running, running, running. X-Men was more, “I can do ten pull-ups.” I was kind of on the Hugh Jackman diet: lots of protein and a lot of pull-ups. [laughs]How would you compare working on those big films to working on something smaller, like The Beaver or Like Crazy?I mean, it’s all filmmaking. It’s just, your trailer’s different, the food is different, the amount of takes you do is different. But it’s always the same principle: you show up with your lines memorized, if that one’s not good, you do another one, and sometimes with independents you can’t do another one, and you move on.Assuming The Hunger Games does well — and let’s be realistic here: it will — are you already looking forward to doing the sequels?Oh, absolutely! I had a blast doing this.The Hunger Games opens in theaters this week.","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"Freeform, potter, Horror","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/JenniferLawrence.jpg","slug":"five-favorite-films-with-jennifer-lawrence"},{"id":"47508848048440","title":"Five Favorite Films with Roger Corman","content":"Five Favorite Filmsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Five Favorite Films with Roger CormanThe veteran independent filmmaker and undisputed king of the B-movie drops in for a chat about his career and the new documentary Exploits of a Hollywood Rebel.by Luke Goodsell | December 15, 2011 |  CommentsMovies as we know them just wouldn’t be the same without Roger Corman. Sure, filmmakers like Francis Ford Coppola, Martin Scorsese, Jonathan Demme, James Cameron and Joe Dante probably would have found their way into the game eventually, but the fact remains that they all got their start under the tutelage of Corman and his low-budget genre factory — a tireless B-picture production line that also gave early breaks to unknown young actors like Robert De Niro, Sylvester Stallone and Jack Nicholson. Perhaps more significantly, Corman was one of the pioneers of the independent movie model, cranking out scores of exploitation and genre films (and distributing foreign titles by Truffaut, Bergman, Fellini and Kurosawa) that turned profits even as they flaunted the traditional studio system. (Not to be discounted: he also directed a handful of genuinely fine movies, like the Edgar Allan Poe adaptation The Masque of the Red Death.) This week, Corman is celebrated in Alex Stapleton’s documentary Corman’s World: Exploits of a Hollywood Rebel, a career-spanning look at his work that gathers together exultant testimonials from many of his most famous pupils. We caught up with Corman earlier this week for a chat about his career and his “graduates,” his thoughts on independent film, and how the Lucas/Spielberg blockbusters spelled doom for genre pictures. First, here are Corman’s five favorite films.Battleship Potemkin (Sergei M. Eistenstein, 1925; 100% Tomatometer)Well, if I were to pick my five favorites I would probably start with Battleship Potemkin, the great Russian silent film. To me, that is the greatest film ever made. It was probably the originator of a number of cutting techniques — the “Odessa steps” sequence, with the baby carriage rolling own the steps at the same time the troops are marching down the steps, is still one of the most powerful montage sequences I’ve ever seen.Lawrence of Arabia (David Lean, 1962; 98% Tomatometer)If I went on to number two, there it becomes more difficult. I would say probably Lawrence of Arabia. I would say simply for the epic scope; the broad expanses and deserts, and then cutting in tight from these giant long shots to Lawrence and the other characters. And the power of Peter O’Toole’s performance as Lawrence.Citizen Kane (Orson Welles, 1941; 100% Tomatometer)Citizen Kane: So many people would pick that and there isn’t much I could say about it. The photography is extremely good. He was using a lot of low angles, he was using covered sets; and at that time, and still, very few art directors will put a ceiling on a set because it makes it very difficult to light, but he gave it a great feeling of realism. Also, it was a brilliant script. It’s well directed, well acted — Welles himself is brilliant as Kane — and it really stems from the script.Did you ever meet Orson Welles?Yes, I did meet Orson Welles. Orson and Peter Bogdanovich and I had dinner one night, and I met him a few other times. When I did The St. Valentine’s Massacre at Fox I wanted classical actors for Al Capone, the leader of the South Side gang, and Bugs Moran, the leader of the North Side gang. We cast Jason Robards for Bugs Moran and I wanted Orson Welles for Al Capone. The executives at the studio said they agreed with Jason, but they said, “Roger” — and I was fairly young at the time — “this is your first picture for a major studio, we have to tell you nobody can work with Orson Welles. He takes over the set and does anything he wants.” I told the story to Orson and Orson said, “[I’m] probably the most cooperative actor anybody ever saw! I don”t know what they’re talking about. I would have been great as Capone!” [laughs]On the Waterfront (Elia Kazan, 1954; 100% Tomatometer)Then each one becomes more difficult as I go along. On the Waterfront — you go straight to Marlon Brando. It was a good picture all around, a good script, and Kazan directed it brilliantly. And the shooting on location, I would assume they would have never shot in a studio — the look of the film gives a great sense of realism, that you are there on the waterfront, you’re there in cold weather, you can see the breath coming out of the actors mouths. I would say it’s probably — probably — Marlon’s best performance, although you would have to give a nod to Godfather.Avatar (James Cameron, 2009; 83% Tomatometer)You know, I would pick Jim Cameron’s picture, Avatar, as a fifth. It’s the only new picture, I think, that can be up there in that group. Jim Cameron, one of our graduates — who started making low-budget science fiction pictures for us — went and jumped ahead and here’s Avatar, the most expensive science fiction picture ever made. Jim’s a technical genius, and the fact that he single-handedly brought back 3D — which had been up there, in and out a few times; in the ’50s and then forgotten — and he used it beautifully and sensitively. So many times when a director’s working with 3D you have the shot of the arrow coming out of the screen, shooting straight at the audience, and effects like that; he deliberately stayed away from that type of effect and just showed you the 3D world. And the use of computer graphics, green screen, motion capture and so forth for the blue-skinned people on the planet — I just thought it all came together as a brilliant film, both technically, in the way he used 3D, and in the beauty of the picture itself.Speaking of your graduates using 3D — have you had a chance to see Martin Scorsese’s Hugo yet?Yes, I saw Hugo and I was very impressed with it. Again, Marty used 3D sensitively and intelligently, and once more he was restrained in the use of 3D. You had a few things coming out toward you, but primarily you became immersed in the story, and Marty filmed a great story. The story of Georges Méliès, the old French director and one of the originators of film, and the story the young boy I thought was beautifully down. I think it’s an excellent film.Next, Corman talks about some of his famous graduates, the state of independent film, and how the Spielberg-Lucas blockbusters spelled doom for his genre movies.&nbsp;You’ve fostered many future-great directors on your productions; filmmakers like Martin Scorsese and James Cameron. Did you have a sense at the time that they were going on to big things?Roger Corman: I was convinced they were both brilliant and that they would have fine careers, but I had no way of knowing the heights to which they would actually rise. I knew — either knew or believed — they would be successful. I couldn’t predict how successful.Was there anyone who you worked with that went on to surprise you?Well most of them I thought were good, but one who surprised me, and on his very first picture, was Ron Howard. Ron had played the lead in Eat My Dust, a comedy car chase film, and when we did the sequel — because the first one was so successful, we did Grand Theft Auto — he played the lead and he directed. I was a little bit apprehensive about his ability to both act and direct in the same film — and he just showed right there that he could do it. Grand Theft Auto became sort of a B-picture classic, and it showed right there what a fine director Ron was.He would have been quite young at the time, too.Yes. I knew he had gone to the SC film school for a while but he didn’t graduate because he was working so much as an actor; but I knew he had something of a background. So that reassured me.Let’s talk a bit about Corman’s World. Why has it taken so long for someone to make this documentary about you? It feels like there should have been many by now.[Laughs] There was a documentary made in the late 1970s [Roger Corman: Hollywood’s Wild Rebel, 1978], which I thought was a well-made documentary, but I guess nobody thought of doing it again until [director] Alex [Stapleton] came up with the idea. She asked me, and I talked with her a little bit; she’s very intelligent and very sensitive, and she understood a great deal of what I was doing. I was just impressed with her and I said, “Fine, let’s go ahead.” I’m a little bit surprised at the number of people she got to be interviewed for it; it became a bigger picture than I thought.It must be nice to have all these big stars and filmmakers come out and say, “We got our start with Roger Corman.”[Laughs] I was a little surprised that they were all there, and a number of them showed a certain amount of emotion — and I felt a reciprocal emotion. I thought, there we were — we were all young at one time — and here we are; we’re still workingJack Nicholson quips that — by mistake — you occasionally happened to make a good movie —[Laughs]Do you have a favorite?It varies from time to time. For today — of the pictures I produced and directed — maybe The Intruder, which was a picture I did with a new young actor, Bill Shatner, about racial integration, in 1960. And then one of the Poe pictures — maybe Masque of the Red Death. I was working in England and I had greater access to facilities for the construction of the sets. We had the best look of any of the Poe films on Masque.Nicolas Roeg’s photography on that film is incredible.Yes. He was a brilliant young cameraman. I believe he may have won the English equivalent of the Academy Award for best cinematography, which was surprising because it was a very low-budget picture.You haven’t directed since the early ’70s. Did you ever consider going back to it?Well, I had directed so many films that I just decided to take a year off in 1970, and then come back after the traditional sabbatical, but during that time I got bored and I started my own production company, New World. I got so involved in producing — we were making 10, 12 films a year — that I just never got back to directing.&nbsp;As one of the most successful independent producers outside of Hollywood, what’s your opinion of the industry at present? Is it a good time to make independent films?No. These are not good times for independent films. When I first started, and up until around the mid-’90s, every theatrical film I made got a full theatrical release. Starting in the mid-’90s and up through the last 15 years or so, the trend has been growing in which these big-budget tent-pole films, and the normal major studio films, dominate the market to the point where it’s very difficult for medium-budget or low-budget independent films to get a full theatrical release. Every now and then one does break through, but as a generality they do not — and that has taken away part of the pleasure and the satisfaction of making films; but also simply the commercial potential.Without the theatrical distribution we have to depend on DVD, VOD, cable, foreign sales and so forth, and one of the key components there is DVD — and that is slipping. It isn’t slipping as much as some people think, but it is definitely dropping a little bit.Over the past few decades we’ve seen “cult” film sensibilities gradually assimilated into mainstream product. What was it like watching that happen, as someone whose stock in trade was genre and exploitation movies?I think it started with Jaws. When Jaws came out Vincent Canby, the lead critic at The New York Times, said, “What is Jaws but a big-budget Roger Corman film?” He was half-right: it was to a certain extent a big-budget Roger Corman film, but it was also better. The fact that this bigger and better film had come out, striking right into the heart of the type of film that I and my compatriots were making, started the beginning of the just-slight slippage for us, and difficulty for us at the box-office. When Star Wars came out, I felt the same thing. I felt these two pictures are changing the course of Hollywood, and the ones that are going to be hurt are my compatriots and me.Were there not more low-budget genre opportunities as a result, or did they make it harder?They made it harder, right from the beginning. Particularly in science fiction films: we had very little money to do special effects and the giant special effects — to a certain extent in Jaws but then to a great extent in Star Wars — those special effects were so spectacular that there was no way that we could compete. It wasn’t just that Star Wars had great special effects — it was well written, well directed, well acted; it was just a good all-round picture — but the special effects were so phenomenal. We tried to compete. I raised my budgets a little bit to try and get special effects, which I did, and it enabled us to maintain our presence theatrically for a certain length of time; but we had been damaged.There’s still a healthy legacy from what you achieved, in the films of people like Eli Roth and Quentin Tarantino — to pick just a couple of random examples.Yes. I know Eli and Quentin and we’ve talked about it, and if there is any second or third generation they are the leaders of it — because they’re taking some of the themes and ideas we had, and they’ve got more money to spend so they’re making them bigger. Not bigger to the extent of Avatar or Star Wars or something like that, but big enough so that they can get a very good film — and they’re both extremely talented filmmakers.Finally, you received an honorary Oscar not too long ago. How did that feel, to be venerated by the Hollywood establishment?I don’t know if I would use the word “venerated” [laughs], but anyway — I would say “recognized” — I knew I was up for it , because the Lifetime Achievement Awards are not voted on and announced to peoples’ surprise on the show, they’re voted in advance by the board of governors of the Academy. They tell you that you’re going to get it. I knew I was being considered, and I said, “I have no chance. I make low-budget pictures — they’re not going to give an Academy Award to someone who makes low-budget pictures.” And I was truly surprised — I was gratified. I was pleased.It was thoroughly well-deserved.Thank you.Corman’s World: Exploits of a Hollywood Rebel opens in select theaters this week.","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"Turner, King, Western, Masterpiece, Avengers, Oscars, DC, series, crime, Studios, Carpet, Television","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/cxvv.jpg","slug":"five-favorite-films-with-roger-corman"},{"id":"47508851051859","title":"Five Favorite Films with Stuntman Vic Armstrong","content":"Five Favorite Filmsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Five Favorite Films with Stuntman Vic ArmstrongPlus, the prolific stuntman and action director on filming The Amazing Spider-Man and his career working with James Bond, Indiana Jones, Superman and more.by Luke Goodsell | May 19, 2011 |  CommentsHis name may not be instantly familiar, but his work most certainly is: over a prolific career, Vic Armstrong has been a stunt man, stunt coordinator and second unit director on some of the biggest and best-loved action movies of the past four decades — a list of credits far too long to even consider including here. He’s stunt-doubled for successive James Bonds, from Sean Connery to Pierce Brosnan, worn the cape and tights on Richard Donner’s Superman, and famously done stunt work for Harrison Ford on, among many of the actor’s other roles, the original three Indiana Jones films.Then there’s his work with Arnold Schwarzenegger, Tom Cruise, Sylvester Stallone and Angelina Jolie, to name a handful, or — our personal favorite — his listed credit as “Unicorn Master” on Ridley Scott’s Legend. How does one get to be a Unicorn Master, anyway?Armstrong’s robust career as a second unit action director has also seen him shoot sequences for the likes of James Cameron, Paul Verhoeven, Steven Spielberg and Martin Scorsese, while he recently completed work on Marvel’s Thor and forthcoming The Amazing Spider-Man.This week, he releases his autobiography entitled — and with a fair claim to the crown — The True Adventures of the World’s Greatest Stuntman, which chronicles his career from riding horses for Gregory Peck through his role today as one of the industry’s most sought-after action coordinators.Armstrong called in for a chat with RT, having just wrapped shooting on Spider-Man, to talk stunts on the new Marvel web-slinger, some career highlights and, as ever, five of his favorite movies. (And hey, if he wants to pick movies he’s worked on — who are we to say no?)&nbsp;Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981, 94% Tomatometer)Raiders would have to be one of them. I just think the ride, the whole thing, is just fabulous entertainment and escapism — and it felt real, you know.Lawrence of Arabia (1962, 98% Tomatometer)Lawrence of Arabia, purely for stylistic reasons. For storytelling — and visually telling a story — it’s fantastic.True Lies (1994, 69% Tomatometer)True Lies, because it’s a great, great action film with the right amount of action and the right amount of storytelling.The Terminator (1984, 100% Tomatometer)I gotta go for one of the Terminators as well — I don’t know which one. [laughs] Probably one, because the first time I saw it… one is always more difficult than the second one, I think. I saw that in Rome after Arnie brought it over when I was doing Red Sonja. We were gonna go out to Rome one night and I said, “I can’t, I’m working, I’ve got a five-o’clock-in-the-morning start,” and he said, “Well, take this — go up to your room and watch this video.” And I watched it — and it was a rough cut of it — and I went, “Oh my god, it’s the greatest film I’ve ever seen.”Tomorrow Never Dies (1997, 55% Tomatometer)And then I’d say Tomorrow Never Dies, because I think you get a real bang for your buck in that — and I enjoyed making it. It was just a nice, big Bond, going back to the old style. It just kicks arse, and you believe he’s in there getting his arse kicked as well.Next, Armstrong talks about filming action on The Amazing Spider-Man and Thor, and takes us through some of the highlights of his impressive career — including his stunt work on the original Indiana Jones films.&nbsp;RT: You’re filming the action stuff on The Amazing Spider-Man at the moment — how’s it all going?Vic Armstrong: Great; we just wrapped some shooting in New York. Did you see him flying? There were some amazing pictures of him flying.I did, yeah. Everyone seems to be impressed that you’re doing this old school, with wires and practical stunt work.It’s amazing how it’s gone full circle. Whenever you get offered a film now it’s like, “We wanna try and do as much of it for real as we can.” And one of the things we always discussed on Spider-Man was that we wanna get away from the CGI Spidey flying through the air — we wanna see it for real, and try to do it as much as we can for real. [Marvel producer] Avi Arad said the other day, “Vic, that’s exactly what you guys did.” There’s a certain movement when you see it; subconsciously you realize it’s real, you know.Did you look at the other Spider-Man movies for a sense of motion, or is this a whole new thing?We didn’t look at the other movies, really, because when you think about it, they would have had to look at what we were doing, or the type of work that we were doing on other things, in the old days — probably trapezes and things like that. We based ours on, not a trapeze, but literally vine-swinging, if you like — going back to [Tarzan star] Johnny Weissmuller and that type of action. You work logically: how would you “web” yourself down the street? You’d go one direction and then you’d go another way and you’d use that momentum to come back in another direction. It’s a bit like skiing.You also did second unit on Thor prior to that, which is doing rather well.It’s done fantastically. I was really pleased, actually, because we put a lot of effort into it and, again, we did as much as we could for real — knowing that you’re going into a surreal environment, everything that we can put into that that’s real, we did. Do you remember a picture called Starship Troopers, with all the bugs? Huge bug movie, but we did everything we could to interact the terrain, the people, the location, the studio — everything to interact with those bugs, you know. It was the same with Thor: we wanted to put as much reality into it as we could. And we put as much realism as we can into the action by using the actor, as well. Chris [Hemsworth] was fantastic: he trained up and worked with us; it was just like having another stuntman.Did Andrew Garfield do any of his own stunts on Spider-Man?Yep, he trained as well, down at this big warehouse we had down in Culver City, where every piece of the action we shot was all mocked up. It was quite funny if you’d seen it: lots of cardboard boxes and platforms simulating buildings or fire escapes or a bridge. Andrew would be there and he’s one of this new breed of actors that wants to be involved in every aspect of their character’s being; so he’s down there with the stunt guys and they would train him up to whatever standard we could get him to. He was very closely involved, and we’d put him in wherever the chance was. He was putting his thumbprint on it, as it were.&nbsp;Your film credits read like a list of the biggest action movies of the past 40 years; I don’t know where we’d begin talking. I understand you got into the business because your dad owned racehorses?Yep. I think my earliest recollection was in the ’50s, of a very famous English actor called Richard Todd — he kept racehorses with my father. So when I was seven, eight, nine years old I’d watch this guy with a big open Bentley and women in furs, and I would talk to him, in awe, and he’d tell me what films he’d been doing and I’d go off and watch them. So that was my interest on movies. And then I’d come home and get on my pony and gallop off playing Cowboys and Indians on my own, and falling off my pony — so I guess that was my introduction into it.Were you aware that there were stunt people that did this stuff?No! [laughs] I was Richard Todd when I was doing it. They never even said they had other people to do it. [laughs]So, your first paying stunt job doubling for Gregory Peck on Arabesque — how’d you get that?I had a great horse that could jump anything, and a stuntman called Jimmy Lodge would come and exercise the horses with us. He was the stunt coordinator on Arabesque. One day he said to me, “Look, can I rent your horse off you, because the ones we have on the set are useless.” I rented him the horse and he called next day saying, “We need another good riding double to jump these jumps as well.” And off we went. I thought, “Wow — 20 pounds a day.” That was a week’s wages. I thought it would work very well with my horse racing career. Everyone said don’t rely on this for a living, it’s very spasmodic. If I was a jockey, I probably would have been retired now for 35 years. [laughs] I’d be shoveling sh** now.And a year later you’re on You Only Live Twice — that must have been something for a young guy.Oh, I was in awe. I went out to Pinewood Studios, this great cavernous place, and inside there was the inside of a volcano — with rockets standing up and a roof for a helicopter to fly in and a monorail going round and round. I’d never seen a set before like it. The guy who would become my father-in-law, [stunt coordinator] George Leech, said, “We need people to slide down a rope four or five hundred feet,” and I said “Yeah, I can do that” — thinking, “There’s no way anyone can do that.” Again, I was in the right place at the right time of my career.&nbsp;What was your favorite 007 stunt, of all the many films you did?I think on the Bonds, directorially was when I had more fun — when I was starting to do it with Pierce. The boat chase, and the car chase where the BMW was remote-controlled; they were cool chases and fairly original. How do you make a car chase original? How do you make a boat chase original? And they both came out pretty original. To me, the most important thing is to have exciting and original chases, thinking that you’re not ripping anybody off. And then on On Her Majesty’s Secret Service, sliding and hanging off a cliff at the end of this big old ski chase; and then there was the fight with Yaphet Kotto in the shark pen, on Live and Let Die.Then there’s Superman…That was tremendous, Superman. We’d just finished A Bridge Too Far, another huge, huge movie. I ended up doubling Chris [Reeve], not knowing it was going to be such an iconic film. It was amazing, working with Dick Donner, a guy with such fantastic vision.Did you get to keep the outfit?I have, funny enough, Warner Brothers gave me a life-long loan on them: the cape, the tights, the costume. I’ve got a cinema in my house in England and I’ve got them hanging in there. I’m very proud of them.&nbsp;Many fans are familiar with you from your work on the original Indiana Jones movies. How did you meet Steven Spielberg and Harrison Ford and get involved with that crew?When they started Raiders, Wendy, my wife, was on it — she was doubling Karen Allen — and I was in Mexico on Green Ice, with Ryan O’Neal. David Tomlin, the first assistant director, was a good friend of mine, and he said [to Spielberg], “You need to get Vic Armstrong out here, he’s a great double for Harrison.” He tried to get me and I was busy, so they shot in England and then went out to Tunisia, and had been there a week, I think, and I finished up on my film and flew out to meet them. I got there and I was just kind of standing around on the set watching. We said, “We’re not doing anything, let’s slope off and get a quick lunch before the mob get here.” So we started walking away and I heard this person calling, “Harrison! Harrison!” Then somebody grabbed me and spun me around, and it was Steven — and he went, “Oh, you’re not Harrison. What are you doing here?” I said I was a stuntman and he went, “David, come here, this guy says he’s a stuntman, he looks just like Harrison.” David said, “Yeah this is the guy I’ve been telling you about, Steven.” So that was it — straight into the deep end.The cover of your book is a shot of you, as Harrison, on the rope bridge from Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom. What was that like to perform?That was fantastic. That was an amazing construction: we had a company put up that great big bridge with cables wrapped in rope, and then we blew it up for real. It was across this ravine which was two or three hundred feet deep and the water was only 18 inches deep, so you couldn’t have anyone come off it. And then we had the real rope bridge hanging on the side of the ravine, and I did the fight with Mola Ram and then we built another bridge back at Elstree and did some more stuff with people falling off that.&nbsp;Of all the actors you’ve worked with, who would you say was the most game in the stunt work?That’s gotta be Harrison, Arnie, Tom Cruise or Chris Hemsworth for Thor.What was it about Harrison?Just everything, yeah — there’s not a stunt he didn’t do on [the Indiana Jones movies] that he wasn’t in, in some way or form. I mean, I did the jump on to the tank [in Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade], but that was silly — you wouldn’t want him to do that. But every little thing — even when he was off on Temple of Doom with a bad back, when he came back the first thing we did was go straight into the fight on the rock-crushing conveyor-belt. We’d shot it with me and then we just went straight into it with him and put him into it. There’s nothing he wouldn’t go for, if you say, “Yeah, this is good and this is okay, you’re not risking too much.” Obviously we don’t want to risk them, because it’s our livelihood, you know — we don’t want them to get hurt, because we wanna keep working. [laughs]&nbsp;You’ve long been a busy second unit action director — was that a natural extension of being a stunt man?It’s a pure progression from a stunt man, to a stunt coordinator who thinks up the stunts, to the action unit director who works out how you’re going to shoot it. The thing I like about it is the creativity of being the director. You bring everything together: you pick the people, you work out the stunts, you work out the safety, then you get the great thrill of actually shooting them.I was surprised to discover you shot the opening sequence of Terminator 2.Yeah. I was supposed to do the whole movie [as second unit director] at one time but I was busy. Anyway, I got off what I was doing and they’d finished [Terminator 2] and said, “We need this opening sequence.” I was thrilled I got to work on it at all, you know, because I love Arnie and I love Cameron’s work. I was very honored to get on to it, I must say.Has CG changed the way you coordinate second unit action sequences?I work very, very closely with them [CG artists], and I look at it as your “Get out of jail free” card. When you really need help, that’s what you use it for. It’s like morphine: morphine is a wonderful drug if you really need it, but abuse it and it’s deadly, it’s a killer — it’s the same with CG. CG can kill a sequence. We’ve seen as many films ruined by CG as we have made good by it. But I think it’s only through misuse, you know. It’s a fantastic thing; it’s all in the use. It’s dreadfully abused at times, but it’s all through lack of knowledge of how to do it properly.Vic Armstrong’s book, The True Adventures of the World’s Greatest Stuntman, is available now.Spider-Man image via Splash Online.

Though for some his name is synonymous with the camp excesses of Batman Forever and Batman and Robin, the self-described “street kid from New York” boasts a much deeper and more varied filmography that includes cult gems, blockbuster thrillers, and tense, micro genre pieces.As a young production designer, he worked on vintage Woody Allen movies like Sleeper and Interiors before penning a series of urban pictures — Car Wash, Sparkle, and The Wiz — that bottled something of a minor cult zeitgeist. Schumacher made his debut behind the lens directing Lily Tomlin in The Incredible Shrinking Woman, and as the ’80s wore on, he was responsible for the seminal “brat pack” films St. Elmo’s Fire and Flatliners, while in between he would helm 1987’s stone-cold classic The Lost Boys — back when teen vampires were original, funny, and menacing. After unleashing an unforgettably mad-as-hell Michael Douglas on Los Angeles in Falling Down, Schumacher spent the ’90s alternating between high-profile adaptations like A Time To Kill and the candy-colored second-phase of Warner Bros.’ Batman franchise, where he was called upon, as he recounts, to render the dark knight more accessible (and, by his own admission, to became a salesman for a toy line).Schumacher’s last decade has mostly seen him scaling back his projects, with the likes of Phone Booth, Tigerland, and Veronica Guerin realigning the filmmaker with his preferred mode of lower budget, darker movies on the fringes. With his latest, the heightened home invasion thriller Trespass, starring Nicolas Cage and Nicole Kidman, in theatrical release this week, we spoke candidly with Schumacher about his career. Read on to hear his thoughts on Batman — including how he wanted to direct The Dark Knight and almost cast Nicolas Cage as the Scarecrow — his admiration for Christopher Nolan’s films, and his preference for smaller, darker movies. But first, after much agonizing, he laid down his all-time Five Favorite Films.War and Peace (Voyna i Mir) (1968)  100%I’d have to say number one is the Russian War and Peace, which is eight hours long [laughs] and is, I think, the greatest film ever made. Just in scope, and size, and the genius of Sergei Bondarchuk, and the majesty of it. It took 10 years to make, and everyone in it ages the 10 years [they do] in the book. So there are no other actors playing the other people; the children all grow 10 years, and so do the older people. That’s pretty amazing in itself. And there was no CGI, so when you see the Battle of 1812 of Borodino, it seems like there are just 50,000 soldiers on horseback. It was made by the Russian government, which is why they had access to everything and so much money. I would have to say that was my number one.Double Indemnity (1944)  97%Number two… I would usually say Lawrence of Arabia but I’m sure everyone says Lawrence of Arabia — and it is one of the greatest movies ever made — but I was trying to think of others, and I would have to say a Billy Wilder one. I would say Double Indemnity, only because it’s never been matched. That plot has been copied, you know, a million times, but that was the first. And his dialogue is great. Billy Wilder’s one of my favorite directors. I would like to pick five of his movies, but I’ll say Double Indemnity because no one’s ever matched it. Well, no one’s ever matched Sunset Boulevard, either.You worked as a production designer on a late film with Gloria Swanson. Did you ever meet her?Yes. She was… she was odd. I’d read about how in the ’20s she had started a macrobiotic diet and was a great believer in Zen and seemed to be very ahead of her time, so I assumed I would be working with a highly enlightened human being. [Laughs] And I’m not saying she was unpleasant, but she was far from enlightened, and very critical of everything and everybody. But that’s okay — she was Gloria Swanson. [Laughs] Legends can act like legends.The Cook, the Thief, His Wife &amp; Her Lover (1989)  85%The Cook, the Thief, His Wife &amp; Her Lover is truly one of my favorite movies of all time. I think that it is, you know, Peter Greenaway’s genius, and it has my favorite actress in the world, Helen Mirren. It also has Michael Gambon and Tim Roth — I mean, we could go on. The visuals are magnificent. I think it is the consummate piece about the greed of the ’80s. It’s pure theater and it’s just a visual masterpiece.Blade Runner (1982)  90%Speaking of that, we must go to Blade Runner — true visual genius, and also in a class never matched. I saw it the first show, the first day, with a bunch of my friends. I can remember that because it was at the Cinerama dome in Hollywood, and it was on that huge screen with that incredible sound system. I still remember that great Vangelis music. But that opening — it’s embedded in my mind, that opening, with that scape of the city and its almost Mayan-like temple formation and those fires out of nowhere shooting up. Plus, Sean Young — that interview [with Harrison Ford’s Deckard] is unbelievable. I got a lovely letter from her last year. I worked with her on Cousins. Amazingly, amazingly beautiful. And of course it has the great Harrison Ford, and Edward James Olmos, and we could just go on and on with that movie. Daryl Hannah is great in it. And the doll guy, William Sanderson, who I got to work with on The Client — he played one of Tommy Lee Jones’ posse. One of the great things about my job is that I’ve been able to cast, sometimes, my favorite people.Apocalypse Now (1979)  98%Apocalypse Now. I would ordinarily say The Conversation, because it was so ahead of its time, but Apocalypse Now — another masterpiece. Also, a lot of these movies would never be made today. But — I’m leaving out Scorsese, I’m leaving out David Fincher; you know, I’m leaving out some of the great Europeans. I’m leaving out 100, or a thousand&nbsp;movies that we could talk about. I’ve been a fan of Chris Nolan’s since I saw his black-and-white film&nbsp;Following. I saw that movie in Paris years and years ago and I thought, “We’re gonna hear from this guy; this is an amazing talent.” I’m glad people really recognized it early enough to support him. There are so many other movies we could talk about. There are at least five David Leans. There are at least five Fellinis. Five Viscontis. John Ford. John Huston. Minelli. And Kubrick! I didn’t say Kubrick! I should be thrown out of film for that. It’s really hard. I don’t know how you do it.Luke Goodsell for Rotten Tomatoes: You mentioned Christopher Nolan. What did you think of his Batman films — were you impressed?Joel Schumacher: Yes. You know, I was the person who was hired to revamp the franchise because of Batman Returns — [Warner Bros.] had a lot of problems with it being too dark, and kids being too scared; they saw it as a disappointment. So we did a younger, sexier, maybe more user-friendly Batman [Forever] which obviously connected, because it was such a hit — and then, I know I disappointed a lot of people with Batman and Robin. But I did my job — I sold a lot of toys. I’d always begged to do The Dark Knight [at the time]. If you look at most of my movies you can understand why I’d wanna do The Dark Knight — my other movies always have the tendency to go toward the dark. But there were a lot of issues going on. We had to get a lot of people into theaters, which we accomplished, and we did it the best we could. And George Clooney always takes blame, which I hate — it’s all me, all the time; it’s my fault. [Laughs] It sold a lot of toys. That was my job. No excuses. Anyway, I love what Christopher Nolan’s done, especially — unfortunately — with Heath’s [Ledger’s] last performance [in The Dark Knight]; although I guess he was doing Terry’s [Gilliam’s] movie when he died. That performance alone in that movie is amazing. I can’t wait to see the next one. I think that Tim’s [Burton’s] movies and my movies and Christopher’s movies are so different that I can appreciate them all, as a Batman fan — which I have been since I was a kid.RT: Is it true that you wanted Nicolas Cage to play the Scarecrow if you had another shot at Batman?Schumacher: Yeah. We were preparing. In between the Batmans I did the two [John] Grishams, The Client and A Time To Kill, and I promised Warners that I would do [Grisham’s] Runaway Jury and a fifth Batman. And I was gonna do the Scarecrow. I had lunch with Nic Cage on the set of Face/Off and asked him to play that part, but — on the press tour for Batman and Robin — I was opening toy stores. And that was fun — it was nice to be the one who was hitting balls out of the park and making blockbusters, because I never was that guy — and then it wasn’t fun, because I’d started with very small movies and had done very small movies, and still do. So I actually left Warner Bros., which was one of the hardest things I’ve ever done, because they’d been wonderful to me; but I just didn’t feel Runaway Jury. I just couldn’t do it, because there was no passion for it. And then I did 8MM, which is exactly my kind of material, and also, it’s as far from a summer feel-good movie as anything. That was a big turning point. Deciding not to worry about whether “We’re No. 1” and whether or not I’m making more money every year and all that stuff. I’m a street kid from New York — it was time to get back on the subway.RT:&nbsp;Do you ever have a desire to return to big films?Schumacher:&nbsp;Well Phantom [of the Opera] was huge. I think after Phone Booth and Tigerland and Veronica Guerin, you know — they were getting smaller and smaller. [Laughs]. I’m proud of all those movies, but when we got down to Phone Booth, I thought, “What’s next? Are you going to make a movie called Sink, and have everyone standing around the sink?” [Laughs]RT:&nbsp;I think Mike Leigh made that one.Schumacher:&nbsp;Right. [Laughs] And Andrew Lloyd Webber had been trying to get me to do Phantom since he saw The Lost Boys in Europe, which was in ’88. So that was a spectacle. I’d always felt that Tigerland and Phone Booth and 8MM were like “dirt under the fingernail” movies, you know what I mean, and that Phantom was gonna be as far from that as you could possibly get. But it also had a very dark hero. Once again, we plunge into the darkness. It was fun to do. I’d never done a musical before. And then it was back to basics again. In the world today, as everyone knows, in the movie business you’re either making expensive franchises or you’re doing tiny movies that may not even see the light of day. For instance, [Schumacher’s last film] Twelve sold right away at Sundance but the people who bought it had no money to market it. DVD got it a following. And that was true of Tigerland, because Rupert Murdoch didn’t want it released because he felt that it was anti-war and anti-American, which it was certainly not.RT:&nbsp;Trespass is such a small film relative to the fame of its stars. How was it reconnecting with Nicolas and Nicole? Had they changed as performers — and what was it like working in such a confined space?Schumacher:&nbsp;Well, we all had grown, and certainly the world has seen Nicole and Nic start as very, very young actors. Nic was the crazy young guy, and Nicole was the beautiful girl who was married to Tom Cruise, and I think they’ve both proven to the world what their talents really are — and worked very hard at it, too. We’ve stayed friends for years. There are things that they always were that they still are. They are never late. [Laughs] And when I say they are never late, I don’t mean ever. And they are the most professional actors. Nicole takes 25 minutes in hair and make-up. The guys don’t take 25 minutes — they take an hour. They help the other actors, and when you’re dealing with filming in such a small space, everybody is dependent on each other. Sometimes there are seven people talking at once in a room, and four cameras moving around them constantly. It’s a dance. And it gets a little rough.RT:&nbsp;Did Nicolas originally want to play the villain in the film?Schumacher:&nbsp;I wanted him to be the hero. He decided he wanted to play the bad guy, so we investigated that. I said to him, “Everybody knows you can play this bad guy, that you can tear up the screen and you’ll do something unique and original — but I want you to play the hero.” In 8MM, what we worked on together is that he’s a relatively average man who then changes and tragically becomes someone he never thought he would be, and I wanted Nic to play a husband and a father and then also become someone he never thought he would be. Nic got so torn he quit. But he came back after two days and decided he had always wanted to play the father. [Laughs]RT:&nbsp;Nicolas recently described his acting style as “nouveau shamanic.” What do you think he meant?Schumacher:&nbsp;Well, Nic is totally captivated by magic — by voodoo, by all of the magical arts, if you will, and superstitions. He loves all of that. I’m sure you can imagine — Nic doesn’t think like anyone else; he thinks like Nic Cage. There’s not necessarily a connected, plotting logic to it — there’s magic to it. He’s an artist. They’re very different styles. Nicole is perfection beyond belief and has worked so hard of every single nuance and second of her performance, while Nic lets it fly — he lets it really fly and sees where it goes. I think they worked off each other really well. Not that Nicole isn’t spontaneous — in a movie like Trespass, everyone’s spontaneous all the time.Trespass is in limited release this week.#1Trespass (2011) 11%#1Adjusted Score: 12.723% Critics Consensus: Another claustrophobic thriller that Joel Schumacher can churn out in his sleep, Trespass is nasty and aggressive, more unpleasant than entertaining.Synopsis: In a private, wealthy community, priority is placed on security and no exception is made for the Miller family's estate....

This week, Freeman lends his particular vocal stylings to the IMAX documentary Born To Be Wild, a tale of two species of baby orphans — orangutans and elephants — fostered in the care of two rather remarkable ladies, Daphne Sheldrick and Birute Galdikas. Filmed in a 3-D that captures the creatures and their environments in vivid detail, the film, under its narrator’s steady hand, makes an entertaining case for animal orphanages helping displaced babies back into the wild. We had the chance to sit down with Freeman recently, who graciously obliged our request to distill a lifetime’s movie-watching into a list of his Five Favorite Films. “It’s gonna be difficult,” he admits.&nbsp;King Kong (1933, 100% Tomatometer)My number one favorite film was the first film I ever saw — I was six-years-old before I ever went to the movies — and that film is the original King Kong. It’s still, I think, the best King Kong.High Noon (1952, 95% Tomatometer)&nbsp;Then, my next favorite film is Gary Cooper’s High Noon. Here we’re talking about the one man against many, having to stand alone. And what sticks with me about that movie is that the woman that he loved, who was completely anti-violence, stood up with him, ultimately; and at the end, when all the townspeople had run away, he took that badge off and threw it in the dirt.Moulin Rouge! (2001, 78% Tomatometer)&nbsp;I think one of the best movies ever made was Baz Luhrmann’s Moulin Rouge! It was just an extraordinarily well done film. Editing, directing, costuming — just everything about it was perfect.The Outlaw Josey Wales (1976, 97% Tomatometer)&nbsp;Clint Eastwood’s The Outlaw Josey Wales — one of my favorite, favorite films. I don’t know what it is about The Outlaw Josey Wales that sticks… Oh, I do know what it is: it’s the relationship with Chief Dan George. The narration, as it were, of Chief Dan George in that movie, you know. He’s so dry, and it’s humorous, but true. [As Josey Wales/Lone Watie] “You’re not supposed to be able to sneak up on an Indian… But white men have been sneaking up on us for years now.” [laughs] He’s just great.Moby Dick (1956, 87% Tomatometer)&nbsp;What’s my fifth favorite movie? Now there have been quite a number of them. See now I’m sort of in no-man’s land, because I’m thinking Bonnie and Clyde, I’m thinking Chinatown… I’m just wandering around now. [laughs] One of my favorite books was Black Beauty; I read it when I was eight-years-old, and I’m trying to find if there was a movie, like that, that sticks with me. Oh, I know! Moby Dick. Yes. Now that was filmmaking. John Huston. Call me… Ishmael. I read the book, and there are very few books that I have read and seen the movie and liked the movie. Gregory Peck was in two of ’em: Moby Dick and To Kill a Mockingbird. Gregory Peck was one of my favorite actors. Gregory Peck and Gary Cooper and Humphrey Bogart, those guys.&nbsp;Born To Be Wild is in IMAX theaters this week.","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"sag, space, rotten, E3, Video, Countdown, anthology","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/safdsfdsasafdsafdsafsaf.jpg","slug":"five-favorite-films-with-morgan-freeman"},{"id":"47508851059030","title":"Five Favourite Films with Nick Frost","content":"Five Favorite Filmsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Five Favourite Films with Nick FrostPlus, the star on his alien comedy Paul, working with Spielberg on The Adventures Tintin, and the forthcoming Attack the Block.by Luke Goodsell | April 13, 2011 |  CommentsRight now, you might say that Nick Frost and Simon Pegg are living every sci-fi movie fan’s dream. The irrepressible British comedy duo, who came to attention via cult TV series Spaced and scored big-screen hits with Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz, are currently enjoying the success of their third movie collaboration, Paul, which finds them as road-tripping nerds inadvertently harbouring an intergalactic fugitive with an attitude (Paul, voiced by Seth Rogen). Directed with freewheeling brio by Greg Mottola (Superbad, Adventureland), bursting with pop references and some heavyweight genre cameos, it’s a film that manages to be satiric and self-referential while retaining its own brand of wayward road movie lunacy.On top of that, Frost and Pegg have been filming Steven Spielberg’s forthcoming The Adventures of Tintin: The Secret of the Unicorn, in which they portray the all-but-identical detective buffoons Thomson and Thompson.Frost is also soon to appear in what looks to be one of the year’s breakout hits, the aliens-invade-inner-city-London adventure Attack the Block, directed by his friend (and Tintin co-writer) Joe Cornish.With Paul landing in Australian cinemas this week, we got a chance to talk with Nick Frost about the film, what it’s been like working with Spielberg, and what to expect from Attack the Block. Read on for the full interview, but first, as always, we asked him his Five Favourite Films. “Alright — as of today,” Frost notes of his choices.&nbsp;Close Encounters of the Third Kind (1977, 95% Tomatometer)&nbsp;Close Encounters of the Third Kind is my favourite film of all time. That will always be number one. I can watch it today and it’s like a time machine; it completely takes me back to the way I felt when I first watched it as a kid. For me it never dates, it never ages, and it’s just perfect.Dead Man’s Shoes (2004, 55% Tomatometer)&nbsp;I’ve also got on there Dead Man’s Shoes, the Shane Meadows/Paddy Considine classic. I think Paddy Considine is the finest actor and I loved working with him on Hot Fuzz and stuff. I think I’d like to be as good an actor as Paddy Considine one day, when I grow up. [laughs] He is amazing.Bottle Rocket (1996, 79% Tomatometer)&nbsp;Bottle Rocket: I love Wes Anderson and that’s one of my favourites. I mean, it’s my favourite today with this interview. I love his staging of detail and specificity, you know; I think if the devil is in the details, Wes Anderson just nails it.Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981, 94% Tomatometer)&nbsp;Raiders of the Lost Ark, again, very similar to me with Close Encounters. If I’m sick, or I’ve had a wisdom tooth out or I’m lying in bed in the afternoon and not very well, I will often put Raiders of the Lost Ark on. Again, it’s like a timeless gem for me and it just never gets tired. When my son becomes old enough to watch films I am gonna show him Raiders.How old is that?Well, like, three. [laughs]The Shining (1980, 88% Tomatometer)&nbsp;Finally, just for today, I am gonna say The Shining. Just a great film. It’s a great horror film and it’s incredibly creepy; fantastic performances and just that sense of threat that is prevalent throughout the whole movie. I just love it.&nbsp;Next, Frost talks Paul, working with Spielberg on Tintin, and more aliens in his upcoming Attack the Block.&nbsp;&nbsp;RT: This is yours and Simon’s biggest film yet — are you happy with how Paul‘s been doing at the box office so far?Nick Frost: I think you have to look at your place in the food chain, you know. We’re British filmmakers. Americans like American films; they like American actors and writers — and that’s fair enough. Yes, Paul is a bigger film in itself, because it was a bigger budget, but we’re aware that we are foreign filmmakers in America, so I think Paul has been very successful.You’ve definitely got another big cult hit on your hands.Well that’s enough — that’s fine for me. In terms of British people who go to America to make films, I think we’ve done great.How did you come to enlist Greg Mottola as director, given his background in more indie-style comedies?We picked Greg, and he picked us. We knew Edgar [Wright] wasn’t available because he was off doing Scott Pilgrim, which was great, and it was Simon and I’s idea anyway; it was something that we’ve always had in mind and that we’ve wanted to do. We were big films of Greg’s first film, Daytrippers, and then I saw Superbad at Comic-Con about three or four years ago, and just flipped out for it. I met Greg there and I spoke to Simon about Greg, and Greg and Simon had a meeting. We had Superbad screened over in London and we just realised that this was exactly who we wanted to do Paul. We wanted it to be like an independent road movie set in America — like Little Miss Sunshine but with Paul instead of Alan Arkin.&nbsp;At what point did you both say, “Let’s write an alien road trip movie”?Well it started out as a bit of flippancy in the rain. We were shooting Shaun of the Dead and it was f**king raining tons during the scene where we were throwing the records at the Hulk and Mary, and Nira our producer just kinda said, “Maybe we should shoot a film somewhere where it doesn’t rain.” That started us spitballing this idea about the desert, because obviously it doesn’t rain in the desert — but it does, which is the irony — and then that became Nevada which became Area 51, and then, because of the frame of reference that Simon Pegg and I use, it is not a big jump to go to “two comic book nerds find alien in crashed Crown Vic.”There are scores of pop references in the script, which is of course part of the fun; but was there a point where you and Simon had to say, “Okay, that’s enough”?Well we don’t have a list, you know. We get asked this question a lot: “You’ve done zombies, you’ve done aliens — what’s next?” It’s not like we set out with a list of genres or a list of references we need to hit and then start it from there. I think Paul is character-driven and the reason there are so many references is that that’s where Graham [Simon Pegg] and Clive [Nick Frost] come from. The only time we did think about the references and pared some of them down was when Simon got the Star Trek gig. I think in original drafts there were more Star Trek references and stuff, and then as soon as he got the gig it seemed we should get rid of them, because it seemed a bit self-referential then.Well not many films manage to work in references to both Capturing the Friedmans and Mac and Me, so my hat is off to you there…[laughs] I don’t think people try, to be honest.Was there a defining moment in your life in which you realised you were a sci-fi fan?Close Encounters. The first time I ever saw that, that’s the first time I remember becoming aware of cinema, and the power of it; and being aware of a film. It’s a love, certainly for Close Encounters, that has endured for the last 30 years of my life. Also for me, for my friends and my cousins and my younger family, it was all about Star Wars. My whole life growing up was all about Star Wars.&nbsp;Speaking of Spielberg, what’s it like having seen his films as a kid and now to be working with him on Tintin?Yeah, absolutely fantastic, you know. He’s a hero of mine. I mean, I don’t remember much about going to school, but I certainly remember where I was the first time I saw E.T. and Close Encounters. Once you start working with him it’s very nerve-wracking, you know, because he’s Steven Spielberg for God’s sake; it’s terrifying. But once you’re on set, in quite a short space of time you realise and understand that he’s an absolute genius and a gentleman, and he’s a filmmaker — he’s not in it for the money or the celebrity, he’s in it because he loves making films. He’s happy to talk about Close Encounters and E.T. and stuff, and he’s a great storyteller. Just watching him shoot a film, you see his enthusiasm and his verve for making films, and it is very infectious. You wanna work around that, and perform inside that.Has he seen Paul?[MINOR SPOILER]Well he’s in Paul.Ah, I didn’t wanna spoil it for anyone who hasn’t seen it.Oh I see. He has, yes. He loved it. He really liked it. His only criticism was that he didn’t like the guy who played Steven Spielberg.&nbsp;[laughs] Again with the aliens — you’ve got Attack the Block, Joe Cornish’s film, coming up. Can you tell us about your role?Aha, yeah I play Ron — I’m like an area drug dealer and I have lots of street kids kind of doing the dirty work for me. I think Joe and I both talked about Ron being like Bruce Dern in Silent Running, you know — he’s just this kind of very peaceful guy who happens to be a grower and a cultivator of marijuana and herbal medicines; he just sits in his council flat cultivating away. I was so happy to do that film and so happy to work with Joe; he’s been a best mate of ours for years, so to see someone have what I think is going to be a massive success with Attack the Block, which he’s written and directed, I’m just proud as f**king punch, you know. And working with those kids — well they’re not kids, they’re young men and women — 99 per cent of those people had never acted before, and Joe and a lady called Lucy Pardee spent months and months street casting those kids. So they bring a tremendous energy and a talent to the set. Again, it’s just one of those jobs that you look forward to getting up and going to work in the mornings.Paul opens across Australian cinemas this week.","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"political, 24, adaptation","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/vcxz.jpg","slug":"five-favourite-films-with-nick-frost"},{"id":"47508854456689","title":"Five Favorite Films with Geoffrey Rush","content":"Five Favorite Filmsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Five Favorite Films with Geoffrey RushPlus, the Oscar winner on The King's Speech and why Pirates 4 is a new direction.by Luke Goodsell | November 24, 2010 |  CommentsA revered stage performer who became an Oscar-winning acting fixture in Hollywood, Geoffrey Rush parlayed his breakout in 1996’s Shine into a succession of roles in films as varied as Elizabeth, Shakespeare in Love, Finding Nemo and Munich, while turning in a memorable performance as the nefarious Captain Barbossa in the Pirates of the Caribbean films. This week, Rush returns to the screen opposite Colin Firth and Helena Bonham Carter in The King’s Speech, Tom Hooper’s period drama that has already started to gather Awards-season buzz. In it, Rush plays Lionel Logue, an unorthodox speech therapist assigned to help the stammering King George (Firth) as he prepares to address the nation on the brink of World War II.We spoke to the always charming Rush, who recently wrapped shooting on the fourth Pirates movie, On Stranger Tides, to talk about his character in The King’s Speech. And, of course, we asked him to name his five favorite films. “It’s a tricky one,” the actor says, “because you think, ‘Ah God, I can never get it down to five,’ but off the top of my head, these are favorites… ”City Lights (1931, 100% Tomatometer)I think they’re all fairly artful pieces of work, but I think my all-time favorite is Charlie Chaplin’s City Lights, which was one of the… well, it’s like now, somebody still making a film in 2D, three years later: he still made it as a silent film [after the advent of sound], with inter-titling, and it had a recorded score. It’s one of those films that I’ve shown to many, various groups of people socially. I remember going to a DVD night in Silverlake, with a lot of very groovy LA people, and we all had to bring a film. And they were bringing along, you know, Sin City and stuff, and I did a pitch on that film, without saying it was a Charlie Chaplin film — saying it’s about an alcoholic and this young, impoverished guy, and they’re best friends when the guy is drunk and then when he sobers up he doesn’t know who he is; and the young guy is wanting to help this girl who sells flowers on the street, and she’s blind. And they were all going, “Oh my God, this sounds amazing,” and then I said it’s in black and white and it’s silent and it’s a Charlie Chaplin film — and they all watched it and were just entranced; and this is sort of like the Tarantino crowd. I’ve always loved that film.Amarcord (1973, 92% Tomatometer)The next one I would say would be Amarcord by Fellini. In fact everything by Fellini, but Amarcord, particularly, I just happened to see it — I think most of the films I’m going to mention I probably saw in my early 20s, either in Queensland or when I first went to Europe, and they were the films that just stuck with me and I felt when I saw them they kind of blew me away.Persona (1966,93% Tomatometer)What else did I have in there? I’d probably have to have Persona, by Bergman.Zelig (1983,100% Tomatometer)Zelig, by Woody Allen, just because I think it’s one of the most ingenious pieces of faux filmmaking and yet it’s hilarious and it has a sort of brilliant sense of history and a touch of absurdity and madness to it.War and Peace (1967, 100% Tomatometer)I’d probably have to throw in the Sergei Bondarchuk War and Peace from the ’60s. I remember seeing that with my step-dad when I was about 15. The scale of it and the kind of dramatic style of old, expressionistic use of the camera, that led me then to look at things like Ivan the Terrible. I just thought they were amazing. No one’s quite touched it since. When you look at it, the only thing that’s dated is probably the font they used for the titles — it sort of says it’s a bit ’60s, but the rest of it you just go, “Wow, this guy played Pierre as well as directing it.” And there’s not one CGI soldier, you know: they’ve literally got 50,000 troops in the back of shot.Next, Geoffrey Rush discusses his role opposite Colin Firth in this week’s The King’s Speech, and his just-wrapped Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides.&nbsp;RT: The King’s Speech looks like it was fun to work on — did you enjoy it?GR: I did, I had a ball. It was something that we had real scheduling difficulties with, because I had committed to a musical in Melbourne and it looked like it was going to clash, but [director] Tom Hooper managed to move things around and I had a window of opportunity for seven weeks. So for a film it was a very intensive period of rehearsal and work shopping; primarily the scenes that Colin and I were doing, because we were going to shoot all of our stuff in a month. And that added a sense of pressure and also of play, which I think was invaluable.The character you play, Lionel Logue, was an Australian speech therapist — did you know much about him before you took the project on?I knew nothing about him. At first I read the play that David Seidler had written, a couple of years back I think, and I knew about the bigger historical wheels that were turning around that period in the British monarchy: the abdication, and I knew that the Duke of York, George the Sixth, was a stammerer and over the years I’d seen different news reel footage of that. It was probably the last period where a royal figure was so prominent in terms of the morale of the country. At the time, the Prime Ministers would make all the official speeches about the declaration of war and stuff, but then it was up to the King, against all those odds, and up against the sort of ranting, charismatic rhetoric of Hitler, to make these great broadcasts; because radio, at that stage, was relatively new, I think — the BBC started in the early- to mid-’30s, so it was kind of a new medium.But Lionel, I knew nothing of him. He was a completely fascinating figure, and that sort of appealed to me; the extremities of the differences between these two men that happened to be thrown together against seemingly great odds. The fact that the Duke of York was very protocol driven, with a great sense of history and rules and regulations, you know; his job description was completely different to Lionel, being the son of brewer and kind of an amateur dilettante, Shakespeare fanatic who loved recitals, taught elocution and then found himself working with shell-shock victims and developing, just through pure experience, techniques that are now regarded as very orthodox. They would have been very avant garde at the time.Is it true that Lionel wanted — and failed — to be a professional actor, and did you imagine what your life might have been like had you been in the same position?[Laughs] It’s a little vague that area. He did, because I know we got a hold of his diaries, and all of his papers were given to us not long before we started shooting. I think the production design department located Lionel’s grandson, who said he had all of his grandfather’s papers… and there were letters and photos and diagnostic charts and diaries. Logue, I think, only started diarizing his life once the Duke of York became King, because I think he might have thought, this is worth archiving for posterity in some way. So the contents of the letters, for example, and just the nature of what the chosen information was that went into the daily accounts… there’s even the Duke of York’s first diagnosis card, the jottings that he made on their first meeting. All of that material was invaluable in finding a greater nuance and reality to those meetings, and not imagining the more clichéd versions of it.You’ve always been an eloquent performer, but were there any “tongue twisters” Logue used that even you had trouble with?Well I don’t have a natural inclination. I know some actors who can jump around dialects with a great facility, with what we might call a “natural ear”. I’ve always worked very closely with two specific voice and dialect coaches, one of whom happens to have been a former speech therapist who had worked with stammerers and so forth. But the one woman I have worked with, Barbara Berkery, who I met on Shakespeare in Love — she worked with me on The Life and Death of Peter Sellers and The Golden Age and on the Pirates films and so forth — it’s a slight homage to her, because the “thistle sifter” tongue twister that’s in the film is one that she taught me. And I’ve always loved it because when my son was younger I used to give it to him, and he’d just stumble fretfully through the whole thing.Once your muscle memory is trained on those sort of things, I think they become for me, and for Lionel Logue, kind of party pieces, you know. It’s like learning the scales or something — you’ve just got to hammer away at it until your fingers can run up and down the keyboard and know which black and white notes to hit. Similarly, a good tongue twister always has those difficult sounds. And I always liked the idea because I thought, as a team, Logue is a thistle sifter, as is the Duke of York; we’re all thistle sifters — we’ve got this in our life and we’ve got that in our life. We used to find hilarious variations of that at any given moment on the set; anything that sounded like thistle sifter we would turn into a tongue twister… and most of them were obscene. [laughs]How’s Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides coming along?Oh it’s great. Pirates 4 has a real snappy, interesting quality to it. It’s got almost a completely different tone and tempo to the trilogy.Are you liking it better than the previous sequels?Ah, no… look I’ve had a good time on that whole quartet of films. The fact that this one was not just another franchise movie — there was a whole lot of new ingredients and new energy and fresh ideas thrown onto the table — was great.The King’s Speech is in theaters this week.","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"ratings, TNT, universe, Family, TV, BET","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/zxcv.jpg","slug":"five-favorite-films-with-geoffrey-rush"},{"id":"47508854468982","title":"Five Favorite Films with Baz Luhrmann","content":"Five Favorite Filmsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Five Favorite Films with Baz LuhrmannThe Romeo + Juliet and Moulin Rouge! director pulls back the red curtain on some of his favorites.by Luke Goodsell | October 19, 2010 |  CommentsFor a director whose films — from the eclectic pop confection Romeo + Juliet to the widescreen-nostalgic Australia — are rich with references to cinema history, it should come as no surprise to find Baz Luhrmann arrives at his “Five Favorite Films” list both well prepared and bearing a caveat of sorts. “To me there are the usual suspects, in terms of the things I particularly like,” he begins, when asked to break it down to five, “from Apocalypse Now to Lawrence of Arabia to Bandwagon, to The Seventh Seal or Annie Hall or The Wizard of Oz or Cabaret. They go from epics to musicals, but when I started to think about it, I started scribbling down these lists and there was Battle of Algiers and Being John Malkovich, All the President’s Men and Casablanca, for example. So I was thinking, maybe my list will be what I think are remarkable films worth seeing, that are perhaps not on the radar. These are like the side menus to the main banquet, to broaden your palette.”Star 80 (1983, 89% Tomatometer)Cabaret is the classic work [from director Bob Fosse], but Star 80 I think is really worth visiting, because it wasn’t a successful film and it really dealt with a kind of heinous crime. The film itself is brilliantly made, in terms of rhythm and storytelling; if you look at it you’ll see that a lot of directors of my era have been influenced by the aesthetic. Bob Fosse’s great ability with rhythmic storytelling is very alive in the movie, and what’s so intriguing is that it takes a true chapter in the history of Hugh Hefner and the world of Playboy and tells it as a kind of psychological thriller — but with a whole lot of Fosse-like theatricality. So I think that’s a kind of little off-the-radar gem.War and Peace (1967, 100% Tomatometer)One of my great all-time loves in cinema, and I’ve seen it three times, is Bondarchuk’s War and Peace. Not a lot of people may have seen that film. It was made during the Soviet era. I’d be happy to see it again — it is, however, 12 hours long. It took 10 years to make, and some actors lived and died during the period of making the movie. It’s a little bit influenced by being a ’60s film, so it’s got a bit of a trippy edge to it; it’s a little bit abstract. But it has some of the finest examples of Russian acting of that era. I was profoundly affected by the Russian theater and the style of Russian acting. It was shot on cameras and film stock that we simply never have access to. If I’m not mistaken, during the opening credits the camera is in a cosmonaut’s space capsule being shot into Earth. It’s probably the biggest crane shot of all time. At first you think, “Well this is going to be tedious,” but stay with it and I think you’ll find yourself drawn in. And the girl who played Natasha [Lyudmila Savelyeva] is a dead ringer for Audrey Hepburn and she’s one of the most luminous stars that ever found herself on the screen.Medium Cool (1969,94% Tomatometer)Medium Cool. I’m crazy about that film. To me, there are a lot of great films from that era because I was seeing them in our movie house when I was a kid [Luhrmann’s dad ran a theater for a period], but what I love about Medium Cool is that it preempts the idea of taking a real historical event and weaving a drama around it. So that’s great about it. Robert Forster is great in that picture. Not to mention — and I’ll be a bit flippant here — the clothes are fantastic. It’s just a great pop cultural picture.Fitzcarraldo (1982,82% Tomatometer)I kind of think Fitzcarraldo. Cinephiles know it, but the new generation don’t really know that picture. It’s a flawed film but if you watch that and the companion making-of [Burden of Dreams]… there’s a great Criterion of it; it’s the one with Mick Jagger in it, when he started the film and had to pull out. What I love about this film is that it represents what I love about film making: The film is about a person who has an insane passion for art, to the extent that they drag a boat over a small isthmus to make money, but he’s making money to bring Caruso, the great Italian Opera singer, to build an opera house. But the backstory, with Klaus [Kinski], and the relationship between Klaus and [director] Werner [Herzog], is so fantastic a backstory. I mean, they try and kill each other. And I think the intense passion between actor and director is in the film. To me it’s kind of a package deal, this film. You have to involve yourself in the movie, but it’s really worth going beneath the film, up the jungle and into the psyche of the drama itself. Its companion film is one of my favorites of all-time, Apocalypse Now — and you can go on the same journey with that film.8 ½ (1963,97% Tomatometer)It could be 8½. I mean, 8 ½ to me is such a great dissertation on the whole, you know, act if filmmaking and creativity. And you can probably link it with Stardust Memories, because I love the way that Woody [Allen] did a take on it as well. I mean, it’s a little bit of a self examination of the act of making a film. [Reels off another long list of films] Apu. That’d be my fifth, if I didn’t get a fifth one. Satyajit Ray’s Apu trilogy — I just love those films; the way he uses scenery to create close-ups and wides, and just the emotion of it.Romeo + Juliet and Moulin Rouge! are out now on Blu-ray.","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"series, TV, Lifetime, mutant, movies, game, Amazon, book, Logo, Month, teaser, marvel","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Five-Favorite-Films-with-Baz-Luhrmann"},{"id":"47508855892346","title":"Five Favorite Films with The Clone Wars‘ Ashley Eckstein","content":"Five Favorite Filmsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Five Favorite Films with The Clone Wars' Ashley EcksteinThe voice actor and Star Wars fashion designer also talks about fandom and Lucasfilm.by Matt Atchity | September 30, 2010 |  CommentsAshley Eckstein is a busy woman these days; not only is she lending her voice to the character of Ahsoka Tano on The Clone Wars animated series, she’s also recently launched Her Universe, the first line of Star Wars apparel exclusively for women. We caught up with her to talk about her five favorite films, her clothing line, and what it’s like to be a longtime Star Wars fan that gets to work with Lucasfilm.Star Wars: Episode V – The Empire Strikes Back (1980,97% Tomatometer)First, I’ve got to go with Star Wars: A New Hope. Wait, switch that… I actually like Empire better, because that’s the movie where the girl finally gets her man.Notting Hill (1999,82% Tomatometer)I’m going to sound super-cheesy, but I’ve got to go with Notting Hill. That’s probably my all-time favorite romantic comedy. That’s high on my list. I’ve fallen in love with London, and there just something about what I love about London, combined with a romantic comedy. And then of course, Julia Roberts; I mean she’s just romantic comedy gold.Alice in Wonderland (1951,82% Tomatometer)Disney’s Alice in Wonderland, not the new one, the old one. The cartoon Alice in Wonderland is high on my list. Alice is my favorite. I grew up in Orlando, Florida, and my dad worked for Disney. So growing up, I actually had the Alice dress, and I had long blonde hair and blue eyes, and so I looked just like her.The Shawshank Redemption (1994,88% Tomatometer)That’s my husband’s all-time favorite movie. He loves it, and so we’ll watch that one together. We really enjoy that.Legally Blonde (2001,67% Tomatometer)I was just watching it the other day, and I just love Reese Witherspoon. I think she’s good in everything she does.Next, Ashley talks about her clothing line and what it’s like to be part of the Lucasfilm family.RT: Let’s talk about Her Universe, your women’s Star Wars clothing line. What prompted you to create this?Ashley Eckstein: Well, I was cast as the voice of Ahsoka about four and a half years ago. I was always a Star Wars fan obviously, so I loved the movies, but I became an even bigger fan once I joined the show. And selfishly, I wanted Star Wars merchandise to wear for me. And I went online, and went to stores, and realized it didn’t really exist. So then I started doing research, and there’s a couple of shirts here and there for female fans, but there wasn’t really anything.Apart from finding something on sites like Zazzle…Right! Zazzle, and Junk Food has a couple, the guys at Mad Engine that did the Star Wars t-shirts are awesome, they have a couple, but for the most part, there wasn’t stylish, fitted shirts for women. I did my research, and found that close to half of Star Wars fans are women. When you consider that something like 80% of the consumer market (for clothes) is women, why aren’t you giving us stuff to buy? So I approached Lucasfilm, and started Her Universe, and it’s the first Star Wars line exclusively for women. We don’t even make men’s products. We want to make girls head-to-toe geek chic! We’ve got our hats, shirts and necklaces, and hopefully we’ll get into footwear. We also plan to do cosmetics; I want to do lightsaber lip gloss. Lip gloss in the shape of a lightsaber!As a longtime fan of Star Wars, what’s it like to be behind the curtain now?The biggest thing is getting to go up to Skywalker Ranch. The first time we ever went, my husband and I, we got a tour and they walked us up the staircase, and we were waiting right outside of George Lucas’s office. He walked out, and we met him, and we shook his hand, and he was just as normal and as down-to-earth as he could possibly be. To have experiences like that because you’re working on one of his shows is cool. We got to stay there at the ranch; it’s stuff like that that you pinch yourself and say, “Okay, how did I fall into this?” Even this line (Her Universe) is truly because of Lucasfilm; they’ve given me the opportunity with The Clone Wars, and they truly believe in their female fans.What can we expect in the new season of The Clone WarsAhsoka has a big season coming up. All they’re allowing me to say is that there are some connections to the original saga in Season 3.You can catch the current season of The Clone Wars every Friday night on Cartoon Network, and be sure to check out Ashley’s Star Wars-themed designs for women at Her Universe.","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"anime, Annual, Fox, tv, movies, IFC, Arrowverse, french, spider-man, jones","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Five-Favorite-Films-with-The-Clone-Wars-Ashley-Eckstein"},{"id":"47508855915911","title":"Five Favorite Films with Karl Urban","content":"Five Favorite Filmsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Five Favorite Films with Karl UrbanThe Star Trek and Red star also talks about working with Ernest Borgnine and Bruce Willisby Matt Atchity | July 23, 2010 |  CommentsKarl Urban isn’t a household name… yet. But the rising star has had his share of memorable roles in some pretty iconic movie franchises. Chances are you’ll recognize the native New Zealander as Eomer, the exiled leader of the Riders of Rohan in the Lord of the Rings trilogy; or as Dr. Leonard “Bones” McCoy in the 2009 Star Trek prequel; or as Kirill, the Russian assassin on Jason Bourne’s tail in The Bourne Supremacy. This October, Urban stars alongside such premiere talent as Bruce Willis, Morgan Freeman, Helen Mirren, and John Malkovich (among others) in the action film Red, based on the comic series of the same name. We were able to sit down with Urban at Comic-Con to talk about his Five Favorite Films, as well as what it was like to work with Ernest Borgnine and Bruce Willis. Read on for the full interview!Out of the Past (1947,96% Tomatometer)The first one I’m going to go with is a Robert Mitchum film called Out of the Past. Classic noir. You’ve got to see it. It’s cool as s—.Queen Margot (1994,77% Tomatometer)It’s difficult; I have so many. But moving right along, a French film, Queen Margot. I love the story, and I love the performances. Jean-Hugues Anglade plays the phenomenal character of this sort of sick, dying king. So that’s one of my favorites.Cool Hand Luke (1967,100% Tomatometer)One of the inspirational films for me, Cool Hand Luke. Paul Newman. He’s just phenomenal. I mean, really. It’s the template for many films. You know, Jack Nicholson in [One Flew Over the] Cuckoo’s Nest, it’s the same kind of thing, the individual against the system. “What we’ve got here is a failure to communicate. Some men, you just can’t reach.” I love that film. Love it.Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981,94% Tomatometer)I’m gonna have to say, because of my childhood, and it’s such a strong influence for me, Raiders of the Lost Ark. I would define my interest in acting as a long-standing compulsion, and I was interested in pursuing this career since I was five years old. But it was films like Star Wars, or, you know, films that really got me interested. Star Wars, Raiders, Jaws… Alien. Alien I have to put on the list… I feel like… Every time, if I name a film like Alien, I say, “Well, I should really say Blade Runner as well.” You can’t… I mean, the attention to detail, and the characters. I just can’t wait to see where [Ridley Scott] goes next. The fact that he’s doing prequels has just got me giddy.A Prophet (2009,97% Tomatometer)I just saw a phenomenal French film recently called A Prophet. Have you seen that? Got to check it out. It’s amazing, it was an amazing film. Oh oh, No Country for Old Men. Gotta have that in there. This five is expanding to 10, 12! No Country for Old Men. Phenomenal film. Loved that film.Next, Urban talks about the experience of working with Ernest Borgnine, Bruce Willis, and whether or not he’ll have a part in the upcoming Hobbit films.RT: So let’s talk about Red for a minute. Amazing cast!Karl Urban: It’s insane. When I first signed onto the film, Bruce [Willis] was attached, Morgan [Freeman] was attached. I met the director, I read the script, and I loved the material, loved the character. “Yeah, I’m in!” And then it was just bizarre! Every week, it was like, “Oh, Helen Mirren’s just joined the cast. Oh, John Malkovich has just joined. Richard Dreyfuss. Ernest Borgnine.” It just became stupid, that this film was just turning into this beast with the most phenomenal cast. You know, they tested the film the other day, and apparently it went through the roof. The audience really loves this film, so I’m really looking forward to it getting out there.Did you have any scenes with Borgnine?I did, I did. He’s phenomenal. I mean, that was one of my most favorite days on this shoot. Getting to work with him and hearing him tell stories about Lee Marvin and [Sam] Peckinpah and From Here to Eternity. He’s one of the last real old-school guys around, back from the ’40s, the ’50s. He was kicking it with Monty Clift and [Frank] Sinatra and [Robert] Mitchum and all those guys. Yeah, so that was a real treat. And to have the opportunity to work with him? He’s 90-something, sharp as a tack and on his game. He put in a full day.It’s got to be a thrill to work with a guy like Bruce Willis, having presumably grown up on movies like his.Oh yeah, absoultely.Is it tough to keep from being starstruck?No, I mean… You know, I’ve been doing this long enough that what you come to realize is that people are all the same. We have the same basic needs and functions. So I don’t get starstruck so much, but for me, certainly, to have the opportunity to go head to head with one of the most iconic action heroes of all time was an offer I couldn’t refuse. It was really wonderful because, quite often, these stars like Bruce are highly revered and you hear so much about them, there’s a high degree of expectation about who they are and what they can deliver and what they’re like on set. And I have to say that it was such a pleasant surprise to me that all my expectations were thoroughly exceeded by how cool this guy is and how wonderful he was to everybody and how he was just a rock solid captain of the ship. Fun to be around, relaxed, you know, just one of the guys. There was no sort of air or pretenses like “I’m Mr. Superstar.” He was really humble and welcoming to be around.Not a lot of people seem to be able to bounce between heroic and villainous roles. Is there one you prefer to do? Is there one that’s more fun?I have no preference, no. To me, I’m just attracted to what fuels me creatively. I don’t really plan out to any great degree what I do, and perhaps I should. But if I read a script and I respond to the characters, and I start making decisions on how I would play them, then that is, to me, an indication of “Well, that’s something I should do.” In the case of Star Trek, I was a longtime fan of the show, so I actively pursued that. But no, you know what? The bad guys are fun to play because they get to do and say the things that we never can in real life, and as far as playing a hero or good guy, it’s one of the things that attracts you as a kid when you’re watching movies. You know, you put yourself in the position of the hero and you want to be that hero, so that’s a lot of fun as well.So I have to ask, since it’s in the news all the time now. Presumably, Eomer’s not in the Hobbit movies, but any chance you might talk your way into a different role?No, no I don’t think so. I have enough respect for Peter Jackson and Fran [Walsh] and Phillipa [Boyens] and all the team there. I just feel very grateful to have already worked with them on such a well-renowned and -loved bunch of films. Would I like to do The Hobbit? Absolutely. But I couldn’t conceivably do it as Eomer; he wasn’t even born when that period of Tolkien was set.Red, starring Bruce Willis, Morgan Freeman, Helen Mirren, John Malkovich, and of course, Karl Urban, opens in the US on October 15.Be sure to check out the rest of our 2010 Comic-Con coverage in our San Diego Comic-Con 2010 Headquarters.","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"critics, quibi, in, halloween, telelvision, Fox","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Five-Favorite-Films-with-Karl-Urban"},{"id":"47508857418123","title":"Five Favorite Films with Tilda Swinton","content":"Five Favorite Filmsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Five Favorite Films with Tilda SwintonThe fiery actress reveals all!by Alex Vo | July 9, 2010 |  CommentsOne of the most compelling women in the profession today,Tilda Swinton has stuffed a ton ofexcellent performances and movies in her filmography, including recently Broken Flowers,The Chronicles of Narnia movies, BurnAfter Reading, and Michael Clayton,for which she won a Best Supporting Actress Oscar.

This year he’s already starred in Terminator Salvation (some critics suggesting he was the best thing about the film), and will soon headline 2010’s amped-up remake of Clash of the Titans. Then, of course, there’s his pivotal role in arguably 2009’s most anticipated film — James Cameron’s 3-D sci-fi epic Avatar. So just how did this little-known actor become the planet’s go-to action guy? Maybe it’s got something to do with his taste in movies…Lethal Weapon 2 (1989,82% Tomatometer)Lethal Weapon 2 — because that’s the movie where I thought, ‘If those guys are doing that and getting paid for it, I want in.’ [laughs]Mad Max 2, aka The Road Warrior (1981,100% Tomatometer)Mad Max 2, along with The Year of Living Dangerously. As far as I’m concerned that was a time of filmmaking in Australia when we were excelling. And I can watch Mad Max 2 over and over again.The Year of Living Dangerously (1983,96% Tomatometer)And The Year of Living Dangerously, I love it because it’s an Australian movie not set in Australia.Beverly Hills Cop (1984,83% Tomatometer)Beverly Hills Cop, ’cause I think it’s Eddie Murphy at his finest. You know, we think of Norbit and things like that nowadays… but go watch Beverly Hills Cop to see the man in top form.Die Hard (1988,94% Tomatometer)Die Hard is the best action movie ever.

Are you a fan of John Carpenter’s cult classic films The Thing and They Live? Have you seen any of Ken Burns’ documentaries on PBS? Did you grow up watching the popular animated television series Gargoyles? And more recently, have you played such blockbuster video games as Mass Effect, Halo 2 or 3, or Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2? If you answered “yes” to any of these questions, then you know who Keith David is.The Harlem born actor has amassed an impressive list of credits on stage and in film, television, and video games, earning himself two Emmys and even a Tony nomination for his work. His distinctive voice is one of his trademarks, and this week, he lends it to Disney’s latest 2D animated feature, The Princess and the Frog. We had the opportunity to speak with him about his Five Favorite Films, his role in the new film, and what it’s like to do voice work in various mediums.&nbsp;Angels with Dirty Faces (1938,100% Tomatometer)A lot of James Cagney movies [inspired me].Sunset Boulevard (1950,98% Tomatometer)Double Indemnity (1944,98% Tomatometer)The March of the Wooden Soldiers (1934, 100% Tomatometer)A Double Life (1947,67% Tomatometer)A Double Life was a big influence on me.Why was that?Well, it was an actor playing Othello. It was written by Garson Kanin, who later married a teacher of mine, but he was married to Ruth Gordon, who was a favorite actress of mine. And it was a movie about the theater. I love those kinds of in-house things. I love political movies or plays, but especially plays about the inner workings of the business, or that give you insight into the process of what actors go through.Next, David talks about what it was like working on The Princess and the Frog, as well as what voiceover work is like in general.RT: Based on your affection for movies that deal with the inner workings of the business, have you found in your experiences as an actor that the films you see are accurate, that you’ve found yourself in those circumstances, or explored those themes and situations?Keith David: Sometimes yes and sometimes no. Sometimes it’s definitely a fictionalized version of what happens. Other times it’s such a particular bent on it that, you know, maybe some people work like that. I haven’t really tried to write a screenplay or play in many, many years, and I’m just picking up that gauntlet of trying, attempting to do that. And although they have many related issues, they’re very different, and they both hold, for me, their individual fascinations.Like you said, you’re picking up that gauntlet again. Do you find that, as an actor, it influences your process of writing? Can you talk a little bit about how that might inform that?Well, certainly I don’t have to tell actors how to act. You know, I have worked with authors who try to actor-proof their scripts. I really don’t agree with that notion; you cannot actor-proof your script. You write the best script that you can possibly write, and the better actors will find the voice of the playwright and the voice of their character, and do that more than glorify themselves. But there’s no substitute for wonderful writing.[rtimage]MapID=1196003&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=26&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]One of the things we’re here to talk about today is The Princess and the Frog, which we recently had a chance to see. What I thought was interesting was that Dr. Facilier – his performance as well as his shadow’s performance – how much of that, when you were working on the character, was on the page versus what was brought to life by you in the room, in the moment?A lot of it was on the page. It makes my job easier; it’s there on the page. And then we can fool around with different versions and variations on the theme. When the writing is good – and I believe it was in this case – it just makes the gig that much more pleasurable. This gig was a dream gig; acting in a Disney film is like the equivalent to doing Broadway. It’s the Broadway of animation.Dr. Facilier’s such an animated character, and I don’t mean necessarily that he’s drawn; he’s always moving, his movements are very big and very broad. I know that it’s helpful for some actors in the booth to be as energetic, physically, as their characters. Was this something that you found yourself doing?It happens that the guy whose body that they used to do the dancing and a lot of the movement of my character happened to be a friend of mine. He’s a guy who I had done a Broadway show with a couple of years ago, beautiful dancer. So that was fun. He called me immediately and said, “Hey man, I’m doing the movement for your character. I heard your voice.” So when I got back in the booth, of course knowing that he was doing my movement, it allowed me to relax and to know and to trust that that part was going to be well taken care of.[rtimage]MapID=1196003&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=46&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]How much did you have to reference before you went into the booth, so you could get a sense of what the character would look like and how the character might move?You know, there are at least prototypes when we get there. They have some idea. And then they have these wonderful clay statues — I don’t know exactly what the process is — but they make them and they were fascinating. This tall lanky guy, with this hair that seemed to have a life of its own. It was fascinating, the whole thing was fascinating. I also did Coraline, and again the animated process takes very long. It takes quite a while to do. I never knew that before working on these projects. It’s fascinating how much time and effort goes into it, and it’s really wonderful to see that all that hard work really comes to something.Was there any added pressure for you as an actor? Like, “This is a return to form and I gotta do it right.” Or was it very naturalistic and comfortable?I mean, I love animation. I particularly love Disney animation. It was a dream job; it was a pleasure to go to work. It was phenomenally unpressurized. I was part of a very well oiled machine; I had a fantastic team, directing team, writing and music team. If nobody got along, I don’t know it. It was a wonderful, wonderfully collaborative process, and people seemed to be mostly on the same page, and when they weren’t, I didn’t know it. Whatever disagreements did happen were kept to a very bare minimum.Is there one particular medium of voiceover that you have maybe a little bit more fun with? Do you enjoy doing games versus animated films, or is it all sort of the same?I love to work, man, you know? Whatever the form or genre. Documentaries are a favorite of mine, but I love doing these. I love animation, I just adore animation.You can catch Keith David in The Princess and the Frog this weekend in theaters everywhere.For more Five Favorite Films,visit our archive.","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"park, batman, Box","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/KeithDavid.jpg","slug":"five-favorite-films-with-keith-david"},{"id":"47508860554668","title":"Five Favorite Films with A.O.

ScottThe new co-host of At the Movies also talks about the show and print vs. TV.by Tim Ryan | September 17, 2009 |  CommentsA.O. Scott of the New York Times — and now, At the Movies — is one of America’s best-known and most trusted film critics. Scott’s tenure with the Times began in 2000; prior to that, he was a book critic for Newsday, and contributed to a number of other publications. Beginning in 2006, he filled in for Roger Ebert on At the Movies; on Sept. 5, he and the Chicago Tribune’s Michael Phillips took over as the hosts of the show, replacing Ben Lyons and Ben Mankiewicz.In an interview with Rotten Tomatoes, Scott shared some of his favorites (he particularly likes long movies and Italian films), and discussed the differences between appraising movies in print and on television, as well as what the new At the Movies has in store for audiences. (Be sure to check back next week, when we present Michael Phillips’ Five Favorite Films.)&nbsp;La Dolce Vita (1960,98% Tomatometer)I would say number one is probably Fellini’s La Dolce Vita, which I never get tired of. Even though parts of it are very grim and depressing, I think if there was a movie I would want to live in, it would be that. You know, if the world could be the Trevi Fountain in black and white, with Anita Ekberg holding a kitten on her head.RT: As a newspaperman, don’t you kind of live in that world?[Laughs] It kind of is; that sort of mixture of romanticism and cynicism that Marcello has is very much a journalist’s world view. And also the way he’s thinking, “What I really am, deep down, is a poet or a philosopher, but I have to be in this vulgar world of paparazzi.” The origin of the paparazzi is in that movie.It’s great to go back to, because whenever I remember it, I remember it a little bit out of order, and it seems like it’s been slightly reshuffled or certain things come to the surface that I didn’t notice before. Everything about it, too – the visuals, the setting. I am generally a sucker for Italian movies. If it’s in Italian, I have trouble disliking it too much.The Godfather (1972,100% Tomatometer)I would cheat and say the two Godfather movies, The Godfather part I and II, edited in whatever order; I like the way they were sort of edited together in a single movie, but I also like them as they were released separately. And I think that that, for me, is the pinnacle of movies as a popular art form in America. It’s like a great novel, but it’s a super entertaining movie. It’s always funny to think that that was — you know, if you talk to Francis Ford Coppola, that was sort of his commercial movie that he got hired to make, and that was the one he did to make a lot of money. I have nothing original to say about it, but again, a movie that I cannot imagine ever getting tired of watching. When you come across it on TV, you stop and suddenly two hours have gone by, and you’re still with it. If you think about it, the performances in that… Everyone in that movie, just about, is as good as they ever were.RT: So in general, do you like long movies?Generally yes. I’ve been accused sometimes of having a kind of “the longer, the better” [attitude]. [A while back] I wrote a piece on the restored Berlin Alexanderplatz, and that was just a few months after Jacques Rivette’s legendary Out 1, which is 13 hours long. [laughs] There was a cut-down version of Out 1 that was five and a half hours, but I think 13 hours is the full length, and they screened it at the Museum of the Moving Pictures here in New York, and they did press screenings over three days. And by the end it was kind of like we had been POWs together, who maybe didn’t know each other or didn’t like each other before, but were huddled, sharing food, and making these kinds of inside jokes. Yes, I do like long movies. I mean, I kind of like that feeling of getting absorbed and completely entering into the movie’s reality. But I don’t think I only like long movies.Sullivan’s Travels (1941,100% Tomatometer)I guess I would say, again, to choose among a lot of different ones, I love Sullivan’s Travels. I love a lot of Preston Sturges movies. It’s a movie about movies, and I just think it’s just so funny. I love it. The first five minutes of the movie are among the funniest five minutes ever. Like when he’s in the studio boss’s office; it’s the fastest dialogue. [laughs] How they managed to do that scene, it’s just flying.McCabe &amp; Mrs. Miller (1971,88% Tomatometer)There’s always an Altman movie on the list. Currently I think it’s probably McCabe and Mrs. Miller. I love westerns; there are actually a lot of westerns I could add. A sort of deconstructed western. Altman’s one of my favorite directors and someone even whose lesser work I find really fascinating and had an intelligence about filmmaking and also about human behavior that’s kind of unmatched.The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance (1962,97% Tomatometer)In the number five position, I would — again, choosing among many possible candidates — I think I would put The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance. There are John Ford westerns that are more picturesque, that are more sweeping, but that’s a movie that distills an idea of history and depicts — granted, in a kind of mythologizing way, but in a very astute and complicated way — the process of historical change in the American West. That movie is just fascinating to me, and it has sort of a dissertation’s worth of ideas in it, but they’re so well embedded and dramatized, and the performances are so interesting. Jimmy Stewart, to me, is such an interesting and in some ways misunderstood actor, because when you see him, he’s so angry so much of the time. In Winchester ’73 and even in It’s A Wonderful Life. When he comes back to the house in that movie, he says, “Why do we have all these kids anyway?” and he’s just furious.Next, Scott talks about the differences between being a critic in print and on TV, as well as what the new At the Movies will be like.RT: I wanted to ask you a little bit about the new show. What can we expect from you guys? Is it just two guys talking about movies, or is there a new format?AS: The format is basically the same. It’s two guys, two critics, basically two writers, talking about movies. What we’re hoping is that it will be really idea-driven. There are a lot of places — including Rotten Tomatoes — but also a lot of shows on television where you can find out about movies. By the time people get to the show, they know the movies that are out there, and we’re figuring what they want it is to hear someone say something interesting about these movies and hear people arguing, not necessarily in the sense of quarreling, but in the sense of engaging each other’s ideas and opinions about these movies. What we’re hoping is that the show will be structured and driven by what we think is most interesting and what are the sharpest and most interesting arguments that we have. Sometimes that means that when there’s not a lot to say about a movie, we’ll deal with it pretty quickly, and when there’s more to say, we’ll try to open it up and talk about it more. Within the format — you know, it’s a half-hour show, it’s interrupted by commercials, we try to cover as much as we can, and it’s going to be about these five movies a week — but within that, we’re trying to vary the length of the segments, to mix it up so that it’s always the liveliest discussion and the most noteworthy movie that’s being talked about the most.We’re also using the DVD segment not so much to focus on new releases on DVD as to use what we’ve been talking about on the show as a way in to talking about some of our favorite movies from the past. In the first show, we talked about movies that were important to us as kids who would someday grow up to be critics; in an upcoming show, we’re reviewing some lame current romantic comedies, so the DVD segment, we picked a couple of our favorite classic romantic comedies. Just to give it a kind of breadth and range.Also, for every show, we’re doing a web video exclusive, where we kind of extend the discussion, where we take something we were talking about in the show and open it up in a more informal, uninterrupted conversation. You know, in an upcoming show when we’re doing The Informant!, the new Steven Soderbergh movie, Soderbergh is such an interesting director and he’s done so many different kinds of things that we spend some time talking about him and his career and our favorite and less favorite of his movies in a way you couldn’t on the show, because you just don’t have the time. That feels worth doing and we think viewers will be interested in seeing that online.RT: How long have you been doing TV? And what was the biggest challenge in terms of getting your ideas across while not diluting what you say in your print reviews?AS: I think there’s a kind of streamlining and simplifying that has to happen on TV, because TV is very linear. You know, when you’re writing something, you can refer back to something a few paragraphs earlier, or you can write a very complex, nuanced sentence with a lot of allusions buried in it, or if something doesn’t make sense, people can go back and read a sentence again. On TV, it is all coming and going very quickly, so you have to simplify. Also, what’s fun about doing it with a partner, with Michael Phillips, is that there’s a degree of spontaneity and surprise and playing off each other. You know, it’s different. When you’re writing, you’re just inside your own head and having maybe imaginary arguments with people [laughs], but it’s not quite the same. So there’s a kind of improvisational quality to it that is really fun, but you have to be on your toes in front of the camera. It’s not taped live, obviously, but we want that quality of spontaneity and real conversation. When you’re writing, you know, you can get up and pace around, and go get a snack, and read some blogs, or whatever it is that you’re going to do to clear your head, but with TV there’s that immediacy. I’m finding it fun. There’s definitely a new set of skills to learn and communication techniques, but it feels like a new way of trying out what I’m interested in doing anyway.RT: Was your substitute gig on the Ebert &amp; Roeper show your first extensive TV experience?AS: I’d done guest spots on Charlie Rose, and interviewed on various TV shows, but I hadn’t ever sat in a regular host’s chair. I think I learned a lot doing it then, just even in terms of how you sit, and how you look at the camera, and what you do with your face, and how you convey energy on television. I feel like I still have a lot to learn from that. I’ve done a lot of video for the Times’ website, and that has been extremely helpful, too, just in terms of thinking about how to take ideas that you might express one way on the page and get them across on camera, talking to someone.RT: Where do you see the state of contemporary film criticism?AS: I think it’s in a very exciting state. I mean, I think that I don’t actually lament the supposed demise of a single, authoritative critical voice. I think that the idea of critics having authority has always sort of been a misguided one. Critics obviously have to know their stuff and express themselves well, and bring a certain seriousness and expertise, but I think that criticism is one of those things that, people who do it professionally are also doing something that everyone does. It’s an activity, and it’s a communal activity, and it’s often sort of a messy and chaotic and argumentative one, and I think we’re in a very good time for the activity of criticism. It’s a very hard time for people who are trying to make a living at it, and I think that’s really too bad. But I think the proliferation of voices — sometimes, you know, somewhat obnoxious voices — is a great thing, and what I really like about it is that it makes what was always kind of a virtual, imaginary conversation that you were having with your readers an actual one. So it’s not as if I send out my copy and wonder what people thought of it; I hear, and I hear very quickly.Check back next week for Michael Phillips’ Five Favorite Films.For more Five Favorite Films articles, check our archive.","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"TV, social, deadpool, police, Superheroes, marvel, Awards, BET, Marvel, wars, Film, TV, renewed, Hallmark","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/AOScott.jpg","slug":"five-favorite-films-with-ao-scott"},{"id":"47508860565934","title":"Five Favorite Films with John Malkovich","content":"Five Favorite Filmsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Five Favorite Films with John MalkovichThe star of Disgrace recommends five movies for fim buffs.by RT Staff | September 15, 2009 |  CommentsActor, producer, and director John Malkovich has had a long career spanning several decades, beginning on stage in high school. Malkovich, who went on to be a founding member of the Steppenwolf Theatre in Chicago, has also earned praise for several of his film roles, including supporting turns in 1984’s Places in the Heart and 1993’s In the Line of Fire.This week, Malkovich stars in a new independent film, Disgrace, which opens in limited release on Friday. Based on a critically-acclaimed novel by J.M. Coetzee, Disgrace is the story of a professor in post-Apartheid South Africa who becomes embroiled in controversy when he enters into an affair with a mixed-race student of his. When we asked John for his Five Favorite Films, he responded by saying, “I can’t really say that I have five favorite films; somehow my mind just doesn’t work that way.” As an alternative, we present to you John Malkovich’s list of five recommendations he would make to any cinephile:The Battle of Algiers (1966,99% Tomatometer)Directed by Gillo Pontecorvo, it’s a taut and very telling film about the French/Algerian war of independence, concentrating on the battle of the Kasbah in the capital city of Algiers. A brilliant, prescient, and very humane film with very few “professional” actors. In black and white.Abraham’s Valley (1993, 86% Tomatometer)Directed by the Portugese master Manoel de Oliveira. Mr. de Oliveira made his first film, a silent one in 1929, and is probably shooting something [now]. A very idiosyncratic and unique filmmaker with a very singular sense of storytelling and pace. This is his adaptation of Flaubert’s Madame Bovary. It has probably my favorite last line in cinema – along with “Forget it, Jake. It’s Chinatown.” – which is, “No one is so good as I, in pretending life is beautiful.”Night Train to Munich (1940, 92% Tomatometer)In black and white, made in 1940 by Sir Carol Reed, who of course also did The Third Man, Odd Man Out, Oliver!, etc. Night Train to Munich is a witty and quite gripping thriller. Intricate and romantic with very amusing performances.The Conformist (1970, 100% Tomatometer)I had the great honor of being at a screening of the restored print in Los Angeles some years ago. I think this is Bertolucci’s masterpiece, though one could argue he made several of them. Ravishingly beautiful visuals, terrific performances, and among the most liquid and complex camerawork ever. A study of fascism, based on the book by Alberto Moravia.Elite Squad (2008, 53% Tomatometer)By Jose Padilha. A film about the elite police unit charged with combating crimes in the favelas. Very original, tight, often grimly comic and very informative.For more Five Favorite Films, check our archive.","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"Shudder, Crackle, Tarantino, Apple, USA, ghosts","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/JohnMalkovich.jpg","slug":"five-favorite-films-with-john-malkovich"},{"id":"47508862237124","title":"Five Favorite Films with Betty White","content":"Five Favorite Filmsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Five Favorite Films with Betty WhiteThe iconic television star discusses her favorite films, working on Golden Girls, and the art of the conversation.by Jen Yamato | June 16, 2009 |  CommentsIn this week’s romantic comedy The Proposal, Betty White steals scenes as Grandma Annie, the spunky, slightly daffy grandmother who welcomes her grandson (Ryan Reynolds) and his boss — an uptight exec who has secretly blackmailed him (Sandra Bullock) into marriage — into her Alaskan home. (Naturally, hilarity ensues, most often when White is onscreen befuddling her future granddaughter-in-law.)Rotten Tomatoes was honored to sit down with Betty White to discuss her Five Favorite Films (hint: she’s a romantic at heart) and to revisit her incredible career in Hollywood — an impressive body of work that includes hosting her own self-titled talk show, her own variety show, creating iconic characters like “The Happy Homemaker” Sue Ann Nivens on The Mary Tyler Moore Show and Rose Nylund on The Golden Girls, and winning five Emmys — all before jumping headfirst into movie roles. Read on to learn Betty White’s Five Favorite Films and hear her insights into great television writing, silly moments on the set of The Proposal, and her take on the art of the conversation.Naughty Marietta (1935,N/A)I don’t think I’d be in this business if it wasn’t for Naughty Marietta, with Nelson Eddy and Jeanette MacDonald. I was 14 and I was SO in love with Nelson Eddy I thought it was the end of the world, and I didn’t just like Jeanette MacDonald, I was Jeanette MacDonald! You know, at 14. And at 14 I also thought, Nelson Eddy married somebody and I thought he needed a much younger woman. I think I saw Naughty Marietta 48 times. I wasn’t even interested in show business until then; I did school plays and that kind of thing, but I hadn’t thought of it as a career until I got hooked.Out of Africa (1985, 63% Tomatometer)I think it’s one of the love stories of the world. The music — I think it’s the most evocative score in the world, it’s just so beautiful.Lost Horizon (1937, 100% Tomatometer)Lost Horizon is also one of my top, top favorites… it’s a James Hilton book; Frank Capra made the first one and they remade it. It’s set up in the Andes, where Shangri-La is a valley unlike any place on earth. Jane Wyatt and Ronald Coleman starred in the first one. Again, it’s terribly romantic; I’m a romantic nut!The Bridges of Madison County (1995,90% Tomatometer)Clint Eastwood and Meryl Streep; again, I thought it was a love story where you cared about [the characters]… I guess it just boils down to chemistry, Jennifer; when they deal you in, you get involved.Rotten Tomatoes: I love this romantic streak! One of my favorite films is also a romance: The Umbrellas of Cherbourg.Oh, yes, it’s beautiful! There’s something about that film, Out of Africa, and even Bridges of Madison County — it’s that lovely, warm love story with a sadness at the end that just stays with you. [These are movies I watch over and over] or get the DVD when you want a fix; you put it in and just relax and enjoy.Kramer vs. Kramer (1979, 88% Tomatometer)It was seeing Meryl Streep for the first time, seeing that performance. You don’t often see somebody just come out from the screen, grab you by the shoulders, and bring you back in. I think it was that that got me about it.Next: Betty White shares silly moments on the set of The Proposal, reminisces about The Golden Girls, The Mary Tyler Moore Show, and her own unscripted talk show, and examines the art of the conversation[rtimage]MapID=1206888&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=3&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]In The Proposal we get to see you in a really fun role; Grandma Annie is sort of a naughty grandmother.Betty White: Well, she’s not naughty, she’s just a very strong lady who wants to get these two people together. She’s the only one in the beginning who sees the good side of Margaret (Sandra Bullock) in the film. We had such fun doing it… from a personal standpoint, you don’t get parts like that very often, at this age, and we had such a good time. When I heard Sandra Bullock and Ryan Reynolds were going to do it, and the chemistry was just such fun, it was like going to a party.You can tell by watching the film that the whole cast has good chemistry.BW: Mary Steenburgen, Craig T. Nelson — well, Craig is the funniest man on two feet. I had seen him on Coach, but I’d never thought of him as that funny. We finally got to the point — we just hit each other funny — so we couldn’t ever lock eyes. We’d be talking to each other and I’d have to look past him, and he’d have to look past me, because if we’d ever caught each others’ eye we’d just break up, and we couldn’t explain it! It was just silly, but it was fun.Speaking of fun, I think members of my generation know you best for your role as Rose on the long-running sitcom The Golden Girls, which coincidentally all of the journalists were just watching here while waiting to speak with you.BW: You’re kidding! You haven’t heard enough of us yet, God bless your heart! The Golden Girls was such good writing, it holds up. I think so many of these things go right back to the writing; Golden Girls is a classic example of that, that and The Mary Tyler Moore Show. We were like four points on a compass. Our characters were all so different but we had plenty to do in every show. The writers would throw a situation in the middle of the table and the audience would wait to see how each character reacted to it. Made it fun to do.[rtimage]MapID=1206888&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=13&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]I loved the show growing up. That and Mama’s Family, too. But your career started way before those shows; you did radio and even hosted your own television show…BW: Oh, there were five “Betty White” shows altogether! I started five and a half hours a day, six days a week, ad-libbing with no script. That’s like going to television college, because whatever happens, happens on camera! You’ve got to handle it. So I’ve always been grateful for that.Back then, how difficult was it as a female performer to get to that level in Hollywood?BW: What was really hard was that on my first series, Life with Elizabeth, I was also the producer. And for a woman to be in the production side of it was very unusual. But again, it was a great experience — and sheer blind luck. [Laughs]Also, I had an NBC half-hour talk show in 1954 where I’d sing a couple of songs and then interview a couple of people. When you’ve been in the business for 60 years, you’ve done a little bit of everything! I did commentary on the Rose Parade for 20 years. It’s just been a lovely go. But I didn’t do movies, I was always in television. Just in the last five years I’ve done movies, and it’s a whole different ball game. With television, you do it, you go home and watch it, and it’s done. With movies, you go and you work, and then it disappears, and then a year later it comes back after it’s edited and you talk about it![rtimage]MapID=1206888&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=4&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Given your experience as an on-the-fly interviewer, what advice could you give me from your days on that five and a half hour interview show?BW: I’m a baboon to give advice to anybody, Jennifer. [Smiles] But I think the biggest problem sometimes that you have in being interviewed is that people will ask you a question, but they’re so busy thinking about the next question that they never hear what you say. The good interviewers do what you’ve done, what Jack Parr and Johnny Carson did — Jack Parr maybe even better than Johnny; they’ll listen to the answer, and find something in the answer. They won’t go where they were going to go next; they’ll follow that through and go down a whole other alley. And that’s when an interview gets interesting — both for the people involved and the audience.Of course; it’s more conversational, more natural.BW: That’s right. As happens in a conversation!And that makes a lot more sense for a live, on-air interview, for an audience to be able to watch a conversation unfold.BW: But now with TV shows they do a “pre-interview.” Somebody will call, and they’ll ask you all the questions that you used to answer on the show, and when you get to the actual interview the host will go down those questions. So all the spontaneity is gone. When I was doing my talk show, I wouldn’t talk to the people before the show, because otherwise they’d leave their interview out in the hall! It was more fun that way.Catch Betty White opposite Ryan Reynolds and Sandra Bullock in The Proposal, directed by Anne Fletcher (Step Up, 27 Dresses), in theaters this Friday!

Below, find out which romantic classics and modern films Bai Ling names among her Five Favorite Films and read on for our in-depth conversation about her work, her life, and her pursuit of happiness as we peel back the layers of the force of nature known as Bai Ling. Click to go directly to our interview with Bai Ling.&nbsp;Casablanca (1942, 96% Tomatometer)Mentally, Casablanca connects with my world. It’s very romantic, about giving and testing, and trusting and loving… And there’s the romantic music. Everything is [in line with] my tastes of romance. It’s also about an unfulfilled love, which makes everything more beautiful because you can’t have it. It’s just human nature. If you have it — you see the person, you see the romance — then the story becomes practical, like reality. But because it’s unfulfilled, it’s always a fantasy because we add so much of our own beauty, and romance, and poetry, into it.Also, Casablanca is about the sacrifice of giving love. Real love, I think, is unconditional; you give your love away to love somebody. Otherwise it’s not real love, it’s possessive, it’s ownership.Traffic (2000, 92% Tomatometer)I like movies like Gone with the Wind, or The Unbearable Lightness of Being, but I’ll actually choose Traffic. When I did not speak the language, I watched the movie sex, lies, and videotape, and I didn’t understand; I thought American movies were always blockbusters, hard movies, with action and male leads. But that film was like pieces of life, pieces of dreams. I did a movie called Nipples, based on my dreams, with different characters coming together…very sexy, and very modern, and very open. I think that’s something that’s very contemporary and I didn’t think a lot of American directors were [that way]. [Steven Soderbergh]’s mind is very modern. I like Traffic because he shot it like a documentary, but there’s mystery, there’s modernity. There’s an unknown danger in it. When the characters are crossing the border — I just like the momentum of life, when people cross each other, when lives cross each other. In that moment of life, what can happen.In the Mood For Love (2001, 88% Tomatometer)Wong Kar-Wai is one of my favorite directors from Asia. I’m a natural romantic. I feel like his movies — slow motion, the momentum of people, even a clock running — are non-traditional filmmaking. Normal movies [have scenes set up] like, I talk to you; you talk to me. Those kinds of movies are boring to me, but his films are advanced. He’s also extremely private and personal. His stories are all about innocent love, sort of like teenage love. How people need; how you love. They’re very, very romantic. When I talk about it, I feel this slow motion romance, high heels, the mystery of women, sexy, walking by. I recognize things in my soul that are unspoken; a lot of those longings, and unfulfilled romances, and dreams within [Wong Kar-Wai’s] films — they make me feel that.Red Corner (1997, 33% Tomatometer)I’d like to pick Red Corner, because Bai Ling’s in it. [Laughs] Actually, I choose it because out of all the movies that have Asian leading characters, it’s the first to have the most feminine — the most brilliant, modern, intelligent, female character ever in a Hollywood film that portrayed Asian characters. In all other films, it’s a mystery, romance, or kung fu; but here, I played a lawyer, a contemporary woman. And she has a romance with this sex symbol — Richard Gere. That combination is really rare on the silver screen, in Hollywood.I play a lawyer and I fall in love; I’m under a Communist government and helping a foreign man. There’s also a lot of unspoken love underneath. I would sacrifice my life for him. She gives on many, many levels; she’s not only tough and sexy, but there’s intelligence behind it, and a total giving of unconditional love for this man for whom she would die and do anything for. There’s a beauty to her giving up everything for a man whom she’s helping while she’s under danger and pressure from the government — choosing between a country’s love, and being in danger of being destroyed and never seeing this lover that she would do anything for. It’s extremely beautiful and romantic to my heart and my soul, and I have a fantastic and beautiful relationship with my co-star, Richard Gere. So that’s one of my favorite movies forever, because I’m so close to it. These two [characters] are giving their lives to each other, and that love must remain hidden on the surface of the court system; the modern world is harsh. I like that under the harshness there’s a romance, and that romance is so free and so true.Do you still remember what it was like when you were filming?When I talk about it, it’s like I’m there! I feel emotional, like it’s going to make me cry; because I gave my life to the character, and to Richard Gere’s character. For me, it’s real; it’s not acting. And we had this beautiful, loving relationship just like in the movie. You know how sometimes when you’re in love for a lifetime, you remember a one-night stand? It’s not about the length, it’s about the impact and how pure, and how right, that person was to your soul and to your heart in that moment.Roman Holiday (1953, 98% Tomatometer)It’s a very personal choice because when I came to America from mainland China, I was an actress, but I never knew about Hollywood. I had heard of Hollywood but we didn’t have access to see Hollywood movies. A photographer was taking pictures of me and said, “You remind me of this actress named Audrey Hepburn.” I said, “Who is that?” He said, “Bai Ling, you have to watch her films,” and he found me Roman Holiday. That was the first Hollywood movie I’d ever seen. And it’s still one of my favorites, because it first introduced me to Hollywood — beautiful, romantic, very graceful, and elegant. I would like to remake it — I hope some director can help me, maybe Steven Soderbergh or Wong Kar-Wai. [Laughs] What I remember about those old Hollywood films is that when a leading lady and a leading man meet, they don’t have to say anything; you already know they’re in love. You root for them; you want them to be together. That’s the magic of Hollywood. I think somehow today we’ve lost a little bit of it, and you don’t care as much if two characters get together. But Roman Holiday makes you smile, makes your heart smile, makes your heart sing for these two people. Gregory Peck is gentle and elegant, the kind of tall leading man that I like.I think we should remake the film. Everybody in America, in Asia, and in Europe, would appreciate it. The beautiful, pure, romantic story — I wish I would play a role like that, because I have a romantic soul. I’d like to bring that purity to the audience, to have their fantasy fulfilled.&nbsp;Check out Bai Ling’s Five Favorites when she sat down with Current! (and yes, we realize that she added in Slumdog Millionaire with our friends at Current)Next: Bai Ling bares all in our no-holds barred interview!Living one’s life in the spotlight is a daunting undertaking for most, but few celebrities set themselves up for negativity as bravely or unapologetically as Bai Ling. After making her Hollywood breakthrough opposite Richard Gere in 1998’s Red Corner, the Chinese-American actress has since racked up an impressive number of credits, zooming breathlessly through mainstream roles and independent films alike. Yet, Ling has become best known in some circles for her off-screen persona, her antics on the red carpet, and the sometimes strange (and wonderfully frank) sayings she shares with press and on her candid personal blog, Naked Seduction.RT sat down with the Crank: High Voltage star to talk movies over lattes in a Beverly Hills cafe and to learn more about the woman behind the persona. We learned that Ling’s brand of celebrity comes at a cost; the Chinese-born actress willingly lives her life in the open, channeling her very existence as a gift unto the world, a candidness that often invites the harshest kinds of criticism. And Ling is not without her moments of vulnerability, as we discovered when she shared her sadness at being exiled from her homeland following the release of Red Corner, or when she revealed the difficulty of keeping a smile when critics attack her in public.Despite all that, Bai Ling soldiers on by living life on her own terms (and by enjoying the hell out of her work, which includes appearing in this week’s Crank: High Voltage opposite Jason Statham and in Taylor Hackford’s upcoming Love Ranch, opposite Helen Mirren). Read on for our candid interview.[rtimage]MapID=1197533&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=14&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Bai Ling: I feel like I’m not in this world; I feel like I am here, but every day I’m living in my own world. I don’t read anything, I don’t really watch anything, I’m in my own world, with the spirit and the soul of the universe, that have been given to me. I think that through my blog and my movies, in my own way I give a little bit of this to other people’s soul, people who forget about life, forget about romance and love, every day they’re trying just to make money and be successful. You wake up and you have tons of money, and you’re bitter; but the blue sky, and the birds and clouds and the romance are passing by you. A lot of people say how rich I am, I have a house, I have land. I say, I am the richest person in the world, do you know what I have? The universe.It seems like very few people would embrace something like that.BL: I’m not just saying that; I live that. And I’m innocently in it, and so happy; I’m like a little girl. Today I opened my curtains and it was sunny, and suddenly I just smiled. To me every day is a new day, a new moment in life, there’s no time…society is time. We’re always late, we’re always rushed, we’re always leaving, but in nature there’s no time. When there’s no time, there’s no hurry. There’s no agenda, there’s no purpose. You just [share the moment], you smile, you talk, you have coffee, you share that moment.When you have an agenda, you don’t see what nature gives. When a moment comes, [like when] the sun sets and [creates] light sculptures… for me, I enjoy that I saw it. I saw it! They’re more real than a real thing you can touch. Because it’s for your soul, it’s food. And that’s what gives you the beauty and the romance and the delightfulness of the spirit, and you can basically affect others. That’s my gift, I feel. I talk to you, and other people read it — truthfully — if they allow themselves to not be judgmental about what Bai Ling says and not criticize me, they will see I’m not here to talk about myself; I’m sharing with you what I see that people don’t notice, but that’s there everyday.It’s the appreciation of the small things that many people have a hard time embracing.BL: It’s like breathing; without breathing, there’s no other thing. You’re alive, can you imagine? What a gift! We don’t see it. Like air — whether you notice it or not, it’s there, serving you every moment. How generous, to just give for free. And we take it for granted. But when someone takes your breath away, you go ah, you were right! You don’t know how beautiful we have it. I think that’s the most valuable thing we have.I just hope that you can help in a way — media, how they portray me; they don’t understand me at all. Or they prefer it that way; I know how magazines want to sell. If Bai Ling’s sophisticated and elegant, there’s nothing really to talk about. If she’s crazy, or her nipples are always out, there’s something to trash and to talk about and to laugh at. But, I understand the magazines’ relationship with Hollywood; I accept that I’m an actress — and I’ve said, I have eight little spirits within me — one of them is crazy, she’s courageous, she’s out there. She enjoys showing off, because she thinks she’s beautiful; she is! And I’m ok if you trash me. I dare you to trash me, and I also dare you to celebrate me. Why only one way? Why not embrace day and night? People don’t know the darkness, the nighttime, how pure and valuable it is. Without the darkness, without pure black, you’d never see the stars and moon. You can’t ignore it. And those things have a higher purpose.[rtimage]MapID=1145402&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=5&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]I think you’re very courageous to live like this; the nature of it leaves you open to both good and bad, and most other celebrities are very guarded.BL: People tell me, “Don’t trust journalists,” but if I don’t trust, I can’t talk. What would be the fun for you? Sometimes I get trashed because I’m so open; it’s like saying “I love you,” and getting slapped. It’s kind of sad sometimes. I’m so open, so pure, I give you love, and a person steps on me… even then, you have to dare to love. Otherwise, why live? So therefore, I have to be loyal to myself, and I have to be truthful. Hopefully if I have ten interviews, just one person grabs it, and I’d be happy. I think it’s a rare thing that few people can appreciate it, because they’re too busy being brainwashed by society, by the magazines, by other people’s views, they forgot to have their own views, their own voice, and their own talents. I think everybody’s a star and a magician, but you give that up to follow others. I think if you’re loyal to that, you will like me, because you’ll know what I’m talking about. Otherwise, you won’t understand me, and you’ll think, “She’s out of her mind!”Did you always have this philosophy?BL: I think when I was in China, I grew up like a wild animal and adopted a human form. And I don’t know how to function because I’m so free. I’m a totally free spirit. When I say everything it seems wrong, because my mind functions differently, like I’m running a different program. I was constantly writing apology letters when I grew up — to my parents, to my school teacher, to my army leader, to my government — and I thought about it, what did I do wrong? I’m only having fun playing with my own thoughts. My own soul, my own structure…I think society is formatted, like with time, systems, boundaries. I’d think, one day I’ll rule the world, and the world will be so much more beautiful, because I’d abort boundaries that divide people, create violence, and pit people against each other.I believe in the universe, in nature. Like my name; Bai is the simplest character, it means white. In writing, it’s the simplest character you can have. It means white and purity. Part of me is childlike, simple, pure, white. Ling, I just learned, in the complicated Chinese character, is like lightning. It’s like a light storm. It’s intriguing, it’s so dangerous, and it changes… I think I’m basically the circle of life; I’m like a child, but I have the wisdom of the universe.I’m not out to get something, I just want to share who I am. There’s no agenda. I talk about my nipples — I think they are beautiful! And people say, she’s doing this for what? I’m doing this for nothing. I’m totally being who I am. A lot of people don’t understand. They’re living in a shell, bitter, trying to trash others. Why don’t you come out of life, compliment somebody, give them love, and say something that you know in your heart is right. For me, I believe that being Bai Ling, in this body and soul, is a gift. And this gift is not for me to keep. You only live once. I feel like the only brilliant, most beautiful thing you can be, is to be the pure extreme of who you are. No matter who you are. You have to go extreme to show it.&nbsp;Next: Bai Ling on what she needs to win an Oscar, how she chooses her roles, and how she nabbed her role in Taylor Hackford’s Love Ranch, opposite Helen Mirren[rtimage]MapID=1145402&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=6&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Let’s talk about your acting. How do you view your career and your talents?BL: I’m really a genius. I’m so talented. But the stage and the road of opportunities I have are not equal to my talent. Dumplings — I won four awards. It’s just magic. If you give me the stage, I’ll make magic for you. Therefore, I hope directors and producers can see it. I just want to give the gift; I know I have it. They talk about winning the [Academy Award] — I just need the vehicle. Not for winning, but to show you the brilliance that I can do. Like Sean Penn, my friend. All the brilliant actors say, “if I had the vehicle, I would be there.” Just to show people the talent that you have. The award is to celebrate; they’re not important to me, but of course it’s important that because of that, people would give me more opportunities, a stage to shine your talent. That’s what I want, not the awards.We all have the special potential that only you have, nobody can do better. But you have to find that. There are people stuck their whole lives because they want to be movie stars, they want to make money and be famous. Money and fame are not the same as doing it to shine; those are the things people reward you with. If you hold on to [those things], you would be miserable.You seem very fearless, in life and in your work.BL: I really, really love what I do. I’m so daring; if a director asks me, Bai Ling, jump, I would jump. I’m not bulls***ing; I do everything for real. I do action myself. You see Crank 2; they hang me in a car, and you’ll see the car crash. At the same time when the car almost hits my body, they lifted me up. If they screwed up, my head would be gone. I have a stunt double, but I do it myself. People don’t know how hard I work. How much I give. I give everything. I was shooting Dumplings, and it was 100-something degrees, in a little apartment building with no air conditioning, and the meat was rotting… But I loved that character — so daring, so bold, so sexy. She tested me, tortured me, teased me.Is it hard to deal with the negativity inherent in the entertainment business? How do you deal, knowing that you put yourself out there for all to accept, or not accept?BL: I’m very proud that I did everything by myself. Nobody supported me; I didn’t rely on anybody, even my family. Sometimes I feel vulnerable, when people don’t understand me and try to trash me instead of celebrate me. I did everything — came from a foreign country, no money, no language, no nobody… and I made it, because purely I trusted. But sometimes I may get sad because people trash me and use harsh words, and wish for the worst. But I don’t want to be afraid…I still feel like a light, innocent, pure spirit, because I think in your heart there’s a candle light, and I have to protect that flame of fire, because it’s so fragile. Wherever you talk to people, wherever the darkness comes to you, you always imagine this little flame of candle light that you have to protect. If you feel it’s dark, then you move away. You don’t fight, because that’s when the light’s going to die for sure. Whenever you feel the shadows you close your eyes, smile, and leave, and don’t take it with you. But I’m a human being; those things hurt me, because I’m human and I have feelings. I can’t take the negativity because it’s a shadow on my soul; I’m here for a higher purpose. I have to protect myself. I just hope people see the beauty…[rtimage]MapID=1197533&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=8&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Years ago you went through a hard time when Chinese officials took offense to your participation in a film that criticized the government. How did you get through that time?BL: Yeah, after Red Corner. But now it’s all solved. I went through a hard time, and I learned that politics are so much more complicated than my comprehension. I don’t like politics; I think most of the people are benefiting from the power. But also I learned there are consequences for my actions; I did Red Corner, I thought it was a brilliant woman that I was playing, but I got punished. So it’s kind of ironic; you learn things about the world that you just have to accept, and overcome your sadness to understand the other part. To understand China, which I did — I apologized, because that’s my country and I have to go back. It was a hard, hard experience for me, but I’m glad I went through it, just to learn and experience life in a harsh way.Talking about the roles you choose, you seem to go for consistently strong and sensual female characters, but has it been difficult to do this as an Asian in Hollywood?BL: In Love Ranch, there had been no Asian roles. It’s a true story about the first legal brothel in America, in Nevada. The role I got was written for a twenty-year-old white girl with big boobs, long hair, from Vegas. Her name is Samantha and she is the highest earning prostitute in that ranch. She’s not Asian, she was white. I auditioned with Taylor Hackford; I got the role with this audition. I’m so excited to see the movie. Helen Mirren and Joe Pesci [co-star], I’m so happy to work with both of them, and Taylor Hackford — I’m just really, really grateful that he gave me this role. He changed it. My character’s so arrogant; so mysterious. Helen Mirren was so nice to me. By the end, [Taylor Hackford] gave me a postcard with a note that said, “Bai Ling, you have no clue what a fascinating Samantha you created.”Do you improvise very often? You’ve said you don’t act, you just live your roles.BL: I think most brilliant actors are very intelligent. Like Helen Mirren, for example: when she played the Queen, the choices she made. How subtle; how brilliant. It’s about the intelligence behind the artist. You know the character. It’s how much you understand life. I assume, I think, most actors are intelligent people.[rtimage]MapID=1165830&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=17&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]You’ve worked with many notable directors, including Richard Kelly; I was at the infamous Cannes premiere when Southland Tales debuted, which you had a role in. How did you reflect back on that experience given the reaction critics had to the film?BL: I don’t judge people’s films like that; I think a person’s artistic journey is like a person’s life journey. It’s up and down, naturally. Natural growth is up and down. I think that the moment an artist goes through is the perfect moment that artist needs to go through, and for him in the moment, it’s the masterpiece he can give. I don’t really criticize or judge others; I find the beauty. For example, my own character is a brilliant character, and just for that I’m satisfied. And Justin Timberlake’s character — look how brilliant it is, what he created! I think this format is art, it’s not perfection of things. Art is supposed to be moving; film is a moving image.I think critics have format in their minds. Of course, they’re brilliant and they know what is good or bad, they watch everything and they know every movie. You have comparison, you have knowledge. But I think sometimes you have to nourish an artist, it’s their journey. You can’t criticize Picasso’s blue period — that’s what made him, that’s his journey. It’s like the four seasons; you can’t say raining or snowing or too much sun is bad. If you think something is not an artist’s best, you can nourish them. You can say, that’s what I don’t like, and I understand why.You have also worked with Luc Besson. What do you remember of that experience?BL: You know what I learned from him? That human beings’ potential is unlimited. Because I learned French. I thought, how can I learn French, when I only had two weeks? I worked so hard; I worked until 12, and practiced my French until 2am.You have a lot of projects coming up, and your career of late has included a lot of independent films. Is that all part of a deliberate career choice, or is there just a lack of roles available in studio films?BL: I’m not planning or thinking too much. I think the roles just come my way. I had a lot of offers; like, last year I was working nonstop, from this set to that set. Sometimes I hadn’t even finished the script and I go. I feel like I’m lucky to be working and that I’m made offers. For me, it is work but it’s life; for example, one film takes me to Thailand, so I’ll go because it’s in Thailand. Another role I play because I like to play the role, and also because of the economy — and last year there weren’t a lot of films, and a lot of actors were not working, so I feel I’m lucky to be working.&nbsp;You can find Bai Ling on her personal blog, and catch her next in Crank: High Voltage, which opens nationwide this Friday.

He’salso an engaging conversationalist, full of insight on the key issues of theday, especially where the worlds of film, politics, and journalism collide.In Lurie’s latest film, Nothing But the Truth, Rachel Armstrong (KateBeckinsale), a reporter for a fictional Washington newspaper, is jailed afterrevealing the identity of Erica Van Doren (Vera Farmiga), a CIA agent who’smarried to a government official critical of a U.S. attack on Venezuela.Armstrong’s imprisonment takes a toll on her family life, while Van Doren andspecial prosecutor Patton Dubois (Matt Dillon) try to find the source of theleak. The film has a number of parallels to the real-life cases of Judith Millerand Valerie Plame, although Lurie says he was not trying to make a fictionalizedaccount of their stories. Rather, he wanted to make a thriller that examined thepersonal toll on these two women.In an interview with RT, Lurie not only waxed poetic on his favorite movies, healso discussed his approach to melding fact and fiction, and bemoaned thecurrent state of the mass media.&nbsp;All thePresident’s Men (1976, 100% Tomatometer)My number one favorite film is All the President’s Men, by [Alan]Pakula. All the President’s Men is a movie that has a very personalplace for me because it made me want to be a journalist, and then it made mewant to be a filmmaker. I think that it has a level of realism that’s reallyunparalleled in the world of thrillers which, inevitably, this film actually is.There are moments of naturalism in it that are extraordinary. I remember there’sone moment in it where [Robert] Redford is speaking to someone on the other linewho’s speaking Spanish. And he turns to the newsroom and says, “Does anyone herespeak English?” And then he laughs at himself and says, “I mean Spanish.” It hadthis very real feel, and I asked Bob whether or not it was improvised. He said,“No, it was actually planned. It was in the screenplay.” And there’s that sortof attentiveness to human mannerism and the frailty of our diction is ratherbeautiful in a film. It’s also supremely cast. There’s nothing about it I don’tlike.The 400 Blows (1959,100% Tomatometer)Les Quatre cents coups, better known as The400 Blows, a film that every man can relate to, because every man once wasa boy. It also bears the historical importance of being among the first films ofthe Nouvelle Vague, along with Breathless.[The last shot] is one of the few freeze fames that I think really works in the history offilm. When you do a freeze frame, you have the opportunity to find the exactshot that you want — no guessing. And [director Francois Truffaut] used it tothe full effect.The GodfatherPart II (1974, 98% Tomatometer)I would say [I like it] more so than [All the President’s Men], because I sortof luxuriated in the ambition of it all: telling two stories simultaneous fromdifferent eras. I don’t think that had ever been done before. It was also thefirst R-rated movie I saw. I saw that, and in the evening I saw Chinatown.So I saw two R-rated movies when I was 12 years old. That was quite a Christmasvacation. I remember quite distinctly that my dad and I also saw TheConversation, and we saw Lenny and The Towering Inferno.We saw all five movies over that Christmas vacation. That was really great.Paths of Glory(1957, 92% Tomatometer)Being a military historian, I was really blown away by the depiction that[Stanley] Kubrick had of trench life. But more importantly, I was immersed inthe moral quagmire that Col. Dax, played by Kirk Douglass, experienced in thefilm. There’s a moment when somebody looks down at a cockroach and says, “Yousee that cockroach?” He says something like, “In an hour, he’ll have morerelevance than I do.” And [another character] steps on the cockroach and says, “Not anymore.” Also, it was a very revolutionary shooting style that Kubrickpresented, with his long tracking shots and his use of close-up wide lenses thatI found very attractive. I first saw that film when I was a cadet at West Point.The Taking of Pelham One, Two, Three (1974, 100%)And the final film, since you limited me to a mere fiveâ€¦ that’s always thebiggest battle, not what will be number one, but what will be the last film on ashort list, because, you know, I would want to throw Pan’s Labyrinth onthere, or City of God, or Annie Hall, or Crimes andMisdemeanors. What I’m gonna put on is The Taking of Pelham One, Two,Three. You want to throw on your list something that is perhaps would becontrarian, or would be unusual. But to me, it’s the most entertaining crimefilm that I have ever seen. In a movie like that, involvement is the mostsignificant aspect in determining whether or not it’s successful. And you’resimply involved in this movie. It doesn’t have one movie star. There’s nobodyparticularly handsome or heroic in the film. You’re dealing with Walter Matthauand Marty Balsam and Robert Shaw. To me, it’s a delight. It’s interestingbecause a remake of it is gonna be coming out, I believe next year. I don’tbegrudge them. I think it’s an absolutely appropriate film to remake. As good asit was, it can be given a modern sensibility that can appeal to modernaudiences.Next: Rod Lurie talks about mass media, film distribution, and the politicsof awards season.[rtimage]MapID=1202524&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=5&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]It’s really interesting that you started off this whole thing with adiscussion of All the President’s Men, because that harkens back to atime when the general public thought of journalists as heroes, after Watergate.In the current climate in which Nothing But the Truth finds itself, notonly are newspapers folding left and right, but there’s a general distrust ofthe mainstream media?Rod Lurie: I think there is a good reason for that. Ascorporations started buying up newspapers and magazines and television stations,the need for profit overwhelmed every other aspect of that business, which wasnot the case years ago. The networks looked at news divisions as loss leaders,and they felt, “Really, no problem, as long as we got it right and we did well.”But the need for profit has forced all of these organizations to get the widestpossible audience that they can, and one of the ways to do it is to becomepartisan, to know that you’re gonna get all the Republicans to watch Fox, andthe vast majority of liberals are gonna watch MSNBC. As a result, thispartisanship has created a bias in the news. That bias, then angers a giganticsection of the population. It never was that Walter Cronkite had people whohated what he stood for. At the same time he was on, people didn’t hate JohnChancellor, or Harry Reasoner, or Howard K. Smith. But now, people really haveanimus toward Sean Hannity on the right, or Chris Matthews, say, on the left.They’re calling themselves journalists, and that’s not really what they are.They’re just more politically–oriented Andy Rooneys. The bias has found its wayinto the reporting of news.I’ll tell you what: I’m a lefty, so let me take away my own bias and attackthe New York Times for a second. If you look like something like thatstory about McCain having a mistress, or maybe she wasn’t a mistress, or theyweren’t sure what she was but they had to report somethingâ€¦In the old days, thisarticle never would have been published, because there wasn’t enough informationto report what they said were the facts. In today’s world, in order to feedtheir liberal readership, they plastered it on the front page.In Nothing But the Truth, there are a lot of parallels tothe cases of Judith Miller and Valerie Plame, but you twisted it a bit. When youheard those stories, what did you want to leave in, and what did you want totake out when making this film?RL: Whenever you make a movie, when it’s done, as afilmmaker, you never sit there and say, “Boy, I really got that right.” It’s, “Where did I screw up?” I’ve not confessed to anyone yet, but I really feel,after having read a lot of reviews of the film — which have been overwhelminglypositive — but those negative ones, every one of them make objection to thefact that we have quote-unquote “gotten wrong” the Judith Miller sorry, or thatwe have romanticized Judith Miller in some way, who by most people’s accounts isnot a glamorous figure. I never intended for this to be a roman a clefof Judy Miller versus Valerie Plame. What I wanted to do was to take theirsituation and put completely different characters in it, and see how differenthuman beings would behave in their situation. Of course, the story goes wildlyoff the Plame story. But I dug myself a bit of a hole having enough parallelsthat some of the lazier critics or some of the critics who have a political biascould use that against the film. It probably would have been wise of me not tomake it a CIA agent. I could have made it some other sort of national security[employee]. Maybe I shouldn’t have made her the wife of an ambassador. Mostpeople seem to seem to think it’s a high quality film, particularly for itsperformances, [but] they’ve been sidetracked by [the facts versus the fictions].[rtimage]MapID=1202524&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=2&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]With this film and The Contender, are you attempting toprovide a civics lesson — for lack of a better term — within the framework ofa thriller?RL: The answer to that is not just no, but unequivocally no.I don’t think I’m equipped enough to be giving anyone a civics lesson, or anykind of message. What I’m trying to do with both The Contender and NothingBut the Truth is to try to find entertaining stories that could come out of“what-if” situations with regard to things that really happen in the world. Forexample, in The Contender, a lot of people thought it was influenced bythe Monica Lewinsky scandal. In fact, it was influenced by me watching theClarence Thomas hearings and thinking, “Could you imagine if this person was awoman, and this woman had to answer all these sexual questions, and how un f—-ingcomfortable that would be?” It would be outrageous. And I thought, “That’s agood movie!”In the case of Nothing But the Truth, its real genesis was I wasgonna do an episode on a smaller lever of this for Commander in Chief.But I was fired, and Steven Bochco came in and killed it. So I really wanted todo a story of a journalist in jail for protecting their source. When Miller andPlame happened, I didn’t really follow their case, but I really wondered whatwould happen if these were both moms, and their kids went to school together andthey had some sort of connective tissue between them. Once I started thinkingabout that, the dominoes started falling into place. In fact, I wrote the endingfirst. I felt it was a very a very cool and interesting idea to put the leadcharacter into an impossible situation.As someone who came out of the world of journalism, what do you thinkthe future holds for newspapers?RL: I think with the print newspaper business, it isempirically obvious that it’s going the way of a disaster. I’ve noticed RollingStone has literally shrunk from its classic large size. The New YorkTimes has also physically shrunk, and there are layoffs left and right.It’s really a shame to me, because in 30 years my grandchildren probably won’tknow what a newspaper is. It’s rather stunning, and not good for thedissemination of news, because there seems to be a less thoughtful andcalculated amount of research and investigation done by purely internet-runpublications.Now, I love the internet. I’m on it all f—ing day long. I do read my printnewspaper in the morning, but all day long, I’m on the Internet. I love theaccess to information, I like to be able to find anything I want, but there area couple things you don’t find that you’d be able to find in a print newspaper.A newspaper will run a lead story that will go 2,500 to 3,000 words filled withinformation. Being able to physically hold the newspaper and read it over a cupof coffee at a diner lends itself to that. Stories of that length just don’tappear on the internet almost ever. It’s kind of a shame; I wish both worldscould coincide, but the internet has put a dagger in the heart of newspapers inmany ways.The Contender came out at the tail end of the Clintonadministration, and Nothing But the Truth is being released at the endof the Bush administration. Are you optimistic about the current state ofaffairs?RL: It seems to me that even the people on theright seem to be watching Obama perform in the transition, and they’re puttingtheir fingers on their chin and they’re saying, “You know, let’s give this guy achance. Maybe there is something here after all.” I think there is a tremendousamount of hopefulness. Now, I say this at the exact moment when the companythat’s releasing Nothing But the Truth, [Yari Film Group], last Fridaywent into chapter 11 bankruptcy. And I’m seeing my own film, as far as theimmediate distribution beyond this qualifying run get obliterated. And I’mseeing almost everyone at the Yari Film Group being fired, and these are peopleI really like. And it’s all part of the economy that George Bush sank us into.I’m hoping the confidence that the economy that the world seems to have for Obama is going to help our economy. Too late for my film, but people are havingfar worse problems.What is your next project?RL: Well, if I tell you, it’s gonna open up a line ofquestioning that’s gonna take foreverâ€¦. I’m remaking Straw Dogs.[rtimage]MapID=1202524&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=4&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]What’s the new take, given that a lot of what Sam Peckinpah was doingin that film is very much of its time?RL: It was very much of its time, because it was about aliberal anti-Vietnam guy who goes into an Irish town where he discovers he’scapable of as much brutality and violence as those who he’d had objection to. Icertainly admire Peckinpah’s movie, but anyone who watches it objectively — andcertainly if they take the mythology about Peckinpah out of it — would find itto be a film that’s more notorious than it is great.When you’re making a film, do you ever think of awards recognition?RL: I’ll be honest with you: the answer is yes, for Kate Beckinsale, and Vera Farmiga and Alan Alda in particular. I think the movie’simpeccably acted. And in fact, both of them {Beckinsale and Farmiga] are both inthe mix; the both got nominated for the Critic’s Choice Awards. Here’s thething: the awards at the end of the year are absolutely driven by the ability tofinance a very aggressive marketing campaign. In today’s New York Times,the ad for Revolutionary Road runs six full pages. That must be$500,000 to $750,000 ad in just the New York Times. The truth is theYari Film Group couldn’t get anyone to see the film. What can you do when you’rea tiny distributor with a high level film, and you’re sending out screeners, and[a critic] gets a screener for Nothing But the Truth, but at the sametime you’re getting Benjamin Button and Doubt and RevolutionaryRoad and Slumdog Millionaire. These movies just have majorfinancial clout behind them. I contacted about a third of the Broadcast filmcritics just to make sure they were looking at the film, and almost everyone Ispoke to said they had the screener but they hadn’t gotten around to it, whichmeant they weren’t gonna see it before they voted. And I asked them just to lookat the film, and they looked at the film and voted for the women. I feel that ifwe had a little more marketing power, we would have been more successful,because I really do believe, as many of the critics pointed out, that Kate andVera are absolutely on fire in this film.Want more Five Favorite Films?

This week Statham returns to one of his best-known characters in Transporter 3: Frank Martin, the black market driver with a “no questions asked” policy and a knack for kicking ass without leaving so much as a wrinkle on his tailored designer suits.While the first Transporter film (2002) was directed by acclaimed martial arts choreographer Corey Yuen, French director Louis Letterier took the helm for its follow-up, Transporter 2 (2005). This week newcomer Olivier Megaton takes the wheel for a bigger, faster Transporter 3, with Yuen returning to choreograph a leaner (and often shirtless) Statham in the film’s impressive action sequences.Rotten Tomatoes spoke to Statham about his favorite films of all time, which surprisingly include a few Paul Newman classics and unsurprisingly include a Bruce Lee film. As our conversation continued, we also discussed the different feel of Transporter 3, Corey Yuen’s diminished role in the film’s action scenes, and his recently announced film, The Expendables, in which he’ll star with action legends Sylvester Stallone (who will also write and direct) and Jet Li.&nbsp;Cool Hand Luke (1967, 100% Tomatometer)I saw it years ago, when my mom and dad made me watch it. And I was like, “This guy [Paul Newman] is just the coolest dude ever.” He just had such charisma. It just really spoke to me, and it’s one of those films I can watch time and time again. Paul Newman! It was like, Oh my God, look at this guy, he’s so cool! It was pretty much the first time I saw Paul Newman and I’ve been hooked on most of his movies ever since.The Godfather (1972,100% Tomatometer), The Godfather Part II (1974, 98%)It’s just quality at its best. Fantastic writing, an amazing caliber of acting; just beautiful, everything about it. The details of the clothes, the sets — just a masterpiece. Again, I can watch any of the trilogy time and time again. [RT: Even Godfather 3??] Well…(laughs) Listen, the first two are so good.Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969, 90% Tomatometer)Another favorite movie is Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. Again, I can watch that movie a hundred times and never get tired. I think the pairing of Redford and Newman is amazing. Paul Newman and Robert Redford are just so good.The Sting (1973, 91% Tomatometer)The Sting. I have a lot of Paul Newman films, don’t I? But they’re so good!&nbsp;Enter the Dragon (1973,97% Tomatometer)If we want to talk about the movies that have made an impact in what I do in the action realm — Bruce Lee in Enter the Dragon. I’ve watched that countless times. That is a standalone pioneer in action movies, and anyone that was inspired by Bruce Lee…I’m sure everyone that has ever done an action movie has just drooled over how full of talent Bruce Lee was, and how unique he was.[On the first time he saw Enter the Dragon]: I was a kid; my brother had posters of Bruce Lee on the wall. My brother’s you know, punching me and he was a lot bigger than me; I was like, what? I couldn’t see the movie, I was tiny. But as soon as I was able to steal the VHS and stick it in, it was like, Gee, this guy is just…so avant-garde, he’s years above, so far ahead of his own time. So that made a massive impact in my life.Next: Jason Statham on Transporter 3, Corey Yuen’s diminished involvement, and his plans to team up with Sly Stallone and Jet Li.I hear you visit Rotten Tomatoes…Jason Statham: Sometimes, yeah! You’re making all these films, and sometimes – hey, listen, it can be quite depressing or it can give you a big head for all the wrong reasons. So I don’t know whether it’s a good thing or a bad thing, but sometimes you spend so many hours making these films…people are going to give an opinion on them, and everyone’s entitled to an opinion. There’s always good and there’s always bad. So it’s best not to take it too seriously, but at the same time it’s nice to know people support what you’re doing, and at the same time you also get the ol’ custard pie. “That was a piece of crap!” But at the end of the day, no one tries to make a bad movie. And people really do work hard. And there are a lot of people involved. And sometimes it doesn’t end up the way it was supposed to end up. So to think that some people just say, “Well that was a piece of shit…” It’s quite harsh when you read that. But at the end of the day, it’s just us trying to do good.And you’re just a part of the whole picture…JS: Yeah, you’re not solely responsible for the finished product. But it is what it is; people like feedback.The Bank Job got great reviews.JS: I know! I was like, hey, somebody likes a movie of mine![rtimage]MapID=1197818&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=12&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]You mentioned how influential Bruce Lee was to you; in many of the scenes in your movies, but especially in Transporter 3, you seem to be going for such a precise physicality that is reminiscent of Bruce Lee’s lightning-quick moves and poses.JS: Oh, God. Bruce Lee was just so lightning-fast. People try to emulate him in whatever way they can, but to try and do what he was doing…you’re just inspired by it; you’re not trying to say, look, I can do that. No one can do what he did.And Corey Yuen, by the way, is the one that creates all these sequences. [Yuen directed the first Transporter film, served as second unit director on Transporter 2, and choreographed the action in Transporter 3.] He’s ultimately responsible for those choreographed pieces.Now, Corey directed the first Transporter; the second film was by Louis Leterrier (Incredible Hulk). In the third Transporter, you’ve got a new director, Olivier Megaton. How different has it been working from movie to movie with these different directors?[rtimage]MapID=1197818&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=11&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]JS: think it’s difficult, because this time the action sequences took on a bit of a different twist. Normally Corey Yuen gets to edit the sequences; because he creates them, he’s responsible for the snip, snip, snip, and puts them together in his own musical way. But this time, Olivier – who’s obviously the director – he wanted to give it a new twist, a fresh twist, and basically put them together in what he saw as the best way. It’s only down to individual taste, really. I don’t know whether it was better…I hope it was.But Corey still choreographed the sequences?JS: Yes, but usually if you choreograph it, you usually edit it, too. But you know, Olivier has a very certain style of filmmaking, and it’s very stylistic and cool; I think he’s done a great job. But it is very different to the previous two. A lot faster; doesn’t have the silky-smooth feel. A little bit of timing was lost. But at the same time, some people like that; it’s a little more contemporary. It’s all about flavor, it’s all about what you like.Can you talk a bit about The Expendables, which was just announced?JS: Yeah, we’re gonna team up with Sly, who’s going to write, direct and star in The Expendables movie and I’m going along for the ride. With Jet Li as well! It’ll be a powerhouse combo – get out of the way, motherf***ers! (laughs) That’s what it should be called.Will you be fighting each other?JS: No, we’ll be on the same squad. There’ll be some ass to be kicked. I’m looking forward to it.Want more Five Favorite Films?

Nelson), some of Hollywood’s funniest fellows trying to touch one another without permission (Tag, starring&nbsp;Ed Helms,&nbsp;Jeremy Renner, and Jon Hamm), and a remade blast from the blaxploitation past (Superfly, starring Trevor Jackson&nbsp;and Jason Mitchell).&nbsp;What are the critics saying?Incredibles 2 (2018)  93%If you’re going to try and follow up an acclaimed blockbuster, you might as well take your time getting the sequel right — and in animation, where time can stand still forever, you have the added benefit of not needing to rush your cast back in front of the camera. Still, after waiting nearly 15 years for a second installment of The Incredibles, fans can be forgiven a certain amount of impatience; while the creative teams at formerly franchise-averse Pixar dreamed up new stories for the characters in Toy Story, Cars, Finding Nemo, and Monsters Inc., the ability to return to theaters continued to elude the superpowered Parr family. All that waiting has finally paid off with Incredibles 2, which reunites the original voice cast for a new adventure serving up more of the domestic turmoil, superhero satire, and brilliantly animated action that made the first one such a hit. It’d be tough to improve on the original Incredibles, and critics say that while this sequel doesn’t quite pull off that feat, it comes impressively close, adding yet another acclaimed entry to Pixar’s already estimable filmography. If you were a kid when The Incredibles&nbsp;came out, you might have kids of your own now — and like all the best stuff the studio has put out, the whole family can look forward to enjoying Incredibles 2.Tag (2018)  56%On one hand, it’s easy to believe Hollywood has long since exhausted most of the reasonable possibilities for comedy that exist in movies about grown men acting like boys. On the other, when you’ve got the Wall Street Journal writing about a real-life group of guys who take a month off every year to continue the game of tag they’ve been playing since they were kids, well, it’s awfully hard to resist the temptation to turn that into a film. Enter the descriptively titled Tag, starring Hannibal Buress, Jon Hamm, Ed Helms, Jake Johnson, and Jeremy Renner as the fellows in question — a talented bunch whose commitment to the story was reflected in the set injury Renner sustained, breaking both of his arms and necessitating some last-minute CGI limb replacements in post-production. It would be wonderful to report that Renner’s suffering came in service of one of the year’s best-reviewed action comedies; alas, the truth is that critics are kinda meh on Tag, which reviews describe as funny and engaging in fits and starts, but ultimately not consistent or committed enough to fully deliver on its premise. Still, this is one talented cast, and even the critical pans say the movie isn’t without its moments, so if you’re in the mood for some arrested development laughs, you may want to check your local listings.Superfly (2018)  51%Released in 1972, the original Superfly&nbsp;helped lead the blaxploitation wave with a thoughtful Harlem-set drama about a drug dealer looking for one last big score; the movie’s trappings may look somewhat dated today, but thanks to Ron O’Neal‘s performance as main character Youngblood Priest — not to mention a killer Curtis Mayfield soundtrack — it still feels fresh. It’s easy to understand why music video veteran Director X wanted to take a shot at updating the story, and its themes are just as relevant as they were more than 45 years ago; unfortunately, critics say those themes have mostly been lost in this new version, which is far more focused on style than substance. Starring Trevor Jackson as Priest, the 2018 edition moves the action to Atlanta, but the basic contours of the story remain the same — which is part of why a number of reviews have outlined pundits’ disappointment with the lost social subtext. This Superfly&nbsp;will make its fortune by and by, thanks to Director X’s way with an artfully arranged scene or set piece, but as is so often the case with remakes, the original still reigns supreme.What’s New on TVThe Bold Type: Season 2 (2018)  100%The Bold Type presents an aspirational yet refreshingly realistic portrait of young women’s careers, friendships and love lives in a big city.Strange Angel: Season 1 (2018)  71%A beautiful slow burn, Strange Angel shoots for the stars, but gets a little lost in its own orbit.Also&nbsp;Opening This Week In Limited Release Eating Animals (2018) , a documentary about the commercial factory farming industry and its various impacts, is at 100%.

Nelson), some of Hollywood’s funniest fellows trying to touch one another without permission (Tag, starring&nbsp;Ed Helms,&nbsp;Jeremy Renner, and Jon Hamm), and a remade blast from the blaxploitation past (Superfly, starring Trevor Jackson&nbsp;and Jason Mitchell).&nbsp;What are the critics saying?Incredibles 2 (2018)  93%If you’re going to try and follow up an acclaimed blockbuster, you might as well take your time getting the sequel right — and in animation, where time can stand still forever, you have the added benefit of not needing to rush your cast back in front of the camera. Still, after waiting nearly 15 years for a second installment of The Incredibles, fans can be forgiven a certain amount of impatience; while the creative teams at formerly franchise-averse Pixar dreamed up new stories for the characters in Toy Story, Cars, Finding Nemo, and Monsters Inc., the ability to return to theaters continued to elude the superpowered Parr family. All that waiting has finally paid off with Incredibles 2, which reunites the original voice cast for a new adventure serving up more of the domestic turmoil, superhero satire, and brilliantly animated action that made the first one such a hit. It’d be tough to improve on the original Incredibles, and critics say that while this sequel doesn’t quite pull off that feat, it comes impressively close, adding yet another acclaimed entry to Pixar’s already estimable filmography. If you were a kid when The Incredibles&nbsp;came out, you might have kids of your own now — and like all the best stuff the studio has put out, the whole family can look forward to enjoying Incredibles 2.Tag (2018)  56%On one hand, it’s easy to believe Hollywood has long since exhausted most of the reasonable possibilities for comedy that exist in movies about grown men acting like boys. On the other, when you’ve got the Wall Street Journal writing about a real-life group of guys who take a month off every year to continue the game of tag they’ve been playing since they were kids, well, it’s awfully hard to resist the temptation to turn that into a film. Enter the descriptively titled Tag, starring Hannibal Buress, Jon Hamm, Ed Helms, Jake Johnson, and Jeremy Renner as the fellows in question — a talented bunch whose commitment to the story was reflected in the set injury Renner sustained, breaking both of his arms and necessitating some last-minute CGI limb replacements in post-production. It would be wonderful to report that Renner’s suffering came in service of one of the year’s best-reviewed action comedies; alas, the truth is that critics are kinda meh on Tag, which reviews describe as funny and engaging in fits and starts, but ultimately not consistent or committed enough to fully deliver on its premise. Still, this is one talented cast, and even the critical pans say the movie isn’t without its moments, so if you’re in the mood for some arrested development laughs, you may want to check your local listings.Superfly (2018)  51%Released in 1972, the original Superfly&nbsp;helped lead the blaxploitation wave with a thoughtful Harlem-set drama about a drug dealer looking for one last big score; the movie’s trappings may look somewhat dated today, but thanks to Ron O’Neal‘s performance as main character Youngblood Priest — not to mention a killer Curtis Mayfield soundtrack — it still feels fresh. It’s easy to understand why music video veteran Director X wanted to take a shot at updating the story, and its themes are just as relevant as they were more than 45 years ago; unfortunately, critics say those themes have mostly been lost in this new version, which is far more focused on style than substance. Starring Trevor Jackson as Priest, the 2018 edition moves the action to Atlanta, but the basic contours of the story remain the same — which is part of why a number of reviews have outlined pundits’ disappointment with the lost social subtext. This Superfly&nbsp;will make its fortune by and by, thanks to Director X’s way with an artfully arranged scene or set piece, but as is so often the case with remakes, the original still reigns supreme.What’s New on TVThe Bold Type: Season 2 (2018)  100%The Bold Type presents an aspirational yet refreshingly realistic portrait of young women’s careers, friendships and love lives in a big city.Strange Angel: Season 1 (2018)  71%A beautiful slow burn, Strange Angel shoots for the stars, but gets a little lost in its own orbit.Also&nbsp;Opening This Week In Limited Release Eating Animals (2018) , a documentary about the commercial factory farming industry and its various impacts, is at 100%.

Christy Lemire breaks it down for families looking to take their kids to the theaters&nbsp;this weekend.NOW IN THEATERSCaptain Marvel (2019)  79%Rating:&nbsp;PG-13, for sequences of sci-fi violence and action, and brief suggestive language.The first film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe with a woman at its center is finally here. Captain Marvel&nbsp;is the superhero little girls and grown women alike can look to with wide eyes and high hopes. Room&nbsp;Oscar-winner Brie Larson plays the title character with grit and a quick wit. She’s still piecing together the details of the past – like the fact that her real name is Carol Danvers, and she used to be a U.S. Air Force pilot – but her rebellious spirit shines through as brightly as her fiery superpowers. The film from Anna Boden (the first woman to direct an MCU installment) and Ryan Fleck is a lot of fun, and it features some enjoyable banter between Larson and Samuel L. Jackson as a younger version of S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Nick Fury. It’s also steeped in ‘90s nostalgia for parents and grown-ups to enjoy. But because this is a comic book blockbuster extravaganza, there are the sorts of giant action scenes and fight sequences you’ve come to expect. When we first see Captain Marvel – and she’s going by the name Vers – she’s living and training as a warrior on the Kree planet of Hala. The power that surges through her fists is formidable, and because she’s challenged so frequently by so many foes, she has to use them a lot. Back on Earth, she also finds herself in several dangerous situations as a pilot. There’s also a lengthy showdown on a Los Angeles Metro train. And because she’s often fighting the enemy Skrulls – who are shapeshifters – it might look like she’s beating up an old lady, for example, when it’s actually an alien in disguise. We see blood, but it’s a shade of bluish-green rather than red. There’s a little bit of language. Overall, though, Captain Marvel is worthwhile for younger viewers – both girls and boys – because she’s a great role model. She’s strong and resourceful, she’s true to herself, and she’s loyal to others. Fine for ages 8 or 9 and older.Like this?

It’s an adaptation of a Japanese manga from 1990, so it would be easy to think it might be completely suitable for children. Film critic Christy Lemire offers up a breakdown of the special effects-heavy sci-fi fantasy to let you know whether or not it’s safe to take your kids to.NOW IN THEATERSAlita: Battle Angel (2019)  61%Rating:&nbsp;PG-13, for sequences of sci-fi violence and action, and for some language.It may look colorful and lively, and the main character may seem inviting with her wide, inquisitive eyes. But Alita: Battle Angel&nbsp;is really quite violent and not meant for young viewers. Fans of the manga series that inspired the movie probably won’t be surprised to learn that. And granted, much of the graphic violence happens to cyborgs who bleed blue, but still – they’re imbued with human characteristics, and we’re meant to care about them as such. So when they get stabbed or sliced in half or dismembered entirely, the imagery can be shocking. The visual effects and elaborate action sequences in the film from director Robert Rodriguez and writer-producer James Cameron are really the main reason to see Alita&nbsp;– that, and the game, physical performance from Rosa Salazar as the title character. She’s an abandoned cyborg whom a doctor (Christoph Waltz) brings back to life in a futuristic, post-apocalyptic society. But she can’t remember who she was; she only knows she has formidable warrior instincts and abilities that make her both powerful and a target. Alita also takes part in a Rollerball-type game that’s fast-paced and treacherous. She’s basically in constant peril. Jennifer Connelly, Mahershala Ali, Ed Skrein, and Jackie Earle Haley are among the impressive supporting cast. I didn’t bring my 9-year-old son with me to the Alita screening I attended, and I was glad afterward. It’s a big, mindless spectacle, but it really earns its PG-13 rating.&nbsp;","section":"Parental Guidance","tags":"Critics, poppins, Bros., adventure, composers, BET, Paramount, HBO, cars, It, anime, &","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/15125917/Alita_Battle_Angel_PG_Rep.jpg","slug":"how-family-friendly-is-alita-battle-angel"},{"id":"47508899008281","title":"The House with a Clock in Its Walls Might be a Little Too Creepy for Young Kids","content":"Parental Guidancevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})The House with a Clock in Its Walls Might be a Little Too Creepy for Young KidsEli Roth's kid-horror flick is Spielbergian enough, but here are a few other witch-centric movies you can enjoy at home.by Christy Lemire | September 21, 2018 |  CommentsJack Black returns to the kid horror genre with this week’s The House with the Clock in Its Walls, and while it hasn’t impressed critics quite as much as&nbsp;Goosebumps, they still say&nbsp;it’s pretty good. However, it does have adult horror-meister Eli Roth behind the camera, so there may be a few things that are too intense for the younger kids. Read on for Christy Lemire’s family-friendly assessment of the film, as well as three witch-centric alternatives you may choose to watch instead.THE&nbsp;MOVIEThe House with a Clock in Its Walls (2018)  65%Rating:&nbsp;PG, for thematic elements including sorcery, some action, scary images, rude humor and language.A family film from horror director Eli Roth (Cabin Fever, Hostel) might sound like a contradiction in terms. But The House With a Clock in Its Walls&nbsp;features elements that are both fantastical and frightening. Based on the book by writer John Bellairs and illustrator Edward Gorey, the movie finds shy, studious Lewis Barnavelt (Owen Vaccaro) moving in with the uncle he’s never met (Jack Black) following his parents’ death in 1955. In small-town New Zebedee, Michigan, folks regard Black’s Uncle Jonathan as a bit of a weirdo, and his stately Victorian mansion is the stuff of legend. But Lewis quickly learns the truth: Jonathan is a warlock, trying to solve the mystery of the ticking coming from inside the home’s walls with the help of his next-door neighbor, the perpetually purple-clad witch Mrs. Zimmerman (Cate Blanchett). Roth’s film plays with the possibility of using magic as a means of kid wish fulfillment: getting dressed in the morning, seeking revenge on school bullies in the afternoon. But it turns scarier as Lewis accidentally unlocks some darker powers with the use of a forbidden spell book. Creepy dolls abound in a secret room inside the house, accessible only by a dark passageway. Predatory pumpkins come to life to wreak havoc. And key scenes take place within a cemetery at night. It’s probably too much for very little kids, but I’d say this is a fine choice – and a solid introduction to horror – for viewers around 9 and older.THE RECOMMENDATIONSIf The House With a Clock in Its Walls has you pondering other movies about witches and warlocks, here are a few suggestions:The Wizard of Oz (1939)  99%Rating:&nbsp;GIt’s Dorothy’s story, of course: her hero’s journey along the Yellow Brick Road with the help of three new friends (and Toto, too). But it’s her encounter with two witches – one bad, one good – that sets her on that tuneful path. When the tornado Dorothy travels in to the Land of Oz fatally falls on top of the Wicked Witch of the East, her sister, the grotesque and green-hued Wicked Witch of the West (a chilling Margaret Hamilton), vows revenge. But as she tries to return home, Dorothy (Judy Garland) also enjoys the guidance and protection of Glinda, the Good Witch of the North (Billie Burke), a vision in mountainous sparkles and tulle. When I was a little girl watching the annual TV broadcast of The Wizard of Oz&nbsp;– which was event viewing back in the ‘70s — the Wicked Witch of the West terrified me, as did her flying monkeys. So that part might be a bit too much for kids around 5 years old. But for everyone else, The Wizard of Oz&nbsp;is a must-see, a classic rite of passage. Watch it – or watch it again – with the whole family.Watch now on: Amazon,&nbsp;FandangoNOW, iTunesKiki's Delivery Service (1989)  98%Rating:&nbsp;GA lovely and joyous film from animation master Hayao Miyazaki. While many of Miyazaki’s movies feature some dark and potentially disturbing imagery, this is a sweet, light tale – albeit one that’s about a witch. Thirteen-year-old Kiki leaves her family for a year to live and train in a foreign city, where she opens a delivery company. She navigates the skies above the shops and streets on her broomstick, with her signature red bow in her hair and her trusty black cat, Jiji, by her side. But as she draws closer to puberty, she finds she’s losing her abilities, which weakens her confidence. And she survives some perilous situations and near misses during her big-city adventures. But Kiki is a witch who uses her powers for good, and she’s loyal and resourceful. A great choice for all ages.Watch now on:&nbsp;Amazon,&nbsp;FandangoNOW,&nbsp;iTunesThe Witches (1990)  93%Rating:&nbsp;PGAnjelica Huston is a sleek and radiant witch in this wild and whimsical family adventure. Based on the Roald Dahl book of the same name, The Witches&nbsp;finds young, orphaned Luke (Jasen Fisher) traveling with his grandmother (Mai Zetterling) on vacation in hopes of restoring her health. But he finds there happens to be a witch convention going on at the hotel where they’re staying, which enlivens all the outlandish fairy tales he’s heard about them over the years. Luke overhears their leader, Huston’s Eva Ernst, ordering her minions to turn all the children they see into mice – a special effect director Nicolas Roeg achieves with help from Jim Henson’s puppetry magic. The Witches is visually ambitious but also tonally twisted, with off-kilter humor and an overall sense of foreboding. The idea of witches turning kids into mice might seem frightening for very young viewers, but overall I’d say this is fine for children age 8 or 9 and older.Watch now on:&nbsp;Amazon,&nbsp;FandangoNOW,&nbsp;iTunes","section":"Parental Guidance","tags":"nfl, TruTV, ESPN, Film, globe, screen","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/21114914/House-Clock-in-its-Walls.jpg","slug":"the-house-with-a-clock-in-its-walls-might-be-a-little-too-creepy-for-young-kids"},{"id":"47508897509137","title":"Digital Multiplex: Criterion Collection Titles are Free on Hulu This Weekend","content":"Now Streamingvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Digital Multiplex: Criterion Collection Titles are Free on Hulu This Weekendby RT Staff | February 15, 2013 |  CommentsEach week in Digital Multiplex, we here at RT will endeavor to bring you a sumptuous list of the most noteworthy and “view-worthy” new titles available via various streaming video outlets and digital download, including both new releases and classic gems.

Stine, we have a family-friendly sequel this week in the form of Goosebumps 2: Haunted Halloween. There’s significantly less Jack Black in this one (aside from his voice), but a lot of familiar small-town mayhem, so Christy Lemire breaks down what may or may not frighten young viewers, then offers a trio of alternatives you can watch at home if you can’t make it to the theaters… or simply prefer not to go at all.THE&nbsp;MOVIEGoosebumps 2: Haunted Halloween (2018)  47%Rating:&nbsp;PG, for scary creature action and images, some thematic elements, rude humor and language.The sequel to 2015’s Goosebumps&nbsp;offers more kid-friendly frights in the vein of the long-running R.L. Stine book series. This time, it’s a whole new story with an array of (mostly) new characters. Middle schoolers Sonny and Sam (Jeremy Ray Taylor and Caleel Harris) accidentally summon the scheming ventriloquist dummy Slappy (voiced by Jack Black) while investigating an abandoned house. (Slappy’s screen presence has been expanded significantly from the original film, in which he was a supporting player.) At first, Slappy seems like a friendly and helpful companion, as he uses his magical powers to do away with chores and homework and get revenge on bullies. But it soon becomes clear that he aims to take over Sonny’s family as well as the entire town, which he does by making all the Halloween decorations and costumes come to life. Witches, pumpkins, mummies, you name it – they all rise up to wreak havoc. It can be a little intense, but overall it’s more silly than scary. The best sight gags involve a giant spider composed entirely of balloons and a bowl full of gummy bears that turn vicious. Kids will enjoy the craziness of it all, although the image of the genuinely creepy Slappy might freak out the youngest viewers. Goosebumps 2 is a solid early horror movie for kids around 8 and older.THE RECOMMENDATIONSIf Goosebumps 2&nbsp;has you in the Halloween spirit, here are a few more spooky movies you and your family can enjoy together:Goosebumps (2015)  78%Rating:&nbsp;PG, for&nbsp;scary and intense creature action and images, and for some rude humor.As is often the case (and as the Tomatometer can attest), the original Goosebumps&nbsp;movie is better than the sequel. And it has the benefit of more Jack Black, starring as Stine himself, a reclusive horror writer. When the new kid in town (Dylan Minnette) moves in next door to Stine and befriends his sheltered daughter (Odeya Rush), adventures ensue. The two open Stine’s sealed manuscripts, causing the characters to leap from the pages and create chaos in a peaceful, small town. As in the sequel, much of the imagery is silly and playful. There’s a bit involving adorable, angry yard gnomes, and instead of a giant balloon spider, there’s a giant preying mantis. And of course there’s Slappy, whose very presence can send a shiver (as well as a giggle). The original Goosebumps&nbsp;reminded me of great ’80s horror comedies like Gremlins&nbsp;in its good-natured danger. Fine for viewers around 7 or 8 and older.Watch now on: Amazon,&nbsp;FandangoNOW, iTunesFrankenweenie (2012)  87%Rating:&nbsp;PG, for thematic elements, scary images and action.This remains one of my all-time favorite Tim Burton movies, both for its technical complexity and its emotional tenderness. This feature-length version of his 1984 short oozes his cleverly macabre style and it’s a great example of all the director does so well. It’s about a little boy (voiced by Charlie Tahan) who brings his&nbsp;beloved, deceased dog back to life – a kindhearted notion that has unexpected results. The balance Burton strikes here in his twisted tearjerker is a joy to behold. His love of classic monster movies is infectious, and his stop-motion animation imagery is just gorgeous in crisp black and white. Winona Ryder, Martin Landau, Catherine O’Hara and Martin Short make up the strong supporting voice cast. A great choice for viewers around 6 or 7 and older.Watch now on:&nbsp;Amazon,&nbsp;FandangoNOW,&nbsp;iTunesIt's the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown (1966)  94%Rating:&nbsp;Not RatedA classic, and one that can be enjoyed year-round. At least that’s how my kid watches it, along with all the other animated Peanuts specials. It is THE Halloween movie for the whole family.&nbsp;You’ve probably seen it a million times and can recite Linus’ Great Pumpkin speech right along with him. But if it’s been a while, or if your kids have never seen it, this is a great one to watch together – regardless of their age. Charlie Brown’s trick-or-treating lament – “I got a rock” – never gets old. And Linus’ unshakable belief that the Great Pumpkin not only exists but also will rise up and bring presents to all the good boys and girls has a charming innocence. An excellent choice for all ages.Watch now on:&nbsp;Amazon,&nbsp;FandangoNOW,&nbsp;iTunes","section":"Parental Guidance","tags":"PBS, Dead, Unbreakable, cinematic","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/12135358/Goosebumps2-PG.jpg","slug":"3-family-friendly-halloween-movie-alternatives-to-goosebumps-2"},{"id":"47508899022624","title":"Three Movies about Incredible Families You Can Watch After Incredibles 2","content":"Parental Guidancevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Three Movies about Incredible Families You Can Watch After Incredibles 2by Christy Lemire | June 15, 2018 |  CommentsPixar’s latest effort, a sequel to the 2004 hit The Incredibles, is another Certified Fresh winner, and it’s already breaking ticket sales records. If you have kids of theater-going age, then you’re likely going to see&nbsp;Incredibles 2 this weekend. With that in mind, Christy Lemire tells you what you might need to keep an eye out for if you’ve got very young children, and she also offers three more movies about unusual families that you can watch at home.THE&nbsp;MOVIEIncredibles 2 (2018)  93%Rating:&nbsp;PG, for action sequences and some brief mild language.Mr. Incredible, Elastigirl, Jack-Jack, and Edna Mode are back in this high-energy sequel to the 2004 Pixar Animation hit The Incredibles. Writer-director Brad Bird also returns, picking up right where he left off with the first film. But many citizens now lament the damage superheroes cause while fighting crime and saving lives, and politicians want to outlaw them entirely. So a wealthy brother and sister (voiced by Bob Odenkirk and Catherine Keener) enlist the Parr family for a campaign to rehabilitate their image, starting with Holly Hunter’s Elastigirl. At the same time, a villain is on the loose, hypnotizing people and forcing them to behave violently using the moniker the Screenslaver. Will the Incredibles be able to stop him? And will the diminutive diva designer Edna Mode (also Bird) find something fabulous for them to wear while they’re trying? Incredibles 2 is just as much fun as the original. It’s thrillingly paced and beautifully detailed, with toddler Jack-Jack nearly stealing the whole thing while feeling out his newfound powers. But some moments with the Screenslaver – who wears a menacing mask and lurks in the shadows – might be too scary for very little kids, including one scene in particular that takes place at his dark, hidden lab in an old apartment building. Also, the effect his hypnosis has on people might disturb young viewers. Incredibles 2&nbsp;has the sorts of chases, fistfights, and general peril you’d expect from a summer blockbuster. But it also has a lot of worthwhile messages about sticking together and fighting for what’s right. Fine for viewers around 7 and older.THE RECOMMENDATIONSIf you’re looking for other movies involving unusual families that you can share with your own family, here are a few suggestions:Freaky Friday (1976)  70%Rating:&nbsp;GWell, they’re only unusual for a day – a particular&nbsp;Friday, that is – but Annabel Andrews and her mom do cram in a lot of wild adventures over just a few short hours. A young Jodie Foster — in one of the veteran actress’ great, early roles — stars as a stressed-out teenager who thinks her mom has it easy. Meanwhile, her harried mother (a game Barbara Harris) envies the simplicity she sees in Annabel’s young life. Neither of them truly understands the challenges the other faces on a daily basis – but they get a taste when they accidentally wish to switch lives for the day. This is a classic body-swap comedy as well as a vintage Disney live-action family film. Both mother and daughter find themselves caught in a lot of awkward moments and slapstick calamities. A car chase, an out-of-control washing machine, and a water skiing extravaganza are among the many wacky antics that erupt throughout the day. It’s all wholesome, harmless fun. A remake came out in 2003 starring Lindsay Lohan and Jamie Lee Curtis, and while it was certainly enjoyable (and had more high-tech special effects), the original has an old-fashioned charm about it. Good for all ages.Watch now on: Amazon,&nbsp;FandangoNOW, iTunesThe Simpsons Movie (2007)  87%Rating:&nbsp;PG-13, for irreverent humor throughout.Our son, who is now 8, has been watching The Simpsons&nbsp;for years. He reads the comic books. He quotes random, classic lines from the show. He looks to troublemaking Bart as a charismatic role model. Now, this may not be your particular parenting path. You may think The Simpsons&nbsp;are inappropriate, despite their pleasingly colorful, animated appearance. And I totally get that. But if your kids love The Simpsons, they’ll love this feature-length adventure. All the same slapstick is there, along with the trademark satire for older viewers to appreciate. As always, Matt Groening’s creation manages to be accessible yet sophisticated all at once. The plot has to do with Homer causing a catastrophe when he adopts a pet pig. Injuries and inside pop culture references abound. We also get some Bart nudity, in case you want to prepare to shield your kids’ eyes. The Simpsons Movie&nbsp;has the same great energy and brash humor as the TV show and the same underlying heart.

But while director Barry Sonnenfeld maintains the television show’s playfully monstrous vibe, the humor here tends to be a tad more grown-up and darker. It’s about the eccentric, wealthy Addamses – including father Gomez (Raul Julia), mother Morticia (Anjelica Huston), and daughter&nbsp;Wednesday&nbsp;(Christina Ricci) – becoming the target of a scheme to steal their fortune. Madcap hilarity and macabre frights ensure. The mere look of these characters and their world is probably too much for very little kids, though. An animated remake is planned for 2019 from the directors of Sausage Party, featuring Charlize Theron, Chloe Grace Moretz, and Finn Wolfhard among the voice cast, but you can get your Addams fix before then. And now that catchy theme song is stuck in your head. You’re welcome (snap, snap).

But if you can’t make it out to the theaters to see the latest superhero extravaganza, you can stay at home and catch these other adventures featuring characters who embark on tiny adventures.THE&nbsp;MOVIEAnt-Man and the Wasp (2018)  87%Rating:&nbsp;PG-13, for some action violence.It’s the latest installment in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, so you know what you’re in for here: chases, danger, and our heroes battling villains in big action sequences. But Ant-Man and the Wasp — like its 2015 predecessor, Ant-Man — is a lot lighter and goofier than, say, Avengers: Infinity War. The fate of all of humanity isn’t at stake, which makes this sequel a more genuinely pleasant experience. The always entertaining Paul Rudd returns as the title character, this time teaming up with Evangeline Lilly’s Wasp and her dad, scientist Hank Pym (Michael Douglas), to return to the Quantum Realm. There, they will try to retrieve the Wasp’s mom (Michelle Pfeiffer), who’s been stuck there for 30 years. (An early scene flashes back to Lilly’s character’s childhood and the memory of her mother being lost forever, which could be difficult for younger viewers.) But plenty of other people are after the technology Pym and his daughter are developing, including an ethereal but powerful force known as The Ghost (Hannah John-Kamen). Ant-Man and the Wasp is fast-paced and playful, but it also features a ton of hand-to-hand combat, knives, guns and general chaos, some of which involves crowds of tourists in San Francisco. It also has some language scattered throughout. But on the whole, there’s nothing scary here. A great choice for kids around 8 or 9 and older.THE RECOMMENDATIONSAfter you’ve seen Ant-Man and the Wasp, here are some other movies featuring characters who shrink down and go on big adventures. Try one of these on for size:The Incredible Shrinking Man (1957)  92%Rating:&nbsp;Not rated.It’s a Universal sci-fi classic, with impressive visual effects and strong themes exploring what it means to be human. Grant Williams stars as a man who goes on a boating expedition with his wife (Randy Stuart) off the coast of California. A strange cloud passes over him, leaving his bare chest sparkling with a mysterious substance. In time, he finds that his clothes are getting bigger as he grows smaller, until eventually he becomes tinier than an insect. Dangers abound, from a ferocious cat to a monstrous spider to the general existential threat of wasting away and being lost forever. But he also gains fame as a fascinating spectacle. It’s thrilling stuff, which director Jack Arnold depicts through inspired use of perspective. Kids probably won’t get the movie’s larger ideas, but they’ll be fascinated by the fantastical depiction of size and space. Fine for viewers around 7 and older.Watch now on: Amazon,&nbsp;FandangoNOW, iTunesInnerspace (1987)  82%Rating: PG, for adult situations/language and violence.Innerspace made Saturday Night Live alum Martin Short a major movie star, and it was considered super high-tech in its day. Directed by sci-fi great Joe Dante (The Howling, Gremlins), the film features Dennis Quaid as a Navy test pilot who gets shrunk down and accidentally injected into the body of an uptight grocery store clerk (Short) when a military experiment goes horribly wrong (as they so often do). Madcap hilarity ensues, much of which features Meg Ryan as Quaid’s girlfriend, who gets caught up in the confusion. There’s a lot going on here, both visually and thematically. This is a high-energy, overstuffed adventure that allows Short to flex his muscles with a ton of big, slapstick comedy, which is one of his specialties. There’s quite a bit of danger, some language scattered throughout and slight nudity from behind. This movie is insane, but also a lot of fun. Fine for viewers around 10 and older.Watch now on:&nbsp;Amazon,&nbsp;FandangoNOW,&nbsp;iTunes","section":"Parental Guidance","tags":"Comedy, show, Black, archives, popular, Tour, Movies, potter, comedy, Month, medical","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/06165424/Tiny-Adventures-PG.jpg","slug":"tiny-adventure-alternatives-to-ant-man-and-the-wasp-that-you-can-watch-at-home"},{"id":"47508900536100","title":"Three Amazing, Age-Appropriate Ape Adventure Alternatives to Rampage","content":"Parental Guidancevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Three Amazing, Age-Appropriate Ape Adventure Alternatives to Rampageby Christy Lemire | April 13, 2018 |  CommentsIt stars a charismatic Dwayne Johnson, it’s based on an old video game, and it’s got explosions and CGI, so there’s a fair chance your kids will be interested in seeing Rampage this weekend. And as long as they’re at least somewhere in late elementary school, it should be fine. But for those of you who have younger children, or simply need a weekend in, Christy offers three primate-themed alternatives you can watch with the family.THE&nbsp;MOVIERampage (2018)  51%Rating:&nbsp;PG-13, for sequences of violence, action and destruction, brief language and crude gestures.Giant, genetically enhanced animals thunder across the United States en route to destroying Chicago, and only Dwayne Johnson – with a lot of help from Naomie Harris – can stop them. Yes, Rampage&nbsp;is exactly the kind of ridiculous B-movie that you want it to be. But it’s also extremely violent and intense, and will likely be too scary for most kids. Johnson stars as a primatologist who must team up with Harris’ geneticist to prevent a super-powered gorilla, wolf, and alligator from creating massive amounts of carnage. Many people do die, though, in their futile attempts at containing these freakish creatures. There’s a ton of gunfire and explosions. Much of downtown Chicago does indeed get leveled, placing countless numbers of people in peril. And just the sight of these animals brawling and roaring ferociously at each other will probably be too much for young viewers to bear. They don’t call it Rampage&nbsp;for nothing. (Also, the albino gorilla, who’s Johnson’s buddy in happier times, has a running joke with his trainer in which he gives him the middle finger.) But for kids around 11 or 12 and older, this movie is good, stupid fun.THE RECOMMENDATIONSIf Rampage&nbsp;sounds like it might be too much for the whole family to handle, here are some other movies featuring primates that everyone can enjoy:King Kong (1933)  98%Rating:&nbsp;Not ratedWe’ve seen plenty of remakes and parodies. Just last year, we were treated to the high-tech spectacle of Kong: Skull Island. And of course, King Kong has fought other giant creatures in films like 1962’s delightfully cheesy King Kong vs. Godzilla. But this is the granddaddy of them all, and it still holds up 85 years later in terms of its emotional impact. A documentary filmmaker (Robert Armstrong) travels to the South Seas to track down a famed, 50-foot ape. Along for the journey is Fay Wray as the beauty who will be the leading lady in his latest film – and who becomes the object of the misunderstood King Kong’s brutish affections. Back in New York City, he goes so far as to escape his captivity to pursue her, famously grabbing her and climbing up to the top of the Empire State Building with her in his giant, furry paw. Director Merian Cooper’s monster movie remains one of the greatest and most revered of all time. It’s a marvel of miniatures and stop-motion animation, even down to the movement of Kong’s fur. It may look simple now to your kids – especially the brawl on Skull Island between Kong and a T. Rex – given how accustomed they are to more high-tech visual effects. But the classic scene atop the Empire State Building remains thrilling. Fine for viewers around 7 or 8 and older.Watch now on: Amazon,&nbsp;FandangoNOW, iTunesJane (2017)  98%Rating:&nbsp;PGA treasure trove of decades-old footage of a young Jane Goodall, when she was just beginning her journey as an advocate for chimpanzees specifically and the globe in general, comprises the bulk of this fascinating documentary. Director Brett Morgen gives us an intimate glimpse into the globetrotting, trailblazing primatologist, back when she was an inexperienced but inquisitive and intrepid 26-year-old. We see her gain the animals’ trust after many months of following and studying them in Tanzania’s Gombe Stream National Park, en route to becoming the expert she is today. There’s a bit of chimp-on-chimp violence here, not unlike what you’d see in any nature documentary. Some chimps also die, which is quite sad. And there’s a tiny bit of language, as well as Goodall’s matter-of-fact discussion of her divorce. But Jane&nbsp;is extremely worthwhile for its portrait of a dedicated, independent young woman who dared to travel to the other side of the world to pursue her dreams in a male-dominated field of study. She also narrates the film, based on her own writings, and provides new interviews for perspective. Great for viewers ages 7 or 8 and older.Watch now on:&nbsp;Amazon,&nbsp;FandangoNOW,&nbsp;iTunesEvery Which Way But Loose (1978)  37%Rating:&nbsp;PGThis isn’t exactly the highest-rated film on this list – or on the whole Tomatometer, for that matter — but I recall loving it as a kid, and I suspect your kids will love it, too. In its day, this Clint Eastwood action-comedy was critically trashed. What was Eastwood thinking? He made his name playing a tough guy. Why would he want to play around with an orangutan? But maybe that’s the point. Maybe Eastwood was looking for a change of pace after the gritty and violent spaghetti Westerns and Dirty Harry&nbsp;movies that made him a superstar. He does seem to be having a blast here. And over time, Every Which Way But Loose&nbsp;has gained a bit of a cult following. Eastwood stars as Philo Beddoe, a truck driver and bare-knuckle brawler who lives in a modest house with his constant companion, an impish orangutan named Clyde. But when he falls for a country singer (Sondra Locke, Eastwood’s former real-life love), his seemingly simple life gets turned upside down. This movie is really silly and playful, and Clyde is always good for a wacky reaction shot or some inappropriate antics. The two have a goofy chemistry together, which plays out through a wide variety of physical comedy. There’s quite a bit of fighting here and some shenanigans involving biker gangs and honky-tonks. But for the most part, this is fine for viewers around 8 or 9 and older. Plus, it could be your kids’ first Eastwood film.Watch now on:&nbsp;Amazon,&nbsp;FandangoNOW,&nbsp;iTunes","section":"Parental Guidance","tags":"Network, movies, breaking, high, Searchlight, laika, Action, TV, cancelled, Sundance, science, thriller, Brie, Book, TV","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/13103751/Rampage-PG.jpg","slug":"three-amazing-age-appropriate-ape-adventure-alternatives-to-rampage"},{"id":"47508900530978","title":"Remember, Deadpool 2 Is Not for Kids","content":"Parental Guidancevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Remember, Deadpool 2 Is Not for KidsBut here are three pop culture-laden alternatives you can watch at home with them.by Christy Lemire | May 18, 2018 |  CommentsTwo years ago, a certain Ryan Reynolds superhero action comedy debuted and, to almost everyone’s surprise, broke a bunch of box office records and earned a Certified Fresh 83% on the Tomatometer. But despite its comic book origins,&nbsp;Deadpool was decidedly not for kids. We warned parents about it then, but just in case your memory’s gone bad, Christy is here to remind you again not to take your little ones to its follow-up,&nbsp;Deadpool 2, and offer three slightly more innocuous alternatives that are also steeped in pop culture references.THE&nbsp;MOVIEDeadpool 2 (2018)  84%Rating: R, for strong violence and language throughout, sexual references and brief drug material.If you saw the original Deadpool&nbsp;in 2016, you know what you’re in for here. Director David Leitch’s film really earns its R rating, with a nearly non-stop cavalcade of gory violence, harsh language and crass sexual humor. The red-suited Marvel character may look like a lot of fun – and in Ryan Reynolds’ expert comic hands, he definitely is – but he’s also not for kids. This time, Reynolds’ Wade Wilson (a.k.a. Deadpool) hooks up with some of the lesser-known X-Men to form his own team. Their mission is to take on the powerful bad guy Cable (Josh Brolin), a soldier who has traveled back in time to right a wrong (and wreak havoc in the process). Kids are frequently in danger, but one kid in particular – a fire-throwing teenage mutant named Russell (Julian Dennison) – is as inappropriate and profane as Deadpool himself. But he also becomes Deadpool’s sidekick and pet project, which adds some tenderness to balance out the wrongness. It’s intense and boundary pushing, but Deadpool 2&nbsp;also has an emotional undercurrent that gives the film more substance than you might expect. Fine for older teens and up.THE RECOMMENDATIONSPart of what makes the Deadpool&nbsp;movies so funny is that they’re crammed with rapid-fire pop-culture references. Since the vast majority of kids probably shouldn’t see this sequel, here are some other movies you can share with them that gleefully wallow in meta movie and music influences.The LEGO Movie (2014)  96%Rating:&nbsp;PG, for action and rude humor.Basically, every LEGO character you could possibly imagine – plus a few truly inspired ones you never knew existed – co-mingle in this high-energy extravaganza, making it the ultimate pop-culture mash-up. From Batman and Wonder Woman to Shaquille O’Neal and Abraham Lincoln to Lando Calrissian and C-3PO, the characters cross time, space and storytelling boundaries to interact in this animated adventure, and it’s a blast. You couldn’t possibly catch all the references in Phil Lord and Christopher Miller’s movie in one sitting, but that’s OK. Revisiting The LEGO Movie&nbsp;and noticing new details each time is part of the fun. (If you have kids who are anything like my 8-year-old son, you’ve probably already seen it several times. “Everything Is Awesome” will eventually get unstuck from your head, I promise.) Chris Pratt (himself a superhero as Star-Lord in the Marvel Cinematic Universe) lends his voice here as an ordinary construction worker named Emmet. He goes on a hero’s journey with the rebellious Wyldstyle (Elizabeth Banks) when he’s mistaken as the Master Builder who will lead his people to freedom from the evil Lord Business (Will Ferrell). There’s a ton of action and danger here, but it’s mostly playful. A great choice for all ages.Watch now on: Amazon,&nbsp;FandangoNOW, iTunesClueless (1995)  81%Rating:&nbsp;PG-13, for sex-related dialogue and some teen use of alcohol and drugs.The main characters are high school students named Cher (Alicia Silverstone) and Dionne (Stacey Dash), “after famous singers of the past who now do infomercials.” And that’s just the beginning in this generation-defining comedy that’s packed with a panorama of pop-culture references and influences. Writer-director Amy Heckerling’s film as a whole is inspired by the Jane Austen classic Emma. But it’s very much of its time with jokes involving Luke Perry, Ren &amp; Stimpy, Calvin Klein, Kenny G and Mark Wahlberg (back when he was still rapping as Marky Mark), plus some older references to Barbra Streisand, James Bond and Sammy Davis Jr. It’s got quite a bit of teen partying and some sexual references, but on the whole it’s a light, sweet movie about finding out what’s important in life. Silverstone’s Cher is a materialistic Beverly Hills queen bee, but she’s loyal to her friends and her heart is in the right place. A solid choice for viewers around 11 and older.Watch now on:&nbsp;Amazon,&nbsp;FandangoNOW,&nbsp;iTunesSing Street (2016)  95%Rating:&nbsp;PG-13, for thematic elements including strong language and some bullying behavior, a suggestive image, drug material and teen smoking.This movie is a complete charmer, and if you didn’t catch it when it came out a couple years ago, now is the time. Irish writer-director John Carney’s semi-autobiographical film is an excellent choice for the teens and tweens in your house, capturing vividly the longing ache of adolescent first love. The performances are all lovely, but the ‘80s-inspired music is what really makes it sing. Ferdia Walsh-Peelo stars as Conor, a sweet teenager who finds himself an outcast when he transfers to a rough new school. Along with the few friends he makes, he starts a band to impress the beautiful and mysterious older girl (Lucy Boynton) who lives across the street. Early MTV videos are a major influence on Conor and his pals as they hone their look and sound, from Duran Duran to The Cure to Hall &amp; Oates. Sing Street&nbsp;is full of insanely catchy, original songs – and the accompanying music videos the band shoots are hilarious — but the poppy sound of the era is pervasive. Conor also has the benefit of an older brother (Jack Reynor) who helps shape his musical tastes, and their intense conversations about what’s good (the Sex Pistols) and what’s bad (Phil Collins) are consistently amusing. There’s quite a bit of bullying, language and smoking, but for the most part, Sing Street is a total joy.Watch now on:&nbsp;Amazon,&nbsp;FandangoNOW,&nbsp;iTunes","section":"Parental Guidance","tags":"TV, Crackle, women, The, YouTube, Reality, Hear, movies","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/18120454/Deadpool2-PG.jpg","slug":"remember-deadpool-2-is-not-for-kids"},{"id":"47508899015453","title":"Three Animated Monster Movies That Are Better than Hotel Transylvania 3","content":"Parental Guidancevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Three Animated Monster Movies That Are Better than Hotel Transylvania 3If you don't want to take your kids to Adam Sandler's animated adventure, here are a few better alternatives you can watch at home.by Christy Lemire | July 13, 2018 |  CommentsThe animated Hotel Transylvania franchise takes classic movie monsters and makes them kid-friendly, and while&nbsp;Hotel Transylvania 3: Summer Vacation is the best-reviewed of the bunch so far, it still falls a bit short of its peers in the genre. With that in mind, Christy Lemire offers a breakdown of what to expect if you take the kids to see it, and then suggests three other animated movies about monsters that will probably make for a far more pleasant viewing experience for everyone.THE&nbsp;MOVIEHotel Transylvania 3: Summer Vacation (2018)  62%Rating:&nbsp;PG, for some action and rude humor.Monsters and humans: They’re not so different after all! It’s the same fundamental point of the previous two Hotel Transylvania&nbsp;movies, only now they’re making it on a cruise ship. Still, an animated film that teaches kids to embrace others’ differences is always welcome, and especially now. And truthfully, these are some of the best movies we’ve ever seen starring Adam Sandler. Once again, the comedian lends his voice to the lead character of Dracula, who’s burned out from running his hotel for monsters. His daughter, Mavis (Selena Gomez), surprises him by taking him and all of his family and friends on a cruise getaway. Dracula isn’t thrilled about this idea until he sees the lovely and intriguing Captain Ericka (Kathryn Hahn). But she may have sinister plans in mind for Dracula and his pals as the great-granddaughter of the legendary vampire hunter Van Helsing (Jim Gaffigan), who’s now half man, half machine. As always, the humor is light and the antics are zippy. The characters are all monsters but they’re cute and colorful. (The green, gelatinous Blobby remains my personal favorite.) There’s a crooning sea creature (voiced by Joe Jonas) who may seem scary for very tiny kids, but his character eventually turns goofy like everyone else. Overall, I’d say this is a fine summer escape for kids ages 6 and older.THE RECOMMENDATIONSIf the latest Hotel Transylvania&nbsp;movie has your kids psyched up to see more animated monsters, here are a few suggestions you can share with them:Monsters, Inc. (2001)  96%Rating:&nbsp;GOne of the earliest Pixar films and still one of my favorites, it’ll inspire ugly crying during its more poignant developments. (The 2013 prequel Monsters University&nbsp;is a lot of fun, too, but not quite as emotionally deep.) Like the Hotel Transylvania&nbsp;series, Monsters Inc.&nbsp;suggests that seemingly scary creatures are just like us: They drive cars, they go on dinner dates, they go to work.&nbsp;But their job is scaring kids to capture their screams, which provide energy for Monstropolis, a vividly detailed city that looks more than a little like New York. The twist is, the monsters are deathly afraid of the children they scare. Billy Crystal and John Goodman bounce off each other beautifully as Mike and Sully, best friends whose lives get upended when they run into a little girl who isn’t frightened of them. It’s wacky and weird, colorful and crazy, and an excellent choice for the whole family.Watch now on: Amazon,&nbsp;FandangoNOW, iTunesTim Burton's Corpse Bride (2005)  84%Rating: PG, for some scary images and action, and brief mild language.Tim Burton has explored the creative storytelling possibilities of stop-motion animation in a few films, including The Nightmare Before Christmas&nbsp;(as a writer and producer) and the excellent Frankenweenie. But the melancholy sweetness of Corpse Bride&nbsp;gets me every time. It’s also just flat-out gorgeous to look at, with its vividly detailed characters and delightfully macabre settings. Burton regulars Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter lead an all-star cast in this romantic tale of a shy young man who’s torn between the woman his parents have arranged for him to marry and the woman he accidentally marries when she rises from the Land of the Dead.&nbsp;It might seem a little scary for very young kids, but it’s mostly magical. Death and decay abound, but in a playful and often musical way. Great for viewers around 8 and older.Watch now on:&nbsp;Amazon,&nbsp;FandangoNOW,&nbsp;iTunesKubo and the Two Strings (2016)  97%Rating:&nbsp;PG, for thematic elements, scary images, action and peril.This dazzlingly beautiful and deeply moving film was one of my favorites of 2016. It’s a traditional hero’s journey with inspired visuals and a starry voice cast. Another twisted offering from the Laika animation house (Coraline, The Boxtrolls), Kubo&nbsp;follows the adventures of a young boy (voiced by Art Parkinson) with the magical ability to bring his vibrant origami creatures to life through music. &nbsp;But he also must deal with heavy issues at home, including serving as the parent to his depressed mother, a witch warrior.&nbsp;With the help of a monkey named Monkey (Charlize Theron) and a beetle named Beetle (Matthew McConaughey), he goes on a quest to find three crucial pieces of armor that belonged to his late father, a valiant samurai. Like Corpse Bride,&nbsp;Kubo was created through painstaking stop-motion animation. But it also explores some ideas that may be disturbing for some young viewers. Kubo is in constant peril and under attack by an array of monsters from his earliest days. Among the challenges he must face are a sea of giant eyeballs and a set of creepy twins. There’s also a great deal of wonder here, though, as well as worthwhile themes of bravery and perseverance. Fine for viewers around 8 or 9 and older.Watch now on:&nbsp;Amazon,&nbsp;FandangoNOW,&nbsp;iTunes","section":"Parental Guidance","tags":"Winter, Comics","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/13153218/Animated-Monsters-Inc.jpg","slug":"three-animated-monster-movies-that-are-better-than-hotel-transylvania-3"},{"id":"47508900545319","title":"Three Female-Driven Adventure Films You Can Watch with the Family","content":"Parental Guidancevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Three Female-Driven Adventure Films You Can Watch with the FamilyIf you don't plan on seeing Tomb Raider this weekend, here are three worthy substitutes you can watch at home.by Christy Lemire | March 16, 2018 |  CommentsAlicia Vikander dons the tanktop and cargo pants to play Lara Croft in this week’s&nbsp;Tomb Raider, but it isn’t doing particularly well with critics, and it might be a little too intense for younger viewers. With that in mind, Christy Lemire gives us the rundown on the movie and recommends three more that you may serve as worthy substitutes if you decide to stay home this weekend.THE&nbsp;MOVIETomb Raider (2018)  52%Rating:&nbsp;PG-13, for sequences of violence and action, and some language.Alicia Vikander takes over the role of the adventurous, aristocratic video-game heroine Lara Croft, 17 years after Angelina Jolie first brought her to the screen. Norwegian director Roar Uthaug’s version is a bit of an origin story, introducing us to Lara as she lives a boho-chic life in London and learns what her long-missing father (Dominic West) really has been up to all these years. She travels to a mysterious and secluded island, teaming up with an inebriated boat captain (Daniel Wu) whose father also disappeared. Along the way, Lara gets the stuffing beaten out of her repeatedly, and usually by men, which is thoroughly unpleasant to watch. She also gets shot at, sucked down some roaring rapids and buried under the rubble of an explosion. Eventually she outwits, outplays, and outlasts them all, but the road there is brutal. There’s a lot of other potentially scary stuff for younger viewers, including dark and foreboding tombs, deadly booby traps and – ultimately – a cursed corpse. Through it all, Lara is brave and resourceful but also feels like a real human being with the fear she understandably conveys in a variety of situations. Vikander is such a good actress, she brings this larger-than-life character to life, and Tomb Raider&nbsp;is actually a more interesting and a better movie before Lara heads off on her adventure. I’d say this is suitable for viewers around 12 or 13 and older.THE RECOMMENDATIONSTomb Raider might be too grown up for your kids. If so, here are some other movies&nbsp;featuring&nbsp;female action heroes that you’ll enjoy sharing with your family:Brave (2012)  78%Rating: PG, for some scary action and rude humor.Pixar’s first film with a strong, young woman at its center is beautiful, thrilling, and long overdue. And while it may not be as novel from a narrative perspective as such an unprecedented story deserves, Brave has connected with a lot of little girls who look up its heroine for her fearlessness and pluck. Kelly Macdonald provides the voice of Merida, a feisty and free-spirited Scottish princess who makes a huge mistake and must use her bravery and archery skills to undo a curse and restore peace to her kingdom. Like many teenagers, Merida thinks for herself always, defying her mother’s wishes to be ladylike and prepare for marriage and beating the boys at an archery contest. Its positive messages are all more than worthwhile for young girls – and boys – but I wish the story as a whole didn’t rely so heavily on hackneyed fairy-tale tropes. There’s some vaguely unsettling stuff here for the littlest viewers involving animal transformations and some sorta-scary growling. But for the most part, this is a fine choice for viewers around 6 and older.Wonder Woman (2017)  93%Rating:&nbsp;PG-13, for sequences of violence and action and some suggestive content.You probably saw it last year – Wonder Woman&nbsp;has made nearly $822 million worldwide since its release last summer – but any opportunity to revisit Patty Jenkins’ beautifully crafted superhero origin story will do. Gal Gadot radiates charisma, bravery, and feminine power as the title character: an Amazon princess who comes into her own and learns how to use her formidable physical abilities for the good of humanity. Wonder Woman features a crucial, fundamental message about the importance of balancing empathy and strength. But it’s also rather intense — a big, violent superhero movie with long, graphic action sequences. Several characters die (albeit with little blood) and countless others are in peril during World War I battles. I’d say this is fine for viewers around 8 or 9. But the film’s driving themes of idealism and intelligence make it valuable for viewers of all ages.Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon (2001)  97%Rating:&nbsp;PG-13, for martial arts violence and some sexuality.Ang Lee’s martial-arts masterpiece was nominated for 10 Academy Awards and it won four, including ones for best foreign language film and for Peter Pau’s exquisite cinematography. Lee reinvented the genre here, turning punishing hits and kicks into a dreamy, gravity-defying ballet. Crouching Tiger&nbsp;features not one but two powerful women at the center of its ancient yet thrillingly modern tale: the gorgeous and commanding Michelle Yeoh and Zhang Ziyi as women of different generations united by their shared desire for freedom. Both figure prominently in many of the film’s dazzling fight scenes, staged by the great Hong Kong action choreographer Yuen Woo-ping. So yes, there is a ton of action here, and a couple of characters die, but there’s very little blood. Crouching Tiger&nbsp;is also swooningly romantic and it’s suggested that a couple of characters have sex, although we never see any nudity. If your kids are into action movies and want to see something truly groundbreaking – and they don’t mind reading subtitles for two hours – this is an excellent choice for tweens and older.","section":"Parental Guidance","tags":"Mindy, Returns, star, sports, on, indiana, cancelled, movie","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/16121313/Tomb-Raider-PG.jpg","slug":"three-female-driven-adventure-films-you-can-watch-with-the-family"},{"id":"47508900558637","title":"Don’t Care about the Super Bowl?

Here Are Three Football Movies You Can Watch with Your Family Insteadby Christy Lemire | February 2, 2018 |  CommentsThe big movie this week is the PG-13-rated haunted house flick&nbsp;Winchester, but it wasn’t screened for critics, so Christy offers an opinion on a smaller animated film that isn’t really for young children. And if you don’t care much for the Super Bowl this Sunday — or the teams in it — Christy also has three great suggestions for football movies you can watch with kids of different ages. Read on for the full list.THE MOVIEBilal: A New Breed of Hero (2018)  59%Rating:&nbsp;PG-13, for violence/warfare and some thematic elements.It’s an animated film with an inspiring story, but be warned: Bilal: A New Breed of Hero&nbsp;really isn’t for younger viewers. In telling the tale of a real-life slave who found his voice, followed his faith, and ultimately declared his independence, director and co-writer Khurram H. Alavi includes several battle scenes – some intimate, some massive, but all quite intense. Horses thunder across a dark, foreboding landscape, and a massive monster made of sand and fire with glowing red eyes swirls and hovers ominously. From the very start, our hero, Bilal – a 7th&nbsp;century slave in Hejaz, currently western Saudi Arabia – is in danger. Marauders strip his mother away in front of him and his sister. Later (when he’s voiced as a teen by Jacob Latimore and as an adult by Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje), he’s chained, beaten, and whipped for thinking for himself and following his own God at a time when others worshipped idols. The ultimate message is worthwhile, but the story is a bit of a slog, and it may be hard for young people to follow. Plus, the character design in the animation has a creepy, expressionless quality reminiscent of early performance-capture films like The Polar Express. Bilal&nbsp;means well, and it provides a cultural perspective we rarely see in animated movies, but it’s probably only suitable for tweens and older.THE RECOMMENDATIONSThis weekend, it’s also the Super Bowl. If you want to get psyched up for the big game – or you’d rather watch anything else besides the New England Patriots playing the Philadelphia Eagles – here are some football-themed movies you can enjoy with the family.Brian's Song (1970)  92%Rating:&nbsp;GThis was originally a made-for-TV movie, so you really, truly could have sat in front of the television with your family and watched this heartwarming story – back when there were only a handful of channels and you had to get up from your recliner to turn the knob. But its themes of kindness and racial harmony are just as relevant today as they were decades ago. Based on a true story, Brian’s Song&nbsp;follows the friendship between Chicago Bears teammates Brian Piccolo (James Caan) and Gale Sayers (Billy Dee Williams). Despite having different personalities and backgrounds, they become close, and even end up being the NFL’s first interracial roommates. When Piccolo is diagnosed with cancer and begins to deteriorate physically, Sayers is his biggest supporter and champion. It’s a weepy, but it’s surprisingly understated, and it earns the emotion it seeks. Very young children might find the sadness and/or uplift too difficult to process, but for slightly older viewers, there are a lot of worthwhile themes here. A good choice for kids around 8 and older.Rudy (1993)  78%Rating:&nbsp;PG, for mild language.It may seem super cheesy in retrospect, but it’s a classic and it’s worth sharing with your kids if they haven’t already seen it. The film from David Anspaugh (who also directed Hoosiers) is based on a true story, too: that of “Rudy” Ruettinger (Sean Astin). His lifelong dream was to play football for the University of Notre Dame despite being small at 5 foot 6 and not terribly athletic. He was also dyslexic, which made his classes at Notre Dame even more challenging. But through hard work, perseverance, and just plain heart, he makes the team and becomes a cherished figure. Rudy takes some tough hits on the field; off the field, he endures the harsh words of various people who don’t believe in him. There’s language scattered throughout, a scene of drinking, and a dramatic death. Yes, it’s a formulaic, feel-good sports movie, but it also offers valuable messages for young people about the importance of being focused and dedicated. Fine for viewers around 10 and older.Friday Night Lights (2004)  82%Rating:&nbsp;PG-13, for thematic issues, sexual content, language, some teen drinking and rough sports action.Before there was Friday&nbsp;Night Lights, the popular TV series, there was Friday&nbsp;Night Lights, the feature film, based on H.G. “Buzz” Bissinger’s eloquent and evocative non-fiction book of the same name. All three vividly capture the sensation that football is life in Texas – especially high school football, and especially in West Texas.&nbsp; But rather than overdramatize the Permian High School football team, director and co-writer Peter Berg goes in the opposite direction, depicting this world in stripped-down, bleached-out fashion. There is an awful lot of action, though. The football scenes, under the guidance of Billy Bob Thornton’s Coach Gaines, have a bone-jarring realism to them.&nbsp;Berg also explores the racial and socio-economic rifts that existed both within Odessa in the late 1980s and between Odessa and rival Midland, a wealthier, whiter town 20 miles east. We see the toll that alcoholism takes on the family of a party-boy tailback (Garrett Hedlund) and his abusive father (a chilling Tim McGraw). There’s also language, some frank sexual talk, and one passionate make-out scene. But Friday&nbsp;Night Lights&nbsp;is well cast and strongly acted, and high school students will likely respond to its authenticity. Fine for viewers around 13 and older.","section":"Parental Guidance","tags":"movies, and","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/02120659/Rudy-Football-Movies.jpg","slug":"dont-care-about-the-super-bowl-here-are-three-football-movies-you-can-watch-with-your-family-instead"},{"id":"47508902235957","title":"4 Family-Friendly Underdog Sports Movie Alternatives to I, Tonya","content":"Parental Guidancevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})4 Family-Friendly Underdog Sports Movie Alternatives to I, Tonyaby Christy Lemire | December 8, 2017 |  CommentsUnless your children are unusually interested in decades-old pop culture, it’s likely they neither know nor care about Tonya Harding and the criminal Olympic fiasco that has come to define her place in sports history. That said, the Margot Robbie-powered drama&nbsp;I, Tonya is, according to most critics, a powerful and fascinating look at the infamous figure skater’s life, and it’s currently Certified Fresh. If you don’t get a chance to see the film in its limited release this weekend, partially because you’ve got kids to think about, then here are some other underdog sports movies you can watch with the whole family, as recommended by film critic Christy Lemire.THE MOVIEI, Tonya (2018)  90%Rating:&nbsp;R, for pervasive language, violence, and some sexual content/nudity.I, Tonya is excellent but it’s definitely not kids – even if you have daughters who are into figure skating and think this world of sparkling artistry looks appealing. It earns its R rating early and often, with strong language throughout and scenes of domestic violence that are extremely difficult to watch. Director Craig Gillespie plays with the absurdity of Olympic figure skater Tonya Harding’s downfall, but he’s matter-of-fact and poignantly sympathetic in his depiction of the abuse she endured at the hands of both her mother and husband. Margot Robbie gives a powerhouse performance as Harding, who gained infamy outside her sport for her tangential role in the 1994 leg-whacking of rival Nancy Kerrigan. We see her suffer cruel and degrading verbal attacks from her mother (Allison Janney) before entering into a physically abusive marriage to Jeff Gillooly (Sebastian Stan). There’s also ton of smoking from the very start – her mother stands on the ice with a cigarette during one of the first times we see her. Teenagers could see this, probably, but it’s not suitable for anyone much younger. Quite a bit of it is disturbing, regardless of your age.THE RECOMMENDATIONSIf your kids are too young for I, Tonya but you’d like to share another underdog sports movie with them, here are a few suggestions:Ice Castles (1978)  44%Rating:&nbsp;PG, for some mild language.I loved this movie so much when I was a little girl, and I’ll admit it still chokes me up now as an adult. Maybe that’s the power of nostalgia. Anyway, ignore the Tomatometer score, because it’s great – although, in retrospect, it does look rather dated. Lynn-Holly Johnson stars as Lexie Winston, a 16-year-old figure skater from small-town Iowa with dreams of Olympic greatness. She rises to stardom quickly and forgets her wholesome roots, only to fall just as fast and lose it all when a freak skating accident leaves her mostly blind. (Yes, I realize how corny this sounds.) There are some uncomfortable scenes of tough love as Lexie’s former coach (the great Colleen Dewhurst) urges her to stop feeling sorry for herself and return to the outside world after the accident. Lexie and her hockey player boyfriend (the dreamy Robby Benson) kiss quite a bit. There’s some smoking – it was the ‘70s, after all. And at the height of Lexie’s fame, she enters into a romantic relationship with a much older TV reporter, which is just creepy and wrong on multiple levels. But Ice Castles&nbsp;has all kinds of worthwhile themes about the power of perseverance and overcoming adversity.The Karate Kid (1984)  89%Rating:&nbsp;PG, for adult situations/language and violence.Your kids already may have seen the hugely popular 2010 remake starring Jaden Smith, which made nearly $360 million worldwide. Now, it’s time to show them the original. It is the prototype for the feel-good, come-from-behind sports movie. Looking back now, I can see the wheels turning in its formulaic machinery, but I don’t care. I saw the original Karate Kid&nbsp;so many times when I was 12 years old, I could recite the dialogue along with the actors, and I dreamed of being Elisabeth Shue. (She did have amazing hair). But this movie is all about Ralph Macchio as a scrawny kid from New Jersey who moves to Los Angeles with his single mom and promptly gets his butt kicked by the high school bullies, led by ultimate ‘80s-movie villain William Zabka. He learns karate with the help of his unorthodox teacher, handyman Mr. Miyagi (the iconic Pat Morita), and redeems himself at The Big Competition. There’s quite a bit of violence as the mean guys beat the daylights out of Macchio’s character early in the movie. Mr. Miyagi gets drunk and sadly reminisces about the family he lost in World War II; there’s also a tiny bit of marijuana use. And Macchio and Shue kiss a little. But The Karate Kid&nbsp;is a classic, and a must-see for viewers around 9 or 10 and older.The Bad News Bears (1976)  97%Rating:&nbsp;PG.This also was remade – by Richard Linklater in 2005, when the title was just Bad News Bears&nbsp;– but the original is hilarious and extremely of its time. Despite the PG rating, there’s quite a bit of language here from adults and kids as well as some inappropriate racial remarks. (You could use it as an opportunity to teach your children what not to say, perhaps.) We also see kids smoking and drinking beer. But the cast of characters is so colorful and distinct and their rousing road to greatness is so unlikely, it’s hard not to be charmed. The great Walter Matthau stars as the reluctant coach of a terrible Little League team. He’s a serious alcoholic struggling to lead a group of unruly, profane misfits. But the addition of a talented female pitcher (Tatum O’Neal) and a tough-guy hitter (Jackie Earle Haley) gives him hope and turns his team into a contender. Despite the grown-up nature of some of the film, The Bad News Bears&nbsp;has an infectious joy that will appeal to adults and kids alike. And its themes of teamwork and persistence are certainly worthwhile.Cool Runnings (1993)  76%Rating:&nbsp;PG.It’s silly and super formulaic, but Cool Runnings&nbsp;is also a funny and feel-good movie the whole family can enjoy. It’s based on the true story of the Jamaican bobsled team, which was a surprising competitor in the 1988 Winter Olympic Games in Calgary. When an accident keeps a track athlete (Leon) out of the summer games, he finds a winter sport to compete in instead. A disgraced former gold medalist (the late, great John Candy) becomes the team’s unlikely coach. There’s a lot of slapsticky physical humor here as the Jamaicans struggle to train for a cold-weather sport in a summery climate — and of course, the transition to the snowy setting of Canada comes as a shock. The Jamaicans are depicted with rather over-the-top, goofy personalities, as are their rivals. And there’s a barroom brawl as well as some mild language scattered throughout. But as in the other recommendations on this list, Cool Runnings&nbsp;has inspiring themes of teamwork, overcoming the odds and dreaming big.","section":"Parental Guidance","tags":"talk, Go, a, Trivia, The, Land, Disney, Schmidt, History","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/08131433/I-Tonya-PG.jpg","slug":"4-family-friendly-underdog-sports-movie-alternatives-to-i-tonya"},{"id":"47508900556588","title":"Peter Rabbit and Three More Talking Animal Movies Your Kids Will Love","content":"Parental Guidancevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Peter Rabbit and Three More Talking Animal Movies Your Kids Will Loveby Christy Lemire | February 9, 2018 |  CommentsThe only big release this week that’s appropriate for children is, of course, Peter Rabbit, and if you’re headed to the theater to see it, critics say it’s not great, but it’s not terrible either.&nbsp;On the other hand, if you’d rather stay home, but still want to watch a light-hearted romp full of talking animals, Christy Lemire offers three alternatives, including another Rotten&nbsp;selection that still might delight your kids. Read on for the full list.THE MOVIEPeter Rabbit (2018)  63%Rating:&nbsp;PG, for some rude humor and action.This live-action version of the beloved Beatrix Potter novels features a menagerie of talking animals plotting various ways to invade Mr. McGregor’s garden. But it’s not nearly as mild-mannered as the source material might suggest. The cast is solid, though. James Corden provides the voice of the daring, devil-may-care Peter; Margot Robbie, Daisy Ridley, and Sia are among the supporting players. When the mean, old McGregor dies suddenly (a moment that’s played for laughs), his great nephew Thomas (Domhnall Gleeson) arrives to take over the property and restore order. Madcap hilarity ensues as Peter and Thomas ratchet up their attacks on each other. This includes a ton of slapsticky physical humor, clever visual gags, and word play, as well as painful traps and massive explosions. There’s also a teensy bit of flirting and kissing between Thomas and his neighbor in the countryside (Rose Byrne), who’s long been a friend to Peter and his bunny buddies. Fine for viewers around 6 and older.THE RECOMMENDATIONSIf Peter Rabbit&nbsp;has you thinking about other live-action talking-animal movies, as it has for me, here are a few suggestions for you to revisit with your kids or even watch for the first time:Babe (1995)  97%Rating:&nbsp;GIt is the gold standard, of course – and that’s still true more than two decades later. The original Babe&nbsp;was nominated for seven Academy Awards including best picture and director, and it won for its visual effects. Chris Noonan’s film is so sweet and so heartwarming, I want to cry just thinking about it. The late, veteran voiceover actress Christina Cavanaugh charmingly provides the voice of Babe, a plucky pig who dreams of herding sheep. When Farmer Hoggett (the Oscar-nominated James Cromwell) spares the piglet from becoming Christmas dinner, Babe becomes a part of things on the farm. His friendship with border collie Fly (Miriam Margolyes) inspires Babe to seek a higher purpose in his life: to become a competitive sheepherder. It seems unlikely, given that Babe is… well, he’s a pig. And the other animals aren’t always welcoming because they view him as different. But Babe&nbsp;is all about overcoming prejudices, finding common ground and achieving difficult goals. Its messages are important but never heavy-handed; they’re subtle but easy enough for even the youngest viewers to understand. There’s some possibly disturbing material in here about the fact that animals get turned into food. But otherwise, this is an excellent choice for the whole family.The Jungle Book (2016)  94%Rating:&nbsp;PG, for some sequences of scary action and peril.Kids around 6 and older will love this live-action take on the Rudyard Kipling classic. They’ve probably already seen it – Jon Favreau’s film made nearly a billion dollars worldwide when it came out a couple years ago – but it’s definitely worth revisiting.&nbsp;The images are lush, vivid and immersive. But the movie as a whole is also just a ton of fun, with thrilling action sequences, delightful musical numbers and lively performances from a strong cast. You know the story by now: Man-cub Mowgli (played by excellent newcomer Neel Sethi) struggles to find his place in the world amid a variety of animals — wolves, panthers, bears, tigers, snakes — as he grows into a young man. The top-notch voice cast includes Ben Kingsley, Bill Murray, Lupita Nyong’o, Scarlett Johansson and Idris Elba. But much of the action could be too intense for very young viewers, including the brutal brawls between the panther who protects Mowgli and the tiger who’s trying to kill him. Wildfires devastate much of the jungle. Mowgli is pretty much in constant peril. And there is a significant character death. My son was 6 ½ when I took him with me to a screening of “The Jungle Book” and he didn’t find anything frightening, but kids who are sensitive to that kind of intense danger might.Cats &amp; Dogs (2001)  54%Rating:&nbsp;PG, for animal action and humor.Sean Hayes voices a diabolical talking cat hell-bent on world domination who goes by the name of Mr. Tinkles. What more do you need to know? Cats &amp; Dogs&nbsp;was considered pretty high-tech in its day, and the visual effects still look decent. It’s not important cinema, by any means, but it’s crazy, playful fun – especially if you have a dog, or a cat, or both in your house. And, like The Jungle Book, it features an all-star voice cast, which makes the dialogue better than it has a right to be. Besides Hayes, who’s the perfect choice to play a power-hungry Persian cat, there’s Tobey Maguire, Alec Baldwin, Susan Sarandon, Joe Pantoliano, Jon Lovitz, and the venerable Charlton Heston as “The Mastiff.” Basically, this action comedy pits cats against dogs for control of the world (or at least humans’ affections). Their antics get seriously over-the-top, and there’s quite a bit of potty humor including kitty litter and dog poop. It’s all silly stuff that little kids will love. And watching animals go about their day functioning like people is always amusing, simply because it looks so ridiculous. Fine for all ages.","section":"Parental Guidance","tags":"Disney, Opinion, fast, latino, King, on, ratings, MSNBC, FX, Month, vampires, &, Lucasfilm","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/09115205/Peter-Rabbit-PG.jpg","slug":"peter-rabbit-and-three-more-talking-animal-movies-your-kids-will-love"},{"id":"47508900559662","title":"Four Family-Friendly Oscar-Nominated Films to Watch instead of Maze Runner","content":"Parental Guidancevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Four Family-Friendly Oscar-Nominated Films to Watch instead of Maze Runnerby Christy Lemire | January 26, 2018 |  CommentsAccording to critics, unless you were just dying to find out what happens in the final chapter of the&nbsp;Maze Runner franchise, you may not&nbsp;find&nbsp;The Death Cure particularly entertaining. That said, the nominees for this year’s Oscars were just announced on Tuesday, which means there are plenty of better movies you can catch up on with your family. Read on for Christy’s analysis of&nbsp;Maze Runner: The Death Cure and a handful of alternative suggestions — including an animated short — that were nominated for Academy Awards.THE MOVIEMaze Runner: The Death Cure (2018)  43%Rating:&nbsp;PG-13, for&nbsp;intense sequences of sci-fi violence and action, language, and some thematic elements.The final installment in the Maze Runner&nbsp;trilogy is as bleak, intense and violent as you’d expect from a Young Adult film set in a dystopian future. If you’ve seen the previous two films from director Wes Ball, based on James Dashner’s books, you know what you’re in for here: shootouts, fistfights, death, destruction and – oh, yeah – zombies. Because there’s a plague, and they’ve been infected. This time, Thomas (Dylan O’Brien) and his friends must save the remaining immune children from the evil clutches of the adults at WCKD (including Patricia Clarkson and Aidan Gillen), who want to experiment on them to find a cure. Eventually there’s a happy ending – or at least a vaguely hopeful one – but the road there is lined with bodies of young people and adults alike. There’s quite a bit of strong language throughout and one climactic kiss. At 142 minutes, it’s also really long – and just when you think it’s ending, it keeps going, and going. I’d say this is fine for mature tweens and older, especially if they’ve seen the first two movies and are desperate to know how this saga ends.THE RECOMMENDATIONSIf the latest Maze Runner&nbsp;movie is too much for your kids to handle, why not catch up with some of the films nominated for Academy Awards this week? Here are a few suggestions.Coco (2017)  97%Rating:&nbsp;PG, for thematic elements.Nominated for: Best Animated FeatureYou may have seen this movie already – it’s made over $657 million worldwide since its release in November – but it’s certainly worth revisiting. The latest animated extravaganza from Disney/Pixar is so colorful and richly detailed, there’s no way to absorb it all in one sitting. It’s a great choice for kids around 5 or 6 and older, even though much of&nbsp;director Lee Unkrich’s film takes place in the Land of the Dead, which is full of talking, singing skeletons and spirit animals that, at times, might seem menacing. It’s beautiful, but danger abounds. Miguel (voiced by Anthony Gonzalez), a 12-year-old boy from a Mexican family of shoemakers, dreams of becoming a musician like his idol, movie and singing star Ernesto de la Cruz (Benjamin Bratt). But his family hasn’t allowed music in the house for generations because of a long-ago betrayal. On Dia de los Muertos – the traditional Day of the Dead – Miguel visits the Land of the Dead to fulfill his destiny and learn his true identity. The skeletons are mostly warm and friendly. Miguel’s ancestors, who’ve been watching over him, welcome him and help him get back home. But while scenes in which elderly relatives appear feeble, forgetful and on the brink of death might seem confusing or sad to small children, they also offer the chance to talk about the importance of honoring the cultural contributions of our ancestors.Star Wars: The Last Jedi (2017)  90%Rating:&nbsp;PG-13, for sequences of sci-fi action and violence.Nominated for:&nbsp;Best Sound Editing, Sound Mixing, Original Score and Visual Effects.Perhaps you’ve heard: There’s a new Star Wars movie. And now, Episode VIII has earned four Academy Award nominations. One of them is for John Williams’ iconic score – the 50th&nbsp;nomination of the great composer’s lengthy career. Writer-director Rian Johnson’s film is one of the absolute best of the Star Wars&nbsp;saga, and it’s the most jaw-droppingly beautiful installment yet. It’s thrilling and moving with a surprisingly cheeky humorous streak and a deep emotional resonance. If your kids have seen the previous films, they’ll enjoy the comedy and energy here as well as the many exciting action sequences. But if you have very young children, or if they they’re not familiar with these characters and this world, The Last Jedi&nbsp;may be a lot for them to handle. It’s long at two and a half hours and features many intense battles, including a dazzling light-saber duel. Many characters perish in elaborate dogfights between the plucky Rebellion and the evil First Order. Their diabolical leader, Snoke (Andy Serkis), might be too creepy for many kids. And several characters find themselves on the verge of execution. But it’s a complete blast and very much worth seeing in the theater to enjoy the awards-worthy sound and visuals.Dunkirk (2017)  92%Rating:&nbsp;PG-13, for intense war experience and some language.Nominated for:&nbsp;Best Picture, Director, Cinematography, Film Editing, Sound Editing, Sound Mixing, Production Design.One of my absolute favorite movies of 2017 is also one of the most-nominated. Christopher Nolan’s World War II epic was honored in seven categories including best picture and director. And it’s amazing to think this is Nolan’s first directing nomination, since he’s given us some of the most influential films of the past generation, including Memento, The Dark Knight, and Inception. I actually think his screenplay should have been nominated, too, since the intricate narrative structure is one of the most impressive parts of the film.&nbsp;From a variety of perspectives over three interlocking time frames, Nolan depicts the evacuation of the beach at Dunkirk as Allied soldiers found themselves surrounded and forced to flee. Tom Hardy, Kenneth Branagh, Mark Rylance, Cillian Murphy, and Harry Styles are among the players whose fates intersect. Dunkirk&nbsp;features nearly constant violence and danger, as you would expect from a war picture. The soldiers are under attack from the air, ground and sea. Many characters (and extras) are shot to death, but there’s barely any blood. And there’s surprisingly only a bit of language, but that includes the one F-word you get in a PG-13 movie. Mostly, though, the unrelenting suspense on display here is what may disturb younger viewers. That, and the noise – the sound design is exquisite (and is among the film’s many nominations) but the gunfire is very loud, as are the screams as men find themselves trapped, abandoning ships, drowning or burning to death. But I’d say this is OK for mature tweens and older — and at an hour and 46 minutes, it’s surprisingly short.Dear BasketballRating: Not rated.Nominated for: Best Animated Short.It’s only about five minutes long and you don’t even need to go to a theater to see it — it’s available online (right here). And with Dear Basketball, Kobe Bryant can add “Oscar nominee” to his long list of accomplishments and accolades. The former Lakers superstar created and narrated this short, an animated version of the poem he wrote which appeared in The Players’ Tribune, announcing his retirement from basketball in November 2015. As directed by veteran animator Glen Keane — whose work has appeared in movies including Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin, and Tangled&nbsp;– Dear Basketball&nbsp;depicts Bryant’s love of the sport from his youth through the height of his powers. It looks like a series of charcoal pencil sketches come to life – simple but fluid, with bold splashes of purple and gold, the Lakers’ colors. It’s Kobe’s ode to Kobe, but it might inspire your kids to aspire for greatness of their own. Fine for all ages.","section":"Parental Guidance","tags":"spanish, cancelled, TV, docudrama, Cartoon, game-of-thrones, Paramount, Film","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/26144508/Maze-Runner-Death-Cure-PG.jpg","slug":"four-family-friendly-oscar-nominated-films-to-watch-instead-of-maze-runner"},{"id":"47508902227763","title":"5 Movie Musicals to Watch with Your Family During the Holidays","content":"Parental Guidancevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})5 Movie Musicals to Watch with Your Family During the Holidaysby Christy Lemire | December 22, 2017 |  CommentsThere are two big movie musicals out in theaters this weekend, namely the Hugh Jackman-powered portrait of circus mogul P.T. Barnum and the third (and presumably final) entry in the wildly popular&nbsp;Pitch Perfect franchise. Both are relatively safe to watch with your kids, depending on their ages, but if you can’t get out to the theaters — or don’t particularly feel like venturing into the cold — then Christy Lemire has some alternative suggestions for you.THE MOVIESThe Greatest Showman (2017)  57%Rating:&nbsp;PG, for thematic elements including a brawl.Hugh Jackman stars as charismatic circus impresario P.T. Barnum in this glossy and peppy but ultimately empty musical extravaganza. The songs from the Oscar-winning La La Land&nbsp;writers Justin Hurwitz and Benj Pasek are catchy (if a bit repetitive). It’s the connective tissue between them that leaves a lot to be desired. First-time director Michael Gracey depicts Barnum in sanitized fashion: a plucky scrapper who amasses a menagerie of oddities and outsiders to put on display in hopes of impressing stuffy New Yorkers. Along the way, he hoodwinks whomever he must to get the money to launch his show and turn it into a massive spectacle. He also neglects his wife (Michelle Williams) and two little girls as his own celebrity grows. A subplot involving an opera singer (Rebecca Ferguson) who falls for Barnum ends quickly and harmlessly. Similarly, the interracial romance between Zac Efron (as Barnum’s wealthy partner) and Zendaya (as a trapeze artist) only briefly reflects the societal obstacles they face. There’s also a bit of rioting from disapproving crowds and a giant fire. But the overall theme of being yourself and expressing your true identity is worthwhile — and we get hammered over the head with it, so it’s hard to miss. Fine for viewers around 8 and older.Pitch Perfect 3 (2017)  29%Rating:&nbsp;PG-13, for&nbsp;crude and sexual content, language and some action.The third (and supposedly final) movie in the hugely successful Pitch Perfect&nbsp;trilogy is a lot like the first two. The a cappella songs are high-energy (and highly overproduced) but they’re a lot of fun. In between, there’s some semblance of plot. The difference this time is that director Trish Sie and screenwriter Kay Cannon have tossed all semblance of realism out the window and turned this last installment into a girl power-infused, James Bond-style action picture. Anna Kendrick, Rebel Wilson, Brittany Snow, Hailee Steinfeld and their cohorts are back as the Barden Bellas singing group. But now they’re (mostly) out of college, so they need the contrivance of a USO tour through Spain, Italy and France to reunite them. One constant is the high-energy (and highly inappropriate) humor of Wilson as perpetual scene-stealer Fat Amy. She’s very physical and sexual. There’s also quite a bit of language and partying. Oh yeah, and an exploding yacht. Aca-loha means goodbye. Suitable for tweens and older.THE RECOMMENDATIONSIf these musicals aren’t the best fit for the whole family, here are some other suggestions you might enjoy this holiday weekend:Singin' in the Rain (1952)  100%Rating:&nbsp;GAn absolute classic, of course – one of the greatest musicals ever made, but also one of the greatest movies ever made, period, regardless of genre. The late, great Gene Kelly stars as a silent-movie star making the transition into talkies with the help of his best friend (Donald O’Connor) and an up-and-coming actress (Debbie Reynolds). The title number is iconic, but the choreography and energy of “Good Morning” is just spectacular. Reynolds is completely adorable, and the whole movie has an infectious joy that will leave you in the best mood for the rest of the day. There’s a little bit of kissing here and there but it’s harmless, and Kelly’s dance routine with the exquisite Cyd Charisse is slightly racy. Very young kids won’t get the ins and outs of the film industry depicted here, but it doesn’t matter. Singin’ in the Rain&nbsp;is a great choice for the whole family, whether you’ve never seen it or enjoyed it countless times.Easter Parade (1948)  91%Rating:&nbsp;Not RatedAnother behind-the-scenes show business story, and another MGM movie musical for the ages. It’s the only cinematic pairing of Fred Astaire and Judy Garland but it’s a doozy, with several classic Irving Berlin tunes including the title song, “I Love a Piano,” and “We’re a Couple of Swells.” Astaire plays a Broadway star who recruits a chorus girl (Garland) to dance alongside him when his longtime partner (the great Ann Miller) leaves him for a solo career. He’s mesmerizing (and makes it look effortless, as always) in “Steppin’ Out With My Baby” and Miller dazzles in “Shakin’ the Blues Away.” Some of the choreography could be considered suggestive, but it’s also colorful, intricate, and a complete blast to watch. Ultimately, Easter Parade is about teamwork, artistic collaboration and – not unlike The Greatest Showman – finding your true voice.Xanadu (1980)  29%Rating:&nbsp;PGXanadu&nbsp;is amazing and it’s only gotten better with time – so much so that it spawned an affectionately mocking, Tony-nominated Broadway musical. Maybe it’s the nostalgia talking, because I pretty much wanted to be Olivia Newton-John when I was 8 years old – she was so pretty and she could sing and roller skate at the same time – but this movie is also just big, silly, colorful fun. It’s extremely of its time: the fashions, the neon, the skating, the overall disco vibe. But like the Pitch Perfect&nbsp;movies, Xanadu&nbsp;is all about girl power. Newton-John plays a Greek muse named Kira who magically appears and helps a struggling artist (Michael Beck) realize his dream of turning a dilapidated art deco auditorium into a roller disco palace – through song! The Electric Light Orchestra tunes are extremely catchy and the choreography is… well, it’s energetic. Xanadu&nbsp;also happens to be Gene Kelly’s final film, so maybe you can do a double feature of this and Singin’ in the Rain after you open presents.","section":"Parental Guidance","tags":"telelvision, PlayStation, The, werewolf, color, on, remakes, LGBTQ, Plus, superhero","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/22130118/Musicals-PG.jpg","slug":"5-movie-musicals-to-watch-with-your-family-during-the-holidays"},{"id":"47508900563760","title":"Three Alternatives to The Commuter You Can Watch with the Family","content":"Parental Guidancevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Three Alternatives to The Commuter You Can Watch with the Familyby Christy Lemire | January 12, 2018 |  CommentsPaddington 2 is clearly aimed at younger audiences, and it also appears to be one of the year’s earliest successes, currently sporting an impressive Certified Fresh 100% on the Tomatometer with over 130 reviews. In other words, if you’re taking the whole family to the movies this weekend, it’s probably a pretty safe choice. But there’s another movie opening this week that’s rated PG-13 and stars Liam Neeson, and some of your older kids might be more in the mood for the kind of explosive action it promises. Read on for Christy’s take on both of them, as well as three age-appropriate alternatives to&nbsp;The Commuter you might want to consider if you’re planning on staying home.THE MOVIESPaddington 2 (2018)  99%Rating:&nbsp;PG, for some action and mild rude humor.This delightful sequel proves that the 2015 live-action family film Paddington&nbsp;was no fluke. Director Paul King once again finds a charming combination of sweetness and smarts, elaborate physical comedy and feel-good sentiment. And the visual effects are just dazzling. The twee bear Paddington (once again voiced by Ben Whishaw) uses his guiding mantra – be kind to others and everything will be OK – to help him navigate a series of misadventures, including being framed for a burglary and going to prison. It may sound dark, but the tone is playful and light. Even Paddington’s hardened fellow prisoners quickly come around to the simple joys of marmalade and bedtime stories. Hugh Grant, as the preening former actor who’s the real criminal, is villainous in a flamboyantly theatrical way. It’s a performance that’s always played for laughs (and always funny). And the fundamental message of both movies – the importance of being decent to people who may seem scary or different – is more important than ever for kids to hear. An excellent choice for the whole family.The Commuter (2018)  55%Rating:&nbsp;PG-13, for some intense action/violence and language.Liam Neeson once again gets to show off his very particular set of skills as an ex-cop who gets dragged into a dangerous scheme while commuting home from New York City. As in the Taken&nbsp;series and other later-career films like Non-Stop&nbsp;and Unknown, Neeson gets to kick all kinds of butt, but he bears the brunt of a lot of hits and kicks here, too, both inside and outside the train. We see a dead body at one point, and several other passengers suffer painful fates including beatings, stabbings, and shootings. There’s quite a bit of language scattered throughout and a doozy of a train wreck at the film’s climax. For older viewers, though, action director Jaume Collet-Serra’s film is a lot of fun and it moves really well. And even though the story eventually goes off the rails – literally and figuratively – it’s certainly never dull. Fine for viewers around ages 12 or 13 and older.THE RECOMMENDATIONSIf The Commuter is too intense and violent for your kids – and it probably will be — here are some other movies that take place on trains that might be a good fit. All aboard:The Polar Express (2004)  56%Rating:&nbsp;G.The motion-capture performances and visual effects may look creepy and outdated now, given how far we’ve come in terms of technology. But in its day, Robert Zemeckis’ animated adventure was pretty groundbreaking. You’ve probably seen it many times with your family – you may even have watched it over the holidays – but beyond being a Christmas movie, this is also fundamentally a train movie. Based on the book of the same name, The Polar Express&nbsp;follows the adventures of a young boy named Billy (Hayden McFarland) whose belief in Santa Claus is wavering. On Christmas Eve, a train magically pulls up and the conductor (Tom Hanks) invites him aboard for a trip to the North Pole. Along the way, Billy learns lessons about bravery, faith and friendship. The train zooms along, sometimes out of control, but it also runs into several obstacles. And children are sometimes in danger, as is so often the case in animated movies. For this most part, though, this is all wholesome stuff. Fine for the whole family.Unstoppable (2010)  87%Rating:&nbsp;PG-13, for sequences of action and peril, and some violence.A train carrying hazardous material is barreling out of control across Pennsylvania, and only Denzel Washington can stop it (with some help from Chris Pine). This is a really intense viewing experience but it’s also a lot of fun, and the material is the perfect fit for the late director Tony Scott’s hyperkinetic style. Based on a true story, Unstoppable&nbsp;stars Washington as a veteran engineer who’s being forced into retirement. Pine plays the younger, cheaper rookie conductor he resents. The two must team up to prevent a massive catastrophe as another train threatens small towns and even a school but full of children at speeds up to 80 mph. Unstoppable isn’t so much violent as it is suspenseful, and the threat of death and destruction looms large. There’s a bit of language here and there. But the movie is also about teamwork and bravery, which is worthwhile. Fine for viewers around 10 and older.Strangers on a Train (1951)  98%Rating:&nbsp;PG.My favorite Alfred Hitchcock movie, and one that tends to get overlooked in favor of his more famous films like Psycho, The Birds, Vertigo&nbsp;and North by Northwest. But in retrospect, its premise has inspired or been referenced in countless other movies, most notably Danny DeVito’s Throw Momma From the Train, which was a darkly comic remake. Based on a novel by the great Patricia Highsmith, Strangers on a Train introduces us to two men who meet in transit and realize after chatting for a bit that they share a similar problem: Each has a person he’d like to rid from his life. So they swap murders – “criss-cross,” as Robert Walker’s character says to Farley Granger’s – making neither of them a suspect in either crime. It’s a rather grown-up concept, executed with masterful camerawork and exquisite tension. For older kids around ages 13 and up – especially those with an interest in classic film – it’s an absolute must-see.","section":"Parental Guidance","tags":"golden, FX, DirecTV","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/12132429/The-Commuter-PG.jpg","slug":"three-alternatives-to-the-commuter-you-can-watch-with-the-family"},{"id":"47508993191575","title":"Total Recall: Bill Murray’s Best Movies","content":"Total Recallvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Total Recall: Bill Murray's Best MoviesWe count down the comedian's 15 best-reviewed films.by Jeff Giles | October 8, 2008 |  CommentsHe got his start on Saturday Night Live and made his big-screen bones on a succession of comedies that traded heavily on his easygoing, wisecracking charm — then kicked off the second phase of his film career by sublimating all that charm in a series of roles that took a less-is-more approach to exploring his dramatic side, and earned the best reviews of his career in the process. Most actors wouldn’t be able to pull off that kind of transition (see: Carrey, Jim), but then, most actors aren’t blessed with equal chops on either side of the funny line. Bill Murray, on the other hand, owns that line — and with his latest film, City of Ember, opening today, we here at RT thought there was no better time to take a look back at some of his best performances. After all, you never know when he’s going to take another prolonged break from filmmaking, right? Get ready to laugh, cry, and pretend Garfield never existed.more info…15.Meatballs(1979)Tomatometer: 71%Ah, the summer camp movie. It’s a genre that’s long since been bled dry — andit’s always provoked a gag reflex in critics — but once upon a time, comediesabout sex-starved teenagers running wild at camp were all the rage, and 1979’sMeatballs was one of the first (and, not coincidentally, best). Whileit certainly isn’t Murray’s finest 90 minutes, it does have plenty of solidhumor and light charm to go with all the hormonal antics, and it offers aninteresting early glimpse at the development of Murray, screenwriter HaroldRamis, and director Ivan Reitman. (If you haven’t seen it in awhile, Meatballsis especially fascinating as an example of what passed for raunchy in 1979.)Although the franchise went on to suffer grevious misuse — Meatballs IIfeatured an alien, Meatballs III is something Patrick Dempsey wouldprobably dearly love to forget, and the fourth installment starred CoreyFeldman and was released direct to DVD — the original is, as Dennis Schwartzof Ozus’ World Movie Reviews put it, “As easy to handle as drinking lemonadeunder a shady tree.”&nbsp;&nbsp;more info…14.Mad Dog and Glory (1993)Tomatometer: 72%One of Murray’s more unusual (and lesser-seen) roles came in thislove story/dramedy hybrid, which found both Murray and Robert De Niro playingagainst type: Murray as a Mob boss (and aspiring stand-up comedian), and DeNiro as the meek, bottled-up police detective who saves his life and “earns”the temporary, uh, use of a prostitute named Glory (played by Uma Thurman). Asyou might imagine, Mad Dog and Glory had a bit of a balancing act topull off, and according to most critics, it wasn’t always successful. Althoughmany writers expressed pleasant surprise at the suddenly commercial turn fromdirector Richard McNaughton (then best known for his work on Henry:Portrait of a Serial Killer), and praised the typically sharp dialogue inRichard Price’s script, ultimately, most critics felt that Mad Dog‘smany shifts in style and tone were too much to completely overcome. Still, itsstars earned high marks for their out-of-character performances; Time Out’sDerek Adams, for one, noted that “De Niro seems committed to the part of thesensitive loner, while Murray all but succeeds in mixing smooth and sinister,heartfelt and hot-tempered.”&nbsp;&nbsp;more info…13.Caddyshack (1980)Tomatometer: 76%There are probably more eminently quotable movies from the early’80s, but not many, and none of them boast the iconic performance of BillMurray as the mumbling, borderline psychotic groundskeeper/groundhog battlerCarl Spackler. Despite being only one member of a very funny ensemble castthat includes Chevy Chase, Rodney Dangerfield, and Ted Knight, Murrayessentially walked away with the movie, thanks in part to an oft-quoted (andtotally improvised) monologue involving the Dalai Lama and the immortal phrase“So I got that goin’ for me, which is nice.” Thanks to a hilarious script andan impressive run at the box office, Caddyshack went on to become oneof the most influential films of the ’80s, at least in terms of inspiringscores of similarly raunchy (but unfailingly inferior) teen comedies, butcritics mostly turned up their noses at the time — and although the film’sstature has grown in the last 28 years, their slowly building respect is stillexpressed grudgingly: DVDTown’s John J. Puccio spoke for many of his peerswhen he said it has “very few saving graces,” but admitted that he harbors “aguilty pleasure in watching it, at least in bits and pieces.”more info…12.The RoyalTenenbaums(2001)Tomatometer: 80%What, you thought Rushmore was quirky? Sucker. With his nextmovie, Wes Anderson proved that was just a warm-up act: The RoyalTenenbaums takes offbeat character studies to a whole new level, makingthe Coen brothers seem like staid conformists in comparison. Here, Andersontakes an unwieldy cast — including Gene Hackman, Anjelica Huston, BenStiller, Gwyneth Paltrow, Danny Glover, Luke and Owen Wilson, and, of course,Bill Murray — and wrangles them into a suitably convoluted plot involving thescheming patriarch of the oddball Tenenbaum clan. As cuckolded neurologistRaleigh St. Clair, Murray doesn’t carry a great deal of the film’s weight onhis shoulders, but one could argue that his typically subtle performance(summed up beautifully in the scene where he learns of his wife’s variousmarital transgressions) helps anchor a movie constantly in danger of floatingright off the rails. It wasn’t a huge hit at the box office, but like Rushmore,it enjoyed largely positive reviews and has continued to build a following onthe home market. Although critics had their issues with Tenenbaums,most of them agreed with the Chicago Reader’s Jonathan Rosenbaum, who said“Whatever my qualms, it’s still one of the funniest comedies around.”&nbsp;&nbsp;more info…11.What About Bob?(1991)Tomatometer: 81%Bill Murray has always excelled at playing unflappable slackers,while nobody can handle the role of an uptight fussbudget with quite theaplomb of Richard Dreyfuss — which meant that pitting them against each otherin 1991’s What About Bob? was virtually a guarantee of critical andcommercial success. Fortunately for fans of progressively over-the-top comedy,the movie basically delivered on that guarantee — although it’s perhaps notas consistently hilarious as some of Murray’s truly classic comedies, it wentdown as easily one of the funniest films of the year. What About Bob?boasts some of Frank Oz’s lightest direction, which is truly saying something,but it makes sense; all he had to do, really, was let the cameras — andMurray and Dreyfuss — run with their characters. Murray’s Bob is awell-meaning soul whose many phobias prevents him from living a normal life —or from allowing his psychiatrist to take the vacation he’s been craving. Asthat psychiatrist, Dreyfuss is at his sputtering, bug-eyed best, and together,the duo transcends what was by then already a very tired plot (and, it must besaid, a patently ridiculous final act). What it boils down to is a very funnyfilm — one, in the words of FulvueDrive-in’s Chuck O’Leary, “made even moreamusing by the fact that Murray and Dreyfuss couldn’t stand each other in reallife.”&nbsp;&nbsp;more info…10.Quick Change (1990)Tomatometer: 84%Bill Murray as a burned-out bureaucrat who disguises himself as aclown to lead a motley crew on a bank robbery — only to find his escapeblocked by a seemingly endless series of mishaps delivered by the gridlock andinnumerable misfits of New York City. Even now, Quick Change‘s synopsissounds like a surefire recipe for box office success, but in spite of mostlypositive reviews, Murray’s (co-)directorial debut went down as one of 1990’shighest-profile flops, grossing less than $16 million during its theatricalrun. It isn’t a particularly ambitious film (Steve Crum of Dispatch-TribuneNewspapers summed it up as “funny fluff”), and most critics agreed that itdoesn’t boast one of Murray’s finest performances, but Quick Change hasheld up well thanks to a stellar supporting cast that the filmmakers had thegood sense to highlight, including Jason Robards, Phil Hartman, Stanley Tucci,and Tony Shalhoub (the latter two would go on to star together in thecritically acclaimed, and equally box office-starved, Big Night).Murray stepped behind the camera for Quick Change after he andscreenwriter Howard Franklin, who worked from Jay Cronley’s book, decided theywere too close to the material to hand it over to anyone else — but it wouldseem that what Murray really wants to do is not direct: this remainshis sole directorial credit.more info…9.Rushmore(1998)Tomatometer: 86%The second act of Murray’s career, in which he pivots from playingsleepy-eyed shysters into more finely nuanced dramatic roles, starts with thisfilm, which broke director Wes Anderson through to a larger audience,essentially redefined the quirky high school movie for a new generation andreaped scores of awards and nominations for its trouble. Though it was neveranything close to a box office hit — its gross stalled at just over $17million, below its $20 million budget — Rushmore has grown into acertified cult classic. The movie rests on Schwartzman’s shoulders, and a gooddeal of the critical acclaim rightly centered on his turn as the troubled MaxFischer — but for a not-inconsiderable number of critics, Murray’sperformance as the dissatisfied executive who befriends, then spars withSchwartzman was a revelation. While lauding Schwartzman as “the best underdogsince Cusack in Better Off Dead,” eFilmCritic’s Brian McKay saved hishighest praise for Murray, deeming this “the finest, funniest, and mostdeadpan performance of his career.”&nbsp;&nbsp;more info…8.Broken Flowers (2005)Tomatometer: 86%By this point, Murray was becoming just as famous for hishard-to-decipher real-life antics as he was for anything he did on screen —at least partly because anyone who wanted to hire him had no agent or managerto go through, and was forced to deal directly with Murray, supposedly throughan oft-neglected personal voicemail box. True to form, for Broken Flowers— and a part which director Jim Jarmusch said he wrote more or lessspecifically for his star — Murray agreed to sign on only if he could staywithin 60 miles of his home. Ironically, Flowers is a movie abouttraveling — Murray’s character visits former flames in an effort to determinewhich one sent him an anonymous letter informing him of the nearly 20-year-oldproduct of their relationship. As much as his character spent the film inmotion, Murray kept his performance close to home, delivering a quiet,minimalistic turn not terribly dissimilar from his work in Lost inTranslation. The similarity was noted by more than one critic, andalthough Flowers didn’t attract the same sort of attention as Translation,but most scribes agreed with Sight and Sound’s Liese Spencer, who noted,“After a career of deadpanning, Murray’s impassive performance is still fresh,funny, sympathetic and restrained.”&nbsp;&nbsp;more info…7.Tootsie (1982)Tomatometer: 87%It’s got Stephen Bishop on the soundtrack and it takes place duringan era in which soap opera stars had a somewhat realistic chance of appearingon the cover of mainstream publications — but despite these anachronisms, Tootsieremains largely as fresh and funny as it was in 1982. And although it would beat best misguided to give Bill Murray a large portion of the credit for this,his scene-stealing, unbilled turn as Dustin Hoffman’s playwright roommate didgive a terrific early indication of Murray’s willingness — eagerness, even —to take on smaller roles in the right projects. It’s easy to see why Murraymight have wanted to show up and film a few days of Tootsie, too: withDustin Hoffman in the lead, Sydney Pollack behind the cameras, and a scriptwhose writers included Barry Levinson and Elaine May, it was a pretty sweetgig whether or not your name ended up above the title. As an added bonus, themovie’s examination of gender roles fit perfectly with the times, helpingpropel Tootsie to nearly $175 million in receipts and plenty of glowingreviews from critics like Emanuel Levy, who called it “one of the best andmost significant comedies of the 1980s.”more info…6.Stripes(1981)Tomatometer: 88%Anyone who’s ever struggled to get a film off the ground will readthis and weep: Ivan Reitman dreamed up the premise for Stripes — “Cheechand Chong in the Army” — on the way to the premiere for Meatballs,after which he pitched his idea to Paramount, where it was instantly greenlit.Of course, it wasn’t all peaches and cream for Stripes — Cheech andChong bailed after being denied complete creative control — but once BillMurray and Harold Ramis were subbed in for the cheeba-loving duo (whosepersonae were ultimately boiled down into Judge Reinhold’s character, Elmo),the studio had an entirely different, but still quite profitable, movie on itshands. As John Winger, the slacker who joins the Army to get fit and meetchicks, Murray was essentially playing a finely tweaked version of his publicpersona, and the script (by Ramis, Len Blum, and Daniel Goldberg) was filledwith zippy one-liners; as a result, although Stripes isn’t what you’dcall a filmmaking achievement, it’s classic early Murray, and it’s nothing butentertaining. Roger Ebert agreed, calling it “a celebration of all that isirreverent, reckless, foolhardy, undisciplined, and occasionally scatological”— and “a lot of fun.”&nbsp;&nbsp;more info…5.Little Shop of Horrors (1986)Tomatometer: 91%We like to think that turning movies into musicals — and then backinto movies — is a new trend, borne of the ever-dwindling capital inHollywood’s creative reserves, but Frank Oz’s 1986 cult classic followed thesame path as the recent big-screen revivals of The Producers and Hairspray.Oz adapted the off-Broadway version of the story, as written by Alan Menkenand Howard Ashman, which was in turn inspired by the (low-budget, natch) 1960Roger Corman film of the same name. Fittingly for a film that predated thewave of screen-to-stage-to-screen projects, Little Shop of Horrors wasa movie ahead of its time: It arrived during a period when musicals were insuch short supply that moviegoers seemed not to know what to do with one, anddespite a funny, colorful ad campaign in support of the funny, colorful movie,Little Shop ended up not doing much more than making back its budget.Those who saw it, however, latched onto its inspired bits — including BillMurray’s turn as the masochistic patient of Steve Martin’s sadistic dentist —and it’s gone on to build quite the devoted following in the two decades-plussince its release. As TIME Magazine’s Richard Corliss noted upon its release,Little Shop “sneaks up on you, about as subtly as Aubrey II.”&nbsp;&nbsp;more info…4.Ed Wood (1994)Tomatometer: 91%It’s a biopic about one of the least talented filmmakers in history,it was scripted by Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski, the duo behind the ProblemChild movies, and director Michael Lehmann (Hudson Hawk) wasoriginally attached to direct. Yes, things could have turned out verydifferently for Ed Wood, but when Tim Burton walked away from MaryReilly and took an interest in directing Alexander and Karaszewski’sscript, the project took another turn. (Lehmann, undaunted, went on to directAirheads.) The final product represented a departure for many of theparties involved: Burton scaled back his signature visual style, filming inblack and white and letting the story do the talking, and much of the cast —Sarah Jessica Parker, for example — found itself in uncharted territory.Appearing as Bunny Breckinridge, the flamboyant star of Plan 9 from OuterSpace, Murray continued the string of smaller, occasionally offbeat roleshe’d occasionally sought out since taking a break from acting following thefailure of The Razor’s Edge in 1984. It also presaged a period in whichMurray would begin choosing scripts seemingly at random, but in Ed Woodhe picked a project that, in the words of Time Out’s Geoff Andrew, “certainlysucceeds as a funny, touching tribute to tenacity, energy, ambition andfriendship.”more info…3.Ghostbusters(1984)Tomatometer: 93%No film makes it to the screen as it’s originally envisioned by itswriters, but Ghostbusters took a particularly circuitous journey:Originally, Dan Aykroyd planned to assemble it as a project for himself andJohn Belushi, with all sorts of big-budget shenanigans, and supporting rolesfor Eddie Murphy and John Candy. It was only after a ground-up rewrite byAykroyd and Harold Ramis that Ghostbusters became the box officebehemoth it was destined to be, racking up an an astounding $238 million tallythroughout 1984 and 1985. Though it’s very much an ensemble comedy, many ofthe film’s best lines are stolen by Murray, perhaps helping create the legendthat he didn’t really read the script, and improvised most of what hischaracter said onscreen. This story is probably apocryphal, but no matter whoput the words in his mouth, Murray’s deadpan delivery was perfect for therole, and cemented his status as the thinking man’s preeminent smart-aleck ofthe ’80s; it also helped sway begrudging critics like the Chicago Reader’sDave Kehr, who summed up Ghostbusters as “not at all a bad time, thanksmainly to…Murray’s incredibly dry line readings.”&nbsp;&nbsp;more info…2.Lost inTranslation (2003)Tomatometer: 95%Thanks to her much-derided appearance in The Godfather III,Sofia Coppola was still the butt of many film fans’ jokes when she helmed Lostin Translation — but all that changed once the glowing reviews startedpouring in, capped off with her Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay.But Coppola wasn’t the only one who earned praise for this quiet littlepicture; Murray received some of the best reviews of his career (not tomention a Golden Globe and a BAFTA Award) for his softly melancholic portrayalof a movie star whose crushing ennui has set him adrift in a sea ofunfulfilling relationships and paycheck projects. He’s oh-so-gently joltedfrom his reverie by a fellow unhappy traveler played by Scarlett Johansson —and who can blame him? — but that’s pretty much all that happens here,something pointed out by the handful of critics who gave Lost inTranslation unfavorable ratings. For the 95 percent of critics who lovedit, though, Translation was something special; Variety’s David Rooneyspoke for many when he said its “balance of humor and poignancy makes it botha pleasurable and melancholy experience.”&nbsp;&nbsp;more info…1.Groundhog Day (1993)Tomatometer: 96%For a modest little comedy that failed to break $100 million at thebox office during its theatrical run, Groundhog Day has done prettywell for itself in the 15 years since its release: It’s been added to theUnited States Film Registry, ranked in the top 40 of the AFI and Bravo “100Funniest Movies” lists, the top 10 of AFI’s fantasy list, and lauded by RogerEbert in his “Great Movies” series. The film catches Murray in transition,navigating between the arch, manic style of his earlier films and the moreminimalistic, restrained humor of later projects — and he’s aided capably bya smartly funny script from Danny Rubin and Harold Ramis, the latter of whomprovides some of his best, lightest direction here. Much like the day Murray’smisanthropic newscaster is forced to relive in the movie, Groundhog Daybenefits from repeated viewings, and this is largely due to Murray’s deftperformance; in the words of TIME’s Richard Corliss, he “makes the movie acomic time warp that anyone should be happy to get stuck in.”&nbsp;Want more actor Tomatometer rundowns?

Looking back at a few of my favorites from 2017, here are some recommendations you can watch (or re-watch) with viewers of various ages. Enjoy, and here’s to a great 2018!Captain Underpants: The First Epic Movie (Captain Underpants) (2017)  87%Rating:&nbsp;PG, for mild rude humor throughout.I was so surprised by how fun this movie was – and I’m familiar with the wildly popular Dav Pilkey book series that inspired it. (My 8-year-old son is a huge fan.) But whether or not you or your kids have read a single page of George and Harold’s adventures, you’ll have a complete blast here. The animation is colorful and lively, the writing is consistently clever and the energy is brisk – so much so that you may have to watch Captain Underpants&nbsp;again to catch some of the gags you missed. Kevin Hart and Thomas Middleditch provide the voices of best friends who accidentally transform their mean elementary-school principal (Ed Helms) into the comic-book superhero of their dreams: The goofy, tighty-whitey wearing Captain Underpants. There’s quite a bit of potty humor here, but it’s amusingly self-aware. And there are valuable themes about&nbsp;being kind to people who are friendless or who’ve been bullied. A great choice for all ages. Tra-la-laaa!Wonder (2017)  86%Rating:&nbsp;PG, for&nbsp;thematic elements including bullying, and some mild language.This was also a pleasant surprise, given that it looks painfully mawkish. Instead, Stephen Chbosky’s film (based on the R.J. Palacio Young Adult novel) is inspiring but restrained, with strong performances from an excellent cast and a worthwhile message about being openhearted and decent to others. Room&nbsp;star Jacob Tremblay continues to impress as a&nbsp;bright, sweet 10-year-old named Auggie who was born with a genetic abnormality that’s required multiple facial surgeries and treatments to fix. He’s been homeschooled all his life, but his mom and dad (Julia Roberts and Owen Wilson) eventually decide to send him to a Brooklyn middle school so he’ll know how the outside world works. Kids are initially cruel or dismissive of him, but he eventually makes friends. Along his journey, we also learn the truth about what life has been like for others in Auggie’s orbit. My son whispered to me at the start of the film that he thought Auggie’s appearance was weird; when it was over, he exclaimed, “I loved it!” A great choice for all ages.Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle (2017)  76%Rating:&nbsp;PG-13, for&nbsp;adventure action, suggestive content and some language.This is in theaters now, so you may already have seen it. If not, go find it as a family before school resumes for 2018. It has big laughs, high-energy action sequences, and lively interactions from its strong cast. The kinda-sorta sequel to the 1995 Robin Williams adventure comedy finds four disparate high school students being sucked into an old video game set in the jungle. There, they find themselves in the bodies of characters that are completely different from who they are in real life. So the nerd ends up with the hulking muscles of Dwayne Johnson, while the beautiful mean girl winds up with the ample, bearded (and male) frame of Jack Black. (Kevin Hart and Karen Gillan also star.) Some of the set pieces involving ferocious animals might be too intense for younger kids, and there’s some body (and potty) humor that might seem a little grown-up. There’s also a bit of language scattered throughout. But I laughed the whole time, and I suspect you will, too. Jumanji&nbsp;consistently reinforces the importance of teamwork. And if your kids are into gaming, they’ll enjoy how aware the characters are of the video game setting and strategies. Suitable for viewers around 8 and older.War for the Planet of the Apes (2017)  94%Rating:&nbsp;PG-13, for&nbsp;sequences of sci-fi violence and action, thematic elements, and some disturbing images.This is on my top-10 list of the year’s best films; it’s also my favorite blockbuster of 2017. Director Matt Reeves’ final movie in the most recent Planet of the Apes&nbsp;trilogy features a dazzling mix of powerful action sequences and resonant emotion, with a mesmerizing motion-capture performance from the great Andy Serkis as the ape leader Caesar. But even though the film&nbsp;features apes on horseback – many of whom can talk, and some of whom are funny – it definitely isn’t for the entire family.&nbsp;As the title suggests, the apes are at war with humans over control of the planet. That means massive battle scenes, which are rendered through incredible special effects. Woody Harrelson is chilling as the humans’ leader, the cruel (and probably crazy) Colonel, making quiet, intimate moments just as startling as the louder, larger ones. Apes are held prisoner&nbsp;and whipped, beaten, and forced into hard labor.&nbsp;And the bold, percussive score from master composer Michael Giacchino contributes greatly to the general sensation of dread and suspense. But for more mature kids – around 11 and older – it’s a spectacular, thrilling time.Lady Bird (2017)  99%Rating:&nbsp;R, for&nbsp;language, sexual content, brief graphic nudity and teen partying.Yes, it’s rated R, but just hear me out on this. Lady Bird is an excellent choice for the teenagers in your house – especially teen girls – and maybe even viewers around 12 if they’re ready for material that’s a little more mature. It’s definitely one of the year’s best films, and it may even end up winning the Academy Award for best picture in a couple of months. Writer and actress Greta Gerwig makes her smart and insightful directing debut with this semi-autobiographical, coming-of-age story. Two-time Oscar nominee Saoirse Ronan does some of her best work yet as a high-school senior named Christine who insists that everyone call her Lady Bird. She can’t wait to fly far away from the mundane trappings of suburban Sacramento, California, for the bright lights and intellectual heights of New York City. But first, she must find out who she is and what kind of place she hopes to occupy in the world. There’s frank talk about sex, and we see Lady Bird awkwardly lose her virginity.&nbsp;There’s also teen partying – drinking and smoking – as well as language throughout. But Lady Bird&nbsp;is so funny, sweet and true, I can’t recommend it enough for the young people in your life who are struggling to navigate their own adolescent angst.","section":"Parental Guidance","tags":"IFC, e., Adventures, awards, A24, Walt, Company, politics, Black, Holiday, globe, dark, Disney, motion, ABC","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/29125958/Best-of-2017-PG.jpg","slug":"5-of-the-best-2017-films-you-can-watch-with-the-whole-family"},{"id":"47508902254395","title":"How Family-Friendly Are Boo 2!

A Madea Halloween and Wonderstruck?by Christy Lemire | October 20, 2017 |  CommentsGeostorm, the biggest movie in theaters this week, wasn’t screened ahead of time for critics, so we can’t tell you much about whether it’s appropriate for your kids if you’re in the mood for a disaster flick. What we&nbsp;can tell you about is Tyler Perry’s latest Madea outing and the rare kid-friendly Todd Haynes movie, as well as one of the biggest hits of the summer on DVD. Read on for details.NOW IN THEATERS&nbsp;Tyler Perry's Boo 2! A Madea Halloween (2017)  4%Rating:&nbsp;PG-13, for&nbsp;sexual references, drug content, language and some horror images.It’s a Madea movie – and a sequel to a Madea movie, at that – so if you’ve ever seen any of them over the years, you know exactly what you’re in store for here. Multimedia titan Tyler Perry once again dons the silvery wig, floral frock and oversized glasses to play his most beloved character, the thoroughly inappropriate Madea. This time, she and her geriatric posse must venture into the woods when rebellious Catholic schoolgirl Tiffany (Diamond White), the daughter of Madea’s nephew Brian (also Perry), attends a Halloween party at a haunted lake. There’s some traditional horror imagery — a creepy girl with stringy dark hair, a guy in a mask wielding a chainsaw – but practically no gore. What makes this movie unsuitable for young viewers is the racy sexual talk, the language, and the many drug references. Madea’s brother, Joe (Perry, again), speaks frequently and fondly about his time as a pimp. The characters all bicker with each other constantly, which features a lot of profanity (although, amusingly, it’s clear that many of the damns have been dubbed into darns). And the high school and college students at the party, all dressed in naughty costumes, talk about who is going to hook up with whom. It isn’t terribly scary or funny, but if your kids are strangely compelled to see it, I suppose this is OK for viewers around 13 and older.Wonderstruck (2017)  68%Rating:&nbsp;PG, for thematic elements and smoking.This is the rare film from master director&nbsp;Todd Haynes (Far From Heaven, Carol)&nbsp;that’s actually suitable for kids. And it stars two young actors who are pretty great: Millicent Simmonds and Oakes Fegley. Wonderstruck hops back and forth over 50 years to trace their characters’ connection. In 1927, a deaf girl named Rose (Simmonds) ventures from her comfortable home in Hoboken, New Jersey, to New York City to track down the silent film star (Julianne Moore) with whom she’s obsessed. In 1977, a Minnesota kid named Ben (Fegley), who’s also hearing impaired, runs away to Manhattan in search of the father he’s never known. In both timelines, the city is bustling and full of danger. The ‘70s New York is especially evocative of the grime and grit of the pre-Disneyfied era. And overall, the film has a lingering melancholy of loneliness and lost parents. But it’s also about finding friendship in unexpected places, and both kids show an impressive amount of independence and bravery. I’d say this is fine for viewers around 9 or 10 and older.New on DVD&nbsp;Spider-Man: Homecoming (2017)  92%Rating:&nbsp;PG-13, for sci-fi action violence, some language and brief suggestive comments.With a box-office haul of nearly $880 million worldwide, this latest incarnation of the Spider-Man legend was a huge hit with viewers of all ages this summer. And justifiably so – it’s a total blast, and the most kid-friendly, live-action version of the character yet. There’s a lightness and a playfulness here that are sometimes missing in comic book movies – especially the darker and more self-serious ones featuring Batman and Superman. But Tom Holland brings a boyish enthusiasm to the role that’s infectious, glimmers of which we saw during his brief appearance in last summer’s Captain America: Civil War. Spider-Man: Homecoming&nbsp;fits nicely into the Marvel Cinematic Universe, but it also stands comfortably on its own. It picks up right where Civil War leaves off, actually, with nerdy high schooler Peter Parker still reveling in the opportunity to hang with the big boys (and girls). But he also must keep his superhero identity a secret – including from his Aunt May (Marisa Tomei) and best friend, Ned (scene-stealing newcomer Jacob Batalon) – even as he longs to continue fighting crime. There are some big battle scenes and action set pieces here, as there always are in this genre, including one spectacularly tense one aboard the Staten Island Ferry and another inside the Washington Monument. Innocent folks are frequently in peril, but Spider-Man always swings in to save the day. There’s also some language scattered throughout, some crass name-calling and light bullying. And there’s a quick (and hilarious) reference to porn, but younger viewers won’t get it.","section":"Parental Guidance","tags":"Vudu, Certified, adaptation, aapi, Larson","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/20112421/Boo-2-Madea-Halloween-PG.jpg","slug":"how-family-friendly-are-boo-2-a-madea-halloween-and-wonderstruck"},{"id":"47508903816003","title":"How Family-Friendly Are Leap! and All Saints?","content":"Parental Guidancevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})How Family-Friendly Are Leap! and All Saints?by Christy Lemire | August 25, 2017 |  CommentsOf all the movies opening or expanding in wide release this week, only two are suitable for chidren: one is an animated film about a ballerina, and the other is an inspirational story based on true events. In other words, you’re probably pretty safe taking your kids to either one, even if one is likely to be more enjoyable for you. Read on for Christy’s take on both.NOW IN THEATERS&nbsp;Leap! (2017)  42%Rating: PG, for some impolite humor, and action.A French orphan dreams of being a ballerina in this family-friendly – if mediocre&nbsp; — animated adventure. Elle Fanning provides the voice of Felicie, a plucky 11-year-old who escapes her dreary, rural trappings in the late 1800s and makes her way to Paris to study dance. Along for the ride is her best friend, a wannabe inventor named Victor (Nat Wolff), who’s secretly in love with her. Both find themselves in marginal danger as they scamper about the city streets. Felicie lies about her identity, pretending she’s a mean rich girl to sneak into the prestigious Opera Ballet School. And the girl’s mom (voiced by Kate McKinnon) is an over-the-top villainess who’ll stop at nothing to destroy Felicie, including chasing her at perilous heights across Paris. There’s nothing really harmful here, and I guess the themes of being true to yourself, chasing your dreams, and persevering are worthwhile. But there’s very little in Leap!&nbsp;that truly soars.All Saints (2017)  95%Rating:&nbsp;PG, for thematic elements.This faith-based film is inspired by the true story of a group of refugees from war-torn Myanmar who helped revive a bankrupt church in rural Tennessee. That’s a mouthful, and it may sound like there’s a lot going on here. But much of what makes director Steve Gomer’s film work is the understated way he approaches dramatic and potentially devastating situations. John Corbett stars as the pastor sent to All Saints Episcopal Church in Smyrna, Tennessee, on a temporary assignment to oversee its sale. A big-box store is set to take over the land. But with the arrival of dozens of Karen farmers, who have no money and no place to go, the pastor sees an opportunity to turn the land into crops, give these folks a job and a home, and save the church. It’s an inspiring story of community and perseverance. And while All Saints&nbsp;is unmistakably a movie about faith, prayer, and signs from God, its religious element isn’t heavy-handed, which might make it more accessible for people of all beliefs (or lack thereof). The church members are tested both physically and spiritually. There’s discussion of the atrocities the refugees suffered before fleeing for the United States. And in one scene, the newcomers clash with police over a misunderstanding and a language barrier, but it’s quickly resolved. I’d say this is a fine and even worthwhile film for viewers around age 8 and older.NEW ON DVD&nbsp;Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 (2017)  85%Rating:&nbsp;PG-13, for sequences of sci-fi action and violence, language, and brief suggestive content.You probably saw the sequel to the 2014 surprise smash this summer – after all, it’s made nearly $863 million worldwide, making it the fourth-highest grossing film of the year so far. In case you haven’t, though, and you’d like to check it out, I’d say it’s suitable for viewers around 10 and older. Once again, the Guardians get caught up in another galactic adventure – and bicker with each other, of course. Along the way to saving the day, Peter Quill (Chris Pratt) – or Star-Lord, as he prefers to be called – learns the true identity of his long-lost father. Gamora (Zoe Saldana), Drax (Dave Bautista) and Rocket (voiced by Bradley Cooper) are along for the ride, as well as the tiny Baby Groot (voiced by Vin Diesel). And similar to Diesel’s Fast and Furious&nbsp;franchise, the Guardians&nbsp;sequel is all about #family. There’s a ton of big, shiny, comic book-movie violence and action here: fights, chases, swordplay and gunfire of the outer-space variety. There’s also a lot of language – mainly from the saucy Rocket. Star-Lord and Gamora enjoy some more romantic tension. And there’s some grown-up humor that’ll probably go over kids’ heads. I brought my son with me to a screening and he did fine – but he’s also seen a lot of Marvel movies in his 7½ years. The themes of loyalty, perseverance, and creating your own family are valuable. And kids will love the insanely adorable Baby Groot. You will too, actually.","section":"Parental Guidance","tags":"Biopics, Fox, San, ESPN, witnail, One, Crackle, movies, CMT, 20th, renewals, Masterpiece, crossover","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/25105301/Leap-PG.jpg","slug":"how-family-friendly-are-leap-and-all-saints"},{"id":"47508902260542","title":"How Family-Friendly Are ‘Til Death Do Us Part and Our Souls At Night","content":"Parental Guidancevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})How Family-Friendly Are 'Til Death Do Us Part and Our Souls At Nightby Christy Lemire | September 29, 2017 |  CommentsMost of the biggest movies opening this week are rated R, but there’s at least one wide release and one new film simultaneously hitting Netflix that promise slightly less adult-oriented entertainment. Read on for details on a domestic violence thriller and a drama about love late in life, as well as couple of DVD releases.NOW IN THEATERS&nbsp;'Til Death Do Us Part (2017) Rating:&nbsp;PG-13, for&nbsp;thematic elements involving domestic abuse, violence, some sexuality and language.This is essentially a remake of the 1991 Julia Roberts thriller Sleeping With the Enemy, with an African-American cast. Annie Ilonzeh stars as a beautiful woman living a comfortable life with her handsome, doting husband (Stephen Bishop). But increasingly, he shows his controlling and jealous sides – and he eventually abuses her, mentally and physically, even though she’s pregnant with his child. She runs away to start a new life and thinks she’s found happiness – until one day when her husband tracks her down and arrives at her door. This is a pretty mature film with dramatic, disturbing images of domestic violence. There’s quite a bit of language and – in the couple’s happier times – some sexual images and discussions. There’s also a major car crash, a shooting and general melodramatic insanity. At the same time, director Chris Stokes’ film also has the good intention of encouraging domestic violence victims to seek help. Suitable for viewers around 12 or 13 and older.Our Souls at Night (2017)  89%Rating: Unrated but contains adult situations and discussions and drunkenness.Fifty years after co-starring for the first time in Barefoot in the Park, Jane Fonda and Robert Redford reunite once again in this sweet story about finding love later in life. Their characters — widowed neighbors living in the same small, Colorado town — enter into an arrangement in which they sleep together nightly to fight loneliness. That’s it – just sleep. For a long time, their relationship remains platonic as they drift off discussing everything from mundane daily activities to long-held wishes and regrets. Eventually, though, their connection becomes more intimate, which director Ritesh Batra depicts tastefully with some chaste hotel-room kissing. Fonda’s character’s troubled son (Matthias Schoenaerts) also enters the picture as a drunk and sometimes neglectful dad to his own 7-year-old son. There’s a brief bit of conflict. But for the most part, Our Souls at Night&nbsp;– which is opening theatrically in limited release and available everywhere on Netflix – is a nice, well-acted picture that provides a solid showcase for its veteran superstars. Fine for ages 10 and older.NEW ON DVD&nbsp;Transformers: The Last Knight (2017)  15%Rating:&nbsp;PG-13,&nbsp;for violence and intense sequences of sci-fi action, language, and some innuendo.It made over $605 million worldwide this summer — and that’s why they keep on making these Transformers&nbsp;movies, even though they’re terrible. Tweens and older should be fine watching it, however, even though Michael Bay’s latest somehow manages to be more incoherent than its predecessors. Once again, the planet is in peril, and only Mark Wahlberg playing a guy named Cade Yeager can save it. Giant robots smash into each other and their alien planet, Cybertron, might smash into Earth to drain it of all its energy. Bay’s film is, as always, a massive, cacophonous spectacle. There’s a ton of violence here, beginning with a battle set during the time of King Arthur. In the present day, the robot combat causes a ton of destruction, as always — and explosions. So many explosions. There’s quite a bit of language throughout as various characters insult each other and freak out about the possibility of the world ending. And there’s some mildly racy humor as Wahlberg’s character exchanges allegedly snappy banter with a brilliant and suggestively dressed professor (Laura Haddock), but kids probably won’t get it. My son (who’s nearly 8) saw it in IMAX 3D and he was fine, but kids who feel uncomfortable during sensory-overload movies like this might have difficulty watching it. And at well over two hours, the latest Transformers will probably be a tough sit for many young viewers.47 Meters Down (2017)  52%Rating:&nbsp;PG-13, for sequences of intense, peril, bloody images, and brief strong language.Tweens and older should be fine watching this unabashed B-movie about beautiful young women in danger of becoming shark food. In fact, they’ll probably love it. 47 Meters Down&nbsp;is lean and mean, and it has some decent scares as well as some impressive underwater camerawork. Mandy Moore and Claire Holt co-star as sisters on a diving trip in Mexico in which they climb into a cage to swim with great whites. But the cable tying them to the boat snaps, plunging them to the bottom of the ocean, where myriad dangers abound. This is a pretty intense little movie. People suffer shark bites and one character dies. It’s dark and scary down there, and the women are constantly aware that they could die at any moment. Understandably, they frequently panic – which depletes their oxygen supply faster, which makes them panic even more. There’s also quite a bit of cursing and a little bit of kissing.","section":"Parental Guidance","tags":"Nominations, cancelled, toy, Us, Fox, Universe, Century, Animation, biography, X-Men, Pixar, Comic","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/29103128/Our-Souls-At-Night-PG.jpg","slug":"how-family-friendly-are-til-death-do-us-part-and-our-souls-at-night"},{"id":"47508902241079","title":"3 Movies like Coco That Deal with Death and Loss from a Kid’s Perspective","content":"Parental Guidancevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})3 Movies like Coco That Deal with Death and Loss from a Kid's Perspectiveby Christy Lemire | November 22, 2017 |  CommentsEven though Pixar’s latest effort,&nbsp;Coco, is another heartwarming animated tale aimed at family audiences, it does deal with often difficult subjects to discuss with kids, like death, grief, and memory loss. By most accounts, though,&nbsp;Coco is great, so don’t be afraid to see it with your children. But if you’re looking for some alternate recommendations, Christy Lemire has you covered.THE MOVIECoco (2017)  97%Rating: PG, for thematic elements.The latest animated extravaganza from Disney/Pixar is a visual delight, brimming with color, energy and magical creatures. But much of the film from director Lee Unkrich (Toy Story 3) also takes place in the Land of the Dead, which is full of talking, singing skeletons as well as spirit animals that can, at times, seem menacing. It’s all beautiful and often quite funny. But danger abounds as well as deeply sad moments about memory loss and death. Miguel (voiced by Anthony Gonzalez), a 12-year-old boy from a Mexican family full of shoemakers, dreams of becoming a musician like his idol, movie and singing star Ernesto de la Cruz (Benjamin Bratt). But his family has forbidden music in the house for generations because of a long-ago betrayal. On Dia de los Muertos – the traditional Day of the Dead – Miguel travels to the Land of the Dead to fulfill his destiny and learn his true identity. The skeletons are, for the most part, warm and friendly. Miguel’s ancestors, who’ve been watching over him, welcome him and help him get back home. But very young kids might find them frightening, as well as a giant, winged spirit animal that’s after Miguel. Scenes in which elderly relatives appear feeble, forgetful and on the brink of death might seem confusing to small children, but they also offer the opportunity to talk about the importance of honoring the cultural contributions of our ancestors. Fine for viewers around 5 or 6 and older.THE RECOMMENDATIONSIf you’re looking for other films that deal with themes of loss, death, and the great beyond to share with your family, there are lots of great choices, including:ParaNorman (2012)  89%Rating:&nbsp;PG,&nbsp;for scary action and images, thematic elements, some rude humor and language.The stop-motion animation films from LAIKA (Coraline, Kubo and the Two Strings) are painstakingly rendered and endlessly inventive. But they often have an off-kilter sense of humor and darker themes, which might work best for more mature kids. Here, in the studio’s second film, an 11-year-old misfit named Norman (voiced by Kodi Smit-McPhee) must use his ability to communicate with the dead to save his small New England town from a zombie invasion. But the place already was cursed, thanks to a centuries-old witch-hunt. Monsters abound, which clearly will be too frightening for very little kids. Children are almost constantly in peril and there are lots of dark shadows and jump scares. The creatures are grotesque – some have body parts that fall off — but that’s usually played for laughs. But Norman also has the opportunity to connect with his recently deceased grandmother (the great Elaine Stritch), who lingers in purgatory and serves as his friend and guide.&nbsp;It’s a touching relationship. ParaNorman&nbsp;also has valuable themes about understanding, tolerance and overcoming bullying. Fine for viewers around 8 and older.Frankenweenie (2012)  87%Rating:&nbsp;PG, for thematic elements, scary images and action.Another stop-motion animated film, this time from the delightfully twisted mind of Tim Burton. Following the accidental death of his beloved dog, Sparky, 10-year-old Victor Frankenstein (voiced by Charlie Tahan) figures out how to bring his buddy back to life using his vast science knowledge. Sparky isn’t quite the same, though, and his reincarnation leads to an invasion of monstrous creatures. Burton’s film is gorgeous in crisp black-and-white, and the meticulous details are dazzling. Frankenweenie&nbsp;might be too scary for very young children; technically and thematically, it represents the best of what Burton has had to offer over his lengthy career. But it’s also a sweet story about the&nbsp;powerful bond between a boy and his dog, one that goes on even after death — a heartrending subject, to be sure, but one that Burton infuses with his trademark mix of lively energy and macabre laughs. The film also features a sympathetic, protective portrayal of an outsider and an affectionate skewering of the sanctity of suburbia.&nbsp;Fine for kids around 7 and older.My Girl (1991)  53%Rating:&nbsp;PG-13.Have tissues handy: My Girl is a tearjerker, no matter how old you are. It’s also a sweet coming-of-age movie that’s a good fit for both girls and boys. Director Howard Zieff’s film is much better than&nbsp;its 50% Tomatometer score&nbsp;would suggest, thanks to its strong cast. Anna Chlumsky stars as Vada, a perky and bright pre-teen girl who’s obsessed with death in 1972. Her father (Dan Aykroyd) is a mortician, her mother died giving birth to her, and she’s a hypochondriac. (And, as in Coco, Vada has a grandmother who’s suffering from Alzheimer’s.) Her best friendship with a boy named Thomas J. (Macaulay Culkin) helps provide her with the comfort and stability that she needs, especially when Dad gets remarried to his new cosmetician (Jamie Lee Curtis). But a shocking, accidental death changes everything. Vada, a tomboy, is coming to terms with puberty, so there’s also some sort-of grown-up talk about body changes. My Girl may seem overly earnest, but it’s also a well-intentioned and direct film about moving through loss and grief toward understanding and redemption.&nbsp;Fine for viewers around 8 and older.","section":"Parental Guidance","tags":"language, Awards, Pirates, Competition, docudrama, Originals, america, Arrowverse, MSNBC, Netflix, a","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/22160539/Coco-PG.jpg","slug":"3-movies-like-coco-that-deal-with-death-and-loss-from-a-kids-perspective"},{"id":"47508902256444","title":"How Family-Friendly Are Happy Death Day and Goodbye Christopher Robin?","content":"Parental Guidancevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})How Family-Friendly Are Happy Death Day and Goodbye Christopher Robin?by Christy Lemire | October 13, 2017 |  CommentsThere’s a chance your kids may be in the mood for some chills at the movie theater this weekend, and the PG-13-rated&nbsp;Happy Death Day might seem like just the ticket. Here’s what you’ll want to know if you plan on making an outing of it, or if you plan on seeing the fact-based origin story of Winnie the Pooh.NOW IN THEATERS&nbsp;Happy Death Day (2017)  72%Rating:&nbsp;PG-13, for&nbsp;violence/terror, crude sexual content, language, some drug material and partial nudity.It’s a slasher-flick take on the Groundhog&nbsp;Day&nbsp;model. Vapid sorority girl Tree (Jessica Rothe) is stuck living the same&nbsp;day&nbsp;over and over again – and getting killed by a stalker in a creepy mask at the end. She must not only outsmart her killer but also learn this person’s identity – and maybe become a better person along the way. Despite its repeated, violent deaths, director Christopher Landon’s film isn’t as gory as a lot of horror movies, but there’s still a lot of grown-up stuff here. When we first meet Tree, she’s waking up hungover in a dorm room with a fellow student (Israel Broussard) whose name she can’t remember. There’s a ton of sexual talk, language, and partying. The sorority sisters are frequently mean to each other. Also, Tree is having an affair with her married professor. But even though the formula feels familiar, the execution is a lot of fun. Fine for viewers around 13 and older.Goodbye Christopher Robin (2017)  63%Rating:&nbsp;PG for&nbsp;thematic elements, some bullying, war images and brief language.Winnie the Pooh gets the origin-story treatment in this tastefully-made, well-acted period drama. Christopher Robin was indeed a real person and the inspiration behind the Pooh-niverse: His father, A.A. Milne, was the author who created all those beloved characters and their adventures in the Hundred-Acre Wood. Director Simon Curtis’ film shows us innocent moments of playtime with stuffed animals, but doesn’t shy away from the emotional turmoil young Christopher Robin (Will Tilston) endured. His father, Milne (Domhnall Gleeson), suffered from Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder after fighting in World War I (although, of course, they didn’t call it that back then), frequently causing him to lash out. His mother, Daphne (Margot Robbie), was a party girl who hated country life and often abandoned her family to return to London. And as Winnie the Pooh’s fame grew, so did the young boy’s, which became overwhelming for him. Later, as a boarding school student (when he’s played by Alex Lawther), he becomes the target of bullies. Goodbye Christopher Robin also shows flashbacks to the war violence Milne endured, which might be hard to watch. Ultimately it’s heartwarming, but there’s some tough stuff on the way there. Suitable for viewers around 8 or 9 and older.","section":"Parental Guidance","tags":"kaiju, Access, media, superhero, italian, america, E3, Stephen, Plus, APB, American, VICE, Fall, Witch, Ice","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/13122938/Happy-Death-Day-PG.jpg","slug":"how-family-friendly-are-happy-death-day-and-goodbye-christopher-robin"},{"id":"47508902263615","title":"How Family-Friendly Are The LEGO Ninjago Movie and Battle of the Sexes","content":"Parental Guidancevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})How Family-Friendly Are The LEGO Ninjago Movie and Battle of the Sexesby Christy Lemire | September 22, 2017 |  CommentsThe latest entry in the LEGO movie universe is clearly aimed at kids — no surprise there — but Christy also offers her take on the based-on-true-events tale of a groundbreaking tennis match, opening in limited release, and a documentary on one of the world’s biggest pop stars, currently streamable on Netflix. She also re-examines one of the biggest blockbuster hits of the summer, newly available on DVD. Read on for details.NOW IN THEATERS&nbsp;The Lego Ninjago Movie (2017)  56%Rating:&nbsp;PG, for some mild action and rude humor.The third movie in the Lego Cinematic Universe isn’t nearly as zippy, funny, or visually inventive as its predecessors. And if you and your kids are fans of the TV show Ninjago: Masters of Spinjitzu, you may be disappointed to find how little the film version resembles it. But The Lego Ninjago Movie&nbsp;is the only week’s new release that the whole family can enjoy together, so if you’re planning to see it, you’ll probably have a decent time. The animated comedy follows the adventures of a group of high school students who are secretly ninjas. Specifically, it follows their leader, the green ninja Lloyd Garmadon (voiced by Dave Franco), as he struggles to reconnect with his estranged father, the evil Lord Garmadon (Justin Theroux) – a villain who just happens to keep invading Ninjago City. Fred Armisen, Kumail Nanjiani, Abbi Jacobson, Michael Pena, and Zach Woods provide the voices of the other ninjas, but they don’t get much to do; Jackie Chan plays their wise leader, Master Wu. The antics are zany, and the martial-arts battles and big action sequences are played for laughs. There’s nothing scary or inappropriate here, and ultimately, the story is very family-affirming. Fine for all ages.Battle of the Sexes (2017)  84%Rating:&nbsp;PG-13, for some sexual content and partial nudity.Emma Stone and Steve Carell star in the true story about tennis legends Billie Jean King and Bobby Riggs, who played each other in a highly watched 1973 match known as the “Battle of the Sexes.” The groundbreaking King was the world’s top-ranked tennis player at the time; Riggs, a self-professed chauvinist pig, challenged her to a match in hopes of proving that men were superior athletes. At the same time, though, the married King began a romance with her hairdresser (Andrea Riseborough), exploring previously untapped lesbian urges that could derail her career if exposed. The film from directors Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris (Little Miss Sunshine) focuses intimately and tenderly on King’s affair; we see a lot of kissing and cuddling in hotel rooms and the suggestion that the two women have had sex. There’s also a slight bit of nudity. Because this was the ‘70s, nearly everyone smokes. And overall, the sexist attitudes many men in the tennis world had toward female players (and women in general) may be shocking for younger viewers to hear – but maybe that’s also a potential teaching moment, to show how antiquated and wrong such thinking is. Suitable for ages 10 or 11 and older.Gaga: Five Foot Two (2017)  73%Rating: Unrated, but contains language throughout, some nudity, smoking and discussion of drug use.Your kids may love Lady Gaga, but they may not be ready just yet for this intimate look at the pop superstar. Director Chris Moukarbel’s documentary, which is also available on Netflix, follows Gaga as she records and promotes her very personal “Joanne” album and prepares for her halftime performance during Super Bowl LI. But we also see her struggling with constant physical pain and lamenting the collapse of her romance with actor Taylor Kinney, whom she’d planned to marry. Gaga cries a lot in the film, making herself vulnerable time and time again. She also curses and smokes throughout the film, and we see her topless several times as she changes clothes backstage or just hangs out with friends. It’s a fascinating profile, with Gaga emerging as a woman and an artist who’s confidently, defiantly herself, even as she’s willing to reveal human frailties. I’d say this is fine for viewers around 11 or 12 and older.NEW ON DVD&nbsp;Wonder Woman (2017)  93%Rating:&nbsp;PG-13, for&nbsp;sequences of violence and action, and some suggestive content.This movie was a massive hit this summer, making nearly $820 million worldwide, and understandably so. It’s a thrillingly executed, surprisingly emotional blockbuster that has a lot to offer viewers of various ages – but perhaps not young kids. It’s great, but it’s also extremely violent. In telling the origin story of Diana Prince (a hugely charismatic Gal Gadot), the Amazon warrior who’d become a superhero, director Patty Jenkins has pulled off a tricky balance of humor, heart and high-tech spectacle that’s genuinely inspiring. But Wonder Woman&nbsp;also features several long, graphic action sequences. There’s a ton of gunfire, swordplay, and hand-to-hand combat. Many characters die, and while there isn’t a lot of blood (hence the PG-13 rating), the movie definitely doesn’t shy away from showing the actual deaths. We see people in peril – including women and children — during World War I battles. In one scene, a room full of bad guys perish from poisonous gas. There’s also the suggestion of a sex scene between Diana and Steve Trevor (Chris Pine), the American spy she rescues from a crash landing, but all we see is kissing in a hotel room. At over two hours, Wonder Woman&nbsp;also might be too long for many kids. Diana is heroic and brave, idealistic and pure, and she’s usually the smartest and most capable person in the room or on the battlefield. That’s all worthwhile. But I suspect this would be too much just yet for viewers younger than 8 or 9.","section":"Parental Guidance","tags":"Sundance, cancelled, Century, caribbean, jones, Geo, Spike","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/22122023/Lego-Ninjago-PG.jpg","slug":"how-family-friendly-are-the-lego-ninjago-movie-and-battle-of-the-sexes"},{"id":"47508902245177","title":"How Family-Friendly Are Daddy’s Home 2 and Murder on the Orient Express?","content":"Parental Guidancevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})How Family-Friendly Are Daddy's Home 2 and Murder on the Orient Express?by Christy Lemire | November 10, 2017 |  CommentsBoth of the big films out this week skirt that PG-13 line between more adult-oriented films and stuff aimed squarely at kids, so if you’re thinking of taking the family to the Will Ferrell/Mark Wahlberg comedy or Kenneth Branagh ensemble murder mystery, here’s what you’ll want to know.NOW IN THEATERS&nbsp;Daddy's Home 2 (2017)  21%Rating:&nbsp;PG-13, for suggestive material and some language.It’s the sequel to the 2015 comedy Daddy’s Home, which I’m not sure anybody needed, but here it is anyway. Similar to last week’s A Bad Moms Christmas, in which the moms’ moms invaded, this time the dads’ dads show up to celebrate the holidays. Madcap hilarity ensues. Mel Gibson plays Mark Wahlberg’s randy father and John Lithgow plays Will Ferrell’s cuddly pop. There are mature gags involving flirtations with women, and Gibson’s character tells some off-color jokes that younger viewers won’t get. While there are several children in the supporting cast, they’re often the butt of jokes or recipients of terrible (and crass) advice, and a couple of the youngsters get drunk on eggnog. One character has a shoplifting habit. There’s also quite a bit of language scattered throughout. And several moments of slapsticky humor are actually quite violent. It’s not very good, but it’s probably OK for viewers around 11 or 12 and older.Murder On The Orient Express (2017)  60%Rating: PG-13, for violence and thematic elements.Well there’s the word “murder” in the title, so clearly someone gets killed here. But even more fundamentally, director and star Kenneth Branagh’s adaptation of the classic Agatha Christie mystery will probably be too grown-up for younger viewers, who might find it slow and hard to follow. Branagh leads an all-star cast (Johnny Depp, Michelle Pfeiffer, Willem Dafoe, Judi Dench, Daisy Ridley, Penelope Cruz) as the world-famous detective Hercule Poirot. When a passenger on the Orient Express train is murdered, Poirot must solve the crime by investigating the handful of other people on board. There’s a lot of adult discussion of motive, as well as graphic description of the killing itself. There are also some physical altercations between several of the characters. Many characters smoke. And the subject matter in general is probably not suitable for viewers younger than 10 or 11.New on DVD&nbsp;Cars 3 (2017)  69%Rating:&nbsp;GKids of all ages can enjoy this third film in the animated Cars&nbsp;franchise, and they probably have done so already.&nbsp;It’s totally harmless and not even remotely as complicated or challenging as the best of the Pixar universe. Cars 3 once again centers on Lightning McQueen (voiced as always by Owen Wilson), who’s now finding that, as a veteran racer, he’s not nearly as fast as his newer, more high-tech competitors. He works with a younger, female trainer named Cruz (Cristela Alonzo), who had long dreamed of racing herself. Basically, it’s about middle-age angst, which should be super fun for the kids in your family. Lightning suffers a couple of bad crashes, and he and Cruz find themselves in danger when they accidentally enter themselves in a demolition derby. But there’s nothing inappropriate here.The Glass Castle (2017)  52%Rating:&nbsp;PG-13, for&nbsp;mature thematic content involving family dysfunction, and for some language and smoking.Mature tweens and older are the right audience for this drama, based on Jeannette Walls’ best-selling memoir about her horrific youth. Director and co-writer Destin Daniel Cretton Short Term 12 doesn’t shy away from showing us the squalor, poverty and hunger she and her siblings endured. The film flashes back and forth between Jeannette’s life as an up-and-coming New York journalist in 1989 (when Brie Larson plays her) and her uncertain childhood (when Ella Anderson plays her). The kids’ alcoholic father (Woody Harrelson) and flighty artist mother (Naomi Watts) wanted the family to live off the grid, which meant multiple moves from town to town, no school, and often no food. Jeannette frequently suffers physical and mental abuse. In one scene, she severely burns herself on the stove because her mother can’t be bothered to feed her; in another, she nearly drowns in a public pool when her father throws her into the deep end to teach her how to swim. All of these perils are in the name of making her (and the other kids) stronger, of giving them independence and character. But it’s harrowing to watch. The film also includes scenes of abandonment and neglect, as well as a moment when the father encourages teenage Jeannette to visit the apartment of an older man who tries to sexually assault her. Ultimately, The Glass Castle&nbsp;is about forgiveness and redemption, but it’s a long and painful haul to get there.","section":"Parental Guidance","tags":"critic, a, park","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/10111551/Daddys-Home2-PG.jpg","slug":"how-family-friendly-are-daddys-home-2-and-murder-on-the-orient-express"},{"id":"47508903867210","title":"How Family-Friendly Is Spider-Man: Homecoming?","content":"Parental Guidancevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})How Family-Friendly Is Spider-Man: Homecoming?by Christy Lemire | July 7, 2017 |  CommentsThe big movie this week is the latest big screen iteration of your friendly neighborhood wall-crawler, and kids who have grown up watching the MCU movies will certainly want to hit the theaters for it. It is, however, rated PG-13, and Christy fills us in on what you’ll need to know about it before you take the young ones to see it. Read on for details on that and a recent Holocaust drama newly available on DVD.NOW IN THEATERS&nbsp;Spider-Man: Homecoming (2017)  92%Rating: PG-13, for&nbsp;sci-fi action violence, some language and brief suggestive comments.Spidey is back for an all-new adventure, and it might be the most kid-friendly, live-action incarnation of the character yet. There’s a lightness and a playfulness here that’s sometimes missing in comic book movies – especially the darker and more self-serious ones featuring Batman and Superman. But Tom Holland brings a boyish enthusiasm to the role that’s infectious, glimmers of which we saw during his brief appearance in last summer’s Captain America: Civil War. Spider-Man: Homecoming&nbsp;fits nicely into the Marvel Cinematic Universe, but it also stands comfortably on its own. It picks up right where Civil War&nbsp;leaves off, actually, with nerdy high schooler Peter Parker still reveling in the opportunity to hang with the big boys (and girls). But he also must keep his superhero identity a secret – including from his Aunt May (Marisa Tomei) and best friend, Ned (scene-stealing newcomer Jacob Batalon) – even as he longs to continue fighting crime. There are some big battle scenes and action set pieces here, as there always are in this genre, including one spectacularly tense one aboard the Staten Island Ferry. Innocent folks are frequently in peril, but Spider-Man always swings in to save the day. There’s also some language scattered throughout, some crass name-calling and light bullying. And there’s a quick (and hilarious) reference to porn, but younger viewers won’t get it. I brought my 7 ½-year-old son to a screening and he absolutely loved this movie (as did I). Totally great for kids around 7 or 8 and older.NEW ON DVD&nbsp;The Zookeeper's Wife (2017)  64%Rating:&nbsp;PG-13, for&nbsp;thematic elements, disturbing images, violence, brief sexuality, nudity and smoking.Jessica Chastain hangs out with lots of cuddly and adorable zoo animals, but don’t be fooled: This isn’t a kids’ movie. Viewers around age 12 and older will probably be fine watching this true story about a couple who saved the lives of hundreds of Jews during the Holocaust by hiding them in the basement of the Warsaw zoo. Chastain’s Antonina Zabinski and her husband, Jan (Johan Heldenbergh), risked their lives and that of their young son by sneaking people out of the Warsaw ghetto and helping them find new lives. Director Niki Caro’s film is often extremely hard to watch. We see Nazi soldiers shoot people and animals to death. We witness Jews being herded onto trains on their way to concentration camps. One young woman is raped (we don’t see the assault, but it’s implied). A zoologist from Berlin (Daniel Bruhl), who initially pretends to be the couple’s ally, eventually reveals himself as a Nazi and tries to force himself on Antonina. There’s a ton of World War II violence, including shootouts, bombings and mass destruction. But The Zookeeper’s Wife&nbsp;is also a well-acted, inspiring story of heroism, courage and sacrifice.","section":"Parental Guidance","tags":"hispanic, talk, lee, News, all-time, globes, GLAAD, werewolf, New, Mindy, Tyler, Academy, Fox, competition","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/06170025/Spider-Man-Homecoming-PG.jpg","slug":"how-family-friendly-is-spider-man-homecoming"},{"id":"47508903872331","title":"How Family-Friendly Is Despicable Me 3?","content":"Parental Guidancevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})How Family-Friendly Is Despicable Me 3?by Christy Lemire | June 30, 2017 |  CommentsThere’s only one new wide release out this week that’s anywhere near appropriate for family viewing, and that’s the latest in the&nbsp;Despicable Me franchise. It’s probably mostly fine for your kids, but read on for Christy’s take on it, as well as a look at the recent&nbsp;Power Rangers movie that just arrived on DVD.NOW IN THEATERS&nbsp;Despicable Me 3 (2017)  58%Rating: PG, for action and rude humor.Gru and the Minions are back for yet another wildly colorful animated adventure. If you’ve seen the previous two Despicable Me movies – and really, how could you avoid them? – you’re in for a lot more of the same. This time, Gru (voiced as always by Steve Carell) finds out he has a long-lost, identical twin brother named Dru (also voiced by Carell). But whereas Gru wants to live a quiet life with new wife Lucy (Kristen Wiig) and their young daughters — Margo, Edith and Agnes – Dru wants to drag him back into the excitement of super villainy. Together, the two team up to fight an ‘80s child star turned bad guy, Balthazar Bratt (Trey Parker), who has stolen a giant pink diamond to use as a giant laser. And they have to do it without the (dubious) help of the Minions, who’ve been thrown in prison. Suffice it to say, there’s a lot going on here. But it’s all so zany and high-energy, kids will probably be laughing too hard to realize how convoluted the plot is. Despicable Me 3&nbsp;features the usual crass humor as its predecessors: tiny, yellow Minion butts, fart guns, gibberishy jokes about boobs, that sort of thing. At one point, the girls wander into a dive bar, but it’s populated with harmless, amusing lowlifes. There are big, noisy chase scenes and action sequences, as well as some mass urban destruction in Hollywood, but everything turns out fine in the end. Suitable for the whole family.NEW ON DVD&nbsp;Saban's Power Rangers (2017)  50%Rating:&nbsp;PG-13, for sequences of sci-fi violence, action and destruction, language, and for some crude humor.Kids around 9 or 10 and older should be fine watching this latest incarnation of the Power Rangers saga, an update on the the cheesy TV series you may have grown up watching in the early 1990s. Essentially, it’s a superhero version of The Breakfast Club, with five disparate high school students finding colorful crystal coins in an abandoned mine that give them unexpected powers. But they also find themselves in the middle of a battle for the planet that’s millions of years old. In the process, the fictional small town of Angel Grove gets decimated. There’s quite a bit of big, noisy violence here, as well as some more intimate, hand-to-hand combat sequences with monsters that look like a bunch of boulders stacked on top of each other. There’s also language throughout, some suggestive humor off the top involving a cow’s bodily fluids, and a police chase and car crash. And the villain, former Power Ranger Rita Repulsa (a campy Elizabeth Banks), may seem scary to little kids, particularly at the beginning of the film when she looks especially witch-like and hasn’t regained her full power and splendor. That’s the only thing that my 7-year-old son found disturbing: an especially violent scene in an alley at night involving Rita and a hobo who found himself in the wrong place at the wrong time. But it’s brief.","section":"Parental Guidance","tags":"Warner, Podcast, actors","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/30115432/Despicable-Me-3-PG.jpg","slug":"how-family-friendly-is-despicable-me-3"},{"id":"47508903863113","title":"War for the Planet of the Apes Is Good, but It’s Not for Kids","content":"Parental Guidancevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})War for the Planet of the Apes Is Good, but It's Not for Kidsby Christy Lemire | July 14, 2017 |  CommentsThe latest entry in the Planet of the Apes franchise barrels its way into theaters this week, and by most accounts, it’s a fantastic film. But if you’re looking to catch up with Caesar and his battle with humanity, you may want to leave your kids at home. Christy explains why, then offers her thoughts on a few DVD releases.NOW IN THEATERS&nbsp;War for the Planet of the Apes (2017)  94%Rating: PG-13, for&nbsp;sequences of sci-fi violence and action, thematic elements, and some disturbing images.The latest film in the epic Planet of the Apes saga is beautifully acted, exquisitely crafted and unexpectedly emotional. It’s the best blockbuster of the summer and it might end up being one of the best movies of the year. But while it features apes on horseback – many of whom can talk, and some of whom are funny – this definitely isn’t a film for the entire family. Director Matt Reeves’ movie – the third in a reboot trilogy, following Rise of the Planet of the Apes&nbsp;and Dawn of the Planet of the Apes&nbsp;– is extremely intense and violent, with protracted battle sequences and multiple deaths. Caesar (Andy Serkis in yet another powerful, detailed performance-capture role) wants to lead his apes to safety, but they all end up in a brutal struggle against the humans, led by the sadistic Colonel (Woody Harrelson). Bullets and arrows fly and many people and apes die, including key characters. Several of the apes are held prisoner for an extended time and are whipped, beaten and forced into hard labor. While it features massive explosions and destruction, War is also disturbing in some of its quieter, darker imagery. And the bold, percussive score from the great composer Michael Giacchino adds to the overall feeling of danger and suspense. But for more mature kids – around 11 and older – it’s a spectacular, thrilling time at the movies.NEW ON DVD&nbsp;The Fate of the Furious (2017)  67%Rating:&nbsp;PG-13, for prolonged sequences of violence and destruction, suggestive content, and language.If you and your kids have seen any of the previous movies in the Fast and Furious&nbsp;franchise, you know what you’re in for here. This eighth film in the series is just as nutty as its predecessors in terms of giant action set pieces, but it’s also extremely violent in ways large and small, making it suitable for viewers around 12 or 13 and older. It’s got everything from hand-to-hand combat, gunfights, shootings and stabbings to cars dropping out of windows in the middle of New York City and a submarine emerging from the ice in middle-of-nowhere Russia. And for one extended sequence aboard an airplane, a baby in a car seat is in danger. Oh, and there’s a plot, too: A hacker (Charlize Theron) forces Dom (Vin Diesel) to turn against his F&amp;F fam and help her with a nuclear terrorism plot. Not that it matters. Massive, fiery destruction ensues. Director F. Gary Gray’s film also features quite a bit of language scattered throughout and the requisite amount of gyrating, scantily clad ladies. It’s all about family, as always, but that doesn’t necessarily mean it’s suitable for everyone in your family.The Lost City of Z (2017)  86%Rating:&nbsp;PG-13, for&nbsp;violence, disturbing images, brief strong language and some nudity.Kids around 12 or 13 and older should be fine watching this historical drama, and they might be interested in its many adventurous elements. But the deliberately languid pacing, which is a trademark of writer-director James Gray’s style, will make it a tough sit for younger viewers. Charlie Hunnam stars in this true story of Percy Fawcett, an explorer who set out in the 1920s to prove the existence of a long-lost South American civilization. He made several journeys to the Amazon, all of which were treacherous and potentially deadly. But Fawcett kept going back for more – and even brought along his teenage son at one point — as new clues tantalized him and stoked his obsession. There are plenty of guns and shootings, including hunting, with smoking and language throughout. The natives frequently seem threatening. And the ending is a bit ambiguous, which could lead to some confusion.Smurfs: The Lost Village (2017)  40%Rating:&nbsp;PG, for&nbsp;some mild action and rude humor.If you’re looking for a movie the whole family can watch together, the all-new Smurfs animated adventure is a solid pick. It’s better than you might expect – despite what the Tomatometer suggested when it came out theatrically. Smurfette (voiced by Demi Lovato) wonders what her purpose is in life while every other Smurf’s abilities are clear from their names alone: Brainy, Hefty, Jokey, etc. When she and her friends learn there’s another entire village of Smurfs, they set off to find them – and to warn that Gargamel (Rainn Wilson) is after them to drain them of their power. This is a vibrant and lively film with a valuable central message about female identity and empowerment. It’s also about strong women supporting each other, as Smurfette finds and connects with a tribe of female Smurfs (voiced by Julia Roberts, Ellie Kemper and Michelle Rodriguez, among others). The humor is mostly light and playful and often extremely slapsticky. Kids will enjoy the cute and clever creatures. Gargamel flies into full-on, villainous rampages a couple times, accompanied by dramatic music and lighting, which might seem slightly scary for extremely young kids. Mostly, though, he’s a buffoon whose bumbling schemes are played for laughs.","section":"Parental Guidance","tags":"adaptation, Cinematographers, talk, Tomatazos, John, political, Marvel","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/14103340/War-for-Planet-Apes-PG.jpg","slug":"war-for-the-planet-of-the-apes-is-good-but-its-not-for-kids"},{"id":"47508903845703","title":"If Your Kids Insist on Watching The Emoji Movie, Here’s What You Should Know","content":"Parental Guidancevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})If Your Kids Insist on Watching The Emoji Movie, Here's What You Should Knowby Christy Lemire | July 28, 2017 |  CommentsYes, there’s a decent chance your kids have seen the colorful, zany ads for The Emoji Movie, and with little else playing for the little ones in movie theaters, you may find yourself standing in line for tickets to see it. Christy offers some advice for those of you who are thinking about doing this, and she also has an alternative to offer. Read on for details.NOW IN THEATERS&nbsp;The Emoji Movie (2017)  7%Rating: PG, for rude humor.Sure, you could take your kids to see The Emoji Movie, but should you? Its 3 percent Tomatometer score –- a truly impressive feat to achieve –- should tell you everything you need to know about it. Still, kids are kids, and they’ll probably be drawn to the colorful characters and their wacky antics. And of course, because one of the main characters is the Poop emoji (voiced by Patrick Stewart, of all people), there’s plenty of potty humor. Basically, the movie explores what it would be like if the emojis inside your smartphone were sentient beings with personalities -– albeit, one-note personalities dictated by the emotions they express. But ultimately, its message is the same trite one so many animated movies offer: Find your own voice and be true to yourself. Not a terrible concept, but not an especially novel one, either. At various points, the characters find themselves in the midst of danger and destruction. There’s a bit of kissing as well as a scene in a dive bar. Overall, it’s harmless for children -– but soul crushing for adults.An Inconvenient Sequel: Truth To Power (2017)  80%Rating:&nbsp;PG, for thematic elements and some troubling images.Eleven years after the release of the Oscar-winning documentary An Inconvenient Truth, Al Gore is back, still fighting climate change with the same passion he’s shown for decades. This sequel has a bit less punch than its predecessor, and it’s so worshipful of the former vice president that it often plays like an infomercial. But the topic is unfortunately more relevant than ever -– especially with President Trump pulling the United States out of the Paris climate accord earlier this summer -– and Gore’s dedication is undeniable. As he travels on his worldwide lecture circuit, Gore shows dramatic videos revealing the increasing power of natural disasters because of the effects of global warming. Countless people find themselves homeless and in harm’s way. And Gore gets fired up as he addresses large crowds on the subject, his intensity often turning to anger. But both the sequel and the original could be useful teaching tools for young people, especially if they have an interest in science. Fine for viewers around 8 or 9 and older –- if you can convince them that they won’t be bored.NEW ON DVD&nbsp;Ghost in the Shell (2017)  43%Rating:&nbsp;PG-13, for intense sequences of sci-fi violence, suggestive content and some disturbing images.This movie truly earns its rating; I’d say it’s really only suitable for more mature kids who are 13 and older. Scarlett Johansson stars in a live-action version of the influential 1995 Japanese anime film about a futuristic society in which a young woman’s brain is placed in a synthetic body. Johansson’s Major is a trained killing machine, but she’s haunted by glimmers of memories of her human past, many of which are frightening. This is an extremely violent movie with punishing fight sequences, extended gun battles and major explosions. The world in which the characters live is dark and gloomy (despite bursts of high-tech color) and it’s full of danger. Much of the imagery is extremely creepy, such as the sight of a robot geisha being shot in the face. Also, there are many scenes in which it appears that Major is fighting while completely naked, but it’s actually just the way her flesh-colored “shell” was designed. And there’s a scene in a club with strippers, but we don’t see much.The Boss Baby (2017)  53%Rating:&nbsp;PG, for some mild rude humor.Your own babies around 5 or 6 and older should be fine watching this animated comedy, even though it’s truly bizarre. A 7-year-old boy named Tim (voiced by Miles Christopher Bakshi) is living a perfectly happy, suburban life with his mom (Lisa Kudrow) and dad (Jimmy Kimmel). Then one day, a baby brother arrives –- and he’s wearing a suit, carrying a briefcase, tossing cash around and talking with the voice of Alec Baldwin. He’s an infant and a grown-up at the same time, and he’s here on a mission involving puppies and a rocket ship…? Anyway, it’s very confusing, but ultimately harmless. Tim has an active imagination, which leads to some wildly colorful fantasy sequences, but they’re more playful than scary. There are the obligatory diaper and potty jokes, and we see some naked baby butts. A trip to Las Vegas involves some slightly racy humor that kids won’t get. And a mad scientist holds Tim and the baby captive, briefly, but they ultimately save the day.","section":"Parental Guidance","tags":"versus, Nat, emmy, Calendar, book, stoner, wars, cults, Century, TV+, ITV, 4/20, news, Series, on","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/28111136/Emoji-PG.jpg","slug":"if-your-kids-insist-on-watching-the-emoji-movie-heres-what-you-should-know"},{"id":"47508906089313","title":"How Family-Friendly is A Dog’s Purpose?","content":"Parental Guidancevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})How Family-Friendly is A Dog's Purpose?by Christy Lemire | January 27, 2017 |  CommentsThe only movie in wide release this week that your kids might want to see happens to be about adorable dogs dying over and over again… and it’s been marred by some bad press lately. Read on to see whether it might all be too much for younger viewers, and get Christy’s take on a couple of DVD releases.NOW IN THEATERS&nbsp;A Dog's Purpose (2017)  35%Rating: PG, for thematic elements and some peril.This movie is terrible, but it’s also terribly effective. There’s no way you won’t cry, multiple times, at the shamelessly heart-tugging sight of adorable dogs dying over and over again. Director Lasse Hallstrom’s film is supposed to be inspirational, though. It’s a hokey story about a dog named Bailey (voiced by a perky Josh Gad) whose spirit is repeatedly reincarnated over several decades. He finds himself inside a German shepherd police dog and a corgi who befriends a college student, among others. Yes, this is a concept that requires you to make giant leaps in faith. But the script is also full of melodramatic situations and barely-drawn characters. Younger viewers may not perceive all that, but they’ll probably find the sight of dogs in danger and dying rather disturbing. One version of Bailey gets shot and another is abandoned in the cold, dark night. There is eventual uplift, though, and the possibility of redemption. I brought my 7-year-old son with me to a screening and he didn’t find anything frightening. “I liked all of it,” he said. So there you go.NEW ON DVDInferno (2016)  23%Rating: PG-13, for sequences of action and violence, disturbing images, some language, thematic elements and brief sensuality.This is one of those instances in which PG-13 really does mean that viewers under 13 shouldn’t see it. Inferno is mostly silly, but it can be extremely scary and intense at times. The third film based on Dan Brown’s best-selling novels about symbols and sinister secrets isn’t much better than its predecessors – The Da Vinci Code&nbsp;and Angels &amp; Demons&nbsp;– but it is more disturbing in its imagery. Ron Howard once again directs Tom Hanks as Harvard professor Robert Langdon, whose mission this time is to stop a high-tech plague from killing billions of people worldwide. Along the way, he finds himself plagued by hellish visions of bodies burning and writhing in pain and surging rivers of blood. Several characters also get shot or stabbed to death in their pursuit of Langdon and his latest sidekick, a brilliant young doctor (Felicity Jones). There’s also a bit of language and a brief love scene.The Light Between Oceans (2016)  61%Rating: PG-13, for thematic material and some sexual content.Viewers around 13 and older will probably be fine watching this heavy-duty, emotionally cathartic romantic drama. It’s beautifully shot and strongly acted. Derek Cianfrance’s adaptation of the M.L. Stedman novel follows the tumultuous relationship between a stoic lighthouse keeper (Michael Fassbender) and his energetic, young wife (Alicia Vikander) living on a remote island off the coast of Western Australia just after World War I. While they are initially happy, their attempts at starting a family end in two miscarriages. But when an infant washes ashore in a small boat after a storm – along with her deceased father – the couple believes they’ve received one last shot at happiness. It isn’t that easy, though. The Light Between Oceans&nbsp;deals with the mature themes of birth and death, guilt and truth. Vikander’s character is understandably devastated both physically and psychologically after her loss, but she’s also the one to pressure her husband into lying and pretending the baby is theirs. There are a couple of brief sex scenes, although they feature barely any nudity. And toward the end, the baby – now a 5-year-old girl – goes missing and appears to be in danger.","section":"Parental Guidance","tags":"Poppins, batman, Logo, Bros., Television, TV+, Pirates, Originals, sitcom, Paramount, superman, Dates, Britbox, 21st","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/27114638/Dogs-Purpose-PG.jpg","slug":"how-family-friendly-is-a-dogs-purpose"},{"id":"47508903838534","title":"How Family-Friendly Is The Dark Tower?","content":"Parental Guidancevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})How Family-Friendly Is The Dark Tower?by Christy Lemire | August 4, 2017 |  CommentsThere isn’t anything new in theaters this week that’s aimed squarely at kids, but on first glance, the Stephen King adaptation The Dark Tower may look a bit like a kid-friendly fantasy adventure… albeit an intense one. Christy tells you what you need to know about it if you plan on taking the family to see it, plus offers her assessment on a couple of newly released DVDs. Read on for details.NOW IN THEATERS&nbsp;The Dark Tower (2017)  16%Rating: PG-13, for&nbsp;thematic material including sequences of gun violence and action.The long-awaited big-screen version of the revered Stephen King series will be too much for young viewers, yet not enough for everyone else. It’s about portals and time travel and monsters and gun battles, but while the original mythology is dense, director Nikolaj Arcel’s adaptation of it feels truncated and rushed. Idris Elba stars as the legendary Gunslinger, who’s long been searching for the devilish Man in Black (Matthew McConaughey) to keep him from destroying the Dark Tower, which stands in the middle of the universe to protect against evil forces. Only the psychically gifted Jake (Tom Taylor), a misfit Manhattan kid who’s had visions of such destruction, can save us all. While the visual effects often look muddled, the violence within them is unmistakable: vicious beasts that attack out of nowhere; fiery, hellish images of mass suffering; prolonged gun fights that result in many casualties. Children are abducted from around the world and placed in torturous devices to do The Man in Black’s bidding. Both Jake and the Gunslinger must deal with the deaths of people who are important to them. And McConaughey’s character also has psychic powers, which he usually uses to kill people. Overall, it’s not very good, but it is intense. OK for tweens and older.NEW ON DVD&nbsp;The Circle (2017)  15%Rating:&nbsp;PG-13, for a sexual situation, brief strong language and some thematic elements including drug use.Tweens and up should be fine watching this thriller about the evils of the internet – although by the time they see it, they’ll probably think it’s lame and outdated. This cautionary tale, based on Dave Eggers’ bestseller, covers much of the same ground as countless technological thrillers before it. The film from director James Ponsoldt (The Spectacular Now) is glossy but ultimately feels choppy. Emma Watson stars as a wide-eyed new employee at a shiny social media behemoth called The Circle. It’s sort of like an extreme version of Google, and it’s similarly situated smack in the middle of the Bay Area. Watson’s Mae is super excited to leave her small town and take an entry-level job there, and quickly succumbs to the corporate culture of sharing everything, all the time, as the company’s gregarious CEO (Tom Hanks) instructs. But when she agrees to take part in a live experiment that destroys all notions of personal privacy, bad things happen. There’s quite a bit of language throughout, including Hanks’ use of the one F-word you’re allowed in a PG-13 movie. Mae accidentally broadcasts an embarrassing sexual situation involving her mother (Glenne Headly) and her father (Bill Paxton), who suffers from multiple sclerosis. A character dies. And there’s just general tension as Mae gets closer to the truth about the company’s intentions.Going in Style (2017)  47%Rating:&nbsp;PG-13, for&nbsp;drug content, language and some suggestive material.Viewers around 10 or 11 and older will be OK watching director Zach Braff’s remake of the 1979 comedy which starred George Burns, Art Carney, and Lee Strasberg as elderly, lifelong friends who rob a bank. This time, Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman, and Alan Arkin play elderly, lifelong friends who rob a bank – but instead of doing it for kicks, as the characters did in the original, these guys do it out of revenge. There’s quite a bit of language throughout, as well as gunfire – some real, some blanks. Arkin’s character engages in some hot and heavy frolicking with Ann-Margret’s character, a pretty, flirty grocery store clerk. Part of the scheme involves a medical marijuana dealer, which leads to these old-timers getting high and having the munchies. And of course, at the center of all these antics is a massive, federal crime. Going in Style&nbsp;offers some decent laughs here and there, and the three stars are such pros and have such lovely chemistry with each other, they’re enjoyable to watch – even if the movie itself is forgettable.","section":"Parental Guidance","tags":"Pride, Plus, scene, TV, crossover, John","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/04132451/The-Dark-Tower-PG.jpg","slug":"how-family-friendly-is-the-dark-tower"},{"id":"47508903885646","title":"How Family-Friendly is The Mummy?","content":"Parental Guidancevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})How Family-Friendly is The Mummy?by Christy Lemire | June 9, 2017 |  CommentsThere’s a new Tom Cruise action movie out this week, and since this one is meant to kick off an entire franchise, it’s been sanitized just enough to earn a PG-13 rating. That said, there may still be some things in the film that might be too intense for your kids, and Christy has the scoop on that.NOW IN THEATERS&nbsp;The Mummy (2017)  16%Rating:&nbsp;PG-13, for violence, action and scary images, and for some suggestive content and partial nudity.Tom Cruise’s reboot of The Mummy&nbsp;is actually the beginning of a whole new Universal universe – a series of high-tech re-dos of classic monster movies. So you have that to look forward to for years to come. This time, Cruise stars as a highly trained soldier who secretly steals antiquities during missions alongside his wisecracking friend and partner (Jake Johnson). One day, he accidentally unearths an ancient tomb – and helps revive an evil Egyptian princess (Sofia Boutella) who’d been buried for centuries. There’s quite a bit of startling, gnarly imagery here, as well as sexually suggestive material. A flashback to the events that sealed the princess’ fate reveals that she murdered her family (which we don’t see, but the blood splatters suggest what she’s done). In the present day, she kills several people by draining the life from them with a kiss – but then they’re reborn as her ferocious, undead army. She causes quite a bit of chaos and destruction, including an intense plane crash and a massive sandstorm that engulfs London. She’s also barely clothed most of the time. And there are several fistfights, stabbings and explosions. In general, the enormous, noisy spectacle of director Alex Kurtzman’s film may be too much for younger viewers to handle. I’d say this is appropriate for kids around 10 or 11 and older.NEW ON DVD&nbsp;Beauty and the Beast (2017)  71%Rating:&nbsp;PG, for some action, violence, peril, and frightening images.Kids around 6 and up should be fine watching this elaborate, live-action retelling of the beloved 1991 animated Disney musical. In fact, they’ll probably adore it. Emma Watson and Dan Stevens star as the titular beauty and the beast. She’s a smart young woman who’s sick of being stuck in her provincial French town; he’s a surly, cursed prince who’s sick of being stuck in his massive castle. Could these two crazy kids possibly find love? Director Bill Condon’s film is visually dazzling, adding luxurious flair to all the big musical numbers you know and love (plus a few new tunes that aren’t quite so great). Children will delight in the household items coming to life and bursting into song – the clock, candelabra, teapot and cup, for example. But there are also dangers to be found in the woods leading up to the beast’s castle. It’s dark and full of ravenous wolves, which might be scary for the littlest viewers. Belle’s father (Kevin Kline) is in peril several times. The arrogant Gaston (Luke Evans) whips the villagers into a frenzy, leading them in a mob to kill the beast. And of course, because this is a Disney movie, there are dead parents. But for the most part, your kids will probably love this, and they’ll be singing the songs around the house for days afterward.A United Kingdom (2017)  84%Rating:&nbsp;PG-13, for some language including racial epithets and a scene of sensuality.Tweens and older should be OK watching this inspiring tale of perseverance, loyalty and love. David Oyelowo and Rosamund Pike star in this true story based on an interracial marriage that caused an international uproar. Oyelowo plays Seretse Khama, the former king of Botswana (then called Bechuanaland, and a British protectorate) who dared to marry Pike’s Ruth Williams, a white British woman, in 1947 London. He brought her home to Africa to make her the queen of his people, but neither of them could have predicted the massive repercussions such an intimate decision could have caused. This is a well-acted and well-made but restrained drama. The couple endures racial slurs as well as rejection from both of their families. Director Amma Asante also shows us the kind of segregation that was prevalent at the time, especially as apartheid was beginning to take hold in neighboring South Africa. There’s also a bit of language and the suggestion that the couple has sex on their wedding night.","section":"Parental Guidance","tags":"Rey, VH1, target, Academy, of, obituary, Movies, Originals, tv, play","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/09103914/The-Mummy-PG.jpg","slug":"how-family-friendly-is-the-mummy"},{"id":"47508903876428","title":"How Family-Friendly Is Transformers: The Last Knight?","content":"Parental Guidancevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})How Family-Friendly Is Transformers: The Last Knight?by Christy Lemire | June 23, 2017 |  CommentsThere is only one franchise big enough, bad enough, and explodey enough to scare away all other wide releases, for fear of getting caught up in its black fumes and brotastic posturing. That franchise is, of course, the&nbsp;Transformers franchise, and if your kids succeed in suckering you to go see the latest installment, here’s what you should know about it, for their sake.NOW IN THEATERS&nbsp;Transformers: The Last Knight (2017)  15%Rating: PG-13, for&nbsp;violence and intense sequences of sci-fi action, language, and some innuendo.No, you’re not losing your mind. There is indeed a fifth Transformers&nbsp;movie. Once again, the planet is in peril, and only Mark Wahlberg playing a guy named Cade Yeager can save it. Trying to explain the plot is pointless. Transformers: The Last Knight&nbsp;manages to be more incoherent than its predecessors. Plus, you probably don’t care. Suffice it to say, it’s about giant robots smashing into each other. It’s also about their alien planet, Cybertron, potentially smashing into Earth to drain it of all its energy. Michael Bay’s film is, as always, a massive, cacophonous spectacle. There’s a ton of violence here, beginning with a battle set during the time of King Arthur. In the present day, the robot combat causes a ton of destruction, as always — and explosions.&nbsp;&nbsp;So many explosions. There’s quite a bit of language throughout as various characters insult each other and freak out about the possibility of the world ending. And there’s some mildly racy humor as Wahlberg’s character exchanges allegedly snappy banter with a brilliant and suggestively dressed professor (Laura Haddock), but kids probably won’t get it. I took my 7 ½-year-old son to an IMAX 3-D screening and he was fine, but kids who feel uncomfortable during sensory-overload movies like this might have difficulty watching it. And at well over two hours, the new Transformers will probably be a tough sit for many young viewers. Fine for tweens and older.","section":"Parental Guidance","tags":"21st, The, Christmas, Mudbound, Election, Women's","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/23102933/Transformers-Last-Knight-PG.jpg","slug":"how-family-friendly-is-transformers-the-last-knight"},{"id":"47508906079070","title":"How Family-Friendly Is The Great Wall?","content":"Parental Guidancevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})How Family-Friendly Is The Great Wall?by Christy Lemire | February 17, 2017 |  CommentsThe big movie this week is Zhang Yimou’s epic period action film starring Matt Damon, and it’s exactly the kind of “good guys vs. monsters” PG-13 spectacle intended to draw wide-eyed younger audiences. That said, how young is too young to see the movie? Read on for details on The Great Wall, plus a Best Picture-nominated sci-fi mystery on DVD.NOW IN THEATERS&nbsp;The Great Wall (2017)  35%Rating: PG-13, for sequences of fantasy action violence.So apparently, the Great Wall of China was built all those centuries ago… to keep out ravenous hordes of marauding monsters? Such is the alternative history this 3-D action epic offers. The Great Wall&nbsp;is the most expensive movie ever made entirely in China (with a reported budget around $150 million), and it shows. Chinese master Zhang Yimou’s first English-language film is massive, with elaborate production design, an enormous cast and high-tech special effects. At the center of it all is Matt Damon as an Irish mercenary who learns to be a part of something larger than himself when he joins an elite force of Chinese warriors to fend off these hideous creatures. And here’s where The Great Wall&nbsp;will be way too intense for younger kids. The monsters look like a speedier, angrier version of the “Jurassic Park” dinosaurs, with gnashing teeth reminiscent of the “Alien” franchise. Zhang shows them to us at a distance, moving as an organized pack, but also up close and personal as they rip individual soldiers to shreds. He creates sweeping battle scenes, full of swords, arrows and explosives. Even though it’s all computer-generated imagery, it’s scary and gory. I’d say kids around 11 or 12 and older will be OK here.NEW ON DVD&nbsp;Arrival (2016)  94%Rating: PG-13, for brief strong language.Older kids – especially those with a taste for science fiction – will find this slow-burn drama compelling. But they might be a little confused by the movie’s time-hopping narrative structure; then again, you might be, too. Nominated for eight Academy Awards including Best Picture and Best Director for Denis Villeneuve, Arrival&nbsp;is an inventive take on the alien-invasion thriller. Amy Adams plays a linguist trying to understand the aliens’ intricate language; Jeremy Renner plays the biologist hoping to study their complex makeup. The images are beautiful and haunting at the same time, with a mix of mystery and wonder. There’s a bit of language and a few intense situations. And part of the film’s drama comes from the death of a little girl who’d been suffering from a disease. But for the most part, Arrival&nbsp;defies your expectations of this ordinarily panicky, heart-pounding genre. It’s beautifully shot and ultimately, surprisingly, hopeful.","section":"Parental Guidance","tags":"hollywood, stand-up, drama, and, indie, Interview, The, marvel, Awards","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/17114556/Great-Wall-PG.jpg","slug":"how-family-friendly-is-the-great-wall"},{"id":"47508904976219","title":"How Family-Friendly is Kong: Skull Island?","content":"Parental Guidancevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})How Family-Friendly is Kong: Skull Island?by Christy Lemire | March 10, 2017 |  CommentsThe big movie this week is a giant monster throwback featuring a certain great ape, but is he too fearsome for little kids? Christy offers parents a rundown of what they should look out for in the blockbuster, then talks about Disney’s latest triumph, Moana.NOW IN THEATERS&nbsp;Kong: Skull Island (2017)  75%Rating: PG-13, for intense sequences of sci-fi violence and action, and for brief strong language.If you like your monster movies big and dumb, you will love Kong: Skull Island. And I mean that as a total compliment. This action epic from director Jordan Vogt-Roberts has the spirit of a classic Ray Harryhausen film with the benefit of high-tech special effects. A team of explorers visits an uncharted island in the South Pacific in 1973 and finds more danger than they ever could have imagined. They include an expert tracker (Tom Hiddleston), a war photographer (Brie Larson), the head of a shadowy government agency (John Goodman), and a military team with a no-nonsense leader (Samuel L. Jackson). But you’re not here for the people. You’re here to see King Kong, who rules the island as a fearsome, deadly, but ultimately gentle giant. This is not a spoiler: If you’ve ever seen any incarnation of King Kong, you know he’s misunderstood. But he might be super-scary for very little kids, especially as he battles the many other oversized monsters that happen to call this island home. (What’s in the water surrounding this place anyway?) I brought my 7-year-old son and he thought Kong&nbsp;was a blast. It is pretty intense, though, with a lot of violence, gunfire, monster action and helicopter destruction, and not everyone makes it out alive. There’s also quite a bit of language, including the one F-bomb you get in a PG-13 movie, courtesy of John C. Reilly. I’d say this is OK for viewers around 9 or 10 and older.NEW ON DVD&nbsp;Moana (2016)  95%Rating: PG, for peril, some scary images and brief thematic elements.If, for some reason, your kids haven’t already seen Moana, now is the perfect time to show it to them. It’s a great choice for the whole family — a two-time Academy Award nominee for best animated film and best original song for the girl-power anthem “How Far I’ll Go.” The latest musical extravaganza from Walt Disney Animation Studios features newcomer Auli’I Cravalho as the title character, a Polynesian teen who’s next in line to lead her tribe. But she has dreams of leaving the island and traveling the high seas, despite her parents’ wishes for her to stay put. She teams up with the demigod Maui (Dwayne Johnson) to return a magical stone to its rightful place, but the two run into a series of obstacles and enemies along the way. Most of Moana is upbeat and delightful. Even some of the villains are downright adorable, including an armada of pirate coconuts with mean, painted faces. But the ultimate enemy is a giant lava monster that rages and hurls fire balls at anyone who comes near. It’s dark and hulking and may be too scary for the littlest viewers. Moana also must deal with the death of a beloved relative, but it’s handled gracefully. But there’s so much here that’s worthwhile for boys and girls alike. Moana&nbsp;is about a strong, curvy girl who’s assertive and independent but also kind and loyal. She puts herself in danger for the well being of her people and, in the process, finds her voice and the confidence to serve as a leader.","section":"Parental Guidance","tags":"Network, movies, transformers, OWN, Exclusive, Mindy, war, composers, dogs, Academy, street, 21st, Elton","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/10110223/Kong-Skull-Island-PG.jpg","slug":"how-family-friendly-is-kong-skull-island"},{"id":"47508906086239","title":"How Family-Friendly are The LEGO Batman Movie and A United Kingdom?","content":"Parental Guidancevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})How Family-Friendly are The LEGO Batman Movie and A United Kingdom?by Christy Lemire | February 10, 2017 |  CommentsJohn Wick: Chapter 2 and Fifty Shades Darker are obviously not for children, while The LEGO Batman Movie most certainly is. With that in mind Christy lets us know what we can expect from the latter, as well as the based-on-true-events drama A United Kingdom and a handful of new DVD releases.&nbsp;Read on for details.NOW IN THEATERS&nbsp;The Lego Batman Movie (2017)  90%Rating: PG, for rude humor and some action.Everything is awesome, again, but now Batman is front and center for this high-energy, self-referential animated extravaganza. This spin-off of 2014’s The Lego Movie&nbsp;finds Batman (voiced once again with wonderfully gravelly arrogance by Will Arnett) fighting to remain relevant as Gotham’s hero. He’s also struggling with an existential crisis, as the arrival of sidekick Robin (Michael Cera) forces him to accept the possibility that he might actually need a family. The humor is rapid-fire but never mean, and while there’s violence and destruction throughout, it’s silly and playful. This is a movie in which characters make “pew pew pew” noises while they’re firing at each other with plastic guns. Many villains show up from both comic books and other pop-culture realms, but they’re depicted in such a goofy way that they’re never scary. And ultimately, the themes of allowing people into your life to help you and creating your own sense of family are worthwhile. Fine for all ages.A United Kingdom (2017)  84%Rating: PG-13, for some language including racial epithets and a scene of sensuality.David Oyelowo and Rosamund Pike star in this true story based on an interracial marriage that caused an international uproar. Oyelowo plays Seretse Khama, the former king of Botswana (then called Bechuanaland, and a British protectorate) who dared to marry Pike’s Ruth Williams, a white British woman, in 1947 London. He brought her home to Africa to make her the queen of his people, but neither of them could have predicted the massive repercussions such an intimate decision could have caused.

Director Amma Asante also shows us the kind of segregation that was prevalent at the time, especially as apartheid was beginning to take hold in neighboring South Africa. There’s a bit of language and the suggestion that the couple has sex on their wedding night. But it’s also an inspiring story of perseverance, loyalty and love. I’d say this is fine for tweens and older.NEW ON DVD&nbsp;Loving (2016)  88%Rating: PG-13, for thematic elements.Ruth Negga deservedly earned an Academy Award nomination for best actress for her elegant, nuanced work in this inspiring drama. She and Joel Edgerton star in writer-director Jeff Nichols’ film, which is based on the true story of Richard and Mildred Loving. They were an interracial couple at a time and place – 1958 Virginia – where such a union was unusual. He was white, she was black, and they had a baby on way. While the two married legally in Washington DC, they found themselves persecuted back home in rural Virginia, where the practice was still against the law. Their fight to keep their family together, which went all the way to the Supreme Court, changed the laws regarding interracial marriage nationwide. Along the way, though, they were forced from their home, jailed and separated. This is a quietly intense movie with some disturbing language and dialogue, as well as a scene of a child getting hit by a car. But it’s beautifully written, shot and acted, making it appropriate – and recommended – for viewers around 12 and older.Trolls (2016)  75%Rating: PG, for some mild rude humor.There’s a Troll that poops cupcakes and another who farts glitter – but even that’s kind of cute. Otherwise, this candy-colored animated musical is totally fine for all ages. The Trolls sing and dance and hug, then sing and dance and hug some more. They’re a clan full of cuddly critters who enjoy expressing their constant happiness through song. If you’re a parent, you may find this incessant cheeriness super annoying. Kids will love it, though, whether or not they’ve ever heard of the high-haired Troll dolls that inspired the movie. Anna Kendrick and Justin Timberlake lead an all-star voice cast in this adventure in which the Trolls try to avoid being captured and devoured by a group of grumpy ogres known as the Bergens. You see, the Bergens believe if they eat a Troll, they won’t be so miserable anymore. It’s basically a parable about the importance of finding the happiness that lies within us all – which is kind of a simplistic message, but not a terrible one for kids to hear. The Trolls are frequently in danger, and while the Bergens are grotesque, they’re never truly frightening.&nbsp;Almost Christmas (2016)  49%Rating: PG-13, for suggestive material, drug content and language.It’s almost Valentine’s Day, but if this Christmas comedy cries out to you instead, it’ll probably be fine for the kids in your house who are around 10 and older. This is your annual wacky, dysfunctional-family holiday movie. Danny Glover, Mo’Nique, Gabrielle Union, Romany Malco, Kimberly Elise, and JB Smoove are among the large ensemble cast, playing members of a family gathering for their first Christmas after the death of their beloved matriarch. Long-held resentments explode and madcap hilarity ensues. Director David E. Talbert’s film is actually better written and acted than most films of this sentimental genre, though. There’s quite a bit of language – most of which comes from the hilariously brash Mo’Nique — and some grown-up situations involving infidelity and drug abuse. But ultimately, its themes of forgiveness and reconciliation are worthwhile.","section":"Parental Guidance","tags":"OneApp, Ellie, The, Pictures, Tarantino","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/10114629/Lego-Batman-PG.jpg","slug":"how-family-friendly-are-the-lego-batman-movie-and-a-united-kingdom"},{"id":"47508904975194","title":"How Family-Friendly is Beauty and the Beast?","content":"Parental Guidancevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})How Family-Friendly is Beauty and the Beast?by Christy Lemire | March 17, 2017 |  CommentsThis week, Disney is releasing a live-action remake of its beloved animated musical&nbsp;Beauty and the Beast — you’ve probably heard about this — and Christy lets us know whether the more realistic trappings make the film too intense for younger viewers who might have been fine with the original. Read on for the details, as well as Christy’s take on a couple of new rentals.NOW IN THEATERS&nbsp;Beauty and the Beast (2017)  71%Rating: PG, for some action, violence, peril, and frightening images.The tale as old as time gets a high-tech, live-action retelling while staying mostly true to the beloved 1991 animated musical. Emma Watson and Dan Stevens star as the titular beauty and the beast. She’s a smart young woman who’s sick of being stuck in her provincial French town; he’s a surly, cursed prince who’s sick of being stuck in his massive castle. Could these two crazy kids possibly find love? Director Bill Condon’s film is visually dazzling, adding luxurious flair to all the big musical numbers you know and love (plus a few new ones that aren’t quite so great). Kids will delight in the household items coming to life and bursting into song – the clock, candelabra, teapot, and cup, for example. But there are also dangers to be found in the woods leading up to the beast’s castle. It’s dark and full of ravenous wolves, which might be scary for very little kids. Belle’s father (Kevin Kline) is in peril several times. The arrogant Gaston (Luke Evans) whips the villagers into a frenzy, leading them in a mob to kill the east. And of course, because this is a Disney movie, there are dead parents. But for the most part, your kids will probably love this, and they’ll leave the theater singing. Fine for kids around 6 and older.NEW ON DVD&nbsp;Passengers (2016)  30%Rating: PG-13, for sexuality, nudity, and action/peril.Critics mostly savaged this sci-fi romance when it came out last year, and I’m not entirely sure why. It works, for a while at least. And it would probably be OK for your kids if they’re around 10 and older. I brought my 7-year-old son with me when it screened, and some of it was probably too grown-up for him. “It was kind of boring,” he said. And there are some long, quiet stretches of loneliness. Chris Pratt and Jennifer Lawrence star as the only two people awake aboard a spaceship headed for a colony on a distant planet. Thousands of other passengers are still in a 120-year state of hibernation. How will they survive? It’s a cool concept with some twists — and some problematic ethics. Director Morten Tyldum’s film is glossy and clever as it depicts life on the ship. It has some amusing elements, mainly courtesy of Michael Sheen as an android bartender. But it turns screechy and silly in the third act when it morphs into an over-the-top sci-fi thriller. There’s some language scattered throughout, as well as the suggestion that Pratt and Lawrence’s characters have sex. We see them lead up to the act, featuring some nudity from behind, as well as the requisite basking in the afterglow. We also see Pratt naked from behind, both in the shower and wandering around the ship. And the two characters find themselves in major peril at the film’s fiery climax.Collateral Beauty (2016)  14%Rating: PG-13, for thematic elements and brief strong language.This was one of the stranger movies to come out last year – and one of the biggest misfires. Still, it’s sort of worth seeing, just to gawk at how spectacularly wrong it all goes. Collateral Beauty may look like a feel-good, life-affirming drama, but it’s actually much more complicated than that. Will Smith stars as a former hotshot ad executive who’s now reeling from a major family tragedy. His business partners – played by Kate Winslet, Edward Norton, and Michael Pena – scheme to make him look crazy so they can sell the agency, which is floundering in his absence. Keira Knightley, Jacob Latimore, and Helen Mirren play the struggling actors who manipulate him by portraying the notions of Love, Time, and Death, respectively. Along the way, all the characters learn to deal with their own problems. What are the odds? Director David Frankel’s film deals with some very mature themes of loss and grief. There’s also quite a bit of language throughout, including the one F-bomb you get with a PG-13 rating. But this film is just so bizarre and hard to follow, your kids will probably be thoroughly confused. Then again, so will you.","section":"Parental Guidance","tags":"Disney, Series, social","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/16175603/Beauty-Beast-PG.jpg","slug":"how-family-friendly-is-beauty-and-the-beast"},{"id":"47508904969047","title":"How Family-Friendly are Going in Style and Smurfs: The Lost Village?","content":"Parental Guidancevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})How Family-Friendly are Going in Style and Smurfs: The Lost Village?by Christy Lemire | April 7, 2017 |  CommentsThis week, Zach Braff’s remake of Going in Style opens side-by-side with the latest&nbsp;Smurfs movie&nbsp;— and clearly, your 6-year-old is going to be more interested in a heist movie starring a trio of octogenarians than an animated feature about friendly Belgian gremlins. With that in mind, Christy Lemire offers a parent’s perspective on both of them, along with a new movie on DVD you should probably avoid, but isn’t terribly offensive for your kids if you happen to have horrible taste in movies and decide to watch it anyway.NOW IN THEATERS&nbsp;Going in Style (2017)  47%Rating: PG-13, for drug content, language and some suggestive material.Director Zach Braff has remade the 1979 comedy of the same name starring George Burns, Art Carney, and Lee Strasberg as elderly, lifelong friends who rob a bank. This time, Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman, and Alan Arkin play elderly, lifelong friends who rob a bank – but instead of doing it for kicks, as was the case in the original, they do it out of revenge. There’s quite a bit of language throughout, as well as gunfire – some real, some blanks. Arkin’s character engages in some hot and heavy frolicking with Ann-Margret’s character, a pretty, flirty grocery store clerk. Part of the scheme involves a medical marijuana dealer, which leads to these old-timers getting high and having the munchies. And of course, at the center of all these antics is a massive, federal crime. Going in Style&nbsp;offers some decent laughs here and there, and the three stars are such pros and have such lovely chemistry with each other, they’re enjoyable to watch – even if the movie itself is forgettable. I’d say this is fine for viewers around 10 or 11 and older.Smurfs: The Lost Village (2017)  40%Rating: PG, for some mild action and rude humor.The Smurfs are back, this time in an all-new animated adventure. Smurfette (voiced by Demi Lovato) wonders what her purpose is in life while every other Smurf’s abilities are clear from their names alone: Brainy, Hefty, Jokey, etc. When she and her friends learn there’s another whole village of Smurfs, they set off to find them – and to warn them that Gargamel (Rainn Wilson) is after them to drain them of their power. This is a vibrant and lively film with a valuable central message about female identity and empowerment. It’s also about strong women supporting each other, as Smurfette finds and connects with a tribe of female Smurfs (voiced by Julia Roberts, Ellie Kemper and Michelle Rodriguez, among others). The humor is mostly light and playful and often extremely slapsticky. Kids will enjoy the cute and clever creatures. Gargamel flies into full-on, villainous rampages a couple of times, accompanied by dramatic music and lighting, which might seem slightly scary for extremely young kids. But mostly he’s a buffoon whose bumbling schemes are played for laughs. This is better than it looks (and the Tomatometer might suggest). If you’re looking for a movie the whole family can watch, this will be fine.NEW ON DVD&nbsp;The Book Of Love (2017)  8%Rating: PG-13, for thematic content, language and drug material.Viewers around 12 or 13 and older will be OK watching this ridiculous and contrived comedy, but surely there must be something better out there for you all to rent. Jason Sudeikis stars as an uptight architect who works through the loss of his pregnant wife (Jessica Biel) in a car accident by befriending an orphaned teen and helping her build a raft to sail across the Atlantic Ocean. Biel appears mostly in flashbacks as a quirky, colorful figure, while Maisie Williams from Game of Thrones is the feisty ragamuffin who helps him grieve, or see the good in the world again, or something. Director and co-writer Bill Purple deals with some heavy themes with his first feature: death and remorse, abuse and abject poverty. We see the crash that kills Biel’s character from a couple different angles; later, we see Williams’ character receiving cruel treatment from the uncle who’s grudgingly agreed to be her guardian. There’s also a lot of language and a couple of scenes in which Sudeikis’ character either smokes or eats marijuana in a stew. Who knew you could do that?","section":"Parental Guidance","tags":"stop, Paramount, universal, romantic, cops, Walt, Academy, Purge, TV, Martial, Hulu, Disney, adaptation","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/07103005/Smurfs-Going-In-Style-PG.jpg","slug":"how-family-friendly-are-going-in-style-and-smurfs-the-lost-village"},{"id":"47508904973145","title":"How Family-Friendly is Power Rangers?","content":"Parental Guidancevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})How Family-Friendly is Power Rangers?by Christy Lemire | March 24, 2017 |  CommentsYou may have fond memories of watching the various Power Rangers shows growing up, but now that they’re on the big screen in a brand new adaptation for modern audiences, the new Power Rangers may not be entirely suitable for kids. Read on for Christy’s take on the new action flick, as well as a couple of rentals.NOW IN THEATERS&nbsp;Saban's Power Rangers (2017)  50%Rating: PG-13, for sequences of sci-fi violence, action and destruction, language, and for some crude humor.Yes, there is yet another incarnation of the Power Rangers saga. This time, it’s a live-action movie, as opposed to the cheesy TV cartoons you may have grown up watching in the early 1990s. It’s essentially a superhero version of The Breakfast Club, with five disparate high school students finding colorful crystal coins in an abandoned mine that give them unexpected powers. But they also find themselves in the middle of a battle for the planet that’s millions of years old. In the process, the fictional small town of Angel Grove gets decimated. There’s quite a bit of big, noisy violence here, as well as some more intimate, hand-to-hand combat sequences with monsters that look like a bunch of boulders stacked on top of each other. There’s also language throughout, some suggestive humor off the top involving a cow’s bodily fluids, and a police chase and car crash. And the villain, former Power Ranger Rita Repulsa (a campy Elizabeth Banks), may seem scary to little kids, particularly at the beginning of the film when she looks especially witch-like and hasn’t regained her full power and splendor. That’s the only thing that my 7-year-old son found disturbing: an especially violent scene in an alley at night involving Rita and a hobo who found himself in the wrong place at the wrong time. But it’s brief. This is probably fine for viewers around 9 or 10 and older.NEW ON DVD&nbsp;Assassin's Creed (2016)  18%Rating: PG-13, for intense sequences of violence and action, thematic elements and brief strong language.Kids around 13 and older should be fine watching this, but I wouldn’t show it to anyone much younger. It’s yet another movie based on a video game – and once again, it doesn’t get that transition right, despite heftier production values and a more pedigreed cast than usual. Michael Fassbender stars as Cal, who’s being executed for murder in the present day at the film’s start. But then he wakes up and he finds he’s in a lab where he’ll have to tap into his genetic ability to live someone else’s memories – specifically, those of his ancestor, who was part of a secret society known as the Assassins. His mission: Travel back to Spain 500 years ago. His goal: Find the elusive Apple of Eden, an artifact that has something to do with controlling free will. Or something. Marion Cotillard, Jeremy Irons, Brendan Gleeson, and Charlotte Rampling co-star. Why any of these esteemed actors said yes to this is truly mind-boggling. The film from Justin Kurzel, who also directed Fassbender in 2015’s Macbeth, has a similarly gritty, gloomy aesthetic – and it’s just relentlessly violent. As I often say, it’s right there on the edge of what you can get away with in a PG-13 movie. Assassin’s Creed&nbsp;features copious killings and stabbings as well as a ton of brutal, hand-to-hand combat. It is very bloody. There’s also a frightening sci-fi element as Cal mentally goes back in time. Younger viewers will find the plot super baffling; then again, so will most adults.Sing (2016)  72%Rating: PG, for some rude humor and mild peril.Viewers of all ages will enjoy the latest animated comedy from Illumination Entertainment, the folks behind the Despicable Me&nbsp;movies and The Secret Life of Pets. And as in Illumination’s previous movies, there’s nothing even slightly scary or inappropriate here. Once again, an array of colorful creatures enjoys adventures in the big city. Matthew McConaughey provides the voice of a koala who owns a historic theater that’s in danger of closing. He gets the idea to stage a singing competition to drum up interest – think of it as Animal Idol – with performers including a harried, housewife pig (Reese Witherspoon), a reluctant criminal gorilla (Taron Egerton), a crooning mouse (Seth MacFarlane) and a punk-rock porcupine (Scarlett Johansson). The animals find themselves in danger, briefly, when a glass case filled with water (and squid) explodes, flooding the dilapidated theater and causing it to crumble. And the gorilla is part of a bank-robbing gang, but we never see the actual crimes. Mostly, Sing&nbsp;is about being true to yourself and finding your voice – literally. And ultimately, it’s about teaming up with a diverse group of folks for a good cause.","section":"Parental Guidance","tags":"cinemax, 78th, Central, 2015, casting, Classic, Sundance, Funimation, dark, WarnerMedia","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/24113552/Power-Rangers-PG1.jpg","slug":"how-family-friendly-is-power-rangers"},{"id":"47508904966997","title":"How Family-Friendly Is Born in China?","content":"Parental Guidancevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})How Family-Friendly Is Born in China?by Christy Lemire | April 21, 2017 |  CommentsWe’ve already talked about The Lost City of Z, which opened in limited release this week, and the only big movie this week clearly intended for children is the latest Earth Day documentary from Disneynature. It’s completely suitable for all audiences, but if you’re concerned about anything, you can check for Christy’s reaction below.NOW IN THEATERS&nbsp;Disneynature: Born In China (2017)  85%Rating:&nbsp;GEvery year around Earth Day, Disneynature releases a documentary about animals in the wilderness: African Cats, Bears, Monkey Kingdom, etc. This year’s offering focuses on several animal species throughout China as they’re born, grow up within their families, and learn to survive. John Krasinski narrates the adventures of a baby panda, a golden monkey, and a mother snow leopard protecting her cubs. It’s shot spectacularly, as is always the case with these films. We see beautifully intimate images of these families in their remote, natural habitats, as well as breathtaking views of varied terrain across the nation. More than ever in the series, though, Born in China&nbsp;seems geared specifically toward young children. The baby animals all get cute names and funny backstories, and Krasinski punctuates their antics with playful asides. There’s very little danger or violence here. Threatening predators pop up and quickly disappear, and there are a couple instances of animals fighting each other, but they’re brief. I’d say this is suitable for the whole family.NEW ON DVD&nbsp;The Founder (2017)  81%Rating: PG-13, for brief strong language.Your kids may enjoy eating at McDonald’s, and they may see the poster for this movie with its familiar golden arches and think it looks like something they’d want to sink their teeth into. It’s not. The Founder&nbsp;is the story of Ray Kroc (a charismatic Michael Keaton), long credited as the founder of the McDonald’s global fast-food empire. But director John Lee Hancock’s film details the ways in which Kroc wrangled the business away from brothers Mac and Dick McDonald (John Carroll Lynch and Nick Offerman), who originally launched the chain from a tiny Southern California burger stand. There’s quite a bit of language and arguing throughout the film, as well as an extramarital affair. The subject matter will probably seem boring to young viewers, but pre-teens might connect with the energy of the movie and its tale of ingenuity. If you’re interested in watching this at home, and you have kids around 11 or 12 and older who are watching it, too, they’ll probably be fine.&nbsp;","section":"Parental Guidance","tags":"DC, history, comic, space, italian, Grammys, Awards, spider-man, Television, parents","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/21132607/Born-in-China-PG.jpg","slug":"how-family-friendly-is-born-in-china"},{"id":"47508904977244","title":"Don’t Be Fooled – Logan Isn’t for Kids","content":"Parental Guidancevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Don't Be Fooled - Logan Isn't for Kidsby Christy Lemire | March 3, 2017 |  CommentsKids who may be familiar with the mostly innocuous X-Men movies up to this point may tug on your sleeve to take them to see&nbsp;Logan. Unfortunately for them, it might just be more than they can handle.&nbsp;Read on for details on Hugh Jackman’s last outing as Wolverine, as well as a YA novel adaptation and a faith-based weepie.NOW IN THEATERS&nbsp;Logan (2017)  93%Rating: R, for strong brutal violence and language throughout, and for brief nudity.Your kids probably really want to see Logan, and who can blame them? It looks awesome, and it is awesome. But it’s also awesomely violent. They really luxuriate in their R-rating here, allowing Hugh Jackman’s title character to make the most of the damage he can do with those Adamantium claws. You would not believe the wide variety of body parts they can pierce in the blink of an eye. This is Jackman’s final outing as the iconic X-Men character, and while director James Mangold’s film is tinged with a gritty melancholy, it’s also repeatedly, explosively thrilling. An ailing Logan wants to leave the drama of his life as Wolverine behind, but he gets dragged back into action when he’s asked to care for a little girl (Dafne Keen) with whom he’s got a surprising amount in common. Young viewers may ask if they can see this, especially if they’re comic book fans or if they’ve seen previous X-Men&nbsp;movies. Say: “No.” This takes the blood and gore to a whole new level. Teenagers can handle this, but it’s not appropriate for anyone younger.Before I Fall (2017)  64%Rating: PG-13, for mature thematic content involving drinking, sexuality, bullying, some violent images, and language — all involving teens.It’s Groundhog Day meets Heathers&nbsp;in this angsty but well-acted high school drama. Zoey Deutch stars as a popular high school senior who wakes up the morning after a raging party to find she’s living the previous day all over again. Then it happens the next morning, and the next. And it keeps happening, over and over, regardless of the slight tweaks she makes to jar herself loose from this time loop. In the process, she learns to see her mean-girl friends more clearly and treasure what’s truly important in life. Director Ry Russo-Young’s film features a ton of language and frank talk about sex. Teens also get super drunk at the party Deutch’s character and her friends attend, and they bully an awkward girl who shows up uninvited. And there’s a major car accident that serves as an important plot point, which we see again and again from various perspectives. Probably fine for viewers around 13 and older.The Shack (2017)  21%Rating: PG-13, for thematic material including some violence.This weepy religious film is based on a New York Times best seller about a father (Sam Worthington) who goes on a spiritual journey following the tragic loss of his young daughter (Amelie Eve). The little girl is kidnapped and killed during a family camping trip, leaving him bereft and faithless and eroding his relationships with his wife (Radha Mitchell) and two other kids (Megan Charpentier and Gage Munroe). Then one day, a mysterious note in his mailbox leads him back to the scene of the crime – and to an idyllic shack in the woods where he meets God (Octavia Spencer), Jesus (Aviv Alush) and the Holy Spirit (Sumire Matsubara). Thematically alone, this is too much for young viewers to handle. We see visions of the young girl being carried away, and we witness the father’s pain and remorse. There’s also a scene in which another kid nearly drowns and requires CPR. It’s pretty grown-up stuff. And at over two hours, the running time alone will make this a tough sit for kids. I’d say it’s appropriate for viewers around 11 or 12 and older.NEW ON DVD&nbsp;Doctor Strange (2016)  89%Rating: PG-13, for sci-fi violence and action throughout, and an intense crash sequence.Kids around 8 or 10 and older will love this movie, especially if they’re familiar with the Marvel franchise – but they don’t have to be to have a good time. The latest installment in the Marvel Cinematic Universe centers on Dr. Stephen Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch), a once-brilliant surgeon who suffers a serious car accident and reinvents himself through mysticism and magic. Under the tutelage of the powerful Ancient One (Tilda Swinton), Doctor Strange becomes a warrior in a battle between good and evil that takes place across various dimensions. It’s as trippy as it sounds, with some seriously psychedelic imagery. But Doctor Strange also features the sort of pummeling hand-to-hand combat, weapons play, and urban destruction you’ve come to expect in these effects-laden comic-book blockbusters. The crash that injures Doctor Strange is pretty gnarly. There’s some language but also a cheeky sense of humor throughout. And the ultimate, evil force Strange must face might look too frightening for younger viewers. It’s intense but also a lot of fun.","section":"Parental Guidance","tags":"See, Awards, drama, Crackle, Larson, A&E, deadpool, series, independent, Teen, Women's","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/03113743/Logan-PG.jpg","slug":"dont-be-fooled-logan-isnt-for-kids"},{"id":"47508906097509","title":"How Family-Friendly are Assassin’s Creed, Passengers, Sing, and A Monster Calls?","content":"Parental Guidancevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})How Family-Friendly are Assassin's Creed, Passengers, Sing, and A Monster Calls?by Christy Lemire | December 22, 2016 |  CommentsThis week, we get another animated film aimed squarely at the kid demographic, but there are also a couple of other big movies — including one based on a popular video game series and one starring Chris Pratt and Jennifer Lawrence — that might interest younger viewers. Read on to see how closely they skirt the edge of that R rating.NEW IN THEATERS&nbsp;Assassin's Creed (2016)  18%Rating: PG-13, for intense sequences of violence and action, thematic elements and brief strong language.Hey, guess what? There’s another movie based on a video game – and this one doesn’t get that transition right, either, despite heftier production values and a more pedigreed cast than its predecessors.

There’s also a frightening sci-fi element as Cal mentally goes back in time. Younger viewers will find the plot super baffling; then again, so will most adults. I’ve never played the game so I have no idea whether this movie is an accurate reflection of what it’s about. Simply as a movie, though, I’d say it’s really only appropriate for viewers 13 and older.Passengers (2016)  30%Rating: PG-13, for sexuality, nudity and action/peril.Chris Pratt and Jennifer Lawrence star as the only two people awake aboard a spaceship headed for a colony on a distant planet. Thousands of other passengers are still in a 120-year state of hibernation. How will they survive? It’s a cool concept with some twists — and some problematic ethics. Director Morten Tyldum’s film is glossy and clever as it depicts life on the ship. It has some amusing elements, mainly courtesy of Michael Sheen as an android bartender. But it turns screechy and silly in the third act when it evolves into an over-the-top sci-fi thriller. There’s some language scattered throughout, as well as the suggestion that Pratt and Lawrence’s characters have sex. We see them lead-up to the act, featuring some nudity from behind, as well as the requisite basking in the afterglow. We also see Pratt naked from behind, both in the shower and wandering around the ship. And the two characters find themselves in major peril at the film’s fiery climax. I brought my son, who’s 7, with me; in retrospect, some of it was too grown-up for him. As for his thoughts on the movie: “It was kind of boring,” he said. And it’s true, there are some long, quiet stretches of loneliness. I’d say this is fine for viewers around 10 and older.Sing (2016)  72%Rating: PG, for some rude humor and mild peril.The latest animated comedy from Illumination Entertainment, the people behind the Despicable Me&nbsp;movies and The Secret Life of Pets, once again finds colorful creatures enjoying adventures in the big city. Matthew McConaughey provides the voice of a koala who owns a historic theater that’s in danger of going under. He gets the idea to stage a singing competition to drum up interest – think of it as Animal Idol&nbsp;– with performers including a harried, housewife pig (Reese Witherspoon), a reluctant criminal gorilla (Taron Egerton), a crooning mouse (Seth MacFarlane) and a punk-rock porcupine (Scarlett Johansson).

And ultimately, it’s about teaming up with a diverse array of folks for a cause. A fun choice for the whole family over the holiday weekend.A Monster Calls (2017)  86%Rating: PG-13, for thematic content and some scary images.Bring tissues. Spanish director J.A. Bayona’s imaginative fantasy film is daringly beautiful and achingly sad. Felicity Jones stars as the divorced mom of a lonely, 12-year-old son (Lewis MacDougall). She’s dying of cancer, and the boy channels his fear through his wild drawings of fantastical creatures. One night, the tree behind his house uproots itself and comes to life, with Liam Neeson richly providing the voice of this monster. The stories he tells the boy are wondrous, with an inspired mix of animation styles. And the tree itself is vividly detailed and tactile – but he’ll also be quite scary for very young viewers. He means well and he can be cheeky, but he’s also intimidating. And A Monster Calls deals quite plainly with the prospect of a parent’s death. The mom’s illness reaches such a severe state that she has to be hospitalized, forcing the boy to live with his stern grandmother (Sigourney Weaver). But the movie also is about forgiveness and growing up, as well as the healing power of creativity. Probably fine for viewers around 8 and older. Adults will be a mess regardless of age.NEW ON DVD&nbsp;Storks (2016)  65%Rating:&nbsp;PG, for mild action and some thematic elements.The whole family can enjoy this animated comedy, although watching it together could lead to some awkward conversations about where babies come from. That had to happen at some point, though, right? The idea is that storks don’t deliver babies anymore; now, they deliver packages for an Amazon-like behemoth called Cornerstore.com. But when the baby-making section of the factory accidentally starts up again, it’s up to a stork named Junior (voiced by Andy Samberg) and a clumsy human named Tulip (Katie Crown) to deliver the infant before their blowhard of a boss (Kelsey Grammer) finds out she exists. Storks&nbsp;is zippy and zany but it also has some unexpected heart. Much of that comes from the relationship between the lonely boy who wished for a little brother, which started this whole madcap sequence of events, and the parents (Ty Burrell and Jennifer Aniston) who are too busy with their real-estate business to spend time with him. Kids will love the colorful aesthetic and the fast-paced energy. There are also a couple of running bits that are truly absurd and insane, which they’ll probably find extremely entertaining.Sully (2016)  85%Rating:&nbsp;PG-13, for some peril and brief, strong language.Viewers around 9 or 10 and older should be fine watching the latest from Clint Eastwood, based on the true story of the Miracle on the Hudson. Tom Hanks stars as Capt. Chesley “Sully” Sullenberger, the veteran pilot who famously landed a US Airways plane in the middle of the Hudson River when both engines cut out after takeoff, saving all 155 people on board. Eastwood’s direction is lean and efficient and he creates a surprising amount of tension given that he’s telling a recent story with an ending we all know. The emergency landing itself is as stressful as you’d expect, with people on board sobbing and saying goodbye to each other and their loved ones as they fear they’re about to die. Once the plane lands safely, several passengers are in danger of drowning in the frigid river. There’s also some language scattered throughout. But the movie itself is brisk and well made, and a worthwhile story of heroism, teamwork and perseverance.The Magnificent Seven (2016)  64%Rating:&nbsp;PG-13, for extended and intense sequences of Western violence, and for historical smoking, some language and suggestive material.Kids around 13 and older should be fine watching this remake of the 1960 John Sturges Western The Magnificent Seven&nbsp;– itself a remake of the 1954 Akira Kurosawa classic Seven Samurai– although I’d show them either of those original films first. Once again, a ragtag band of men comes together to protect a small town from invading bad guys. The setting this time is Northern California, and the main villain is a robber baron (Peter Sarsgaard) searching for gold. Denzel Washington, Chris Pratt, Ethan Hawke, and Byung-hun Lee play some of the tough guys and gunslingers who’ve signed on to stop him and his men. Director Antoine Fuqua’s film has a modern quality in its multicultural cast, but it mostly stays true to Western conventions. Expect prolonged scenes of intense violence, with shootouts, stabbings and battles on horseback. The carnage comes early and often, including an opening sequence in which Sarsgaard’s character coldly kills several townspeople to assert his dominance. There’s a bit of language and a ton of smoking.","section":"Parental Guidance","tags":"your, Hulu, sitcom, Warner, Holiday, comic, Superheroe, Reviews, Peek, nightmare, Access, adaptation, Christmas, of","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/22114243/Assassins-Creed-PG.jpg","slug":"how-family-friendly-are-assassins-creed-passengers-sing-and-a-monster-calls"},{"id":"47508907590510","title":"10 Family-Friendly Movies to Watch for Halloween","content":"Parental Guidancevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})10 Family-Friendly Movies to Watch for HalloweenSome spooky Samhain selections to share with your spawn.by Christy Lemire | October 26, 2016 |  CommentsHalloween is coming. Perhaps you were aware of that. What better way to celebrate the holiday than with some family-friendly horror movies? Take a break from stressing out over costumes and shopping for candy with any of these great choices. Or you could just watch all eight Harry Potter movies, in order, all over again. Enjoy!&nbsp;Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein (1948)  89%My husband and I took our son, Nicolas, to see this at the New Beverly Cinema, the Los Angeles repertory theater Quentin Tarantino owns, when he was a little over 6 years old. He laughed the whole way through – and he especially enjoyed the Invisible Man, voiced by Vincent Price. Abbott and Costello’s classic brand of slapstick comedy is perfect for kids, and the clever integration of Universal’s iconic movie monsters into their zany world will amuse grown-ups, as well.Watch Trailer&nbsp;|&nbsp;Available on: Amazon, FandangoNOW&nbsp;Beetlejuice (1988)  85%This entire list could consist of nothing but Tim Burton movies, in theory – at least, his earlier ones. But I’m limiting myself to just a handful, and this one’s a must. Beetlejuice finds Burton in his sweet spot with a mix that’s weird and whimsical, giddy and ghoulish. The macabre details, the off-kilter humor, the Danny Elfman score: They all blend brilliantly to create one of Burton’s absolute best works. And Michael Keaton is in peak form as the title character: a fast-talking, flatulent spirit who’s been hired to scare a family of yuppies out of their new house.Watch Trailer&nbsp;|&nbsp;Available on: Amazon, FandangoNOW&nbsp;The Blob (1958)  68%This is just straight-up silly – a pure, unabashed B-movie with a ridiculous premise and cheesy special effects. If your kids are savvy moviegoers (like mine is), and they’ve grown up enjoying blockbusters with the highest of high-tech computer-generated visuals, they’ll be struck by how cheap and simplistic The Blob&nbsp;looks by comparison. But that’s what makes it such a blast to watch. A meteor crashes to Earth and emits a reddish, gooey ooze that starts sucking the life out of people, increasing in size with each new victim. Pandemonium ensues. It’s a hoot. And it gave Steve McQueen his first starring role.Watch Trailer&nbsp;|&nbsp;Available on: Amazon&nbsp;Tim Burton's Corpse Bride (2005)  84%We’re back with Burton again, this time in stop-motion animation mode. The Nightmare Before Christmas (1993) is also a great — and popular — Halloween choice along these lines, but I’ve got a soft spot for the melancholy sweetness of this one. With an all-star voice cast led by Burton regulars Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter, the film follows the romantic troubles of a shy young man torn between the woman his parents have arranged for him to marry and the woman who rises from the Land of the Dead and accidentally becomes his wife. It’s as gorgeous as it is poignant.Watch Trailer&nbsp;|&nbsp;Available on: Amazon, FandangoNOW, Netflix&nbsp;E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial (1982)  98%This may not seem like the most traditional pick. But if you’ll recall, a crucial scene in E.T.&nbsp;takes place on Halloween night: when the boys smuggle their alien friend out of the house by pretending he’s Gertie, dressed as a ghost for trick-or-treating. As always, Steven Spielberg works wonders with perspective here, as an awestruck E.T. surveys the landscape of ghouls and goblins and struggles to make sense of it all. And come on – this is one of Spielberg’s greatest films ever. Any excuse to watch it will do.Watch Trailer&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;Available on: Amazon, FandangoNOW, Netflix&nbsp;Frankenweenie (2012)  87%Tim Burton reminds us of why we love Tim Burton with this feature-length version of the 1984 short that revealed early glimmers of the veteran director’s darkly humorous style. The story of a little boy who brings his beloved, deceased dog back to life felt like the purest expression of Burton’s ethos that we’d seen in a while. His love of classic monster movies is infectious. And it’s just gorgeous in crisp black and white. I recently showed this to my son and I cried all over again, and he made fun of me for crying, so a good Friday night was had by all.Watch Trailer&nbsp;|&nbsp;Available on: Amazon, FandangoNOW&nbsp;Ghostbusters (1984 Original) (1984)  97%You could watch either version – the original or this summer’s remake with a cast of stellar comediennes. But I’d steer you and (more importantly) your kids toward this one first, for cultural perspective, if nothing else. You know what it’s about: It’s Ghostbusters. A group of scientists try to explain and eliminate a paranormal invasion that’s terrorized New York City. A comedy classic starring Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, Harold Ramis and Ernie Hudson, but one with some genuine scares and thrills, too.Watch Trailer&nbsp;|&nbsp;Available on: Amazon, FandangoNOW&nbsp;Goosebumps (2015)  78%A really fun big-screen version of the R.L. Stine Goosebumps&nbsp;books, starring Jack Black as the real-life author. If your kids love the books, they’ll have a blast watching this – but even if they’re not familiar with the series (as my son wasn’t when he saw the movie), they’re still in for some thrills. A teenager moves to a new town and finds his next-door neighbor is the creepy and reclusive Stine. Soon afterward, the monsters trapped inside Stine’s bound books spring to life and wreak havoc. Some of the images here may be a bit too scary for very young kids, but the tone is mostly playful.Watch Trailer&nbsp;|&nbsp;Available on: Amazon, FandangoNOW, Netflix&nbsp;It's the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown (1966)  94%THE Halloween classic, of course. You’ve probably seen it a million times and can recite Linus’ Great Pumpkin speech right along with him. But if it’s been a while, or if your kids have never seen it, this is a great one to watch together – regardless of their age. Charlie Brown’s trick-or-treating lament – “I got a rock” – never gets old. And Linus’ unshakable faith that the Great Pumpkin not only exists but also will rise up and bring presents to all the good boys and girls has a charming innocence.Watch Trailer&nbsp;|&nbsp;Available on: Amazon, FandangoNOW&nbsp;Wallace &amp; Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit (2005)  95%Another dazzling example of stop-motion animation – in the same year, as Corpse Bride, no less – from the geniuses at Aardman. Mild-mannered Wallace and his trusty dog, Gromit, come to the rescue when a mutant rabbit attacks a village right before its annual vegetable competition. Winner of the Academy Award for best animated feature, Curse of the Were-Rabbit is irresistibly sweet and slyly subversive. A great choice for viewers of all ages and an excellent entry into the Wallace &amp; Gromit world.Watch Trailer | Available on: Amazon, FandangoNOW","section":"Parental Guidance","tags":"BBC, versus, movies, Fox, HBO, book, Polls, movie, Reviews, Studios, Classic, jurassic, GIFs, Oscars, Prime","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/26144503/Family-Friendly-Halloween.jpg","slug":"10-family-friendly-movies-to-watch-for-halloween"},{"id":"47508906094435","title":"How Family-Friendly are Monster Trucks and The Book of Love?","content":"Parental Guidancevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})How Family-Friendly are Monster Trucks and The Book of Love?by Christy Lemire | January 13, 2017 |  CommentsThere are a couple of choices available to you in theaters if you plan on a family movie night, including a kid-friendly monster fantasy and an inspirational tale of grief, and Christy lets us know what to expect from them. Read on for details.NOW IN THEATERS&nbsp;Monster Trucks (2017)  32%Rating: PG, for action, peril, brief scary images and some rude humor.It’s a truck… fueled by a monster! Hence the name. And if you have very young kids who are into either of these things, they may have a decent time watching this family-friendly action comedy. Your mileage may vary – after all, it’s January. Lucas Till stars as a teenager living in small-town North Dakota who discovers a friendly, oil-guzzling monster. While a scientist studies the creature’s two other buddies in a lab, Till’s character, Tripp, protects his new pal (whom he names Creech) and even lets him power his truck. But bad guys are on their way – and they have guns. Grown-ups might find the adventures, which include car chases and crashes, rather lame and flimsy. And there’s a bit of chaste romance between Tripp and a young woman (Jane Levy) with a knack for science. But somewhere in here is a message about fighting greedy oil executives, protecting animals and treasuring the environment. And of course: teamwork. Fine for kids around 6 or 7 and older.The Book Of Love (2017)  8%Rating: PG-13, for thematic content, language and drug material.An uptight architect works through the loss of his pregnant wife in a car accident by befriending an orphaned teen and helping her build a raft to sail across the Atlantic Ocean. Yes, this movie is as ridiculous and contrived as it sounds. Jason Sudeikis stars, with Jessica Biel playing his quirky, colorful wife mostly in flashbacks. Maisie Williams from Game of Thrones&nbsp;is the feisty ragamuffin who helps him grieve, or see the good in the world once more, or something. Director and co-writer Bill Purple deals with some heavy themes with his first feature: death and remorse, abuse and abject poverty. We see the crash that kills Biel’s character from a couple different angles; later, we see Williams’ character receiving cruel treatment from the uncle who’s grudgingly agreed to be her guardian. There’s also a lot of language and a couple of scenes in which Sudeikis’ character either smokes or eats marijuana in a stew. (Who knew you could do that?) I’d say this would be OK for viewers around 12 or 13 and older, but surely there are better offerings available on VOD.NEW ON DVD&nbsp;Max Steel (2016)  0%Rating: PG-13, for some sci-fi action violence.Kids around 9 or 10 years old are probably fine watching this sci-fi action comedy, but I’d find something else for them to do. Anything else. Based on the Max Steel games and toys by Mattel, this is theoretically aimed at tweens and teens, but it’s borderline incomprehensible regardless of your age. Max McGrath (Ben Winchell) moves back to his father’s hometown with his widowed mother (Maria Bello). There, he begins to piece together the details of the accident that killed his scientist father. But Max finds strange things are happening to him, too – like, he can shoot strings of liquid, blue-tinted energy from his fingertips and make objects explode. Thankfully, a cheeky, drone-like alien named Steel (voiced by Josh Brener) arrives to explain his newfound powers and show him what the two can achieve when they join forces. When they do, they become a superhero known as… wait for it… Max Steel, complete with head-to-toe body armor, super strength and flying abilities. He’s Iron Teen. But if only it were that simple. Max is in constant peril, with armed bad guys trying to capture him and harness his energy. There’s also a giant, evil, tornado-like creature with a mean face and glowing red eyes that might be an alien. But even without those nuisances, Max is frequently in pain as energy surges through his body, giving him terrible headaches and making him panic. There are also several intense flashbacks that gradually reveal what really happened to his dad.Deepwater Horizon (2016)  83%Rating: PG-13, for prolonged intense disaster sequences and related disturbing images, and brief strong language.It’s intense, but viewers around 10 and older should be fine watching this action drama inspired by real events. Director Peter Berg’s film is about the April 2010 explosion on&nbsp;the Deepwater Horizon oil rig, which left 11 men dead and dumped 4.9 million barrels of oil into the Gulf of Mexico. We get to know the crew members (Mark Wahlberg, Gina Rodriguez, and Kurt Russell lead the ensemble cast) and see the arduous, complicated work they do. Then Berg steadily builds suspense leading up to the volatile disaster itself. This is a riveting, well-made, and strongly acted film, but it’s also really tense and difficult to watch for much of the time. Men get pummeled with oil and thrown across rooms by the sheer force of the blasts. Several of them leap from the rig into the fiery water, hoping to survive, but others plummet to their deaths. One character gets hit with shattered glass all over his face and body; another suffers a severe leg injury. And at the end, the credits reveal the names and photographs of the victims, which is stirring. There’s also quite a bit of language: These are blue-collar guys who are boisterously joking with each other and, later, reacting to a disastrous situation. But it’s a worthwhile story in terms of educating young people about the environmental impact of this massive spill, and it has important themes of courage and teamwork.","section":"Parental Guidance","tags":"Amazon, Logo, new, 71st, YouTube, Emmys, cancelled, lee, TV, latino, Reviews, drama, 4/20, nbcuniversal, high","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/13144422/Monster-Trucks-PG.jpg","slug":"how-family-friendly-are-monster-trucks-and-the-book-of-love"},{"id":"47508906099558","title":"How Family-Friendly are Rogue One: A Star Wars Story and Collateral Beauty?","content":"Parental Guidancevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})How Family-Friendly are Rogue One: A Star Wars Story and Collateral Beauty?by Christy Lemire | December 16, 2016 |  CommentsThe much-anticipated Star Wars standalone film, Rogue One, is out this week, but it’s rated PG-13 and it’s a little darker than its predecessors. Christy lets us know whether or not there’s anything unsuitable for the youngest&nbsp;Star Wars fans. Also, she gives us the lowdown on the Will Smith tearkerker&nbsp;Collateral Beauty and a handful of DVD releases. Read on for details.NEW IN THEATERS&nbsp;Rogue One: A Star Wars Story (2016)  84%Rating: PG-13, for extended sequences of sci-fi violence and action.There’s a new Star Wars movie! There’s a new Star Wars&nbsp;movie! Your kids are probably pumped about this, so you should know what’s in it – and know that it’s darker than you might expect. Rogue One, which takes place between Episodes III and IV in the series, follows the mission to steal the plans for the Death Star, which – as we know – the rebels blow up in the original Star Wars. Felicity Jones stars as Jyn Erso, daughter of an Empire scientist who strikes out on her own and joins the Rebellion. She’s a strong and brave young woman, in the tradition of Leia and Rey. But she also sees many horrors along the way. (Possible spoilers ahead!) Director Gareth Edwards’ film isn’t afraid to kill characters we’ve come to care about, and the film vividly shows what happens when the Death Star trains its lasers on planets for a series of test runs. And some characters have no qualms about coldly killing each other, which we see. I brought my Star Wars-obsessed son, who’s now 7, with me to a screening and he wasn’t afraid of anything here. He loved it. But Rogue One&nbsp;is a serious war picture much of the time, with massive battle sequences, which could make it too intense for the youngest viewers in your family.Collateral Beauty (2016)  14%Rating: PG-13, for thematic elements and brief strong language.This may look like a feel-good, life-affirming holiday movie. It’s actually very strange and I’m going to have a hard time describing it, but here goes. Will Smith stars as a former hotshot ad executive who’s now reeling from a major family tragedy. His business partners – played by Kate Winslet, Edward Norton, and Michael Pena – scheme to make him look crazy so they can sell the agency, which is floundering in his absence. Keira Knightley, Jacob Latimore, and Helen Mirren play the struggling actors who manipulate him by portraying the notions of Love, Time, and Death, respectively. Along the way, all the characters learn to deal with their own problems. What are the odds? Director David Frankel’s film deals with some very mature themes of loss and grief. There’s also quite a bit of language throughout, including the one F-bomb you get with a PG-13 rating. Plus, this film is just so bizarre and hard to follow, your kids will probably be thoroughly confused (as will you).NEW ON DVD&nbsp;Suicide Squad (2016)  26%Rating:&nbsp;PG-13, for sequences of violence and action throughout, disturbing behavior, suggestive content and language.Don’t let the candy-colored marketing scheme fool you: This is really only OK for viewers around 12 or 13 and older. Suicide Squad&nbsp;is right there on the edge of what you can include in an action movie without earning an R rating. This latest comic book blockbuster extravaganza based on DC Comics characters is just relentlessly violent. It’s about a group of incarcerated super villains who are offered reduced sentences if they’ll help the federal government take down even worse bad guys than they are. They include the expert marksman Deadshot (Will Smith), the crazy-sexy Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie) and Diablo (Jay Hernandez), who blasts fire from his fingertips. It’s extremely dark thematically in terms of who these characters are, what they’ve done and what they can do. There’s relentless gunfire, as well as stabbings, brutal fistfights, zombie invasions, and witch sorcery from the powerful Enchantress (Cara Delevingne). It’s also quite difficult to follow much of the time — both in terms of the story and the visuals — with so many characters and so much of the action taking place at night. And of course there is The Joker (Jared Leto), for whom wreaking havoc is his raison d’etre.Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children (2016)  64%Rating:&nbsp;PG-13, for intense sequences of fantasy action/violence and peril.Kids around 9 or 10 and older are probably fine watching the latest flight of fancy from director Tim Burton. It follows the adventures of a teenager named Jake (Asa Butterfield) who travels back in time to visit an orphanage full of kids with magical abilities. The material would seem tailor-made for Burton’s tastes. The “peculiars,” as they’re known, can set fire to things just by touching them, or float away, or spit bees from their mouths, to list just a few. But there are some deeply frightening images here, too, including the sight of dead people whose eyes have been plucked from their skulls, leaving them with dark, haunting holes. The murderous villains, meanwhile, have eyes that shine an eerie, bright white. We also see the repeated sight of Nazi planes dropping bombs on the orphanage during World War II. There’s some fun to be had here, too, as well as some moments of beauty and wonder. But the story, based on the Young Adult novel by Ransom Riggs, features a densely packed mythology that’s often hard to follow. My son — who wasn’t quite 7 when he saw this and never gets scared in movies – found the sight of the hollow-eyed people frightening. And, like me, he often thought the convoluted plot was confusing.Ben-Hur (2016)  25%Rating:&nbsp;PG-13, for sequences of violence and disturbing images.Viewers around 12 or 13 should be fine watching this high-tech telling of the classic, biblical-era tale. It’s about half as long as the 1959 Charlton Heston version, but it’s crammed with violent action sequences. Judah Ben-Hur (Jack Huston), a prince of Judea, is wrongly imprisoned and sentenced to slavery when his adopted brother, Messala (Toby Kebbell), a Roman officer on the rise, accuses him of treason. Ben-Hur must find a way back to rescue his mother and sister, get revenge and restore his name. Along the way, he spends years being whipped as a galley slave and there’s a ton of graphic swordplay. Men all around him drown, get pierced with arrows, and are set on fire. Of course, Ben-Hur must compete against Messala in a climactic chariot race in which riders get tossed in the air and trampled by horses. And he keeps running into Jesus Christ (Rodrigo Santoro), including during the crucifixion, which (as you can imagine), is traumatic and bloody. But you also may find that Ben-Hur is worthwhile as a story of redemption, spirituality and forgiveness.Southside With You (2016)  92%Rating:&nbsp;PG-13, for brief strong language, smoking, a violent image and a drug reference.President Obama’s administration is coming to a close in a few weeks, but you can revisit his early days with the first lady in this walking-and-talking romance. It recreates the first date between Barack and Michelle Obama, back when they were in their mid-20s with dreams of changing the world. Parker Sawyers plays the future president when he was still just a charismatic law student, with Tika Sumpter co-starring as the future first lady, his superior at the Chicago law firm where he worked during the summer of 1989. The two spend the day together on the city’s South side – hence the title – visiting an art exhibit, attending a community meeting, seeing a movie (Spike Lee’s Do the Right Thing) and finally sharing a climactic ice cream cone. There’s a bit of language. The young Obama smokes cigarettes pretty much non-stop and jokes about smoking too much pot in college. We also see a snippet of the riot scene in Lee’s classic film as the couple is watching it in a theater. But this is really lovely, intimate and beautifully acted. I’d say it’s fine for viewers around age 10 and older, especially if they’re interested in history or politics.","section":"Parental Guidance","tags":"Sony, Games, Pictures, e.","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/16122533/Rogue-One-PG.jpg","slug":"how-family-friendly-are-rogue-one-a-star-wars-story-and-collateral-beauty"},{"id":"47508906103656","title":"Family-Friendly Choices on DVD This Week: The BFG and Pete’s Dragon","content":"Parental Guidancevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Family-Friendly Choices on DVD This Week: The BFG and Pete's Dragonby Christy Lemire | December 2, 2016 |  CommentsAll of the most prominent new releases this week are either rated R or they weren’t screened for critics, so instead, Christy dips into the DVD releases to make a couple of recommendations for family movie night.&nbsp;Read on for details.NEW ON DVD&nbsp;The BFG (2016)  74%Rating: PG, for action/peril, some scary moments and brief rude humor.Kids of all ages should be fine watching Steven Spielberg’s adaptation of the Roald Dahl novel. It’s visually dazzling, with seamless special effects that blend computer-generated giants with real-life actors. Mark Rylance stars as the title character – the Big Friendly Giant – who teams up with a spirited, 10-year-old orphan named Sophie (Ruby Barnhill). Together, they try to stop other giants from eating people with the help of the Queen of England (Penelope Wilton) and the British military. Sophie is in near-constant danger of being smushed, stomped on or outright devoured by the hulking inhabitants of Giant Country. And while the BFG himself is gentle and kind, the other giants – who are much larger than he is – are grotesque and menacing, and might seem scary for the youngest viewers. Also, The BFG’s job is to capture dreams (and sometimes nightmares) to place in Londoners’ heads while they’re sleeping, so some of that imagery might be a bit creepy for little kids. And there’s a running gag involving flatulence that builds to an amusingly explosive climax.Pete's Dragon (2016)  88%Rating:&nbsp;PG, for action, peril and brief language.Viewers around 6 and older will delight in this family film, which is sort of a remake of the 1977 movie of the same name in that it’s about a boy named Pete who has a dragon. Orphaned at a very young age, Pete (Oakes Fegley) has been raised in the forest by his only friend: a furry, green dragon he named Elliot. When a forest ranger (Bryce Dallas Howard) discovers him at age 11 and brings him home, he struggles to adjust to civilization, all the while trying to protect his magical friend from loggers who want to capture him for their own glory. Director David Lowery has created a film set in in the 1970s that feels as if it was made then, too. He’s unrushed in his pacing and uses wordless sequences efficiently to tell his story. And the relationship between Pete and Elliot is lovely – full of frolic and joy as well as quiet, intimate moments. But as I mentioned at the start, Pete is an orphan in the classic Disney tradition; in the film’s first few minutes, we see him lose his parents in a car accident that he survives, then wander alone in the woods until he meets Elliot. The sense of loneliness and loss is powerful here and might be too much for very young viewers. Also, a group of loggers take down the dragon using tranquilizer guns and chain him to a flatbed truck, which could be disturbing.","section":"Parental Guidance","tags":"news, NYCC, criterion, festival, blaxploitation, james, halloween, lord, thriller, international, book","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/02120425/BFG-PG.jpg","slug":"family-friendly-choices-on-dvd-this-week-the-bfg-and-petes-dragon"},{"id":"47508906110828","title":"How Family-Friendly Are Doctor Strange, Trolls, and Loving?","content":"Parental Guidancevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})How Family-Friendly Are Doctor Strange, Trolls, and Loving?by Christy Lemire | November 4, 2016 |  CommentsIt’s pretty clear that the new animated film Trolls is meant for kids, but there are a couple of PG-13 offerings this week — including the latest Marvel blockbuster and an important historical drama — that might be worth looking into. Christy lets us know what to look out for.NEW IN THEATERS&nbsp;Doctor Strange (2016)  89%Rating: PG-13, for sci-fi violence and action throughout, and an intense crash sequence.The latest installment in the Marvel Cinematic Universe centers on a character your kids may not have heard of prior to the release of this film: Doctor Stephen Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch), a once-brilliant surgeon who suffers a serious car accident and reinvents himself through mysticism and magic. Under the tutelage of the powerful Ancient One (Tilda Swinton), Doctor Strange becomes a warrior in a battle between good and evil that takes place across various dimensions. It’s as trippy as it sounds, with some seriously psychedelic imagery. But Doctor Strange&nbsp;also features the sort of pummeling hand-to-hand combat, weapons play and urban destruction you’ve come to expect in these effects-laden Marvel blockbusters. The crash that injures Doctor Strange is pretty gnarly. There’s some language but also a cheeky sense of humor throughout. And the ultimate, evil force Strange must face might look too frightening for younger viewers. It’s intense but also a lot of fun. I’d say this is OK for kids around 8-10 and older – especially if they’re familiar with the Marvel franchise.Trolls (2016)  75%Rating: PG, for some mild rude humor.They sing and dance and hug and sing and dance and hug. They’re a candy-colored clan full of cuddly critters who enjoy expressing their constant happiness through song. What’s not to like? Well, if you’re a parent, you may find this incessant cheeriness super annoying. Kids will love it, though, whether or not they’ve ever heard of the high-haired Troll dolls that inspired the movie. Anna Kendrick and Justin Timberlake lead an all-star voice cast in this animated, musical adventure in which the Trolls try to avoid being captured and devoured by a group of grumpy ogres known as the Bergens. You see, the Bergens believe if they eat a Troll, they won’t be so miserable anymore. It’s basically a parable about the importance of finding the happiness that lies within us all – which is kind of a simplistic message, but not a terrible one for kids to hear. The Trolls are frequently in danger, and while the Bergens are grotesque, they’re never truly frightening. The only vaguely inappropriate thing here is a Troll that poops cupcakes and another who farts glitter – but even that’s kinda cute. Fine for all ages.Loving (2016)  88%Rating: PG-13, for thematic elements.This is a serious, grown-up movie, but its subject matter is important and inspiring, which makes it worthwhile for the older kids in your house. Joel Edgerton and Ruth Negga star in writer-director Jeff Nichols’ drama based on the true story of Richard and Mildred Loving. They were an interracial couple at a time and place – 1958 Virginia – where such a union was unusual. He was white, she was black, and they had a baby on way. While the two married legally in Washington DC, they found themselves persecuted back home in rural Virginia, where the practice was still against the law. Their fight to keep their family together, which went all the way to the Supreme Court, changed the laws regarding interracial marriage nationwide. Along the way, though, they were forced from their home, jailed and separated. This is a quietly intense movie with some disturbing language and dialogue, as well as a scene of a child getting hit by a car. But it’s beautifully written, shot and acted, making it appropriate – and recommended – for viewers around 12 and older.NEW ON DVD&nbsp;Star Trek Beyond (2016)  86%Rating: PG-13, for sequences of sci-fi action and violence.Kids around 8 and older will be fine watching the latest installment in the rebooted Star Trek universe. Justin Lin takes over directing duties from J.J. Abrams this time, as Kirk (Chris Pine), Spock (Zachary Quinto), Bones (Karl Urban), and the rest of the crew of the USS Enterprise go on a mission through a dangerous nebula to rescue a stranded ship. What they find instead is a massive attack by a villain (Idris Elba) who needs a crucial artifact on board the Enterprise to enact his dastardly, interplanetary plan. This movie is a blast, filled with thrilling special-effects set pieces: chases through the skies and on land, gravity-defying stunts, and a race against the clock. Elba’s character, Krall, may seem a bit scary for younger viewers with his menacing mask. And the siege he mounts on the Enterprise is incredibly tense. Characters are temporarily separated from each other and frequently are in peril; one suffers a major, bloody injury that requires serious medical attention. There are legitimate stakes, but compared to a lot of blockbusters from this past summer which got bogged down in self-serious mythology, this one’s just breezy, zippy fun.The Ivory Game (2016)  77%Rating:&nbsp;N/AAvailable on Netflix, this is a disturbing but urgent documentary about the multibillion-dollar ivory trafficking industry. Directors Richard Ladkani and Kief Davidson and their crew went undercover for 16 months to investigate the poaching of African elephants and the smuggling of their tusks to China, where ivory sales are legal but shady, black-market dealings still exist. Although it’s a non-fiction film, The Ivory Game plays with the gripping pacing and glossy production values of an international thriller. There’s a great deal of imagery that’s difficult to watch, no matter how old you are, including the sight of slain carcasses and fellow elephant loved ones surrounding them silently to mourn their loss. The statistics alone are staggering: An African elephant is killed every 15 minutes, and at that rate they could be extinct altogether in the next 15 years. It’s a tough, tense watch. But young people should see this film to learn about a crisis that may seem far away and inaccessible. Fine for viewers around 10 and older.","section":"Parental Guidance","tags":"monster","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/04121609/Trolls-PG.jpg","slug":"how-family-friendly-are-doctor-strange-trolls-and-loving"},{"id":"47508907605878","title":"How Family-Friendly Is The Light Between Oceans?","content":"Parental Guidancevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})How Family-Friendly Is The Light Between Oceans?by Christy Lemire | September 2, 2016 |  CommentsThe big movie this week is a weepie with a handful of awards-caliber stars, but it’s a melodrama with some heavy themes.&nbsp;Read on to see if it might all be a bit much for your little ones.NEW IN THEATERS&nbsp;The Light Between Oceans (2016)  61%Rating: PG-13, for thematic material and some sexual content.If you’re in the mood for a heavy-duty, emotionally cathartic romantic drama, The Light Between Oceans is for you. Derek Cianfrance’s adaptation of the M.L. Stedman novel follows the tumultuous relationship between a stoic lighthouse keeper (Michael Fassbender) and his vivacious, young wife (Alicia Vikander) living on a remote island off the coast of Western Australia just after World War I. While they are initially happy, their attempts at starting a family end in two miscarriages. But when an infant washes ashore in a small boat after a storm – along with her deceased father – the couple believes they’ve received one last shot at happiness. Clearly, it can’t be that easy, though. The Light Between Oceans&nbsp;deals with the mature themes of birth and death, guilt and truth. Vikander’s character is understandably devastated by her loss both physically and psychologically, but she’s also the one to pressure her husband into lying and pretending the baby is theirs. There are a couple of brief sex scenes, although they feature barely any nudity. And toward the end, the baby – now a 5-year-old girl – goes missing and appears to be in danger. But this is a beautifully shot, strongly acted film that’s probably suitable for viewers around 13 and older.NEW ON DVD&nbsp;The Jungle Book (2016)  94%Rating: PG, for some sequences of scary action and peril.Kids around 6 and older will be just fine watching Jon Favreau’s live-action take on The Jungle Book. In fact, they’ll love it – it’s a visual wonder. If you saw it during its theatrical run, you know this was a rare example of a film that really is worth the extra cost for 3-D: The images are lush, vivid and immersive. But the movie as a whole is also just a lot of fun, with thrilling action sequences, delightful musical numbers and lively performances from a strong cast. You know the story: It’s Rudyard Kipling’s The Jungle Book. Man-cub Mowgli (played by excellent newcomer Neel Sethi) struggles to find his place in the world amid a variety of animals — wolves, panthers, bears, tigers, snakes — as he grows into a young man. The excellent voice cast includes Ben Kingsley, Bill Murray, Lupita Nyong’o, Scarlett Johansson, and Idris Elba. But much of the action could be too intense for young viewers, such as the brutal brawls between the panther who protects him and the tiger who’s trying to kill him. Wildfires devastate much of the jungle. Mowgli is pretty much in constant peril. And there is a significant character death. I took my son (who was then 6 ½) to a screening, and while he didn’t find anything frightening, kids who are sensitive to that kind of intense danger might.Me Before You (2016)  54%Rating: PG-13, for thematic elements and some suggestive material.Emilia Clarke is the ultimate manic pixie dream girl in this sweet but soapy adaptation of Jojo Moyes’ novel. She stars as a young woman in a small, British town who accepts a job as the caretaker for a formerly high-flying, risk-taking rich boy (Sam Claflin) who’s now paralyzed and in a wheelchair after being hit by a motorcycle. With her brightly colored tights, wacky vintage dresses and generally sunny demeanor, she naturally wears down this miserable man’s defenses. But even though the two share plenty of adventures (and eventually a romance – not exactly a spoiler), he still doesn’t feel life is worth living in this manner. Me Before You deals directly with the heavy, complicated subject of assisted suicide. It also features some drinking, plenty of language and the suggestion of sex. I’d say this is fine for viewers around 11 and older.","section":"Parental Guidance","tags":"78th, sag, Star, CMT, motion, actors, jurassic, chucky, Thanksgiving","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/02122949/Light-Between-Oceans-PG.jpg","slug":"how-family-friendly-is-the-light-between-oceans"},{"id":"47508909031292","title":"How Family-Friendly are Star Trek Beyond and Ice Age: Collision Course?","content":"Parental Guidancevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})How Family-Friendly are Star Trek Beyond and Ice Age: Collision Course?by Christy Lemire | July 22, 2016 |  CommentsThe latest installment of the Ice Age franchise is quite obviously aimed at kids — even if it is rated PG — but is there anything to worry about in the latest chapter of the Star Trek saga? Christy Lemire has seen them both, and she lets us know what to look out for.NEW IN THEATERS&nbsp;Star Trek Beyond (2016)  86%Rating: PG-13, for sequences of sci-fi action and violence.Justin Lin takes over the directing duties from J.J. Abrams in this latest installment of the rebooted Star Trek&nbsp;universe.

Characters are temporarily separated from each other and frequently are in peril; one suffers a major, bloody injury that requires serious medical attention. Yes, there are legitimate stakes, but compared to a lot of recent summer blockbusters which get bogged down in self-serious mythology, this one’s just breezy, zippy fun. Fine for kids around age 8 and older.Ice Age: Collision Course (2016)  18%Rating: PG, for mild rude humor and some action/peril.What is this now, like, the fourth Ice Age movie? The fifth? It’s hard to keep track. Anyway, this time, Scrat ends up inside an alien spaceship, where he inadvertently sends a fiery asteroid hurtling toward Earth in his eternal pursuit of an acorn. All the prehistoric creatures down below must scurry about, seeking safety and working together to avoid obliteration. Yes, the characters (voiced by Ray Romano, Queen Latifah, Denis Leary, Jennifer Lopez, Keke Palmer, Adam Devine and – the rare highlight – Simon Pegg) are in constant danger, but the threat seems far away and cartoonish. There’s a scene in which a bunch of animals luxuriate in a hot tub and flirt with each other. And there is exactly one poop joke. This movie is harmless. It’s also not very good. But the jokes and action are suitable for the whole family, and your kids will probably think Scrat is cute. So if it’s really hot outside this weekend and you’re desperate to get indoors in the air conditioning, this’ll do.NEW ON DVD&nbsp;Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice (2016)  29%Rating: PG-13, for intense sequences of violence and action throughout, and some sensuality.Mature tweens and older will probably be fine watching director Zack Snyder’s follow-up to his 2013 film Man of Steel. This time, Superman (Henry Cavill) battles Batman (Ben Affleck) basically for the amusement of crazed industrialist Lex Luthor (Jesse Eisenberg). Mass urban destruction ensues. Theoretically, there’s more to it than that, and it involves Batman’s fear that Superman is dangerous after the climactic events of the previous movie. But really, any semblance of plot is just a thin excuse to set up a pantheon of films based on DC Comics, similar to the Marvel Cinematic Universe that’s firmly in place. All your usual action-movie elements are here: brutal fistfights, perilous car chases, enormous explosions and deadly gunfire. As in so many other Batman films, BvS&nbsp;replays the moment when young Bruce Wayne watches his parents get shot to death during a robbery outside a movie theater. Plus — without spoiling anything — a new monster arrives on the scene who’s seemingly indestructible. There’s also a disturbing dream sequence. It’s all very noisy and numbing, but it’s CGI-inflated comic-book violence.","section":"Parental Guidance","tags":"Awards, Bowl","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/22122136/Star-Trek-Beyond-PG.jpg","slug":"how-family-friendly-are-star-trek-beyond-and-ice-age-collision-course"},{"id":"47508907614075","title":"How Family-Friendly are Jason Bourne and Nerve?","content":"Parental Guidancevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})How Family-Friendly are Jason Bourne and Nerve?by Christy Lemire | July 29, 2016 |  CommentsTwo of this week’s movies — the latest in the Bourne franchise and a thriller for the social media age — are rated PG-13, but how closely do they toe the line of an R rating? Christy lets us know whether either film might be a bit much for younger audiences and covers a couple of choice selections on DVD. Read on for details.NEW IN THEATERS&nbsp;Jason Bourne (2016)  54%Rating: PG-13, for intense sequences of violence and action, and brief strong language.I’m actually amazed this got a PG-13 rating. With its violence, rioting, brutal hand-to-hand combat, shootings and killings, it’s just right there on the edge of what you can show in a movie without earning an R. But if you’ve seen the three previous Bourne films, you know what you’re in for; Jason Bourne&nbsp;covers a lot of the same ground. Once again, Matt Damon returns as the title character. At the film’s start, the former assassin is living underground and continuing to put together the pieces of his past and fill in the blanks in his memory. Along the way, he must take out the various shadowy dark-ops guys who are trying to kill him, as well as a highly trained sniper (Vincent Cassel) who has a personal grudge against him. One early sequence takes place during a protest in Athens that quickly escalates into chaos. Bourne also causes a ton of damage on his own through a couple of incredibly tense chases, one of which involves an armored SWAT truck on the crowded Las Vegas strip. There’s also some profanity. I’d say this is OK for kids around 13 and older.Nerve (2016)  66%Rating: PG-13, for thematic material involving dangerous and risky behavior, some sexual content, language, drug content, drinking and nudity – all involving teens.Emma Roberts and Dave Franco co-star in this action thriller about teens playing a dangerous online game of dare. They and many others across the country have signed onto an app called Nerve, in which you can either watch or take part in an increasingly risky series of challenges for money. If you pull out, the consequences are dire. The pranks are harmless at first – embarrassing stuff in public – but become more demanding and possibly deadly depending on what the watchers want the players to do. It doesn’t seem terribly implausible; in this age of Pokémon Go, walking around with your phone and interacting with strangers in wild ways kinda makes sense. But the film grows tense and violent with stunts involving motorcycles, trains, fire, skyscrapers and guns. The lead characters end up in their underwear at a luxury department store and they kiss several times. One bad-girl cheerleader flashes her naked rear end during a football game. And there’s quite a bit of teen partying. Your tweens and young teens will probably want to see it, and that might be OK – provided you explain to them that they should NOT try any of this at home.NEW ON DVD&nbsp;Barbershop: The Next Cut (2016)  90%Rating: PG-13, for sexual material and language.Young teens and older should be fine watching the latest Barbershop&nbsp;movie. It’s been 12 years since the last one, but much of the old gang is back alongside some new characters. Ice Cube, Cedric the Entertainer, Eve, Common, Nicki Minaj, Regina Hall, Anthony Anderson and J.B. Smoove joke around, talk politics and pop culture, and generally create the warm, community vibe we’ve come to know at Calvin’s Barbershop on Chicago’s south side. But director Malcolm D. Lee’s film very much takes place in the real world in which we’ve lived in recent years, and it addresses head-on not only the devastating gang violence that has plagued Chicago but also the racial tensions and shootings that have taken place across the country. Calvin’s son is considering joining a gang and another character dies off-screen in a gang-related shooting. There’s quite a bit of language and sexual humor — some of which is innuendo, some of which is graphic in nature. But the movie is also worthwhile because it balances humor and heart with social and political relevance.Sing Street (2016)  95%Rating: PG-13, for hematic elements including strong language and some bullying behavior, a suggestive image, drug material and teen smoking.This is a great choice for the tweens and teens in your house, especially if they have musical aspirations of their own. The third film from Irish writer-director John Carney has a lot in common with his first two, Once and Begin Again. They all explore the power of music to transform and connect us and to give us an outlet to express our every emotion — but that doesn’t make Carney’s latest any less charming. Set in Dublin in the mid-1980s, Sing Street&nbsp;has some autobiographical underpinnings. It focuses on a 15-year-old fledgling musician (an appealing Ferdia Walsh-Peelo) who forms a band with some other outsiders at his rough public high school in hopes of impressing the beautiful older girl (Lucy Boynton) who lives across the street. There’s a ton of bullying and abuse that goes on here, both from fellow students and the priest who runs the place. There’s also quite a bit of language, arguing, and frank talk about divorce. And pretty much everyone smokes constantly. But the film as a whole is a complete joy to watch, with an infectious energy and an incredible soundtrack of both classic ‘80s songs (Duran Duran, The Cure, The Jam, Hall &amp; Oates) and original tunes.","section":"Parental Guidance","tags":"Warner, Comic, media, Plus, festivals, cults, best, book, mockumentary, Netflix, Exclusive","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/29144712/Jason-Bourne-PG.jpg","slug":"how-family-friendly-are-jason-bourne-and-nerve"},{"id":"47508907603829","title":"How Family-Friendly Are Sully and Ithaca?","content":"Parental Guidancevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})How Family-Friendly Are Sully and Ithaca?by Christy Lemire | September 9, 2016 |  CommentsThe big movie this week is Clint Eastwood’s retelling of the “Miracle on the Hudson,” starring Tom Hanks, but we’ve also got the directorial debut of one-time frequent Hanks co-star Meg Ryan. Read on to see if these two PG-13 films are too intense for the kids.NEW IN THEATERS&nbsp;Sully (2016)  85%Rating: PG-13, for some peril and brief strong language.Tom Hanks stars as Capt. Chesley “Sully” Sullenberger, the veteran pilot who famously landed a US Airways plane in the middle of the Hudson River when both engines cut out after takeoff, saving all 155 people on board. Clint Eastwood’s direction is lean and efficient, and he creates a surprising amount of tension given that he’s telling a recent story with an ending we all know. The emergency landing itself is as stressful as you’d expect, with people on board sobbing and saying goodbye to each other and their loved ones as they fear they’re about to die. Once the plane lands safely, several passengers are in danger of drowning in the frigid river. There’s also some language scattered throughout. But the movie itself is brisk and well made, and a worthwhile story of heroism, teamwork and perseverance. Fine for viewers around 9 or 10 and older.Ithaca (2016)  22%Rating: PG, for thematic elements, a war image and smoking.Meg Ryan makes her feature-directing debut with this exceedingly earnest but tonally awkward adaptation of William Saroyan’s The Human Comedy. She also has a supporting role as a widow trying to hold her family together during World War II. Alex Neustaedter stars as her teenage son, Homer, who takes a job as a bike messenger to support the family while his older brother (Jack Quaid) is off fighting in the war. There’s some heavy thematic stuff here: Homer frequently has to deliver telegraphs informing mothers that their sons have died. There’s also a bit of language and a lot of smoking. (It was the ‘40s, after all.) And Sam Shepard has a supporting part as Homer’s frequently inebriated co-worker at the telegraph office. It means well. It’s just a mess.NEW ON DVD&nbsp;The Meddler (2016)  85%Rating: PG-13, for brief drug content.Tweens and older are fine seeing this feel-good comedy. Your enjoyment of it, however, will depend greatly on how you feel about its main character. Susan Sarandon stars as Marnie, a widow who moves from New Jersey to Los Angeles to be near her daughter (Rose Byrne), who’s a television writer. Marnie calls and texts her daughter incessantly and shows up at her house unannounced, but she also insinuates herself in the lives of people she barely knows. She’s well-intentioned, but she’s also extremely needy and clingy. There’s some language here and some grown-up talk about death and grief during therapy sessions. There’s also one scene in which Marnie eats a bag full of marijuana to hide it from a security guard and goes on a hallucinatory trip while wandering around an outdoor mall.","section":"Parental Guidance","tags":"Turner, who, trailers, theme, Prime, thriller, Character, Pride, 2020, CBS, Geographic, Cartoon, Disney, &","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/09135102/Sully-PG.jpg","slug":"how-family-friendly-are-sully-and-ithaca"},{"id":"47508907601780","title":"Captain America: Civil War is Out on DVD, but Can Your Kids Watch It?","content":"Parental Guidancevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Captain America: Civil War is Out on DVD, but Can Your Kids Watch It?by Christy Lemire | September 16, 2016 |  CommentsAll of the big films this week are rated R, but a very popular blockbuster arrived on DVD this week. Christy Lemire offers up a rundown of the film’s themes and content to help determine if it’s suitable for your kids.NEW ON DVD&nbsp;Captain America: Civil War (2016)  90%Rating: PG-13, for extended sequences of violence, action and mayhem.Kids around 8-10 and older probably will be fine watching this massive cog in the Marvel Cinematic Universe machinery, which will end up being one of the biggest box-office hits of the year. This time, Captain America (Chris Evans) and Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) square off over how much autonomy the Avengers should have when so much collateral damage lies in the wake of their good deeds. Their superhero buddies take sides depending on whom they agree with philosophically, with some old friends from previous Marvel movies joining in the mix. Like 2014’s Captain America: The Winter Soldier, Civil War&nbsp;comes from the brother directing team of Anthony and Joe Russo. And like that previous film (and every other Marvel movie), there’s a ton of violence and destruction. But the film also addresses that head-on in a smartly self-referential way. Explosions and extended sequences of hand-to-hand combat abound, as well as the disturbing sight of the Winter Soldier (Sebastian Stan) being activated as a killing machine with specific, sequential code words. This is about on par with all the other Marvel movies in terms of whether it’s appropriate for your kids. If they’ve seen other ones, they should be OK here. I brought my Marvel-savvy, 6-1/2-year-old son to a screening of Civil War&nbsp;this past summer and nothing frightened or disturbed him. And despite the movie’s serious themes, much of the dialogue is knowing and playful as the Avengers poke fun at themselves, each other and pop culture in general.","section":"Parental Guidance","tags":"Fresh, Year, Anna, CBS, talk","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/16114515/Captain-America-Civil-War-PG.jpg","slug":"captain-america-civil-war-is-out-on-dvd-but-can-your-kids-watch-it"},{"id":"47508909033341","title":"How Family-Friendly is Ghostbusters?","content":"Parental Guidancevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})How Family-Friendly is Ghostbusters?by Christy Lemire | July 15, 2016 |  CommentsThe new Ghostbusters is an all-out comedy, but if you’re thinking about taking the kids to see it, you should know whether or not some of the ghosts might still be a little too freaky for the littlest ones. Read on to see what Christy thought about it, as well as a couple of new DVD releases.NEW IN THEATERS&nbsp;Ghostbusters (2016)  74%Rating: PG-13, for supernatural action and some crude humor.This remake of the 1984 comedy-action classic finds four women busting ghosts in New York City rather than men. Comedians Melissa McCarthy, Kristen Wiig, Kate McKinnon and Leslie Jones star as paranormal investigators who run around town with their makeshift, high-tech gear, wrestling and capturing an ever-increasing number of ghouls who’ve invaded. It’s mostly played for laughs, but younger viewers might be frightened at first by the appearance of the ghosts, which are more detailed than they were 30 years ago. An early scene in particular finds a long-dead woman floating over our heroes menacingly with her wild eyes and sharp teeth – only to shoot projectile green slime all over Wiig’s character. That’s the way a lot of the bits go: They initially may seem scary but they’re ultimately played for laughs. There’s a bit of language here and there in addition to the complicated scientific jargon, which may confuse younger viewers. But the underlying theme of strong, smart women who stick by each other no matter what is more than worthwhile for both girls and boys to see. I brought my son (who’s almost 7) with me to the new Ghostbusters, and while he felt briefly frightened during the opening sequence in a haunted mansion, he quickly laughed when things turned silly. This is probably fine for viewers around 8 or 9 and older.NEW ON DVD&nbsp;The Divergent Series: Allegiant (2016)  11%Rating: PG-13, for intense violence and action, thematic elements, and some partial nudity.Viewers around 13 and older should be fine watching this second-to-last movie in the Divergent&nbsp;franchise – especially if they’ve seen the previous two. And yes, there’s still one more coming; as usual, the last book in Veronica Roth’s trilogy is being split into two movies. This time, Tris (Shailene Woodley), Four (Theo James) and their rag-tag band of buddies dare to climb the wall surrounding Chicago to investigate the outside world. As in all of these movies (and post-apocalyptic Young Adult fare in general), there’s a ton of violence, much of it involving gunfire and hand-to-hand combat. But toward the end, there’s also the climactic threat that an orange gas being pumped through the ventilation system will cause massive memory loss. Adults are universally nefarious figures. Several young people are shot to death, children are hunted down and snatched from their parents for scientific experiments, and one little boy watches as his father is fatally shot in front of him. There’s also a bit of nudity during a shower scene.Miracles from Heaven (2016)  45%Rating: PG, for thematic material, including accident and medical issues.Kids around 7 and up will probably be fine watching this real-life drama. It’s based on the story of Texas mom Christy Beam (Jennifer Garner), whose 10-year-old daughter, Annabel (Kylie Rogers), suddenly suffered from a rare and potentially fatal intestinal disorder – and, just as suddenly, was cured. A 30-foot fall through the hollowed-out trunk of a cottonwood tree miraculously healed Annabel. But while she was trapped on the ground, she says she had an out-of-body experience in which she went to heaven and God told her she’d be fine. Hence the title. Miracles From Heaven&nbsp;contains many stressful moments as Christy and Annabel travel back and forth to Boston for treatment, which doesn’t seem to be working.

Read on to find out.NEW IN THEATERS&nbsp;Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children (2016)  64%Rating: PG-13, for intense sequences of fantasy action/violence and peril.A teenager named Jake (Asa Butterfield) travels back in time to visit an orphanage full of kids with magical abilities in the latest fantasy adventure from director Tim Burton. The material would seem tailor-made for Burton’s tastes. The “peculiars,” as they’re known, can set fire to things just by touching them, or float away, or spit bees from their mouths, to list just a few. But there are some deeply frightening images here, too, including the sight of dead people whose eyes have been plucked from their skulls, leaving them with dark, haunting holes. The murderous villains, meanwhile, have eyes that shine an eerie, bright white. We also see the repeated sight of Nazi planes dropping bombs on the orphanage during World War II. There’s some fun to be had here, too, as well as some moments of beauty and wonder. But the story, based on the Young Adult novel by Ransom Riggs, features a densely packed mythology that’s often hard to follow. My son — who’s almost 7 and never gets scared in movies – found the sight of the hollow-eyed people frightening. And, like me, he often thought the convoluted plot was confusing. But if your kids are interested in seeing Miss Peregrine’s, I’d say it’s OK for viewers around 9 or 10 and older.Deepwater Horizon (2016)  83%Rating: PG-13, for prolonged intense disaster sequences and related disturbing images, and brief strong language.The April 2010 explosion on&nbsp;the Deepwater Horizon oil rig, which left 11 men dead and dumped 4.9 million barrels of oil into the Gulf of Mexico, is the subject of this intense drama. Director Peter Berg lets us get to know the crew members (Mark Wahlberg, Gina Rodriguez, and Kurt Russell lead the ensemble cast) and provides a glimpse into the arduous, complicated work they do. Then he steadily builds tension leading up to the volatile disaster itself. This is a riveting, well-made, and strongly acted film, but it’s also really tense and difficult to watch for much of the time. Men get pummeled with oil and thrown across rooms by the sheer force of the blasts. Several of them leap from the rig into the fiery water, hoping to survive, but others plummet to their deaths. One character gets hit with shattered glass all over his face and body; another suffers a severe leg injury. And at the end, the credits reveal the names and photographs of the victims, which is stirring. There’s also quite a bit of language: These are blue-collar guys who are boisterously joking with each other and, later, reacting to a disastrous situation. But it’s a worthwhile story in terms of educating young people about the environmental impact of this massive spill, and it has important themes of courage and teamwork. Fine for viewers around 10 and older.Queen of Katwe (2016)  94%Rating: PG, for thematic elements, an accident scene and some suggestive material.This feel-good true story, which opened in limited release last week and goes wider this week, is a beautifully acted and inspiring tale of a girl from the slums of Uganda who becomes an unlikely chess champion. The lovely Madina Nalwanga stars as 10-year-old Phiona, who sells corn in the streets to help her family survive. But she’s quick-witted and inquisitive, and she becomes curious when she sees a missionary (David Oyelowo) teaching chess to the local youth. He, in turn, recognizes her smarts and instincts for the game – as well as her fighting spirit – and agrees to coach her. But Phiona’s hardworking and protective mother (Lupita Nyong’o) is apprehensive about letting her compete on an international scale. Director Mira Nair creates a vivid sense of place, both in the daily hardships these kids endure and the small joys they savor. There’s also a subplot involving the questionable choices Phiona’s older sister makes to ensure her own survival. But for the most part, this is a worthwhile, emotionally powerful film for kids to see with lessons about dedication and hope.NEW ON DVD&nbsp;Warcraft (2016)  28%Rating: PG-13, for extended sequences of intense fantasy violence.Kids around age 10 or 11 and older would probably be fine watching this feature-film version of the Warcraft&nbsp;video game – but should they? It’s a giant, noisy, computer-generated extravaganza crammed with massive battles between hulking orcs and sword-wielding knights. If that’s what you’re into, awesome. But if you’ve never played the game before, you’re likely to be confused (as I was), because it’s often difficult to tell who’s doing what to whom. The violence is pummeling and relentless, full of fighting, shooting and stabbing, but it’s also rather fake looking and cartoonish. Having said that, the orcs’ appearance alone may be rather startling to some younger viewers. There’s also quite a bit of magic at play here as warlocks use their powers for good and evil. My son was 6 ½ when I took him with me to a screening of this and he didn’t find anything frightening; actually, he was rather bored and squirming the whole time.The Shallows (2016)  78%Rating: PG-13, for bloody images, intense sequences of peril, and brief strong language.Viewers around 12 or 13 and older will be fine with this lean, mean thriller in which Blake Lively battles a hungry shark. Who will win?! Lively stars as a young woman who goes surfing alone at a secluded Mexican beach. Ignoring warnings to return to shore before it gets too dark, she stays for one last wave and becomes the target of a particularly persistent great white. It’s pretty gnarly, I must say – in all the best possible ways. Lively’s character suffers a serious bite on the leg and stitches up the bloody limb in clever, makeshift fashion. The few other people who exist in this remote setting don’t fare nearly so well. She’s in constant peril but she’s also smart, resourceful and skilled as she runs through her options for survival. And she gets the one well-chosen F-bomb you’re allowed in a PG-13 movie. This is an intense, frightening, well-made and surprisingly fun little flick.","section":"Parental Guidance","tags":"child's, Pictures, breaking","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/30140705/Deepwater-Horizon-PG.jpg","slug":"how-family-friendly-are-miss-peregrines-home-for-peculiar-children-deepwater-horizon-and-queen-of-katwe"},{"id":"47508909038464","title":"How Family-Friendly are Independence Day: Resurgence and The Shallows?","content":"Parental Guidancevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})How Family-Friendly are Independence Day: Resurgence and The Shallows?by Christy Lemire | June 24, 2016 |  CommentsThis week, Christy lets us know whether or not the big sci-fi blockbuster or the smaller — but possibly more thrilling — shark attack movie might be too intense for younger viewers. Then she also revisits a couple of movies now available on DVD, in case you choose to stay home with the little ones. Read on for details.NEW IN THEATERS&nbsp;Independence Day: Resurgence (2016)  30%Rating: PG-13, for sequences of sci-fi action and destruction and for some language.The aliens are back, and this time they want… more of the same thing they wanted before, maybe? Not that it matters, because this sequel to the 1996 smash-hit blockbuster Independence Day is all about the spectacle. And it is big, shiny and noisy in the over-the-top tradition of Roland Emmerich, but without the kind of visceral thrills you usually get with the director’s outlandish action extravaganzas. Twenty years after the original film’s alien battle, humans have learned to use their technology for everything from space exploration to getting across town more efficiently. But just as America is about to celebrate the anniversary of that victory, the aliens return — in a spaceship that’s 3,000 miles wide, no less — to lock onto our planet and drill into its core for resources. Or something. Anyway, Jeff Goldblum, Bill Pullman, Judd Hirsch and Brent Spiner are back — Will Smith opted out, wisely — fighting alongside newcomers Liam Neeson, Maika Monroe, Jessie T. Usher, William Fichtner, and (in the strangest bit of casting of all) Charlotte Gainsbourg. There’s massive urban destruction, ostensibly resulting in massive death, little of which we actually see. The aliens are big, gooey and relentless in typical alien fashion. Children are in peril — a school bus full of them, for good measure. There’s a bit of language. And there are lots of battles in which human and alien ships shoot green lasers at each other that go “Pew! Pew! Pew!” I brought my 6 ½-year-old son with me (because he’d seen the original Independence Day&nbsp;and was actually curious to know what could possibly happen next) and he was never scared, but he also slept through about half of it. Lucky him. As for your kids, they’ll probably be OK if they’re around 10 and older.The Shallows (2016)  78%Rating: PG-13, for bloody images, intense sequences of peril, and brief strong language.It’s Blake Lively vs. Shark: Who will win?! That’s the premise of this lean, mean genre picture. Lively stars as a young woman who goes surfing alone at a secluded beach in Mexico. Ignoring warnings to come out of the water before it gets too dark, she stays for one last wave and becomes the target of a particularly insistent great white shark. It’s pretty gnarly, I gotta say – in all the best ways. Lively’s character suffers a serious bite on the leg and stitches up the bloody limb in clever, makeshift fashion. The few other people who exist in this remote setting don’t fare nearly so well. She’s in constant peril but she’s also incredibly resourceful as she runs through her options for survival. And she gets the one well-chosen F-bomb you’re allowed in a PG-13 movie. This is an intense, frightening, well-made, and surprisingly fun little movie. Kids around 12 or 13 and older will be fine watching it.NEW ON DVD&nbsp;My Big Fat Greek Wedding 2 (2016)  27%Rating: PG-13, for some suggestive material.Viewers around 9 or 10 will probably be fine watching this sequel to the 2002 surprise hit My Big Fat Greek Wedding, although I’m not sure why they’d want to do that. The wacky Portokalos family is back in all its overbearing, obnoxious glory. And yes, there is indeed another big, fat, Greek wedding. This time, Toula (writer and star Nia Vardalos) must help orchestrate the event when it turns out that her parents (Michael Constantine and Lainie Kazan) never were married officially 50 years ago in Greece because the priest didn’t sign the certificate. Madcap hilarity (and lots of Windex spritzing) ensue. The only possibly offensive part of this movie is the thoroughly inappropriate sex talk from Toula’s outspoken Aunt Voula (Andrea Martin). She also buys Toula a racy, red negligee to help her spice things up with Ian (John Corbett), the WASPy dude she married in the first film.Midnight Special (2016)  83%Rating: PG-13, for some violence and action.Mature tweens and older will probably be fine watching this sci-fi thriller from indie auteur Jeff Nichols (Take Shelter, Mud), which reunites him with the great Michael Shannon. This time, Shannon plays the father of a young boy (Jaeden Lieberher) whose mysterious powers make him a prophet for some and a target for others. Father and son go on the run with the help of an old friend (Joel Edgerton) as they try to elude both the religious cult to which they’d belonged and federal authorities. There’s great tension throughout as well as some startling special effects, including chunks of a satellite raining down on a gas station. The boy’s eyes beam a bright light at various points, which may be frightening for younger viewers to see, and he’s in constant danger. There’s also a bit of gunfire. But it’s a powerfully written and acted story about a father-son bond, sacrifice, and love.","section":"Parental Guidance","tags":"SDCC, Extras, TV, Company, Holiday, FX, Tomatazos, stoner, Avengers, movies","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/24111828/Shallows-PG.jpg","slug":"how-family-friendly-are-independence-day-resurgence-and-the-shallows"},{"id":"47508909042562","title":"How Family-Friendly is Warcraft?","content":"Parental Guidancevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})How Family-Friendly is Warcraft?by Christy Lemire | June 10, 2016 |  CommentsThe wildly popular video game franchise Warcraft comes to the big screen this weekend, but is it too violent for the little ones?&nbsp;Read on for Christy’s thoughts on that, as well as her assessment of an animated Disney treat on DVD.NEW IN THEATERS&nbsp;Warcraft (2016)  28%Rating: PG-13, for extended sequences of intense fantasy violence.The big-screen version of the Warcraft video game is a giant, noisy, computer-generated extravaganza crammed with massive battles between hulking orcs and sword-wielding knights. If that’s your thing, have at it. But if you’ve never played the game before, you’re likely to be confused (as I was), because it’s often difficult to tell who’s doing what to whom. The violence is pummeling and relentless, full of fighting, shooting and stabbing, but it’s also rather fake-looking and cartoonish. Having said that, the orcs’ appearance alone may be rather startling to some younger viewers. There’s also quite a bit of magic at play here as warlocks use their powers for good and evil. I brought my movie-savvy, 6 ½-year-old son with me to the screening and he didn’t find anything frightening; actually, he was quite bored and squirming the whole time. I’d say this is fine for kids around age 10-11 and older.NEW ON DVD&nbsp;Zootopia (2016)  98%Rating: PG, for some thematic elements, rude humor and action.Kids around age 6 and older will be just fine watching this extremely timely animated Disney movie. It’s a smart, clever allegory about prejudice and race relations. But before you cringe at the prospect of a heavy-handed, preachy tale, just know that Zootopia&nbsp;handles some tricky, emotional issues with great deftness, humor and honesty. Basically, it suggests that we’re all a little racist, whether or not we think we are, and acknowledging as much is the first step to true understanding and harmony. Heavy stuff potentially, but it’s packaged in the context of a lively and thriving urban center called Zootopia, full of adorable creatures – predators and prey alike – who’ve found a way to co-exist peacefully. Ginnifer Goodwin provides the voice of a plucky bunny named Judy Hopps, the first of her species to join the city’s police force. She teams up with an unlikely ally – sly fox Nick Wilde (Jason Bateman) – a con artist who helps her investigate a series of attacks in which predators are suddenly turning savage, which breeds rampant mistrust. Kids will delight in the furry animals, colorful settings and charming details, but might feel a little frightened during the brief moments when some of the animals lose control.","section":"Parental Guidance","tags":"boxing, of, TV, festivals, twilight, Star, DC, south, winner, globes, Walt, 93rd, Brie, History","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/10112428/Warcraft-PG.jpg","slug":"how-family-friendly-is-warcraft"},{"id":"47508909050760","title":"How Family-Friendly are Ratchet &amp; Clank, Mother’s Day, and The Meddler?","content":"Parental Guidancevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})How Family-Friendly are Ratchet &amp; Clank, Mother's Day, and The Meddler?by Christy Lemire | April 29, 2016 |  CommentsThis week, Christy goes over a new video game adaptation, Garry Marshall’s latest holiday-based ensemble movie, and a solid comedy that opened last week. Read on for details.NEW IN THEATERS&nbsp;Ratchet &amp; Clank (2016)  21%Rating: PG, for action and some rude humor.This animated family comedy is based on the sci-fi video game of the same name about the adventures of a cat-like creature named Ratchet, who’s a mechanic, and Clank, his robot friend. The two team up with a group of Galactic Rangers to stop the villainous Chairman Drek (voiced by Paul Giamatti) from blowing up various planets for his own nefarious purposes. John Goodman, Rosario Dawson, Sylvester Stallone, and Bella Thorne are also among the starry voice cast. This movie is pretty harmless but it’s also not very good. The jokes are flat, the antics are noisy and the overall tone is annoyingly cheeky. As for whether it’s appropriate for your kids, though, there’s a bit of action violence but it’s never scary. There is some weaponry and we see a few explosions, but it’s cartoonish in every sense of the word. I brought my 6 ½-year-old son to a screening and nothing bothered him. If your kids are begging to see Ratchet &amp; Clank, it’ll be fine for around ages 6 or 7 and older.Mother's Day (2016)  8%Rating: PG-13, for language and suggestive material.This is the latest holiday-based comedy from director Garry Marshall, who previously gave us Valentine’s Day&nbsp;and New Year’s Eve. Once again, a large, A-list cast (Jennifer Aniston, Julia Roberts, Kate Hudson, Jason Sudeikis) comes together in several intertwined storylines, all of which are meant to celebrate the joys and challenges of motherhood. There is language scattered throughout, including the one F-bomb you get in a PG-13 movie, which Aniston gets to drop. There’s a running bit in which a couple of racist parents from Texas (Margo Martindale and Robert Pine) make inappropriate comments about their daughter’s Indian husband. But while the content is mostly harmless, it’s also terrible. There’s not a single authentic moment in the entire movie — which, at a couple minutes under two hours, feels like a massive slog. Avoid, regardless of age.The Meddler (2016)  85%Rating: PG-13, for brief drug material.I wanted to play catch-up with this one because I missed it last week, and it’s a far preferable movie to take your mom to than Mother’s Day. Susan Sarandon stars as Marnie, a widow who moves from New Jersey to Los Angeles to be near her daughter (Rose Byrne), who’s a television writer. Marnie calls and texts her daughter incessantly and shows up at her house unannounced, but she also insinuates herself in the lives of people she barely knows. She means well, but she’s also extremely needy and clingy. There’s some language here and some grown-up talk about death and grief during therapy sessions. There’s also one scene in which Marnie eats a bag full of marijuana to hide it from a security guard and goes on a hallucinatory trip while wandering around an outdoor mall. But this is a fine movie for tweens and older to see, with some nice performances.NEW ON DVD&nbsp;Ride Along 2 (2016)  14%Rating: PG-13, for sequences of violence, sexual content, language and some drug material.The sequel to the surprise 2014 hit Ride Along reunites stars Kevin Hart and Ice Cube for more mismatched buddy-cop antics. It’s essentially the same movie all over again — Hart chatters, Cube glowers — but this time, Hart’s character really is a probationary police officer, and not just a wannabe. Still, he manages to mess things up with his unstoppable enthusiasm and half-baked notions of detective work. He follows his soon-to-be brother-in-law from Atlanta to Miami to stop a villainous shipping magnate (Benjamin Bratt) from doing something villainous. Shootouts, explosions and copious amounts of South Beach booty shaking ensue. There’s also some language and sexually suggestive material. If you must watch this, it’s probably OK for mature tweens to watch, too.","section":"Parental Guidance","tags":"language, cats, remakes, cancelled","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/29111620/Ratchet-Clank-PG.jpg","slug":"how-family-friendly-are-ratchet-clank-mothers-day-and-the-meddler"},{"id":"47508909052809","title":"How Family-Friendly is The Huntsman: Winter’s War?","content":"Parental Guidancevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})How Family-Friendly is The Huntsman: Winter's War?by Christy Lemire | April 22, 2016 |  CommentsThe big movie this week is the prequel/sequel to Snow White and the Huntsman, and Christy lets us know if there are any fantastical images in it that might frighten the wee ones. Also on video, she covers a poorly received animated film from earlier this year and an underseen gem from across the pond. Read on for details.NEW IN THEATERS&nbsp;The Huntsman: Winter's War (2016)  19%Rating: PG-13, for fantasy action violence and some sensuality.This sorta-prequel, sorta-sequel, sorta-spinoff to 2012’s Snow White and the Huntsman&nbsp;is visually lush but the script is a mess. It’s essentially a really angry version of Frozen, starring Charlize Theron and Emily Blunt as wicked royal sisters dueling for power. Blunt’s character, Freya, discovers she can shoot ice from her fingertips in a fit of rage and exiles herself to the snowy mountains where she builds her own kingdom and forms her own army. She rounds up and trains child soldiers for battle and explicitly instructs them not to fall in love. But two of them (Chris Hemsworth and Jessica Chastain) — her two brightest, actually — grow up and do just that. (There are two brief love scenes — one in a hot tub, another in the forest — which suggest they have sex, but you don’t see anything.) Winter’s War&nbsp;is also about a quest to recover that famous mirror and, like the original film, features various, strange forest creatures and digitally rendered dwarfs. Much of the combat is rather intense, and there’s a horned, roaring goblin who might be seriously frightening for younger kids. The special effects are quite dazzling but they also result in images that might be too scary, especially during the climactic showdown between the two sisters. Probably fine for kids around 9 or 10 and older.NEW ON DVD&nbsp;Norm of the North (2016)  7%Rating: PG, for mild rude humor and action.Critics weren’t kind to this animated family comedy when it came out earlier this year. It barely hovered above the ground at 8 percent on the Tomatometer and stayed there, despite its theoretically worthwhile ecological message. It’s about a chatty, wacky polar bear (voiced by Rob Schneider) who travels to New York City to stop a real estate developer from building luxury condos near his Arctic home. Along for the ride is a trio of adorable, Minion-esque lemmings. Madcap fish-out-of-water antics and fart jokes ensue. This is probably fine (and best-suited, really) for the youngest children in your house. Maybe if you’re desperate, you can put it on to occupy your kids while you’re folding laundry or making dinner — but there are a million other preferable options.The Lady In The Van (2015)  89%Rating: PG-13, for a brief unsettling image.Maggie Smith is adorably cantankerous in this true story of a homeless woman who parked her van in the driveway of a playwright’s London home and didn’t leave for 15 years. The Lady in the Van&nbsp;is based on Alan Bennett’s play of the same name, inspired by his real-life experience with a mysterious woman who demanded that people address her exclusively as Miss Shepherd. Nicholas Hytner’s film has plenty of hard-earned lessons about tolerance, generosity and kindness. It features several characters who are repulsed by the sight and smell of Miss Shepherd but eventually find a soft spot in their hearts for her. But it also includes — spoiler alert — the discovery of her dead body inside the van toward the end; it’s a quiet, peaceful image, but it’s apparently the reason for the film’s PG-13 rating. The movie has a nice message, though, and should be fine for older kids and up.","section":"Parental Guidance","tags":"dceu, impossible, Arrangement, The, unscripted, sports, Pop, serial, Talk, Rocky, Logo, casting","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/21220528/Huntsman-PG.jpg","slug":"parental-guidance-how-family-friendly-is-the-huntsman-winters-war"},{"id":"47508910506897","title":"Parental Guidance: How Family-Friendly Are Gods of Egypt and Eddie the Eagle?","content":"Parental Guidancevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Parental Guidance: How Family-Friendly Are Gods of Egypt and Eddie the Eagle?by Christy Lemire | February 26, 2016 |  CommentsThis week, Christy looks at a special effects-driven mythological tale and a lighthearted, inspirational true story. Then, on home video, she revisits one of Pixar’s two films from 2015 and an American remake of an Argentine Oscar-winner. Read on for details.NEW IN THEATERS&nbsp;Gods Of Egypt (2016)  15%Rating: PG-13, for fantasy violence and action, and some sexuality.This is a crazy, cheesy, over-the-top mish-mosh of history, mythology, and sci-fi fantasy. It’s basically about Egyptian gods (played by actors who are either Scottish, Australian or Danish) turning into giant, metallic flying creatures that battle each other in the sky. There’s a ton of carnage and destruction, all of which is rendered in hilariously terrible 3-D special effects. One character gets his eyes plucked out of his face. Another takes a lengthy trip to the underworld, where some fellow travelers find themselves graphically obliterated if they don’t have anything valuable to secure their passage to eternal peace. There’s also a brief sex scene with partial nudity between Gerard Butler’s character, the power-hungry Set, and his mistress. This is super-violent and overlong but also just bad. Bad in a fun way quite often, but still — bad. If for some reason you feel compelled to see it, though, it’s probably OK for young teens and older.Eddie The Eagle (2016)  82%Rating: PG-13, for some suggestive material, partial nudity and smoking.The unlikely athletic prowess of Michael “Eddie” Edwards provides the inspiration for this feel-good, formulaic story. Edwards competed in the 1988 Olympic Winter Games in Calgary as the first British ski jumper since the 1920s. What he lacked in natural physical ability he made up for in fearlessness and heart. It’s a pretty harmless story for the whole family for the most part, except for a couple of racy scenes. One features Eddie’s reluctant coach, a former American ski jumping great (Hugh Jackman), comparing the dynamics of takeoff to having sex with Bo Derek, complete with fake orgasm. The other scene takes place in a sauna where a bunch of hunky, Scandinavian ski jumpers are unwinding in little more than skimpy towels. Also, Jackman’s character smokes and sips from a flask pretty much non-stop. (It’s shorthand to indicate how rebellious he is.) But the movie also has some worthwhile messages about perseverance, self-confidence and drive. I brought my 6-year-old son and he enjoyed Eddie’s slapsticky antics (he falls a lot, from various heights). Probably OK for tweens and older.NEW ON DVD&nbsp;The Good Dinosaur (2015)  76%Rating: PG,&nbsp;for peril action and thematic elements.This stunningly beautiful animated adventure from Disney’s Pixar Animation is probably OK for most kids in your family, even though it has a pervasive sense of old-school peril reminiscent of Bambi or Dumbo. In this prehistoric twist on the traditional boy-and-his-dog tale, a young dinosaur named Arlo (voiced by Raymond Ochoa) reluctantly befriends the feral boy (Jack Bright) who’d been stealing food from his family’s farm. The two repeatedly find themselves in serious danger. Arlo becomes separated from his family and loses his way home in the treacherous wilderness. There are raging storms, predatory pterodactyls and vicious cattle rustlers to survive as well as a dramatic parental loss early in the film, which already was devastating. I brought my 6-year-old son to see this and we both cried in different spots. But we were also dazzled by the movie’s visual wonder — it has such a high-tech, photorealistic beauty, you’ll swear you’re looking at real water, trees and mountains — as well as its touching, unlikely friendship.Secret in Their Eyes (2015)  39%Rating: PG-13, for thematic material involving disturbing violent content, language and some sexual references.Mature young teens and older are probably the suitable audience for this star-studded thriller. Julia Roberts, Chiwetel Ejiofor, and Nicole Kidman share the screen in an English-language remake of Argentina’s El secreto de sus ojos, winner of the Academy Award for best foreign-language film in 2010. It follows a group of investigators and close friends still reeling from the brutal rape and murder 13 years earlier of Roberts’ character’s daughter, and it jumps back and forth in time as it reveals clues and twists. We see the young woman’s body — soaked in bleach and tossed in a Dumpster — as well as her mother’s anguish at the discovery. We also see montages of partially obscured images from the attack itself. There’s some disturbing imagery here as well as some fatal shootings.","section":"Parental Guidance","tags":"BBC, The, Trivia","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/26105952/EddieTheEaglePG.jpg","slug":"parental-guidance-how-family-friendly-are-gods-of-egypt-and-eddie-the-eagle"},{"id":"47508910515094","title":"Parental Guidance: How Family-Friendly Are The 5th Wave and The Boy?","content":"Parental Guidancevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Parental Guidance: How Family-Friendly Are The 5th Wave and The Boy?by Christy Lemire | January 22, 2016 |  CommentsThis week, Christy takes a look at the latest YA novel adaptation and a horror movie centered around a creepy doll, plus a bubbly music movie, a harrowing survival story, and a sweet comedy on DVD. Read on for the list.NEW IN THEATERS&nbsp;The 5th Wave (2016)  15%Rating: PG-13, for violence and destruction, some sci-fi thematic elements, language and brief teen partying.This is yet another movie based on yet another Young Adult novel. But the way it trots out every trope of the genre, it plays like a Wayans-brothers spoof. There’s been an apocalypse (this time aliens are to blame). There’s a plucky teenage girl (Chloe Grace Moretz) who dares to think for herself and fight back. There are two hunky young men (Nick Robinson and Alex Roe) who are competing for her affections. There are untrustworthy adults played by serious actors (Liev Schreiber and Maria Bello). There are kids being trained as soldiers. And eventually there’s a mad dash through maze-like hallways. It’s all there. Also because it’s possibly the end of the world, there’s general panic, violence, death and destruction. Kids get sent into battle and must pick off their enemies in hails of gunfire (and some of them get shot, as well). There’s also some language including one F-bomb and a kegger during happier times at the film’s start. This may not be very good but it is very intense, and probably best suited for viewers around 13 and older.The Boy (2016)  29%Rating: PG-13,&nbsp;for violence and terror, and for some thematic material.A young American woman finds that the 8-year-old boy she’s been hired to nanny at an imposing estate in the English countryside is actually a china doll, whom his parents treat like a living, breathing child. It should be a super-creepy premise but, in execution, The Boy&nbsp;is too silly to take seriously — yet not knowingly over-the-top enough to serve as a guilty pleasure. Lauren Cohan of The Walking Dead&nbsp;stars as the nanny, who’s skeptical about the toy until her clothes start going missing and she hears a child’s giggling and sobs in the hallways. There’s some potentially unsettling stuff here in terms of what happened to the couple’s actual 8-year-old son, and the climactic showdown is violent and bloody. Probably OK for viewers around 12 or 13 and up.NEW ON DVD&nbsp;Jem and the Holograms (2015)  22%Rating: PG,&nbsp;for thematic material including reckless behavior, brief suggestive content and some language.If you’ve got a girl in your house between the ages of 8 and 12, they will love this. Tweens and older are the perfect age for this live-action movie based on the 1980s cartoon series about the adventures of an all-girl rock band. Shy singer-songwriter Jerrica (Aubrey Peeples) becomes a viral Internet sensation when her younger sister, Kimber (Stefanie Scott), posts a video of her performing online. She gets whisked away to Los Angeles for a record deal but insists on bringing not just Kimber but also her two foster sisters. But while she’s there, she also must follow a series of clues her late father left behind for her in the form of hologram images stored inside a robot. As you might have figured out, there’s a lot going on here — and the movie is all of two hours long — so really little kids might be lost. There’s also a bit of minor language and a few scenes of nighttime trespassing. And at one point, the band’s hunky handler (Ryan Guzman) emerges from the shower in nothing but a towel — but that’s for the moms’ enjoyment.Everest (2015)  73%Rating: PG-13, for intense peril and disturbing images.The moral of the story is: Don’t climb Mt. Everest. You won’t make it to the top. And if you do, you probably won’t make it back down. And even if you do make it back down, you’ll probably have frostbite. The visuals are spectacular, though; theatrically, it was available in IMAX 3-D, and was definitely worth the extra cost. An all-star cast including Jason Clarke, John Hawkes, Jake Gyllenhaal and Josh Brolin brave the elements in this harrowing recreation of a real-life, ill-fated trek up the mountain in 1996. Keira Knightley and Robin Wright are among the women waiting and worrying for them back home. The characters struggle and suffer in disturbing ways, and not everyone makes it out alive. Amid the striking imagery, director Baltasar Kormakur also shows us dead, frozen bodies in the snow. My son (who was almost 6 at the time) was curious about Everest, though, so I brought him with me to a screening and he did fine. This should be suitable for older kids and up.The Intern (2015)  59%Rating: PG-13, for some suggestive content and brief strong language.This week, Robert De Niro is in theaters as Dirty Grandpa. But last year, he played a much sweeter guy: Ben Whittaker, a 70-year-old widower and retiree who takes an internship at a burgeoning fashion website to feel useful again. He’s assigned to work with the site’s founder, Jules Ostin (Anne Hathaway), an impatient, workaholic wife and mom. Magically, they make each other’s lives better — and they do it all in great clothes within impeccably decorated homes and offices. (This is a Nancy Meyers movie, after all.) There’s a bit of language here and a mature subplot involving Jules’ husband (Anders Holm). Otherwise, this movie is fine for tweens and older. You’ll just have to explain to them that nobody actually lives this way in Brooklyn.","section":"Parental Guidance","tags":"women, marvel, 2017, show, sequels, books, lee","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/22151020/5thWavePG.jpg","slug":"parental-guidance-how-family-friendly-are-the-5th-wave-and-the-boy"},{"id":"47508910507922","title":"Parental Guidance: How Family-Friendly Is Race?","content":"Parental Guidancevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Parental Guidance: How Family-Friendly Is Race?by Christy Lemire | February 19, 2016 |  CommentsThis week, Christy looks at the inspirational true story of Olympian Jesse Owens, who faced immense obstacles on his way to winning four gold medals at the 1936 Summer Games in Berlin. Also, on video, she looks at the real life story of the Chilean miners who were trapped underground in 2010. Read on for details.NEW IN THEATERS&nbsp;Race (2016)  62%Rating: PG-13, for thematic elements and language.Prolific Olympic gold medalist Jesse Owens is the subject of this well-intentioned sports biopic. Stephan James stars as the legendary track and field athlete who was part of the controversial decision by the American team to take part in the Nazi-run 1936 Summer Games. Given the time period and the racially charged setting, you can expect lots of language and slurs, which may be uncomfortable for young viewers to hear — but it also may provide a teaching moment about history and racial struggles. (The title is a double entendre, get it?) The film features Jews being forced onto transport vehicles and having their businesses vandalized. It also includes some sexual humor and shows Owens cheating on the mother of his child. But there are also many worthwhile themes here for kids to learn about and discuss: perseverance, courage and understanding. This is probably fine for tweens and older.NEW ON DVD&nbsp;The 33 (2015)  48%Rating: PG-13, for a disaster sequence and some language.Here’s another drama based on a real-life events, which is probably suitable for kids around 8 or 9 and older. It’s about the 33 Chilean men who were trapped underground for 69 days in 2010 when the gold mine where they worked collapsed. As they fight to survive, the government tries to rescue them and their family members struggle to maintain hope. Antonio Banderas, Lou Diamond Phillips, Rodrigo Santoro, and Juliette Binoche are among the film’s stars. Much of the imagery of the actual collapse is intense as giant chunks of rock come tumbling down around the miners, giving them little room to run for safety. It’s dark and cramped in there, and the men get edgy with each other as they face starvation and possible death. (Spoiler: They all make it out alive, hence the title.) Above ground, there’s a subplot involving one of the miners who has both a wife and a mistress, with each woman insisting he loves her best. But The 33&nbsp;also is a story of hope, faith, teamwork, and perseverance, which could make it worthwhile for the younger members of your family to watch.&nbsp;","section":"Parental Guidance","tags":"drama, Paramount, TCA, IFC, Rey, NBC, Video, Country, of, Film, new, casting, ID, Rom-Com, docudrama","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/19114244/RacePG.jpg","slug":"parental-guidance-how-family-friendly-is-race"},{"id":"47508910498701","title":"Parental Guidance: How Family-Friendly Are Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice and My Big Fat Greek Wedding 2?","content":"Parental Guidancevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Parental Guidance: How Family-Friendly Are Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice and My Big Fat Greek Wedding 2?by Christy Lemire | March 24, 2016 |  CommentsThis week, Christy reports back on a superhero spectacle that happens to be one of the most anticipated films of the year, as well as a sequel to a surprise hit from 2002 and, on DVD, the final chapter of the Hunger Games franchise. Read on for details.NEW IN THEATERS&nbsp;Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice (2016)  29%Rating: PG-13, for intense sequences of violence and action throughout, and some sensuality.Director Zack Snyder’s follow-up to his 2013 film Man of Steel&nbsp;finds Superman (Henry Cavill) battling Batman (Ben Affleck) basically for the amusement of crazed industrialist Lex Luthor (Jesse Eisenberg). Mass urban destruction ensues. Theoretically, there’s more to it than that, and it involves Batman’s fear that Superman is dangerous following the climactic events of the previous movie. But really, any semblance of plot is just a thin excuse to set up a pantheon of films based on DC Comics characters, similar to the Marvel Cinematic Universe that’s firmly in place. All your usual action-movie elements are here: brutal fistfights, perilous car chases, enormous explosions and deadly gunfire. As in so many other Batman films, BvS&nbsp;replays the moment when young Bruce Wayne watches his parents get shot to death during a robbery outside a movie theater. Plus — without spoiling anything — a new monster arrives on the scene who’s seemingly indestructible. There’s also a disturbing dream sequence. It’s all very noisy and numbing. It’s CGI-inflated comic-book violence. But it’s probably OK for mature tweens and older.My Big Fat Greek Wedding 2 (2016)  27%Rating: PG-13, for some suggestive material.The sequel to the 2002 surprise smash hit My Big Fat Greek Wedding&nbsp;revisits the wacky Portokalos family in all their overbearing, obnoxious glory. And yes, there is indeed another big, fat, Greek wedding. This time, Toula (writer and star Nia Vardalos) must help orchestrate the event when it turns out that her parents (Michael Constantine and Lainie Kazan) never were married officially 50 years ago in Greece because the priest didn’t sign the certificate. Madcap hilarity (and lots of Windex spritzing) ensue. The only possibly offensive part of this movie is the thoroughly inappropriate sex talk from Toula’s outspoken Aunt Voula (Andrea Martin). She also buys Toula a racy, red negligee to help her spice things up with Ian (John Corbett), the WASPy dude she married in the first film. But for the most part, this is probably fine for kids around age 9 or 10 and up. (Although I brought my movie-savvy 6 ½-year-old with me to the screening and he complained afterward that it gave him a headache.)NEW ON DVD&nbsp;The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 2 (2015)  69%Rating: PG-13 for intense sequences of violence and action and for some thematic material.The final Hunger Games&nbsp;film comes with all the massive carnage and destruction you’ve come to expect from the series — and from any movie within the post-apocalyptic, dystopian-future Young Adult genre. So if you’ve seen any of the three previous films, you know what’s in store for you. There is the threat of all-out war in Panem. Additionally, diabolical President Snow (Donald Sutherland) and his gamesmakers have scattered deadly obstacles — or pods — throughout the capitol to keep Katniss (Jennifer Lawrence) and her fellow rebels from storming in and killing him. These are devastating, ranging from a giant, ferocious wave of black ooze to an army of ravenous, reptilian lizard mutts in the sewers. (The latter scene had me curled up in a ball, watching through splayed fingers.) There’s also a disturbing sequence involving the death of many young children. This is just extremely violent for a PG-13 movie. It’s probably OK for mature, older tweens and up — but if your kids are fans of the book, they know what’s in the movie, and they’ll probably want to see it all unfold for themselves.","section":"Parental Guidance","tags":"Lucasfilm, adaptation, children's, on, poppins, PlayStation, Shondaland, Teen, awards, Bros., Fantasy, streaming, movies","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/24154305/BatmanVSupermanPG.jpg","slug":"parental-guidance-how-family-friendly-are-batman-v-superman-dawn-of-justice-and-my-big-fat-greek-wedding-2"},{"id":"47508910513045","title":"Parental Guidance: How Family-Friendly Are Kung Fu Panda 3 and The Finest Hours?","content":"Parental Guidancevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Parental Guidance: How Family-Friendly Are Kung Fu Panda 3 and The Finest Hours?by Christy Lemire | January 29, 2016 |  CommentsThis week, Christy takes a look at the third installment of DreamWorks’ hit franchise&nbsp;and a real life high seas rescue story, plus a monster-filled adventure for kids on DVD. Read on for details.NEW IN THEATERS&nbsp;Kung Fu Panda 3 (2016)  87%Rating: PG, for martial arts action and some mild rude humor.Roly-poly panda Po (voiced by Jack Black) is back for his third animated adventure, and this time the student becomes the teacher. Po must find his inner dragon master — and show other creatures how to find the untapped warrior within himself or herself. He teams up with his long-lost father (Bryan Cranston), the noodle-making goose who raised him (James Hong) and all their friends (Seth Rogen, David Cross, Angelina Jolie, Lucy Liu and Dustin Hoffman) to defeat an evil spirit warrior (J.K. Simmons) who’s stealing the chi of kung fu masters across China. It’s a gorgeous film filled with lively battles scenes as well as moments of genuine emotion. The combat scenes aren’t scary, though; they’re actually quite playful. After all, this is a movie in which a panda uses dumplings as weapons. I brought my 6-year-old son to the screening and there’s nothing here that was scary or troubling. Fine for all ages, but it might be a bit intense for the littlest kids, especially those who haven’t seen a movie in a theater very often if at all. There’s quite a lot going on here visually.The Finest Hours (2016)  63%Rating: PG-13, for intense sequences of peril.Based on the true story of an oil tanker that got sheared in half during a powerful blizzard off the coast of Cape Cod in 1952, and the plucky Coast Guard team that dared brave the elements to rescue the men aboard. Chris Pine, Casey Affleck, Ben Foster, Eric Bana and Holliday Grainger are among the large ensemble cast. There are many intense moments here, with both the tanker’s crew and the Coast Guard team in constant danger of death. The waves are massive, the winds are punishing and the downpour is incessant. And as the tanker takes on more water, it looks unlikely that anyone on board will survive. (Given that this is a Disney movie, though, you can guess what happens). This is an extremely earnest and old-fashioned movie, one that’s probably best suited for tweens and older.NEW ON DVD&nbsp;Goosebumps (2015)  78%Rating: PG, for scary and intense creature action and images, and for some rude humor.Speaking of Jack Black, he also stars in this live-action horror comedy that brings the Goosebumps books to life. The new kid in town, Zach (Dylan Minnette), finds out that his reclusive, next-door neighbor is actually the author R.L. Stine (Black). During an ill-fated adventure with Stine’s sheltered teenage daughter (Odeya Rush), sealed manuscripts of Stine’s work burst open and the characters leap out to wreak havoc on a peaceful, small town. Much of the imagery is silly and playful – an army of adorable yard gnomes causing chaos, for example. But some might be too scary for the littlest kids in your family – a giant preying mantis creating mass destruction, or a creepy ventriloquist’s dummy spewing venomous threats. (The latter freaked me out, that’s for sure.) Goosebumps is actually a lot of fun for the adults watching, and it feels like a throwback to ‘80s films of this ilk like Gremlins, in which actual danger was in store for the characters. This is probably fine for kids around 8 and older.","section":"Parental Guidance","tags":"boxoffice, Plus, Kimmy, blockbuster, emmy, Spring, Bowl, in, shows, Musical, DGA, finale, politics, casting, golden","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/29112147/KungFuPanda3PG.jpg","slug":"parental-guidance-how-family-friendly-are-kung-fu-panda-3-and-the-finest-hours"},{"id":"47508911575965","title":"Parental Guidance: How Family-Friendly Are The Hunger Games: Mockingjay – Part 2 and Secret in Their Eyes?","content":"Parental Guidancevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Parental Guidance: How Family-Friendly Are The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 2 and Secret in Their Eyes?by Christy Lemire | November 20, 2015 |  CommentsThis week, Christy&nbsp;breaks down the much-anticipated final chapter of the&nbsp;Hunger Games series, a star-studded remake of an Oscar-winning Argentinean thriller, and a coming-of-age drama from Turkey, as well as Guy Ritchie’s zippy spy movie on DVD. Read on for details.NEW IN THEATERS&nbsp;The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 2 (2015)  69%Rating: PG-13, for intense sequences of violence and action, and for some thematic material.It’s the final movie in the Hunger Games&nbsp;series — no, really, it is. So if you’ve seen any of the three previous films — or any movie within the post-apocalyptic, dystopian-future Young Adult genre — you know what’s in store for you. The second half of the Mockingjay&nbsp;finale features massive amounts of carnage and destruction, as well as the constant threat of all-out war. Additionally, diabolical President Snow (Donald Sutherland) and his gamesmakers have scattered deadly obstacles — or pods — throughout Panem’s capitol to keep Katniss (Jennifer Lawrence) and her fellow rebels from storming in and killing him.

This is just extremely violent for a PG-13 movie. I’d say it’s OK for mature, older tweens and up — but if your kids are fans of the book, they know what’s in the movie, and they’ll probably want to see it all unfold for themselves.Secret in Their Eyes (2015)  39%Rating:&nbsp;PG-13, for thematic material involving disturbing violent content, language and some sexual references.Julia Roberts, Chiwetel Ejiofor and Nicole Kidman star in an English-language remake of Argentina’s El secreto de sus ojos, which won the Academy Award for best foreign-language film in 2010. It follows a group of investigators and close friends still reeling from the brutal rape and murder 13 years earlier of Roberts’ character’s daughter, and it jumps back and forth in time as it reveals clues and twists. We see the young woman’s body — soaked in bleach and tossed in a Dumpster — as well as her mother’s anguish at the discovery. We also see montages of partially obscured images from the attack itself. There’s some disturbing imagery here as well as some fatal shootings. I’d say this is probably appropriate for mature young teens and older.Mustang (2015)  97%Rating:&nbsp;PG-13, for mature thematic material, sexual content and a rude gesture.A great choice for the older girls in your house, the debut film from Turkish-French director Deniz Gamze Erguven provides an intimate look at five sisters who become imprisoned in their own home. A neighbor in their small, coastal village sees them romping on the shores of the Black Sea on the last day of school and misinterprets their behavior as being inappropriately sexual. Embarrassed and enraged, their grandmother and uncle take away their belongings, lock them inside and make plans to marry them off, one by one. You could think of it as a Turkish version of Sofia Coppola’s haunting 1999 debut The Virgin Suicides, but Mustang&nbsp;has its own sense of melancholy as well as a rebellious spirit. There’s some frank talk in here about virginity and ensuring that the girls have maintained theirs — or not, on their wedding night, once the older sisters enter into their arranged marriages. And at one point, one of the sisters playfully flips the bird to another at the dinner table. But it’s also about young women who are loyal and brave as they assert their identities in the face of patriarchal oppression. Fine for tweens and up (who don’t mind reading subtitles).NEW ON DVD&nbsp;The Man From U.N.C.L.E. (2015)  68%Rating: PG-13, for action violence, some suggestive content, and partial nudity.Guy Ritchie’s big-screen version of the 1960s TV spy series is a great example of what the British director does so well through his signature, kinetic style. It’s slick and sexy, fizzy and funny. But it can also be quite violent — although less so than his best films, the R-rated Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, Snatch,&nbsp;and RocknRolla. You don’t need to know a thing about the television show (I certainly didn’t) to have a good time here. Henry Cavill stars as a suave, American CIA agent sent on a mission to East Berlin during the Cold War to rescue a beautiful mechanic (Alicia Vikander) whose estranged father is a world-renowned rocket scientist working on a nuclear bomb. Also on the hunt for her is a Russian KGB agent (Armie Hammer), who’s as highly skilled as Cavill’s character but burdened with a beast of a temper. Multiple shootouts, car chases and fistfights ensue, including one in a men’s bathroom between the two spies. Characters are fatally shot but there’s no blood. There’s also a bit of torture, with one supporting character dying in spectacularly grisly fashion — but we see it from a distance, so there’s sort of a detachment to how disturbing it is, and it’s played for laughs. If sex is what you’re worried about, Cavill’s character effortlessly beds the hotel’s front desk clerk, whom we see afterward from behind in nothing but a pair of lacy panties. And there’s a playfully flirty fight between Hammer and a drunk Vikander that results in a trashed hotel room. This is probably OK for tweens and older.&nbsp;","section":"Parental Guidance","tags":"demand, ESPN, football, movie","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/20132640/HungerGamesMockingjay21.jpg","slug":"parental-guidance-how-family-friendly-are-the-hunger-games-mockingjay-part-2-and-secret-in-their-eyes"},{"id":"47508911589283","title":"Parental Guidance: How Family-Friendly Is Pan?","content":"Parental Guidancevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Parental Guidance: How Family-Friendly Is Pan?by Christy Lemire | October 9, 2015 |  CommentsJust one movie out this week you might want to share with your kids, and that movie is Joe Wright’s origin story, Pan. Christy lets us know how harrowing Peter’s adventures are, whether or not there are any frightening elements for the littlest of your little ones, and whether or not it’s worth seeing at all.NEW IN THEATERS&nbsp;Pan (2015)  27%Rating: PG, for fantasy action violence, language and some thematic material.Director Joe Wright’s film is a Peter Pan origin story – because every classic children’s character has to have an origin story these days, right? But despite the elaborate, fanciful imagery, Pan is actually a slog. Levi Miller stars as young Peter, whose mother (Amanda Seyfried) leaves him at the doorstep of a London orphanage at the film’s start. Years later, during World War II, he’s stuck in this squalid place with dozens of other boys – until the night Blackbeard (Hugh Jackman) swoops by on his flying pirate ship to scoop them all up to do his bidding. The story has something to do with the kids being forced to work as miners, digging for pixie dust to keep Blackbeard eternally young. But Peter also is The Chosen One spoken of in a prophecy, so he’s got bigger things in store. He also has to meet up with the dude who will become Captain Hook (Garrett Hedlund, doing a Harrison Ford impression circa 1980) and Tiger Lily (Rooney Mara), whose tribe he must free. It’s very complicated and not much fun. Some of the early orphanage imagery is bleak, but once we’re in Neverland, Blackbeard and his cronies aren’t terribly enjoyable to look at, either. Your kids also may be confused about why everyone sings Nirvana’s “Smells Like Teen Spirit” upon Blackbeard’s initial appearance on screen. (My 6-year-old was.) Anyway, avoid.","section":"Parental Guidance","tags":"best, Awards, Awards, and, universal, FX, singing, french, golden, HBO, book, joker, satire","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/PanParental.jpg","slug":"parental-guidance-how-family-friendly-is-pan"},{"id":"47508911571868","title":"Parental Guidance: How Family-Friendly Are The Good Dinosaur and Creed?","content":"Parental Guidancevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Parental Guidance: How Family-Friendly Are The Good Dinosaur and Creed?by Christy Lemire | November 25, 2015 |  CommentsThis week, Christy gives us a look at Pixar’s latest CGI wonder and Sylvester Stallone’s&nbsp;Rocky franchise reboot, as well as a stop-motion animated gem on DVD. Read on for details.NEW IN THEATERS&nbsp;The Good Dinosaur (2015)  76%Rating: PG,&nbsp;for peril action and thematic elements.The latest film from Disney’s Pixar Animation has a high-tech, photorealistic beauty about it – you’ll swear you’re looking at real water, trees and mountains – but it also features old-school Disney peril that’s reminiscent of Bambi&nbsp;and Dumbo. In this prehistoric twist on the traditional boy-and-his-dog story, a young dinosaur named Arlo (voiced by Raymond Ochoa) reluctantly befriends the feral boy (Jack Bright) who’d been stealing food from his family’s farm. The two repeatedly find themselves in serious danger. Arlo becomes separated from his family and loses his way home in the treacherous wilderness. There are raging storms, predatory pterodactyls and vicious cattle rustlers to survive as well as dramatic parental loss early in the film, which already was devastating. The film has plenty of visual wonder and a touching, unlikely friendship, but also a pervasive sense of loneliness and fear. I brought my 6-year-old son to the screening and we both cried in different spots. I’d say this is OK for most kids in your family, but the sensitive ones may have trouble with the elements of parental separation.Creed (2015)  95%Rating:&nbsp;PG-13, for violence, language and some sensuality.The seventh Rocky&nbsp;movie finds Apollo Creed’s son, Adonis (a charismatic Michael B. Jordan), traveling to Philadelphia and seeking out an aging Rocky Balboa (Sylvester Stallone, of course) to train him when no one else will. Ryan Coogler’s thrilling, beautifully made film is extremely violent and bloody – it is about boxing, after all – but it also features all the uplift and overcoming-of-odds you’d expect. And it’s got training montages – lots and lots of training montages. Along his journey, Adonis falls for the cool, beautiful musician (Tessa Thompson) who lives in the apartment downstairs from him, and it’s implied that they have sex. There’s also plenty of language and trash talk as Adonis prepares to take on various opponents, as well as serious discussions and imagery involving a health scare. Having said that, I’d say this is fine for mature tweens and older.NEW ON DVD&nbsp;Shaun the Sheep Movie (2015)  99%Rating: PG,&nbsp;for rude humor.Totally charming, extremely clever and beautifully detailed, as you’d expect from the folks at Aardman Animation. The latest from the studio that brought you Wallace &amp; Gromit&nbsp;and Chicken Run&nbsp;finds a mischievous sheep named Shaun enjoying some unexpected adventures in the big city. When Shaun and his buddies in the flock decide they’re tired of their quiet life, they cook up a scheme to sneak away from the farmer and have a little fun – but naturally, nothing goes as planned. What’s amazing about this movie is that it’s told without a single bit of dialogue – just grunts and noises here and there to indicate thoughts and emotions. There is some danger, though, as Shaun and his pals find themselves the targets of the evil animal control officer, who’s hell-bent on rounding up every creature he can find and throwing them behind bars. But the movie is also about teamwork, loyalty and friendship. The “rude humor” that earned the film a PG rating consists of some fart jokes, but otherwise this film is completely harmless. It’s a great choice for the whole family, especially if you’re looking for something to watch together over the Thanksgiving holiday.&nbsp;","section":"Parental Guidance","tags":"American, films, Amazon, awards","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/25133512/GoodDinosaur.jpg","slug":"parental-guidance-how-family-friendly-are-the-good-dinosaur-and-creed"},{"id":"47508911578014","title":"Parental Guidance: How Family-Friendly Are Love the Coopers and The 33?","content":"Parental Guidancevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Parental Guidance: How Family-Friendly Are Love the Coopers and The 33?by Christy Lemire | November 13, 2015 |  CommentsThis week, Christy looks at an early Christmas-themed ensemble comedy and a based-on-true-events story about a miraculous rescue. Then, on DVD, we’ve got a big blockbuster franchise sequel and a smaller drama about Sherlock Holmes. Read on for details.NEW IN THEATERS&nbsp;Love the Coopers (2015)  18%Rating: PG-13, for thematic elements, language and some sexuality.It’s your obligatory wacky Christmas comedy, complete with family dysfunction, shopping mall mishaps, a truly awkward dinner and plenty of cutaways to an adorable dog. Matriarch Charlotte Cooper (Diane Keaton) just wants one last perfect Christmas before she and her husband, Sam (John Goodman), announce to the family that they’re separating after 40 years of marriage. But as it turns out from the various supporting characters’ subplots, everyone else’s life is just as much of a mess. There’s some randy and raunchy humor here (including old-lady flatulence) and a bit of language. Charlotte’s sister (Marisa Tomei) gets arrested for shoplifting. A teenage boy frequently makes out in public with his new girlfriend. The littlest girl comes up with a catch phrase that includes a vulgar word for penis. And the eldest member of the family (Alan Arkin) has a dramatic health scare. I’d say this is fine for kids around age 8 and older. I brought my 6-year-old son to the screening and he wasn’t scarred.The 33 (2015)  48%Rating:&nbsp;PG-13, for a disaster sequence and some language.This drama tells the true story of the 33 Chilean men who were trapped underground for 69 days in 2010 when the gold mine where they worked collapsed. It focuses on their fight to survive as well as the government’s efforts to rescue them and their family members’ struggles to maintain hope. Antonio Banderas, Lou Diamond Phillips and Rodrigo Santoro are among the film’s stars, alongside a wildly miscast Juliette Binoche as an empanada peddler. Much of the imagery of the actual collapse is intense, as giant chunks of rock come tumbling down around the miners, giving them little room to run for safety. It’s dark and cramped in there, and the men get edgy with each other as they face starvation and possible death. (Spoiler: They all make it out alive, hence the title.) Above ground, there’s a subplot involving one of the miners who has both a wife and a mistress, with each woman insisting he loves her best. But The 33&nbsp;is also a story of hope, faith, teamwork and perseverance, so it could be worthwhile for the younger members of your family to watch for that reason. This is probably fine for kids around 8 or 9 and older.NEW ON DVD&nbsp;Terminator Genisys (2015)  27%Rating: PG-13, for intense sequences of sci-fi violence and gunplay throughout, partial nudity and brief strong language.Perhaps you’ve heard of the Terminator franchise. It’s been around for a while. So if you’ve seen any of the four previous films — or you’re generally familiar with Arnold Schwarzenegger’s action oeuvre — then you should have a pretty good idea of what’s in store here. Massive amounts of gunfire, crushing fistfights, dangerous chases, post-apocalyptic terror, explosions and some brief (and chastely shot) nudity during the time-travel segments. Oh, and of course, the constant threat of the world ending. This time, Schwarzenegger returns to the role that made him a superstar in 1984’s original Terminator. But because of some time-travel glitches, he’s the good guy from the get-go. In the year 2029, rebellion leader John Connor (Jason Clarke) sends his right-hand man, Kyle Reese (Jai Courtney), back in time to protect his mother, Sarah Connor (Emilia Clarke). But Schwarzenegger’s Terminator already is there, functioning as a father figure she affectionately calls Pops. Besides the wall-to-wall violence, the general tone of Alan Taylor’s film is quite dark, and the overlapping time-travel streams can get confusing. Plus, at two hours, it could be too long for young viewers. This is probably OK for kids around age 12 and older — but the first two Terminator&nbsp;movies are better choices.Mr. Holmes (2015)  88%Rating: PG, for thematic elements, some disturbing images and incidental smoking.This is a different take on the legacy of Sherlock Holmes, focusing on his later years in his remote farmhouse by the sea. Director Bill Condon’s film finds the world-famous detective (Ian McKellen), at age 93, struggling to recall the details of the case that ended up being his last. He has just returned from post-World War II Japan with a plant whose healing powers he hopes will restore his mental acuity, but he continues to deteriorate. Also living in the house are Holmes’ housekeeper (Laura Linney) and her young son (Milo Parker). Holmes reflects upon this final investigation, which involved the makings of a murder plot. While in Japan, he visited the remnants of Hiroshima and witnessed the devastating impact the bomb had on the city’s survivors. And the boy, whose inquisitive nature makes him a keen companion for Holmes, winds up in serious physical danger when he helps tend to the detective’s prized bees. There’s also just the scary nature of the creeping effects of dementia. It’s rated PG, though, so for the most part it’s fine for kids around age 8 and older.","section":"Parental Guidance","tags":"joker","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/13134047/LoveTheCoopersPG.jpg","slug":"parental-guidance-how-family-friendly-are-love-the-coopers-and-the-33"},{"id":"47508911584161","title":"Parental Guidance: How Family-Friendly Are Jem and the Holograms and The Last Witch Hunter?","content":"Parental Guidancevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Parental Guidance: How Family-Friendly Are Jem and the Holograms and The Last Witch Hunter?by Christy Lemire | October 23, 2015 |  CommentsThis week, Christy talks about the big screen adaptation of a popular 1980s cartoon and a fantasy action/adventure starring Vin Diesel. Then, on video, she also tells us whether or not three of this week’s new releases are appropriate for the little ones. Read on for details.NEW IN THEATERS&nbsp;Jem and the Holograms (2015)  22%Rating: PG,&nbsp;for thematic material including reckless behavior, brief suggestive content and some language.This is a live-action movie based on the 1980s cartoon series about the adventures of an all-girl rock band. Shy singer-songwriter Jerrica (Aubrey Peeples) becomes a viral Internet sensation when her younger sister, Kimber (Stefanie Scott), posts a video of her performing online. She gets whisked away to Los Angeles for a record deal but insists on bringing not just Kimber but also her two foster sisters. But while she’s there, she also must follow a series of clues her late father left behind for her in the form of hologram images stored inside a robot. There’s a lot going on here – and the movie is all of two hours long – so really little kids might be lost. But if you’ve got a girl in your house between the ages of 8 and 12, they will love this. There’s a bit of minor language and a few scenes of nighttime trespassing. The band’s hunky handler (Ryan Guzman) emerges from the shower in nothing but a towel (but that’s for the moms in the audience). Fine for young tweens and up.The Last Witch Hunter (2015)  18%Rating: PG-13, for sequences of fantasy violence and frightening images.It’s boring and confusing and grim and the effects look murky and cheesy. Having said that, if you can figure out what’s going on here, many of the images are super-scary. Vin Diesel stars as a man who’s been cursed with immortality, and who’s been hunting witches for the past 800 years. There’s been a truce between humans and the witches who exist among us, but the most evil being of them all, the Queen Witch, has plans to return and unleash the Black Death upon the planet in a fit of revenge. There is the suggestion that some characters die – or at least they appear to die. There’s some language. But more potentially disturbing is the imagery of the icky witch covered in gooey, oozing glop who unleashes torrents of insects upon New York City. This movie is terrible. But if your kids insist on seeing it, it’s probably OK for young teens and up. I’d steer them toward something else, though.NEW ON DVD&nbsp;Jurassic World (2015)  71%Rating: PG-13, for intense sequences of science-fiction violence and peril.This is an extremely violent PG-13 movie. It’s actually kind of amazing that it got a PG-13 rating — it’s right there on the edge of the most you can get away with before earning an R. In keeping with other movies in the Jurassic Park series, people get straight-up eaten here. Or trampled. Or torn to pieces. There’s no other way to phrase it — it’s a movie about dinosaurs run amok at a (supposedly) family-friendly theme park. Thousands flee in terror as dinosaurs stomp and roar and tear their way through the scenery and eateries. The biggest of them all is the genetically engineered Indominus Rex, which stands 50 feet high and contains strands of DNA from various other creatures, making it unstoppable. A couple of kids are in particular danger: A teenager and his younger brother, visiting their aunt (Bryce Dallas Howard), who’s a top executive at Jurassic World. Luckily, a tough-guy velociraptor trainer (Chris Pratt) is there to save the day. It’s the biggest hit of the year and No. 3 all-time at the box office, but I still feel like it’s best suited for viewers around 13 and up.Paper Towns (2015)  58%Rating: PG-13, for some language, drinking, sexuality and partial nudity – all involving teens.A sweetly geeky high school senior (Nat Wolff) goes on an all-night adventure with his neighbor from across the street (Cara Delevingne), his one-time, childhood pal who’s now the rebellious, cool girl. The next morning, she has disappeared mysteriously, inspiring him and his two best friends to go on a hunt to find her. Paper Towns is based on the novel by John Green, who also wrote The Fault in Our Stars, so the young-adult crowd probably knows what’s in store. There’s some teen-movie partying, including beer bongs, keg stands and subsequent vomiting. A couple of characters engage in a hot-and-heavy make-out session, and a couple of others ponder the prospect of losing their virginity to each other on prom night. And there’s a bit of language. But this is totally fine for tweens and older. It’s a movie that I really liked — but I would have loved it if I’d seen it at age 13.Z For Zachariah (2015)  78%Rating: PG-13, for a scene of sexuality, partial nudity and brief strong language.This would be a tough sit for most young viewers with its ambiguous premise and languid pacing, but if you have tweens in your family with a taste for bleak, post-apocalyptic dramas, this may work for you. Margot Robbie, Chiwetel Ejiofor and Chris Pine star as the only survivors for miles around of some sort of nuclear catastrophe. They share a farmhouse nestled in a valley somewhere in the rural South, and a creeping tension grows between them. Director Craig Zobel’s beautifully shot film features some disturbing images of disease and distress as well as mature themes of death and the necessary steps to maintain humanity. The three characters get drunk and frisky one night; there’s also a bit of nudity and the implication that a couple of the characters have had sex. We won’t spoil it by telling you which ones, though.","section":"Parental Guidance","tags":"dc, TV, Christmas, mockumentary, CW, history, The, news, Guild, show, football, VH1, Reality, IFC, History","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/JemHologramsPG.jpg","slug":"parental-guidance-how-family-friendly-are-jem-and-the-holograms-and-the-last-witch-hunter"},{"id":"47508911587234","title":"Parental Guidance: How Family-Friendly Are Goosebumps and Bridge of Spies?","content":"Parental Guidancevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Parental Guidance: How Family-Friendly Are Goosebumps and Bridge of Spies?by Christy Lemire | October 16, 2015 |  CommentsThis week, Christy give us the lowdown on a horror comedy inspired by the work of author R.L. Stine, a cold war thriller from Steven Spielberg, and on DVD, a George Clooney-powered Disney fantasy adventure. Read on to find out all the details.NEW IN THEATERS&nbsp;Goosebumps (2015)  78%Rating: PG, for scary and intense creature action and images, and for some rude humor.The Goosebumps books come to life – just in time for Halloween – in this live-action horror comedy. The new kid in town, Zach (Dylan Minnette), finds out that his reclusive, next-door neighbor is actually the author R.L. Stine (Jack Black). During an ill-fated adventure with Stine’s sheltered teenage daughter (Odeya Rush), sealed manuscripts of Stine’s work burst open and the characters leap out to wreak havoc on a peaceful, small town. A lot of the imagery is silly and playful – an army of adorable yard gnomes causing chaos, for example. But much of it might be too scary for the littlest kids in your family – a giant preying mantis creating mass destruction, or a creepy ventriloquist’s dummy spewing venomous threats. (The latter freaked me out, that’s for sure.) But Goosebumps&nbsp;is actually a lot of fun for the adults in the audience, and it feels like a throwback to ‘80s films of this ilk like Gremlins, in which actual danger was in store for the characters. This is probably fine for kids around 8 and older.Bridge of Spies (2015)  90%Rating: PG-13,&nbsp;for some violence and brief strong language.Steven Spielberg’s Cold War drama is based on the true story of the American attorney (Tom Hanks) who negotiated the release of a U-2 spy plane pilot (Austin Stowell) captured in the Soviet Union in exchange for a Russian spy (Mark Rylance) discovered living in New York. It’s impeccably made, as you would expect from Spielberg, but it’s a slow burn, and the two-plus-hour running time might make it a tough sit for younger viewers. There’s some violence here – a prisoner endures a harsh interrogation, and some people are shot while trying to escape East Berlin. There’s also quite a bit of language and just a general unease that prevails because of U.S.-Soviet tensions. But if older kids in your family are interested in history (and excellent filmmaking), this would be a smart, challenging choice for them. Fine for viewers around 13 and older.NEW ON DVD&nbsp;Tomorrowland (2015)  50%Rating: PG,&nbsp;for sequences of sci-fi action violence and peril, thematic elements, and language.The section of Disneyland that features the Space Mountain and Star Tours rides inspires this live-action, sci-fi adventure. George Clooney and Britt Robertson star as strangers linked by a mysterious pin that transports them to a magical, futuristic land when they touch it. A robot in the form of a plucky teenage girl (Raffey Cassidy) brings them together in hopes that they’ll be able to save the place from falling apart. Two-time Oscar winner Brad Bird (The Incredibles, Ratatouille) directed from a script he co-wrote with Lost&nbsp;co-creator Damon Lindelof, so the loftier philosophical elements of the script may go over younger viewers’ heads. But the film’s dreamy, central message — do something great with your talents and make the world a better place — couldn’t be clearer. Bad guys are after our heroes in both human and robot form, and many chases and shootouts with laser guns ensue in which characters get disintegrated. And at one point, a truck hits the little girl/robot, but she’s fine. OK for kids around 8 and older.&nbsp;","section":"Parental Guidance","tags":"Disney, Television, Interview, movies, Century, independent, Studios","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Goosebumps1.jpg","slug":"parental-guidance-how-family-friendly-are-goosebumps-and-bridge-of-spies"},{"id":"47508911598503","title":"Parental Guidance: How Family-Friendly Are The Perfect Guy and The Age of Adaline?","content":"Parental Guidancevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Parental Guidance: How Family-Friendly Are The Perfect Guy and The Age of Adaline?by Christy Lemire | September 11, 2015 |  CommentsThis week, Christy takes a look at the psychological thriller starring Sanaa Lathan and Michael Ealy, which is new in theaters, and a sci-fi drama starring Blake Lively, new on DVD.NEW IN THEATERS&nbsp;The Perfect Guy (2015)  18%Rating: PG-13, for violence, menace, sexuality and brief strong language.This romantic thriller is going to be too racy for the younger viewers in the house, even your mature tweens. Sanaa Lathan stars as Leah, a Los Angeles-based lobbyist who seems to have it all: brains, looks, power, a beautiful home in the hills and a handsome longtime boyfriend (Morris Chestnut). But she’s ready to start a family and he isn’t, which drives her into the arms of the charming Carter (Michael Ealy). He seems perfect, hence the title. But he’s actually a super-psycho stalker who beats a stranger to a pulp for a perceived, minor offense right before Leah’s eyes. He also breaks into her house, steals her cat, installs surveillance equipment, hacks into her computer and calls and texts her incessantly. Oh, and he pushes the old lady across the street down a flight of stairs when he realizes she’s onto his antics and causes a deadly car accident for another character. In happier times, Leah and Carter engage in some sloppy bathroom sex at a club. There’s also some language.NEW ON DVD&nbsp;The Age of Adaline (2015)  54%Rating: PG-13, for a suggestive comment.Blake Lively stars in this romantic fantasy as a beautiful woman who stopped aging at 29 after a cosmic car accident. Decades later, she’s been moving around and changing her identity to avoid being discovered — and she’s been reluctant to connect with anyone emotionally. This handsomely made movie also features a couple of major car crashes. It suggests that Adaline has sex with the handsome philanthropist (Michiel Huisman) she allows herself to fall for, but we don’t actually see anything. There’s also a dog death, which might choke you up. (It bothered me). And it features some very mature notions about love and immortality. Still, this is probably fine for tweens and older — especially those with an interest in history or fashion. The statuesque Lively gets to wear some gorgeous period clothes.","section":"Parental Guidance","tags":"Lionsgate, in, Lifetime, festival, and","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/PerfectGuy.jpg","slug":"parental-guidance-how-family-friendly-are-the-perfect-guy-and-the-age-of-adaline"},{"id":"47508913404849","title":"Parental Guidance: Is Terminator Genisys Too Dark for Kids?","content":"Parental Guidancevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Parental Guidance: Is Terminator Genisys Too Dark for Kids?by Christy Lemire | July 2, 2015 |  CommentsNEW IN THEATERSTerminator Genisys 27%Rating: PG-13, for intense sequences of sci-fi violence and gunplay throughout, partial nudity and brief strong language.Well, it’s a Terminator movie.

Read on for more details.NEW ON DVD&nbsp;Little Boy (2015)  24%Rating: PG-13, for some thematic material, including violence.This is a lot more intense, mature and violent than its wholesome marketing might suggest. It’s a faith-based movie that features war footage, a hate crime and racial epithets against a Japanese man, shootings, a major death and a funeral. It’s also terrible, so even if it’s one of the few choices available to you, avoid it if you can. Jakob Salvati stars as a diminutive 8-year-old named Pepper, who’s mercilessly teased by bullies in 1940s small-town California. When his father and only friend (Michael Rapaport) goes off to fight in World War II, Pepper performs a series of charitable acts in hopes of bringing him back at the suggestion of the town priest (Tom Wilkinson). It’s all meant to be heartwarming but it may be too disturbing for your own little boy or girl.","section":"Parental Guidance","tags":"Broadway, cops, comic, USA","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Little-Boy-DVD.jpg","slug":"parental-guidance-how-kid-friendly-is-little-boy"}]
