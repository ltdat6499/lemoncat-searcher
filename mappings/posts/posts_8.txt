[{"id":"47508723674281","title":"All John Carpenter Movies Ranked by Tomatometer","content":"(Photo by Warner Bros./courtesy Everett Collection)All&nbsp;John Carpenter Movies Ranked by TomatometerJohn Carpenter was still a student at USC when he started piecing together what would become his first feature: 1974’s Dark Star, a sci-fi comedy about intrepid goofballs in deep space. Carpenter not only directed, but also wrote, produced, and scored the music — a DIY approach that would characterize his most legendary work.Indeed, it’s Carpenter’s relentless synth theme that opens 1978’s Halloween, his third feature (made after the claustrophobic Assault on Precinct 13) that would go on to shock audiences with its violation of suburban idyll, break box office records, and change the face of horror for decades to come. Though Michael Myers quickly grew up in the hands of other producers, Carpenter was never too far from his baby in the genre/horror world. 1980’s The Fog was icily efficient, while Escape From New York gave us sardonic action icon Snake Plissken and a blueprint of infiltration-and-rescue movies for plenty of low-budget directors to copy. Carpenter followed that up with his paranoid masterpiece, The Thing, in 1982, a year that gave us a bonanza of other sci-fi influencers like Blade Runner, E.T., and Tron.Still, Carpenter showed no sign of slowing down in the ’80s, with the release Stephen King adaptation Christine, softening his image with Starman, and putting out beloved goofy lark Big Trouble in Little China. 1988’s They Live, the action/horror hybrid satire that body checked consumerism and media propaganda, would mark his last Fresh movie to date.Some of his work in the ’90s certainly has its legions of fans — the Lovecraftian In the Mouth of Madness and Escape From L.A. especially — but critics and audiences were losing patience with his cobbled-together filmmaking style. 2001’s Ghosts of Mars was a bomb that effectively sent him to Hollywood jail, insomuch as it would be 10 years before his next (and perhaps final) feature, The Ward. Carpenter has since focused on his moody synth music, putting out albums and performing live. Thus, he was able to return to the Halloween&nbsp;franchise with the Certified Fresh 2018 sequel as composer and executive producer.And now we look at his directorial work as we rank all John Carpenter movies by Tomatometer.#17John Carpenter's Ghosts of Mars (2001) 21%#17Adjusted Score: 24.128% Critics Consensus: John Carpenter's Ghosts of Mars is not one of Carpenter's better movies, filled as it is with bad dialogue, bad acting, confusing flashbacks, and scenes that are more campy than scary.Synopsis: By the year 2025, the planet Mars, long inhabited by human settlers, has become the manifest destiny of an over-populated...

Romero Movies Ranked by Tomatometer","content":"(Photo by United Film Distribution, Universal, Weinstein Company / courtesy Everett Collection)All George A. Romero Movies Ranked by TomatometerGeorge A. Romero’s first movie,&nbsp;Night of the Living Dead, released in 1968, walloped the country with its black-and-white dread and gore; infused with progressive casting and social commentary, it single-handedly created the modern-day zombie genre. His final movie — Survival of the Dead, released 2009 and eight years before his death — had, well, not quite the same impact, but discloses Romero’s lifelong commitment to the zombie revolution he spearheaded. The movies he made in-between these two Deads represent a visionary’s rocky but tenacious journey through the industry, frequently compromised or pigeonholed, but true to a drive to shake up the conventions of horror.Night of the Living Dead took the space-age hopes of a nation on the cusp of landing on the moon and cut it to ribbons, fashioning an ambiguous backstory of a downed space craft whose radiation transforms the freshly deceased into mindless flesh-hungry shamblers. Romero was keen to quickly climb out of the horror genre pit, releasing rom-com There’s Always Vanilla in 1971, and then drama Season of the Witch in ’73, whose distributor chopped out 40 minutes and marketed as softcore. Both&nbsp;films&nbsp;have gone little-seen since.With his talents apparently unwanted outside of horror, Romero returned to the genre and filled out the rest of the ’70s with his best streak of movies: virus-based The Crazies, vampire deconstruction Martin, and the legendary Dawn of the Dead. With this Night of the Living Dead sequel, Romero took a maximalist approach: More social commentary, more characters, more action, and, of course, much more gore. The effects had people literally blowing their tops off. We call it the #1 zombie movie you must see.Dawn‘s success gave Romero enough cred to make one last go at it outside horror: Knightriders, a 2.5-hour personal drama about a troupe of Reniassance Faire-esque moto-performers. Romero, still one of the biggest names in horror even in the ’80s age of the slasher, collaborated with the biggest name in literary horror, Stephen King, for anthology Creepshow. 1985’s Day of the Dead took aim at the human psychological breakdown that came with living in the undead post-apocalypse, concluding his ultimate at-the-time trilogy of zombie cinema.Romero then entered big studio production with Monkey Shines for Orion Pictures, which balked at the movie’s initial long runtime, and were desperate for a hit. (They didn’t get one.) He collaborated with Dario Argento for 1990’s Two Evil Eyes, each adapting Edgar Allan Poe, before making Dark Half for Orion, which was&nbsp;still desperate for a hit. (They still didn’t get one.)It’d be seven years before Romero’s next film, Bruiser. And then five years after that for Land of the Dead, a highly credible return to zombie land after two decades away, working with his biggest budget ever. He would stay among the Dead for the rest of his career, following Land with found-footage reboot Diary of the Dead, shot in his native Pittsburgh area, where he set a majority of his films. Survival came out two years after that. And now, we pay tribute to the godfather of zombies by ranking all George A. Romero movies by Tomatometer!#14Survival of the Dead (2010) 30%#14Adjusted Score: 32.148% Critics Consensus: Survival of the Dead offers glimmers of Romero's savage wit, but not nearly enough to make up for his unusually uninspired directing and a lack of new ideasSynopsis: A group of rogue soldiers seek shelter from the zombie apocalypse on scenic Plum Island, only to become caught up...

Spend your burgeoning directing career on strange and grotesque genre pictures, then hook up with a major studio to work on Lord of the Rings, with hundreds of millions of dollars in budget. Obviously! It worked for Peter Jackson, whose Dead Alive and Meet the Feebles movies did little to suggest he would one day get the gold trophy for The Lord of the Rings: Return of the King.And it worked for Guillermo del Toro, whose success with cult cinema fanatics led him to toil for years on The Hobbit movies. Del Toro didn’t win anything for those movies — hell, he didn’t even end up directing them. But he did get the top prize for The Shape of Water, an unlikely win for the unlikeliest of love stories, which currently puts a lovely bow on a career characterized by dark fantasy, big sci-fi, and creature features, of visions where the lines between dream and nightmare blur.Del Toro got his start in his native Mexico in the early ’90s with the mythological Cronos, featuring Ron Perlman in the first of several collaborations. As with many international filmmakers with a hit on their hands, del Toro was wooed to Hollywood to do exactly his thing… except, of course, with tons of studio interference, notes, and meddling. The result was the compromised Mimic, whose lackluster reception was enough to get del Toro to go back abroad for his next film. The Spain set-and-shot The Devil’s Backbone was another cult hit, again enough for him to get tempted back to the States.What followed was Blade II and Hellboy, which gave the pre-Marvel Cinematic Universe era of comic book movies an unpredictable shot in the arm. The latter film reunited him with Perlman, along with physical artist Doug Jones, who he first worked with on Mimic&nbsp;and would be crucial on his journey towards The Shape of Water.2005’s Pan’s Labyrinth was a cross-cultural phenomenon, a grim fantasy and political commentary that’s still heavily watched today. Then 2008’s Hellboy II: The Golden Army had the unfortunate luck of being released a week before The Dark Knight. It took del Toro five years to return with the mech brawler Pacific Rim, which was followed by the Gothic ghost love story Crimson Peak. And then we come to The Shape of Water, his tender ode to Creature from the Black Lagoon.And those are just the movies he did end up making. Del Toro’s travails in film development hell are frequently the subject of public attention, with his name attached to a myriad of promising projects like Dark Universe, At the Mountains of Madness, and a third Hellboy. On the horizon in active development is a remake of Nightmare Alley (Toni Collette was recently announced to join Bradley Cooper) and an adaptation of Pinocchio, a once-dead project Netflix revived last year. Maybe in the future we’ll see those movies on lists like these, but for now, here’s every Guillermo del Toro movie ranked by Tomatometer!#10Blade II (2002) 57%#10Adjusted Score: 61.021% Critics Consensus: Though Blade II offers more of what worked in the original, its plot and character development appear to have been left on the cutting room floor.Synopsis: Four years after scoring a box-office touchdown with Blade (1998), actor Wesley Snipes returns to portray the Marvel Comics character...

And you’d be right in feeling so: The 10 years between that Aussie soap and David Lynch’s surreal masterpiece produced only bit parts for Watts in Hollywood, effectively making Mulholland her big debut and calling card.\nOne year later in 2002, Watts established her among the scream queen elite with The Ring, kicking off Tinseltown’s obsession with remaking Asian horror for years following. I Heart Huckabees and 21 Grams gave her further credit with the arthouse crowd, with the latter rewarding Watts with her first Best Actress Oscar nomination. Her second would come with gut-wrenching Indian Ocean tsunami disaster film The Impossible in 2012. In between noms, she would release her biggest movie (2005’s King Kong), and work with David Cronenberg (Eastern Promises), Michael Haneke (Funny Games), and Clint Eastwood (J.

You got his number. Since 1962, James Bond has been the spy whose reputation precedes him: As international man of mystery, as guru of gadgets and espionage thrills, and as the agent who never encountered a boundary – country, or personal space – he couldn’t sneak across.The Ian Fleming adaptations started with a bang:&nbsp;Dr. No&nbsp;remains among the best-reviewed of 007’s movies, bringing forth that first legendary era of Sean Connery suited up as the debonair rogue that women crave and men aspire to be in vain. Case in point: 1967’s&nbsp;Casino Royale&nbsp;had no less than six James Bonds within its spooferifous walls, none holding a candle to the Con’. The non-comic caper is the worst-reviewed James Bond movie, and was produced outside of franchise gatekeepers Eon.As celebrated was Connery’s reign was – the late actor’s films occupy three of the top five slots on this list – the sun sets on every empire, and thus was ushered in the age of the Lazenby. A mild administration for George, yes, with only 1969’s&nbsp;On Her Majesty’s Secret Service&nbsp;released, though Certified Fresh.Then it became time to move over for Roger Moore, who offered a lightly winking and intelligent Bond for those burned-out ’70s times. Three of his movies are Rotten, three are Fresh, and one is Certified Fresh. Not bad, and he even traveled into space.In 1981, Connery came back for non-Eon Bond&nbsp;Never Say Never Again, just as HQ was hiring Timothy Dalton for the job. Dalton’s Bond: Cool and menacing, and his films&nbsp;The Living Daylights&nbsp;and&nbsp;License to Kill&nbsp;are praised by modern fans for their dark, grittier take on the spy game. It’s something Daniel Craig would pick up on in the future, but with a bigger budget and fewer a-ha theme songs.Pierce Brosnan brought back the sophisticated sex appeal, as the best Bond in the not-so-greatest movies.&nbsp;GoldenEye&nbsp;was intoxicating Certified Fresh fun, while the three that followed are all Rotten.After Austin Powers took the piss out of the franchise for a decade, Eon turned to resurrecting James Bond as the brooding, brutish hulk we have today.&nbsp;Casino Royale&nbsp;was a return to form, Daniel Craig’s sneer and occasional smile calibrated to the modern cynical viewer.&nbsp;Skyfall&nbsp;was likewise Certified Fresh, but there was not so much critical love for in-betweener&nbsp;Quantum of Solace&nbsp;and the most-recent&nbsp;Spectre&nbsp;of 2015.Six years will have passed when&nbsp;No Time To Die&nbsp;arrives in 2021 (fingers crossed), though the longest wait for Bond’s return was the six years between Dalton’s&nbsp;License to Kill&nbsp;and Brosnan’s&nbsp;GoldenEye. At 15 years, Craig holds the record for longest uninterrupted ownership of Bond, but Connery spread his appearances as Bond across 21 years. In anticipation of No Time To Die, and to celebrate the life and work of the late Sean Connery, we’re reaching into the classified files for every James Bond movie ever ranked by Tomatometer!#26Casino Royale (1967) 26%#26Adjusted Score: 29.84% Critics Consensus: A goofy, dated parody of spy movie clichés, Casino Royale squanders its all-star cast on a meandering, mostly laugh-free script.Synopsis: This James Bond spoof features the hero coming out of retirement to attempt to fix some problems for SMERSH, while...

[More]Starring: Roger Moore, Christopher Walken, Tanya Roberts, Grace JonesDirected By: John Glen#24The Man with the Golden Gun (1974) 40%#24Adjusted Score: 45.156% Critics Consensus: A middling Bond film, The Man With the Golden Gun suffers from double entendre-laden dialogue, a noteworthy lack of gadgets, and a villain that overshadows 007.Synopsis: The Man With the Golden Gun, Roger Moore's second outing as James Bond (Live and Let Die was the first),... [More]Starring: Roger Moore, Christopher Lee, Britt Ekland, Maud AdamsDirected By: Guy Hamilton#23Octopussy (1983) 42%#23Adjusted Score: 45.88% Critics Consensus: Despite a couple of electrifying action sequences, Octopussy is a formulaic, anachronistic Bond outing.Synopsis: This (13th) time around, 007 (once again played by Roger Moore) receives the usual call to come and visit M...

Ñ to thwart a mad media mogul trying to start a third world war....

While M battles political...

Bond is dispatched to the... [More]Starring: Roger Moore, Yaphet Kotto, Jane Seymour, Julius W. HarrisDirected By: Guy Hamilton#14Never Say Never Again (1983) 69%#14Adjusted Score: 73.185% Critics Consensus: While the rehashed story feels rather uninspired and unnecessary, the return of both Sean Connery and a more understated Bond make Never Say Never Again a watchable retread.Synopsis: Essentially, this film is a remake of the 1965 Bond flick Thunderball. James Bond emerges from cozy retirement to cross...

He started his directing career with the well-renowned giallo trilogy of The Bird With the Crystal Plumage, The Cat o’ Nine Tails, and Four Flies on Grey Velvet, which are among his highest-rated movies. But Argento didn’t stop there: His 1975 Deep Red is considered a landmark just not just within giallo, but horror overall.Argento shifted gears for his masterpiece Suspiria, a fantasia of blood, witches, and prismatic color. Suspiria‘s grand guignol thrills have kept audiences coming back for decades, and&nbsp;the film was remade in 2018. He was just as prolific in the ’80s, releasing hidden classics like Tenebre, Phenomena, and Opera. It’s been a rough go for Argento with the critics since then, with 1996’s The Stendhal Syndrome a lone bright spot.

Having a role in The Goonies nets you cool points forever, but it took a while for Brolin to fully match his acting talent with the appropriate movies. 1998-2006, for example, didn’t net him a single Fresh movie, as he appeared in disparate films like The Mod Squad, Hollow Man, and Melinda and Melinda.But nobody had a better 2007 than Brolin, as he appeared in three Certified Fresh projects: Grindhouse (the Planet Terror portion), American Gangster, and No Country for Old Men, the latter of which would go on to win Best Picture.Brolin debuted in the MCU in 2014’s Guardians of the Galaxy as Thanos, though the character was depicted first by another actor in The Avengers. Thanos has been hanging over these movies like a purple Sword of Damocles, with the character requiring an actor of immense physical presence yet capable of emanating a kind of, yes, sensitivity and inner life to make this Mad Titan believable and near-relatable. As we’ve seen in Infinity War and now Endgame, Marvel bet on the right actor.

And the first African-American ever.It was just about as auspicious a debut as any director has had, and Singleton carried the torch with more propulsive dramas: the lyrical Poetic Justice starring Janet Jackson, and the university-set Higher Learning. Neither were able to achieve the same high marks with critics back in the day, though they connected with their intended targets if the Audience Scores are anything to be reckoned with. Rosewood, about the 1923 Florida massacre, could be seen something of a return to form.Singleton formally entered his Hollywood era with the new century, delivering the sly Shaft remake starring Samuel L. Jackson and the first Fast and Furious franchise sequel. After 2011’s Abduction with Taylor Lautner fizzled, Singleton turned to television, directing episodes of The People v. O. J. Simpson: American Crime Story and Empire, and creating drug crime serial Snowfall for FX. In April 2019, Singleton passed away at the age of 51 after lapsing into a coma due to a stroke he suffered two weeks earlier. As the movie industry deals with the loss of a pioneering talent and trailblazing voice, we celebrate his life by looking back on all of John Singleton’s movies.#1Boyz n the Hood (1991) 94%#1Adjusted Score: 99.059% Critics Consensus: Well-acted and thematically rich, Boyz N the Hood observes Black America with far more depth and compassion than many of the like-minded films its success inspired.Synopsis: Director John Singleton's debut chronicles the trials and tribulations of three young African-American males growing up in South Central Los...

The Television Academy put new rules into place this year that would prevent titles like Black Mirror from entering episodes under 75 minutes into the “Television Movie” Emmy category. The title’s 61-minute “San Junipero” won the 2017 award in the category. (On the flip side, shorts now must be at least 2 minutes long.)So, when we’re compiling a list of “Certified Fresh TV Movies,” we’re faced with making choices like whether or not individual episodes of an anthology film series like Black Mirror should be listed in such a way that they are eligible for Certified Fresh designation as the title’s one-off “Bandersnatch” is.Fortunately/unfortunately, the individual episodes for season 5 don’t meet the scores required for consideration anyway.Read also: “The Best Black Mirror Episodes to the Worst, Ranked”We pulled together a list of TV and streaming film titles that&nbsp;do&nbsp;meet the eligibility criteria to be Certified Fresh, which is a minimum of 40 reviews (higher than the 20 needed for TV seasons) with at least five reviews from “Top Critics.” We also&nbsp;took into consideration whether a title’s primary release was in theaters or on broadcast, cable, or streaming. So limited releases that saw only festival screenings or had very small theatrical time and number of theaters, but then was available broadly on a streaming service, were included as well.Read on to find out which titles in this very exclusive category came out on top for 2019.#14The Perfection (2019) 72%#14Adjusted Score: 75.461% Critics Consensus: Led by a pair of compelling performances, The Perfection is a smart, gripping thriller that barbs its wild twists with cutting wit.Synopsis: When troubled musical prodigy Charlotte (Allison Williams) seeks out Elizabeth (Logan Browning), the new star pupil of her former school,...

And, for once, the movie itself lived up to the marketing hype: With nary any blood or boobs, The Conjuring jammed audiences into a non-stop claustrophobic horror thrill ride, as Ed and Lorraine Warren investigated paranormal activity in the ’70s. A Certified Fresh rating (a first for director James Wan) helps in securing a sequel, a $300 million worldwide box office haul all but guarantees it – and the&nbsp;Conjuring 2&nbsp;was almost as scary as the original.Years later, the Conjuring Universe is in full-swing, having now expanded into one direct sequel and many spinoffs that have whisked audiences to locales like London, Rome, and Mexico.

They’ve been around for almost as long as each other, separated by a mere 30 million years. They rotate in synchronicity. And sometimes the moon blocks the Sun for some cool Earth shade. You don’t see Jupiter and Titan being such BFFs. And we hear Oberon and Uranus aren’t even on speaking terms.And for as long as Earth’s greatest, overachieving inhabitants have gifted themselves the invention of cinema, we humans have sought to depict the moon on screen. 1902’s A Trip to the Moon created the movies’ first iconic single image, a rocket ship face-planted in a crater, mythologizing the moon as sphere of whimsy, wonder, and fantasy. After July 20, 1969, the moon was gifted a new definition, one of scientific achievement and human triumph.On the 50th anniversary of the moon landing by a crew of three American astronauts with the full power of NASA behind them, Rotten Tomatoes pays tribute with every moon movie to ever sprout its own Tomatometer. These are narrative movies set on the moon (H.G. Wells’ First Men in the Moon, Airplane II: The Sequel), and about going to the moon (First Man, Apollo 13), and expansive documentaries (In the Shadow of the Moon, For All Mankind). They’re also movies about the moon landing itself, like The Dish and Moonwalkers. And we’re featuring movies where the moon is significantly visited (2001: A Space Odyssey, The Adventures of Baron Munchausen, Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me), or where the moon is thematically woven into the plot, such as A Walk on the Moon or Under the Same Moon.Ready to make a spacewalk to Earth’s closest and oldest friend?

It all started, as most auspicious Hollywood careers do, in a execrable slasher movie — the sixth Halloween, to be exact in Rudd’s case. Clueless came out that same year and was the crown jewel in his filmography for nearly a decade because, although Rudd quickly rose to leading man status with The Object of My Affection&nbsp;and&nbsp;The Shape of Things, it doesn’t matter much if nobody watches the movies.Of course, Rudd’s career trajectory exploded with cultural comedy touchstone Anchorman, which was followed&nbsp;by&nbsp;The 40-Year-Old Virgin, ushering in the Judd Apatow era of American comedy. Combined with his 2001 role in Wet Hot American Summer, appearances on TV’s Tim &amp; Eric, and his internet-tailored running joke of showing Mac &amp; Me on Conan O’Brien’s show in lieu of whatever he was supposed to promote, Rudd made his presence known in virtually ever niche of 21st century comedy.Subsequently, he joined the MCU in 2015 in Ant-Man, which had a publicly rocky development leading to original director Edgar Wright’s departure. But with its light step and heist-movie architecture, the film won over audiences, and&nbsp;Rudd’s fanboy enthusiasm as Scott Lang has been a welcome addition in all his appearances since.&nbsp;All that&nbsp;wide-eyed cheer came in handy with the heavy Avengers: Endgame, and with that saga now complete, we’re celebrating with the best Paul Rudd movies! And then the worst!#51Halloween - The Curse of Michael Myers (Halloween 6) (1995) 9%#51Adjusted Score: 10.649% Critics Consensus: Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers trades the simple, brutal effectiveness of the original for convoluted mysticism, with disastrously dull results.Synopsis: Picking up six years after the events of Halloween 5: The Revenge of Michael Myers, this competently produced but ultimately...

But even when Pratt did break into the movies, his early filmography was mostly littered with secondary roles in comedies like Bride Wars, Jennifer’s Body, and Take Me Home Tonight. But Pratt is one to take things on the chin — literally, as he did in Wanted.It was his role as Andy in NBC’s Parks and Recreation that gave him stability and steady visibility. The stars aligned for a legendary 2014 where he helped make two of the unlikeliest movies connect with audiences and critics: a space opera featuring talking trees and raccoons, and an emotionally affecting movie about sentient toy blocks. Pratt’s involvment with Marvel, LEGO, and then later the Jurassic franchise means he has your childhood pop culture and nostalgia under lock, and his&nbsp;role in Pixar’s Onward&nbsp;has the potential to become a sentimental favorite for a new generation.

Welcome to the 140 essential movies of the ’70s.The two moods we aimed to capture in this countdown: The wilting of ’60s flower power optimism under the harsh light of urban reality and decay; meanwhile the destruction of the musty Hays Code — a musty ruleset that dictated what could be depicted on-screen for decades — suddenly allowing directors to pursue more personal expressions in film, often violent and sexual. You’ll find stories of lone men (Taxi Driver, Dog Day Afternoon) and women (Wanda, Norma Rae) against the system, and paranoid political thrillers (All the President’s Men, Three Days of the Condor). There are the horror hallmarks (Alien, Halloween) including international (Suspiria, Deep Red), and box office game changers (Star Wars, Jaws). Low-budget exploitation (The Last House on the Left, Mad Max), and a few things a willing warped mind can get off on (The Man Who Fell to Earth, The Holy Mountain). All movies considered for this list needed to have a Tomatometer (after 5 reviews) and have been made during the decade, even if it didn’t get a major release until later, e.g. Hausu or Killer of Sheep.Now, let’s strut them mean streets, let’s do the time warp again, let’s have ourselves a close encounter with 140 essential 70s movies!More Essential Movies By Decade1980s | 1990s | 2000s#140The Last House on the Left (1972) 62%#140Adjusted Score: 66.516% Critics Consensus: Its visceral brutality is more repulsive than engrossing, but The Last House on the Left nevertheless introduces director Wes Craven as a distinctive voice in horror.Synopsis: Based on Bergman's The Virgin Spring, Wes Craven's cult classic is an account of a group of sadistic killers who...

Whether it was a rom-com like 10 Things I Hate About You, a biting satire like Election, a bawdy sex romp like American Pie, or a darkly comic drama like Cruel Intentions, there was a little something for everyone, and several of them went on to develop cult followings that hold strong to this day.\nThis year, all of those films celebrate their 20th anniversary, and to mark the occasion, we decided to take a quick little jog down memory lane and look at the whole batch of 1999 teen movies to see how they rank against each other.

Then you were wise to visit Rotten Tomatoes, because we’re presenting our guide to the best comedies of 2018, ranked by Tomatometer! (We’re also including the worst comedies of 2018, so you know what to avoid, or if you’re in for a chuckle of a different variety.) We’ve included only movies that have at least 20 reviews, and that have comedy as&nbsp;their primary genre. That includes certain superhero fare (thanks for the levity Deadpool and Ant-Man!), though we avoided animation and most family movies (sorry, Paddington 2, this is one list you wont dominate). But if you were a comedy-drama, you pretty much made the list, even if the drama managed to take over in the end; you’ll see the likes of Eighth Grade and Blindspotting at the top. But don’t worry, there was plenty of space for everything in-between: the frat comedy (Blockers), rom-coms (Crazy Rich Asians), star vehicles (Tully), and even a touch of the political (Death of Stalin).#55In a Relationship (2018) 60%#55Adjusted Score: 41.441% Critics Consensus: No consensus yet.Synopsis: Owen &amp; Hallie spent the first half of their twenties together, and now they're hitting a wall.

Film cameras were the standard way to shoot a movie for over a century, and now they to had to make space for upstart digital. Without digital cameras, zombies would’ve stayed dead; 28 Days Later was only possible with how quick and easy it is to set up with them. Sofia Coppola (Lost in Translation) and Neill Blomkamp (District 9) certainly benefited from the new technology.Movies were also used to absorb our collective trauma. We escaped into magic and wonder in the months after 9/11 with Harry Potter and The Lord of the Rings, while we celebrated the end of the Great Recession by getting the hell off this planet with Avatar. And speaking of those series, we didn’t want their installments&nbsp;taking&nbsp;up all the spots on this list, so one movie representing the whole franchise was chosen for those worthy.And your vast comic-book trivia knowledge became a social asset, not a bullseye for beatings. Iron Man, The Dark Knight, and&nbsp;Spider-Man 2 opened up new ways of connected storytelling (and money making). And it wasn’t just superheroes making the leap to the mainstream. Fanboy culture, the internet, and sites like the one you’re reading now helped bring “genre” movies to the cultural forefront: zombies (28 Days Later, Shaun of the Dead), sci-fi (Avatar, Serenity), horror (The Descent, Saw), and fantasy (Pan’s Labyrinth).Meanwhile, under-served voices started to make some noise in the mainstream with films led by females (Mean Girls, Whale Rider, Bend It Like Beckham, Twilight), made African-American filmmakers (Love &amp; Basketball, Barbershop), and featuring Asian-American stars (Harold &amp; Kumar Go to White Castle, Better Luck Tomorrow). And that’s not including the increasingly easy access to international material like City of God and Let the Right One In.And we still haven’t touched upon Pixar’s golden age (WALL-E, Finding Nemo), Hollywood finding the formula for comedies perfectly balanced between smart and dumb (The Hangover, The 40-Year Old Virgin), or that the&nbsp;Fast &amp; Furious&nbsp;series got its humble beginnings here.

Jackman will forever be associated with the self-healing mutant with the adamantium claws, and now that he’s officially done playing the character, good luck to whoever attempts to fill his shoes next.Outside of the X-Men universe, though, Jackman has also proven to be a multi-faceted leading man, starring in romantic comedies (Kate &amp; Leopold, Scoop), sweeping adventures (Australia, Pan), family films (Happy Feet, Real Steel), musicals (Les Misérables, The Greatest Showman), mysteries (The Prestige, Prisoners), and just about everything in between. It’s no wonder some of the biggest directors working today, from Christopher Nolan to Darren Aronofsky to Denis Villeneuve, have sought his talents for their films.

Our ranking includes the Friday release’s Netflix brethren The Haunting of Hill House, which is Certified Fresh at 92% (with 63 reviews of season 1) and lands at No. 9 on our list of 100 binge-worthy horror shows.\nBut choosing the best ever horror TV show can make your eyes twitch and head spin until you take a chainsaw to your computer — debating whether Lucifer belongs in the horror genre or is more of a crime procedural finally put us over the edge.\nFor one, horror bleeds into so many other genres; it sometimes dabbles in star-crossed romance like in HBO’s True Blood and conjures the dark humor of Starz’s Ash vs. Evil Dead. It even takes a stab at social commentary through the FX anthology American Horror Story. And, for a genre that so often portrays death and carnage, it has an amazing ability to endure – even if shows like CBS classic The Twilight Zone don’t make today’s audiences kick over their TV-dinner trays as much as it did their parents and grandparents. Horror even brings cultures together, as evidenced by Netflix’s popular German sci-fi thriller Dark, Indian series Ghoul, and director Lars von Trier’s Danish mini-series Riget (The Kingdom). These and many more shows are on this list.\nYou may wonder why we slashed others: The blue-eyed Night King and his ilk are certainly terrifying on HBO’s Game of Thrones, but with those dragons and Red priestesses, “best horror TV show”? Not exactly. GoT falls more into the fantasy category. The Magicians, Dead Like Me, and Lost Girl met the same fate. Similarly, Black Mirror falls under sci-fi; in fact, it turns up as No. 9 on our list of the “100 Best Sci-Fi TV Shows of All Time.” True-crime documentaries and dramas — like Netflix’s Making a Murderer or its serial killer drama Mindhunter — are left off this list even if the acts depicted there are more terrifying than anything we might see on AMC’s zombie series The Walking Dead (which, of course, is included).\nTo rank the scary TV shows in this monster list, we took the critics’ Tomatometer score (where available) into consideration, plus the rankings of a number of reputable “best of” lists, and then applied some editorial discretion, asking ourselves which horror TV series have stood the test of time, inspired spin-offs and copycats, and even made their influence known on the big screen. We also had a look at your own audience scores on each of the series.\nRead on to find out if Lucifer made the cut.\nDisagree about our exclusion of The Magicians? Or did we miss another title you think should be included?

Those sightless days of people reaching out and bumping into movies at random, like wandering through a Blockbuster with all the lights off.&nbsp;Those were dark and undirected times.&nbsp;Since the&nbsp;launch of RT in August of 1998, though – the site went live on August 18 of that year –&nbsp;movie fans have&nbsp;had immediate access to the largest accumulation of film reviews ever, distilled for one purpose: to get you watching the best kind of movies you want to see. (Or if you only want to watch bad movies, the site can help you find those more quickly, too.)\nAs we mark our 20th birthday, we’re looking&nbsp;back on the past two decades with this&nbsp;guide&nbsp;to the 200 best-reviewed movies released since that fateful day in August of 1998. To keep the competition tight, we only included movies that had at least 80 reviews, the number at which wide-release movies qualify for Certified Fresh status; applying that rule, and limiting the total list to 200 titles, the lowest Tomatometer score you’ll find is 95%. The criteria also meant that no&nbsp;films from 1998 made the cut (Shakespeare in Love&nbsp;did come awfully close).\nThe list, which we’ve ordered chronologically, runs the gamut of movies, ranging from popular blockbusters (Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part II, The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers) to indies (The Wrestler, Nightcrawler) and the still underseen (Step, Gloria). Some 14 movies come from this very year made the list, among them Mission: Impossible – Fallout and&nbsp;BlacKkKlansman.&nbsp;There are&nbsp;seven Best Picture Oscar winners and 24 animated movies in there – 10 of which are Pixar products, and three of which come from the UK’s Aardman Animations. Documentaries make up a whopping quarter of the movies listed, and include landmark films like&nbsp;Bowling For Columbine and&nbsp;Man On Wire,&nbsp;while 53 of the movies listed are foreign-language, including&nbsp;Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, and the first film on the list,&nbsp;Pedro Almodóvar‘s&nbsp;All About My Mother.&nbsp;\nA number of directors show up twice on the list – Ava DuVernay, Taika Waititi, Ryan Coogler,&nbsp;and Sean Baker among&nbsp;them – and a handful show up even more than that: Lee Unkrich, Pete Docter, Brad Bird, and Richard Linklater.&nbsp;Meanwhile,&nbsp;series like the&nbsp;Paddington,&nbsp;Before, and&nbsp;Toy Story&nbsp;films appear more than once, along with both films in The&nbsp;Act of Killing/The&nbsp;Look of Silence&nbsp;documentary pairing feature.\nSo: 200 movies, 20 years. How many have you seen after all this time? And how many are you adding to your watchlist?\n\n        \n            #200\n            \n              \n                  \n              \n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                          All About My Mother (Todo sobre mi madre) (1999)  98%\n                        \n                    \n                    \n                        #200\n                    \n                \n                \n                    \n                        Adjusted Score: 101.659% \n                        Critics Consensus: Almodovar weaves together a magnificent tapestry of femininity with an affectionate wink to classics of theater and cinema in this poignant story of love, loss and compassion.\n                        Synopsis: Pedro Almodóvar directed this story of a woman and her circle of friends who find themselves suffering a variety of...

After surviving the original night of terror against Michael Myers in the original 1977 Halloween, she has entered the slipstream of alternate timelines, at points lighting him on fire, decapitating him, or getting thrown off a roof by him. Meanwhile, other Halloween movies have her institutionalized, or shot dead by the police. One even ignores her existence completely, offering annoying TV commercial jingles and magic Stonehenge rocks in her place. (That was Halloween III: Season of the Witch by the way.)But with the latest Halloween fresh in theaters (and Certified Fresh on Rotten Tomatoes), Jamie Lee Curtis returns to her roots with this no-holds-barred version of Laurie, along with producer John Carpenter and original Myers player Nick Castle.

And actors love playing them: They get to show off an expanded range of talent, and so many musicians’ lives are filled with drama and passion. As the term implies, the biopics on this list are all based on real people across an expanse of styles: rock (Sid &amp; Nancy, Control), country (Coal Miner’s Daughter, Walk the Line), hip-hop (Straight Outta Compton), pop (Selena, Love &amp; Mercy), classical (Amadeus), and beyond. The only exception we made was for 8 Mile: Though the names were changed, the fact that the main character – a Marshall Mathers stand-in – was played by the original Marshall Mathers demanded its inclusion. After that, every movie with a Fresh rating is sorted by Adjusted Tomatometer to give us the definitive ranking of the best movies made about musicians.Let’s take it from the top, and this time with feeling: Play on for the best-reviewed music biopic movies!#50Immortal Beloved (1994) 56%#50Adjusted Score: 59.188% Critics Consensus: No consensus yet.Synopsis: This biography of Ludwig von Beethoven (played here by Gary Oldman) builds its narrative around an actual letter found after...

They’re nostalgic movies you can’t separate from memories of watching the leaves turn, the snow fall, and coming together with your family over warm food and even warmer drinks.The end of the year is a time of reflection and appreciation, and the holiday movies chosen for this list reflect our most hopeful side – whether it’s seeing Scrooge’s redemption (there’s no shortage of Christmas Carol adaptations here!), the salvation of George Bailey in It’s a Wonderful Life, or Charlie Brown’s conquest of melancholia in his legendary Christmas special.Meanwhile, other movies picked here are simply good-natured fare with plenty of snowy moments, like Cool Runnings, Eight Below, and Paddington.

But for everyone else, it was the future, changing the movie culture landscape on every level: How and what gets made, how they’re released, and, yes, how they’re merchandized. A space opera for all ages, Lucas closed out this original trilogy with the biggest twists (Empire Strikes Back) and the cuddliest endgame battle (Return of the Jedi).Over 20 years later, Lucas returned with the prequel trilogy that went deep into Force mechanics and far towards space politics. And nearly another 20 years after that, the so-called sequel trilogy started up, reuniting old friends and plot devices for the nostalgic blockbuster touchstone The Force Awakens. That was followed by the foundation-shaking Last Jedi, and the action-packed fan service machine The Rise of Skywalker, which is now the second-lowest–rated Star Wars film, according to the Tomatometer.With the 42-year spanning Skywalker Saga now complete, we’re ranking every movie in the franchise!

What are the critics saying?The Invisible Man (2020)  91%Once upon a time, Universal Pictures had plans for a so-called “Dark Universe,” in which the studio hoped to reboot all of its classic monster movies and bring the characters together in a united storyline akin to the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Unfortunately, after the mediocre performance of 2014’s Dracula Untold prompted a soft reset of the franchise, 2017’s&nbsp;The Mummy&nbsp;officially halted those plans when it also debuted to dismal&nbsp;box office returns and even worse reviews, forcing Universal to rethink their strategy entirely. The solution? Stick to standalone films, at least for the time being. That brings us to this week’s&nbsp;The Invisible Man, a new take on the classic H.G. Wells novel that shifts the focus from the titular character to the woman he terrorizes. Elisabeth Moss is the woman in question, an architect trapped in an abusive relationship with a brilliant but controlling scientist, who finally finds the courage to flee the relationship, only to learn her ex has committed suicide. Or has he? Is he the one stalking her from the shadows and breathing down her neck? And if he is, who will believe her? Critics say&nbsp;The Invisible Man is a smartly written thriller that tackles timely themes but also provides sufficient spectacle, and it benefits from a magnetic performance from Moss in the lead. The Dark Universe may be no more, but if Universal continues to make films of this caliber, they may be onto something after all.Also&nbsp;Opening This Week In Limited Release Blood on Her Name (2020) ,&nbsp;a thriller about a woman who covers up an accidental killing and then decides to deliver the dead body to the man’s family, is at 100%.

With that in mind,&nbsp;our list of new releases this week includes Christopher Nolan’s latest mind-bender, a live-action Disney remake, and a unique thriller from the mind of Charlie Kaufman. Plus, we’ll also take a brief look at two other recent releases. See below for details.Tenet (2020) 70%After months of uncertainty, with lots of cineplexes across the U.S. still closed, we finally had our first “major” new theatrical releases last week, with&nbsp;The New Mutants and&nbsp;Bill &amp; Ted Face the Music, the latter of which, it should be noted, also premiered on VOD. But this week, we have arguably the most anticipated film of the year, from one of the most popular, most celebrated directors of the new millennium, and you can only see it in theaters. That film is, of course, Christopher Nolan’s Tenet, a heady sci-fi thriller that stars John David Washington, Robert Pattinson, Kenneth Branagh, and Elizabeth Debicki and, like a number of Nolan’s previous films, plays with the concept of time. If you’re fan of Nolan’s work, you don’t need to know any more than that; you’re already in. If you’re not a fan, though, or you aren’t as familiar with his narrative and thematic proclivities, well, you’re in for a doozy, as critics say&nbsp;Tenet is ambitious, extravagant, and a little difficult to decipher. If you don’t mind a smidge of puzzlement — and if you’re willing to brave the movie theater experience — you’ll likely find yourself sufficiently intrigued and entertained, even if some of the more spectacular stuff here feels like a remix of Nolan’s greatest hits.Mulan (2020) 72%Christopher Nolan stuck to his guns and insisted that&nbsp;Tenet would play in theaters, and Warner Bros. had a hell of a time trying to figure out the best way to respect Nolan’s wishes. Disney’s live-action remake of&nbsp;Mulan, however, chose not to follow suit, opting instead to premiere on the Disney+ streaming service… for a premium fee. This is, of course, the latest in the Mouse House’s efforts to reimagine&nbsp;some of their most beloved animated classics as live-action films, and unlike some of their recent attempts,&nbsp;Mulan is impressing the critics so far. Liu Yifei stars in the title role as a young woman who dresses as a man in order to represent her family in the Chinese imperial army, and the reviews say she offers a charismatic performance that holds the film together. They also say the action choreography is fantastic, the visuals are stunning, and the choice to eschew the original film’s musical elements in favor of a more grounded action-drama results in a more mature film. The youngest viewers may not find Niki Caro’s film as compelling, but you can always throw on the colorful animated original for them.Available on Disney+ for $29.99 on September 4; available to all Disney+ subscribers on December 4.I'm Thinking of Ending Things (2020) 82%It’s true that Netflix has poured unspeakable amounts of money into crafting and curating genre fare for its binge-hungry subscribers, but they’ve also gone out of their way to court some unique voices. Sometimes those two goals are achieved in a single film, which is what we have this week in&nbsp;I’m Thinking of Ending Things, a psychological horror drama written and directed by Charlie Kaufman, the man who thought up Being John Malkovich, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, and Anomalisa. Unlike his best-known projects,&nbsp;I’m Thinking of Ending Things is actually an adaptation of a novel by Iain Reid, in which a young man (here played by Jesse Plemons) takes his girlfriend (Jessie Buckley) home to meet his parents (Toni Collette and David Thewlis), unaware that she is, well, thinking of ending things. What begins as a relatively somber relationship drama devolves into mind-bending terror as nothing is quite as it seems, and while critics concede that this isn’t likely to win any new converts to the Church of Kaufman, those who appreciate his style will note his signature touches and his peculiar flair for the weird and inscrutable. You’ll get plenty of twists and turns, some dark, existential discomfort, and probably a bit of confusion, but that’s kind of par for the course when it comes to Kaufman’s work.&nbsp;At the end of the day, you can always find something a little sunnier to chase it with.Available on Netflix on September 4.Also currently released and available: 83% Bill &amp; Ted Face the Music (2020) , in which Keanu Reeves and Alex Winter return as the titular duo of naively optimistic, well-meaning buffoons who must now write a most excellent song to save the world with the help of their teenage daughters. Currently available on VOD and playing in select theaters. 35% The New Mutants (2020) , starring Charlie Heaton, Anya Taylor-Joy, Maisie Williams, and a young cast of would-be X-Men who are confined to an institution in this famously delayed horror-themed interpretation of the titular comic book series.

With that in mind,&nbsp;our list of digital new releases this week includes a fresh-from-the-theaters Pixar movie, the latest&nbsp;Star Wars adventure, a Razzie-winning Broadway adaptation, and a trio of brand new theatrical releases that&nbsp;are being made digitally available way ahead of schedule. See below for the most notable titles hitting VOD this week.The Invisible Man (2020)  91%It was just three weeks ago that we saw the release of&nbsp;The Invisible Man, Universal Pictures’ updated take on the classic H.G. Wells novel, starring Elisabeth Moss. However, in light of the recent global crisis, the studio has opted to make a handful of its latest theatrical releases available to would-be moviegoers who are self-quarantined at home, and this is the biggest of them. Moss stars as Cecilia Kass, who flees the home of her abusive ex and learns soon after that he has committed suicide. Except that he might not have, and now Cecilia has to figure out if she’s really imagining things, or if it’s possible he actually invented a way to make himself invisible. It’s a timely story that’s well-crafted, and it impressed critics enough to become the best-reviewed horror film of the year so far. If you didn’t get a chance to see it before the theaters closed, it should be available for digital rental on Friday.Available now&nbsp;on: FandangoNOW,&nbsp;Amazon,&nbsp;Google Play, iTunes, VuduOnward (2020)  88%Following Universal’s example, Walt Disney Studios has also decided to release one of its most recent theatrical films into the digital marketplace just a couple of weeks after it opened. Pixar’s&nbsp;Onward features the voices of a couple of MCU stars, Tom Holland and Chris Pratt, as a pair of elf brothers living in a suburbanized fantasy world where magic has been rendered obsolete by technology.&nbsp;When Ian is gifted the means to resurrect his dead father for 24 hours on his 16th birthday, he inadvertently only summons the bottom half, so he and Barley set out on a road trip to rediscover the magic they’ll need to bring back the rest of their dad before time runs out. Though it isn’t being hailed as an instant classic,&nbsp;Onward still earned enough acclaim to be Certified Fresh, and if you’re looking for something new to watch with your stir-crazy kids, you can pay to watch it today or wait for it to drop on the Disney+ streaming service on April 3.Available now&nbsp;on:&nbsp;FandangoNOW,&nbsp;Google Play,&nbsp;iTunes,&nbsp;VuduAvailable Friday, April 3 on: Disney+Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker (2019)  51%Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker had a lot riding on its shoulders. Not only was it the conclusion of the recent sequel trilogy in the&nbsp;Star Wars universe, but it was meant to wrap up the entirety of the so-called Skywalker Saga itself, which began with the original film all the way back in 1977. If that weren’t enough, writer/director J.J. Abrams also had to contend with upended expectations from Rian Johnson’s&nbsp;The Last Jedi even as he attempted to tie up over four decades of storytelling in one film. Did Abrams succeed?&nbsp;Critics loved&nbsp;The Last Jedi but didn’t care much for&nbsp;The Rise of Skywalker, and audiences had pretty much the opposite reaction, so it’s probably safe to say both directors’ efforts landed somewhere in the middle. The story catches up with our new galactic heroes and some old, familiar faces as they face off against an evil from the past and chart a new course for the future. This one dropped earlier this week, so you can properly binge the entire saga at home now.Available now on: FandangoNOW,&nbsp;Amazon,&nbsp;Google Play, iTunes, VuduCats (2019)  19%Even if there was never a “butthole cut” of the film,&nbsp;Cats still managed to capture the moviegoing public’s morbid curiosity, what with its nonsensical “plot,” its peculiar A-list cameos, and its reportedly horrifying special effects, and it even succeeded in impressing a handful of critics, even as it baffled countless others.&nbsp;If you’re one of those people who wondered what the fuss was about, but not enough to pay theater prices to see it, you can now gather up a group of friends and host a watch party. Whether or not you choose to remain sober for the multiple Razzie Award winner — Seth Rogen chose not to — is up to you, but results may vary.Available now on:&nbsp;FandangoNOW,&nbsp;Amazon,&nbsp;Google Play,&nbsp;iTunes,&nbsp;VuduThe Hunt (2020)  57%After just one week in theaters, the “liberal elites hunt deplorables” movie&nbsp;The Hunt, which ultimately isn’t as controversial as it thinks it is, will be available to watch from the comfort of your nonpartisan couch.&nbsp;It’s kind of a fitting culmination of several months of delays for the movie, which was pulled from its initial release date in September of 2019 amid a pair of deadly mass shootings and rescheduled for the same opening weekend — last weekend, to be precise — when strict social distancing measures went into effect pretty much everywhere. That said, the chances of getting into heated political debates over the film are probably much slimmer if you’re watching it at home with your friends, so maybe that works in the movie’s favor. As one of the three titles Universal announced for early digital access,&nbsp;The Hunt is expected to be available on Friday.Available now&nbsp;on:&nbsp;FandangoNOW,&nbsp;Amazon,&nbsp;Google Play,&nbsp;iTunes,&nbsp;VuduSeven Stages to Achieve Eternal Bliss (2020)  65%This small, indie comedy didn’t get a very wide release, so it’s exactly the kind of film that should benefit from a more robust home market for the foreseeable future. Kate Micucci and Sam Huntington star in&nbsp;Seven Stages to Achieve Eternal Bliss as a married couple in whose home a local cult leader (played by Taika Waititi) previously&nbsp;killed himself in the bathtub. Inspired by his actions, his followers begin breaking into the house to copy his death, and the couple soon find themselves the unwitting facilitators of ritual suicide. It’s a pitch-black comedy that screened in just a few theaters at the beginning of march, and it’s available now on a few VOD platforms.Available now on:&nbsp;Amazon,&nbsp;Google Play,&nbsp;VuduHuman Capital (2020)  68%This film is the only one this week that is available digitally and also&nbsp;technically scheduled to open in theaters, although the cineplex closures will probably affect the latter and relegate the film strictly to the former. Marisa Tomei and Liev Schreiber star in this remake of the 2014 Italian film of the same name about two families whose lives become connected after a tragedy. Its gotten decent reviews so far, and its impressive supporting cast includes Peter Sarsgaard, Alex Wolff, and Maya Hawke. It was set to open in theaters and be available on VOD on Friday.Available now&nbsp;on:&nbsp;FandangoNOW,&nbsp;Amazon,&nbsp;Google Play,&nbsp;iTunes,&nbsp;VuduEmma. (2020)  87%The third and likely least well-known film that Universal is making available for an early digital release is Autumn de Wilde’s new interpretation of the classic Jane Austen novel&nbsp;Emma. Anya Taylor-Joy stars as the titular matchmaker, who&nbsp;discovers that maybe she’s not as good at bringing people together as she thought she was, all while her own romance bubbles up and takes her by surprise, and critics have been delighted by the film to the tune of a Certified Fresh 85% Tomatometer score. This one has been in theaters for longer than the other films, but it wasn’t in many, so now’s your chance to check it out at home.Available now&nbsp;on:&nbsp;FandangoNOW,&nbsp;Google Play,&nbsp;iTunes,&nbsp;VuduThumbnail images by Walt Disney Pictures and Universal Pictures","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"series, Shudder, Ovation, versus, halloween, Seed, Comics, marvel, TV","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/20105716/Onward-Invisible-Skywalker-CC_Rep.jpg","slug":"the-invisible-man-star-wars-the-rise-of-skywalker-and-cats-hit-digital-release-this-week"},{"id":"47508733920511","title":"The Hunt Isn’t as Wild as It Thinks","content":"Critics Consensusvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})The Hunt Isn't as Wild as It ThinksPlus, Bloodshot is a (franchise) non-starter, I Still Believe is earnest but sanitized, and Never Rarely Somtimes Always is Certified Fresh.by Ryan Fujitani | March 12, 2020 |  CommentsThis week at the movies, we’ve got&nbsp;evil elites (The Hunt,&nbsp;starring&nbsp;Betty Gilpin&nbsp;and&nbsp;Hilary Swank), a&nbsp;super soldier (Bloodshot, starring&nbsp;Vin Diesel&nbsp;and&nbsp;Guy Pearce),&nbsp;and&nbsp;a&nbsp;Christian courtship (I Still Believe, starring&nbsp;K.J. Apa&nbsp;and&nbsp;Britt Robertson). What are the critics saying?The Hunt (2020)  57%Author Richard Connell’s 1924 short story&nbsp;The Most Dangerous Game, in which a big-game hunter is hunted by a Russian aristocrat on a remote island, has been adapted for the screen several times since its publication, and more than a few of those films have taken creative liberties with the source material. In 1972’s&nbsp;The Woman Hunt, there were multiple victims, and they were all women;&nbsp;1987’s&nbsp;Slave Girls from Beyond Infinity set the action in space; and 1993’s&nbsp;Hard Target&nbsp;gave us Jean-Claude Van Damme in a mullet. The latest alternate take on the story comes to us via&nbsp;The Hunt, which casts a gaggle of insufferable “liberal elites” as the hunters and a dozen “deplorables” as their prey. Originally slated for release in September of 2019, the film was delayed in the wake of mass shootings in Dayton, OH and El Paso, TX, as well as some high-profile backlash from none other than Donald Trump himself. Presumably, the dust has settled enough that Universal feels comfortable releasing the film, and critics say it’s kind of a mixed bag. Taken on its own merits as an action thriller infused with pitch-black comedy, it’s not bad, but its efforts to skewer the political divide largely miss the mark, resulting in clumsy attempts at social satire and exaggerated caricatures that are difficult for anyone to relate to.&nbsp;GLOW star Betty Gilpin handles herself admirably in the central heroic role, and there’s plenty of blood and guts to go around on all sides, but if there’s anything to get riled up about here, it’s that the end result wasn’t a smarter movie.Bloodshot (2020)  30%Marvel and DC obviously aren’t the only two purveyors of comic book fare around, but they are the most popular, so it’s easy to forget there are others out there trying to get a piece of the superhero franchise pie. Enter Valiant Comics’&nbsp;Bloodshot, a&nbsp;marine&nbsp;who is brutally murdered but brought back to life by scientists hoping to create a super-soldier with the help of nanotechnology. Vin Diesel stars in the big-screen adaptation as Ray Garrison, the marine in question, who at first struggles to recall anything from his past life, but once he does, he embarks on a bloody mission of vengeance. Diesel already has a few action franchises under his belt, including the&nbsp;Chronicles of Riddick movies, the&nbsp;xXx movies, and, of course, the hugely popular&nbsp;Fast and Furious series, and&nbsp;Bloodshot&nbsp;is ostensibly an attempt to jump-start another. Unfortunately, while critics say Diesel is fairly compelling as the anti-hero here and Guy Pearce plays his role as the mad scientist with relish, neither is quiet capable of compensating for the film’s over-reliance on shopworn action cliches and bland CGI spectacle. That said, it may appeal to undemanding&nbsp;audiences in search of little more than a few cheap thrills.I Still Believe (2020)  51%It’s no secret that faith-based films have a fairly spotty track record when it comes to critical reception, but they frequently rely on ham-fisted narratives built&nbsp;upon performances of varying quality. At the very least,&nbsp;this week’s&nbsp;I Still Believe benefits from the presence of stars like&nbsp;Britt Robertson,&nbsp;Riverdale‘s K.J. Apa, and Gary Sinise, and instead of swinging wildly at rhetorical straw men, the film takes its cues from a true story, namely that of Christian music megastar Jeremy Camp. Based on his memoir of the same name, the film follows the singer-songwriter as he moves from Indiana to California for college and falls in love with his first wife, Melissa Lynn Henning. Not long after, Melissa is diagnosed with terminal cancer, and the couple decide to face the grim diagnosis together. While critics aren’t calling&nbsp;I Still Believe a triumph in filmmaking, they aren’t saying it’s a complete disaster either. It has its moments of affecting drama, and the more hopeful elements of the story can be inspiring. At the same time, the film is so sanitized that it’s somewhat robbed of its humanity, and like many faith-based films before it, it caters so specifically to a niche audience that few outside that circle are likely to find it a worthwhile watch.Also&nbsp;Opening This Week In Limited Release Never Rarely Sometimes Always (2020) ,&nbsp;a drama about&nbsp;two girls in rural Pennsylvania who travel to New York to end an unwanted pregnancy, is Certified Fresh at 100%.

With that in mind,&nbsp;our list of digital new releases this week includes an animated adventure and a crime drama that both premiered on VOD. See below for details.Scoob! (2020)  48%Back in early April, Universal’s Trolls World Tour became the first major movie of the year to largely forego a theatrical release (due to widespread theater closures) and premiere simultaneously&nbsp;on VOD, and it became a notable streaming success for the studio. It wasn’t long after that we learned Warner Bros. would do the same for its own animated offering, a reboot of the Scooby-Doo gang called&nbsp;Scoob!, and that film is available today. The story recounts how Scooby-Doo, voiced by longtime vet Frank Welker, first met his best pal Shaggy (Will Forte) and teamed up with Fred (Mark Wahlberg), Daphne (Amanda Seyfried), and Velma (Gina Rodriguez) to solve mysteries, and then dives into their latest challenge as they attempt to discover the secret behind a ghostly dog. Fans of the live-action adaptations of the early 2000s bemoaned the exclusion of Matthew Lillard as the voice of Shaggy, but critics say that’s the least of their worries here. While Scoob!&nbsp;is enjoyable enough for longtime&nbsp;Scooby-Doo followers and young viewers, it doesn’t offer much outside of its updated computer animation to set it apart from the classic series on which it’s based. In other words, it’s another disposable family adventure that goes down easily enough but won’t leave much of a lasting impact.Available&nbsp;now on: FandangoNOW,&nbsp;Vudu,&nbsp;Amazon,&nbsp;Google Play,&nbsp;iTunesCapone (2020)  40%After his breakout debut feature&nbsp;Chronicle, it seemed like writer-director Josh Trank was poised to become a part of the next wave of hotshot filmmakers groomed to take on big Hollywood films. He got that opportunity with his next movie, Fox’s attempt to reboot&nbsp;Fantastic Four, and, well, it bombed rather spectacularly, which also led to his leaving a planned&nbsp;Star Wars standalone film. This week, however, Trank resurfaced with his latest, a crime drama centered on the final years of notorious mobster Al Capone’s life, with a heavily made-up Tom Hardy in the lead role. Positioned as Trank’s reentry to the mainstream,&nbsp;Capone catches up with its anti-hero at the age of 47, just as he’s released from a decade-long stint in prison and suffering from dementia. As he slowly succumbs to his condition, he attempts to remember the location of a secret stash of money he hid on his property. Critics say&nbsp;Capone is some of the most challenging work Hardy has taken on in recent memory, and he commits his all to it, but the material surrounding him is shoddily crafted and full of bizarre directorial choices. Linda Cardellini sparks some life into the proceedings as Capone’s put-upon wife Mae, and the supporting cast includes capable actors like Matt Dillon, Kyle McLachlan, and Jack Lowden, but there’s a lot going on in this film, and there just isn’t enough to hold it all together coherently.Available now&nbsp;on:&nbsp;FandangoNOW,&nbsp;Vudu,&nbsp;Amazon,&nbsp;Google Play,&nbsp;iTunesThumbnail image by Warner Bros.

With that in mind,&nbsp;our list of digital new releases this week includes the premiere of an animated sequel and the home entertainment debuts of a pair of horror films, a comedy misfire, and a martial arts franchise finale, not to mention the free streaming premiere of the most recent Best Picture winner. See below for the full list.Trolls World Tour (2020)  71%It may have initially been a little hopeful for Universal to announce a so-called “day-and-date” release for&nbsp;Trolls World Tour, meaning that the film would be available both in theaters and on&nbsp;VOD simultatneously, if only because that release date is here, and none of us is going to any movie theaters this weekend. So, for all intents and purposes,&nbsp;TWT is the first major release of 2020 that is only getting a VOD release, which will be an interesting experiment to track as more studios figure out what they want to do with all the films they’ve postponed. (Some have decided to go straight to streaming;&nbsp;The Lovebirds will debut on Netflix, and&nbsp;My Spy will stream on Amazon Prime.) That said, Anna Kendrick and Justin Timberlake are back to provide their voices for trolls Poppy and Branch, who discover that there are other tribes dedicated to different genres of music and must unite them all against the one queen who wants to destroy all the others. Critics so far say this follow-up admittedly feels a little familiar, but it’s got plenty of laughs, plenty of heart, and plenty of music to keep the entire family entertained. It may not be playing in theaters, but that just means you can sing along with your kids at home when they inevitably ask to watch it over and over again.Available Friday, 4/10 on: FandangoNOW,&nbsp;Google Play, VuduGretel &amp; Hansel (2020)  64%We saw a slew of new horror movies debut in the first several weeks of 2020, but the vast majority of them were not well-received by critics.&nbsp;Gretel &amp; Hansel was one of the few exceptions, even as it didn’t exactly earn rave reviews.&nbsp;IT star Sophia Lillis takes center stage as the titular&nbsp;young woman in this dark reimagining of the classic fairy tale, in which a brother and sister are duped into taking part in a lavish feast provided to them by an evil witch living in the forest who has sinister plans for them. Whether or not they felt the liberties taken with the source material worked, most critics nevertheless agreed that the film’s cinematography and visual aesthetic were its greatest strengths, and Alice Krige is properly creepy as the woman who&nbsp;just wants to snack on some children. This one debuted at the tail end of January, and it’s available digitally now.Available now&nbsp;on:&nbsp;FandangoNOW, Amazon,&nbsp;Google Play,&nbsp;iTunes,&nbsp;VuduIp Man 4: The Finale (2019)  84%Martial arts movie fans have known about Donnie Yen for a long time, and though he’s appeared in a few classics of the genre (Iron Monkey,&nbsp;Hero) and some&nbsp;Hollywood productions (Shanghai Knights,&nbsp;Rogue One: A Star Wars Story), he’s probably best known for his films about legendary&nbsp;Wing Chun master Ip Man, which began with 2010’s appropriately titled&nbsp;Ip Man. Almost a full decade later, we got the final chapter to the saga, also appropriately titled, in&nbsp;Ip Man 4: The Finale. Yen again portrays the mild-mannered icon, who travels to San Francisco to help deescalate a simmering feud between local kung fu masters and Ip Man’s most famous student, Bruce Lee. Critics say it doesn’t quite measure up to the best of Donnie Yen’s output, but it’s a satisfying conclusion to a surprisingly consistent franchise with plenty of fun, top-tier action and a suitably bittersweet tone.Available&nbsp;now on:&nbsp;FandangoNOW,&nbsp;Amazon,&nbsp;Google Play,&nbsp;iTunes,&nbsp;VuduLike a Boss (2020)  21%If you&nbsp;told us that pairing up Rose Byrne with Tiffany Haddish and pitting them against a scenery-chewing Salma Hayek would make for a pretty solid comedy, we wouldn’t disagree with that. But just because something makes sense on paper, that doesn’t mean it’ll translate well from page to screen, and that seems to be what happened with&nbsp;Like A Boss. Haddish and Byrne play a pair of besties running a small cosmetics company together who must work through their very different business styles in order to claw their way out of debt and prevent a hostile takeover by an unsavory make-up mogul (Hayek). Critics felt that the cast was fine, doing the best they could with the material they were given, but the writing unfortunately just sharp enough to match their talents. The hit-or-miss jokes mostly miss, the storytelling is paper thin, and there’s no wit underlying its crass veneer. For better or worse, though, it’s available to rent now.Available&nbsp;now on:&nbsp;FandangoNOW,&nbsp;Amazon,&nbsp;Google Play,&nbsp;iTunes,&nbsp;VuduThe Turning (2020)  13%Remember what we said above about terrible horror films in 2020? Well, this is one of them. To be frank, with a Tomatometer score of 12% and an Audience Score of 15%, we’re not sure many of you are going to like it, but it takes all kinds, and if there’s someone out there who’s just been waiting for The Turning to hit the digital home market, then&nbsp;far be it from us to deprive them of it. Mackenzie Davis and Finn Wolfhard star in this new take on the classic Henry James novella&nbsp;The Turn of the Screw that updates the setting to the 1990s and places a young nanny at the mercy of two creepy rich kids. Of course, spooky things begin to happen at their sprawling estate, and it’s unclear if supernatural things are actually happening, or if the nanny is simply going nuts. The source material is famously open-ended, but critics say&nbsp;The Turning takes that to frustrating new lows, blurring the lines between “psychological thriller” and “ghost story” so much that the narrative ceases to make sense.&nbsp;Still, if you’re just super into haunted house movies or you’re a Brooklynn Prince competionist, have at it.Available&nbsp;now on:&nbsp;FandangoNOW,&nbsp;Amazon, Google Play,&nbsp;iTunes,&nbsp;VuduParasite (Gisaengchung) (2019)  98%Lastly, we would be remiss if we didn’t mention that South Korean director Bong Joon-ho’s genre-bending, history-making, Oscar-winning film&nbsp;Parasite is available to stream for anyone with a Hulu account. It has been available for digital rental and purchase for a little while, but now that it’s free, it should be even easier for anyone who was curious to check it out. The story revolves around a family of grifters who weasel their way into the home of a much wealthier family before their lies eventually spin things out of control, but beyond that, it’s best you go into it knowing as little as possible, if it somehow hasn’t been spoiled for you already. The film did win four Oscars (including Best Picture and Best Director), and it has earned the acclaim of both critics and audiences alike, so there’s a pretty good chance you’ll enjoy what you see here.

See below for the full list.Bad Boys for Life (2020)  76%When a film gets a sequel that comes more than a decade and a half after the last installment, with an entirely different creative team behind the camera, it’s usually not&nbsp;something to get excited about. But when the film you’re following is 2003’s&nbsp;Bad Boys II, you don’t have a particularly high bar to clear. Enter co-directors Adil El Arbi and Bilall Fallah, a pair of Belgian filmmakers who stepped up to the challenge and came out with a film that was better than anyone expected. Will Smith and Martin Lawrence are back as Mike Lowry and Marcus Burnett, of course, as is Joe Pantoliano as their captain. This time, Mike needs Marcus’ help when he finds himself in the crosshairs of a cartel boss with ties to his past. Critics said&nbsp;Bad Boys for Life effectively builds upon Michael Bay’s first two films and delivers both spectacular action and the requisite bromantic banter between Smith and Lawrence. It’s a solid action-comedy that mostly delivers everything it promises in style.Available now&nbsp;on: FandangoNOW,&nbsp;Amazon,&nbsp;Google Play, iTunes, VuduSonic the Hedgehog (2020)  63%Before&nbsp;Sonic the Hedgehog debuted, the most interesting thing about the film was probably the fact that, after its first trailer inspired revulsion among fans for its creative interpretation of the&nbsp;titular character’s look, Paramount went back to the drawing board to redo the visuals. Now that it’s come and gone from theaters, though, it’s become notable for a couple of other reasons, namely that it’s now the third best-reviewed video game adaptation ever (behind&nbsp;The Angry Birds Movie 2 and&nbsp;Detective Pikachu) and that it features a rousing Jim Carrey performance that harkens back to his 1990s heyday. Carrey plays the bad guy here, one Dr. Robotnik, who seeks to harness Sonic’s power for evil, which forces Sonic (voiced by Ben Schwartz) to team up with a human pal (James Marsden) so he can&nbsp;locate the magic rings that will help him get back to his home planet. If it sounds a little goofy, well, that’s because it is, but it’s all harmless, good-natured fun that will probably keep the kids occupied while they’re holed up at home.Available now&nbsp;on:&nbsp;FandangoNOW, Amazon,&nbsp;Google Play,&nbsp;iTunes,&nbsp;VuduBrahms: The Boy II (2020)  10%Back in 2016,&nbsp;The Boy only managed a meager 30% on the Tomatometer, and earlier this year, its follow-up&nbsp;Brahms: The Boy II earned a whopping 10%. In other words, if you’re looking for a horror flick about a creepy doll, there are probably much better choices out there to satisfy your craving. As for the rest of you, don’t say we didn’t warn you. Katie Holmes serves as the ostensible anchor for the story this time around, which finds a young family dealing with trauma from a home invasion who decide to move into a new home on the property where the first film took place. Of course, it isn’t long before the family’s young son Jude (Christopher Convery) discovers Brahms the doll buried in the ground, brings him home, and initiates a series of dark, disturbing events that may or may not be tied directly to Brahms. The vast majority of critics found&nbsp;Brahms: The Boy II to be derivative, plodding, and far too tame and predictable to be scary, but if you’re just dying to&nbsp;see it, it’ll be available digitally on Friday.Available Friday, 4/3 on:&nbsp;FandangoNOW,&nbsp;Amazon,&nbsp;Google Play,&nbsp;iTunes,&nbsp;VuduPortrait of a Lady on Fire (Portrait de la jeune fille en feu) (2020)  98%Céline Sciamma’s acclaimed romantic drama didn’t make it to the Oscars this year, but it did get nominated for an Indie Spirit award and a Critics’ Choice Award after winning the Queer Palm and Best Screenplay award at last year’s Cannes Film Festival. Audiences who missed out on seeing it in theaters during its limited run should now be able to catch up on it, as it has been moved up from its original May 12 digital release to this week.&nbsp;Noémie Merlant stars as an artist who is hired to secretly paint the portrait of a reluctant bride-to-be (Adèle Haenel), only to fall in love with the woman. Portrait of a Lady on Fire&nbsp;is a powerfully acted, deeply affecting period piece that&nbsp;is beautifully shot and thoughtfully layered, and it should be a treat for anyone looking to have their heartstrings pulled a bit.Available Friday, 4/3 on:&nbsp;FandangoNOW,&nbsp;Hulu,&nbsp;iTunes,&nbsp;VuduNever Rarely Sometimes Always (2020)  99%Eliza Hittman’s powerful drama opened in theaters just a few weeks ago, right as many of the shelter-in-place orders went into effect, but even if prospective moviegoers hadn’t gone into self-quarantine, it still would have been difficult for many of them to see&nbsp;Never Rarely Sometimes Always, which saw a fairly limited release. The film follows a young woman named Autumn (Sidney Flanigan) and her cousin Skylar (Talia Ryder), who travel from Pennsylvania to New York to end Autumn’s unwanted pregnancy. That in itself may be enough to turn off some viewers, but Hittman wisely avoids further politicizing the inherently political subject, choosing instead to focus solely on the two girls’ journey, portraying their stark reality in matter-of-fact detail. It won’t be an easy watch for many viewers, for different reasons, but it’s a worthwhile one, anchored by a couple of powerful performances from two young and very promising actresses.Available Friday, 4/3 on:&nbsp;FandangoNOW,&nbsp;Amazon,&nbsp;Google Play,&nbsp;iTunes,&nbsp;VuduThumbnail images by Ben Rothstein / © Columbia Pictures","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"rings, books, Grammys, America, York, Awards, SDCC, Funimation, films, TLC","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/02160104/Bad_Boys_For_Life-Box_Office_Rep.jpg","slug":"bad-boys-for-life-and-sonic-the-hedgehog-hit-digital-release-this-week"},{"id":"47508735560965","title":"The Rhythm Section Hits Too Many Familiar Beats","content":"Critics Consensusvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})The Rhythm Section Hits Too Many Familiar BeatsPlus, Gretel &amp; Hansel is visually stunning but slow, and The Assistant and Beanpole are Certified Fresh.by Ryan Fujitani | January 30, 2020 |  CommentsThis week at the movies, we’ve got&nbsp;a woman at war&nbsp;(The Rhythm Section, starring&nbsp;Blake Lively&nbsp;and&nbsp;Jude Law) and a&nbsp;witch in the woods (Gretel &amp; Hansel,&nbsp;starring&nbsp;Sophia Lillis&nbsp;and Alice Krige). What are the critics saying?The Rhythm Section (2020)  28%One of the most notable things about this week’s&nbsp;The Rhythm Section is that it’s only the third non-James Bond film that Eon Productions has ever undertaken, which, all things considered, is&nbsp;rather&nbsp;appropriate, considering it’s also based on a series of novels about a super-spy. The hero in this ostensible franchise-starter is a woman named Stephanie Patrick (Blake Lively), who begins the film as an Oxford grad-turned-junkie prostitute after her family is tragically killed in a plane crash. When a journalist approaches Stephanie with information that the crash was no accident, she sets out on a path of revenge against the terrorists who planned it. Critics say&nbsp;The Rhythm Section&nbsp;earns points for making Stephanie relatable, as she stumbles through her missions the way a novice assassin believably might, but the action feels uninspired and perfunctory, and the screenplay, adapted by Mark Burnell from his own novel, feels like it’s simply going through the motions to get Stephanie from one messy set-piece to the next. The people behind 007 may have been hoping to strike gold with another thrilling franchise, but with little to set the film apart from any number of other revenge/vigilante thrillers like it, there isn’t much left to drive demand for a sequel, let alone an entire series.Gretel &amp; Hansel (2020)  64%We haven’t even spent an entire month in 2020&nbsp;yet, but we’re already getting our fourth big horror release of the&nbsp;year in this week’s&nbsp;Gretel &amp; Hansel. Like last week’s The Turning, this one is also rooted in classic literature, as it offers a new take on the well-known fairy tale by the Brothers Grimm. Sophia Lillis plays 16-year-old Gretel, who, along with her brother Hansel (Samuel Leakey), has been sent into the woods in search of a convent to take them in, since their destitute mother can no longer provide for them. Of course, as anyone familiar with the source material might predict, the pair happen upon a mysterious cabin en route and, tempted by the feast they spy inside, decide to pull up a couple of chairs and hang out with the creepy woman who lives there… and who might be a witch looking to fatten them up and eat them later. Director Oz Perkins is no stranger to horror — his previous films include&nbsp;I Am the Pretty Thing That Lives in the House and&nbsp;The Blackcoat’s Daughter&nbsp;&nbsp;— and he does his best to craft an atmosphere-driven arthouse chiller, but most critics say&nbsp;Gretel &amp; Hansel&nbsp;is far too leisurely paced and devoid of real terror that it loses steam quickly and never quite recovers. There are bright spots here: Sophia Lillis’s acting chops are on full display, Alice Krige is suitably unsettling as Holda the witch, and pretty much everyone — even those who generally didn’t like the film — has nothing but great things to say about the film’s lush imagery and stunning cinematography.&nbsp;Ultimately, though, fans of traditional horror fare may find the film’s deliberate pacing and third-act liberties with the source material a bit too much to swallow.Also&nbsp;Opening This Week In Limited Release Incitement (2020) ,&nbsp;a thriller about an Orthodox Jew in Israel who becomes an extremist activist when Yitzhak Rabin announces the terms of the Oslo Accords in 1993, is at 100%. Beanpole (Dylda) (2020) ,&nbsp;a drama about two young women in Russia trying to rebuild their lives in the wake of World War II, is Certified Fresh at 87%. The Assistant (2020) ,&nbsp;a drama that follows the assistant to a powerful film mogul as she increasingly bears witness to the abusive nature of the industry, is Certified Fresh at 86%. José (2020) ,&nbsp;a romantic drama about a young man living in socially conservative Guatemala City who falls in love with another man, is at 86%. Miss Americana (2020) ,&nbsp;a biographical documentary charting several years in the career of pop music icon Taylor Swift, is at 85%.

What are the critics saying?Doctor Sleep (2019)  78%Stephen King was rather famously&nbsp;unhappy with Stanley Kubrick’s adaptation of his novel&nbsp;The Shining, even if the film went on to be a bona fide classic, beloved by millions of fans who mythologized and analyzed it endlessly. So even with a new novel from King to work with as source material, it was always going to be a daunting task for director Mike Flanagan to adapt&nbsp;Doctor Sleep, a sequel to&nbsp;The Shining, for the big screen almost four decades later. But Flanagan may have proven to be the best choice for the job — he’s a huge Stephen King fan and even wrote one of his own acclaimed horror films (Hush) at the Stanley Hotel, where King was inspired to write&nbsp;The Shining. The end result, according to reviews, is a faithful translation from page to screen — if different from&nbsp;its predecessor&nbsp;—&nbsp;that does a decent job balancing its genre thrills with its more contemplative themes. Ewan McGregor stars in&nbsp;Doctor Sleep as a grown-up Danny Torrance, who offers his help to a teenage girl (Kyliegh Curran) with the same extrasensory “shine” that he possesses. She’s on the run from a nefarious cult known as The True Knot, who seek out others like her and Danny to feed on their special abilities. Critics say the film has its flaws — it plays at times like mere&nbsp;Shining&nbsp;fan service and seems to feel the need to offer too-tidy solutions — but manages to feel both like it’s a part of Kubrick’s vision and a unique beast all its own, with great performances (Rebecca Ferguson in particular, ahem, shines as the villain) and poignant themes that help bring an element of depth to the scares. It’s probably not going to go down as a horror classic, but it’s more than serviceable as an addition to the still-growing list of Stephen King adaptations.Last Christmas (2019)  46%This week brings us our first true holiday film of the season in the form of a Paul Feig romantic comedy starring the Mother of Dragons and the hot guy from Crazy Rich Asians. We’re talking about Emilia Clarke and Henry Golding, respectively, the latter of whom previously worked with Feig on last year’s Certified Fresh&nbsp;A Simple Favor. In Last Christmas,&nbsp;Golding plays another love interest as Tom, the mysterious man who seems to pop up at the most convenient times in the life of an unlucky, self-destructive woman named Kate (Clarke). Kate is a struggling would-be singer who takes a job working at a year-round Christmas shop in London when she runs into Tom, and the two of them begin to fall for each other, as Tom helps Kate put her life back on track. Critics say this piece of holiday magic — co-written by and co-starring Emma Thompson — is certainly aided by the immense likability of its stars, and audiences in search of a feel-good flick will get what they’re looking for. However, the film does fall prey to some cliches commonly found in the genre, and there’s no denying that it all feels like something you might find airing on Lifetime or the Hallmark Channel, with all the requisite cheesiness that implies. Whether or not that’s appealing&nbsp;will be up to the viewer.Midway (2019)  41%Director Roland Emmerich, one of Hollywood’s foremost purveyors of “disaster porn,”&nbsp;isn’t exactly known for his somber filmmaking or nuanced storytelling, so it wouldn’t be unreasonable to presume his cinematic retelling of World War II’s Battle of Midway, aptly titled&nbsp;Midway, would be a grandiose display of explosions and exaggerated human peril. To Emmerich’s credit, the film is more ambitious than that, but reviews so far say its reach far exceeds its grasp. Woody Harrelson and Patrick Wilson headline a testosterone-fueled ensemble cast (Dennis Quaid, Aaron Eckhart, Luke Evans, Ed Skrein, and more) as the story covers the events of Pearl Harbor, the U.S. code-breakers deciphering Japanese communications, and the pivotal titular battle itself, pitting American and Japanese forces against each other in a&nbsp;dramatic naval and aerial conflict. While critics concede Emmerich does his best to portray events in a balanced fashion, they also found that the film, which runs well over two hours, is chock full of stale dialogue and loses its way in a cacophony of special effects-heavy action sequences. There’s a powerful story to be told here about one of the most important battles in American history, but Roland Emmerich may not be quite the right man to tell it, unless you’re looking for an equally trite companion piece to Michael Bay’s&nbsp;Pearl Harbor.Playing with Fire (2019)  23%Being that we here at Rotten Tomatoes are located in California, just miles away from the sites of multiple wildfires, it’s admittedly a little difficult not to cringe a little bit every time we pass by a billboard for&nbsp;Playing with Fire, complete with a smirking John Cena and its flippant tagline — “0% Contained” — emblazoned across it. Thankfully, though the film wasn’t widely screened for critics ahead of time, those who have seen it report that the majority of the action takes place at the fire station, where Cena’s superintendent and fellow smoke-jumpers (played by Keegan-Michael Key and John Leguizamo) are tasked with babysitting a trio of kids they’ve rescued until their missing parents can come pick them up. What results is a broad slapstick comedy that critics say might appeal to the youngest viewers but might grow tiresome for anyone older. Cena, Key, and Leguizamo are reliable comic talents, and with a supporting cast that includes Brianna Hildebrand, Judy Greer, and Dennis Haysbert, there are bound to be some great moments. But the final product is a fairly standard children’s film that makes use of a familiar formula — macho men paired with precocious children — in service of a silly, predictable comedy, and unless you’re part of the target audience, there isn’t a strong chance there’s much for you to see here.Jojo Rabbit (2019)  80%Lastly, we have rather unique film expanding into wider release with quite a bit of buzz surrounding it.&nbsp;Thor: Ragnarok director Taika Waititi‘s Jojo Rabbit&nbsp;is a World War II satire that centers on a young Hitler Youth named Jojo (Roman Griffith Davis) whose imaginary friend happens to be a decidedly less sinister incarnation of&nbsp;Der Führer himself (played by Waititi). When Jojo learns his mother (Scarlett Johansson) is harboring a young Jewish girl in the attic, he’s forced to come to terms with his beliefs and decide what is right. The ensemble cast includes Sam Rockwell, Rebel Wilson, Stephen Merchant, and as the girl seeking refuge, Thomasin McKenzie. Critics admit&nbsp;Jojo Rabbit‘s irreverent treatment of a rather serious subject may not be broadly appealing, but for those in tune with Taika Waititi’s off-kilter sense of humor, it’s a smart, funny, surprisingly sweet comedy that benefits from some strong performances and largely succeeds in communicating its larger themes. It’s a risky, ambitious proposition, for sure, and some moviegoers will find it a little awkward in its execution, but Waititi is nothing if not unconventional, and it would appear he’s accomplished what he set out to do.Also&nbsp;Opening This Week In Limited Release Marriage Story (2019) , starring Scarlett Johansson and Adam Driver in Noah Baumbach‘s drama as an actress-director couple whose marriage slowly disintegrates, is Certified Fresh at 97%. Honey Boy (2019) ,&nbsp;starring Shia LaBeouf (who also wrote the screenplay) in an autobiographical drama about his relationship to his demanding father (played by LaBeouf himself), is Certified Fresh at 95%. The Kingmaker (2019) ,&nbsp;a documentary chronicling the exploits of the famously corrupt Marcos family, and specifically former First Lady Imelda Marcos, who once governed the Philippines, is at&nbsp;92%. Sunday Girl (2019) ,&nbsp;a romantic comedy about a woman involved in relationships with five men who must make a difficult decision, is at 80%. Klaus (2019) ,&nbsp;featuring the voices of Jason Schwartzman, Rashida Jones, and J.K. Simmons in an animated holiday adventure about the origins of Christmas mythology, is at 75%. Crown Vic (2019) ,&nbsp;a thriller about a veteran LAPD officer and his rookie partner on patrol over the course of one night with two cop killers on the loose, is at 73%. Danger Close (2019) ,&nbsp;a Vietnam War film recounting the Battle of Long Tan, in which Australian soldiers fought against the Viet Cong, is at 65%. Primal (2019) ,&nbsp;starring Nicolas Cage in an action thriller about a hunter trapped on a ship with the white jaguar he captured and a dangerous prisoner who has broken free, is at 54%.Like this?

What are the critics saying?Sonic the Hedgehog (2020)  63%Over the course of the past couple decades and change, movies based on video games have earned a reputation as subpar entertainment, to be generous. Critically speaking, things trended a bit upward in 2018 with&nbsp;Rampage&nbsp;(51%) and&nbsp;the&nbsp;Tomb Raider&nbsp;reboot (52%), and 2019 saw the genre’s first two Fresh entries in&nbsp;Pokémon: Detective Pikachu&nbsp;(69%) and&nbsp;The Angry Birds Movie 2&nbsp;(73%), which currently sit at #2 and #1, respectively, on our list of all video game movies ranked. With that context in mind, we come to 2020 and&nbsp;Sonic the Hedgehog, an animated/live-action hybrid adventure in which the titular Sega hero (voiced by Ben Schwartz) travels to Earth from his home planet, befriends a local sheriff (James Marsden), and attempts evade capture by the nefarious Dr. Robotnik (Jim Carrey), who hopes to harness Sonic’s power for evil. The film endured a minor controversy when its first trailer premiered and longtime fans cried foul at Sonic’s subtly creepy character design, but after the folks behind the film pushed its release date back and reworked the visuals, most moviegoers seemed optimistic. As it turns out, those moviegoers weren’t entirely misguided, as critics say&nbsp;Sonic the Hedgehog is mostly wholesome family fun, with a lively performance from Carrey that harkens back to his 1990s heyday. The jokes may not all land, but there are a lot of them that come at you, and while the rest of the film largely caters to a younger audience, there’s enough in there for adults to ensure a trip to the theater won’t be entirely mind-numbing.The Photograph (2020)  75%Being that Friday is Valentine’s Day, it’s only appropriate that at least one of the big releases is a romance. This year, that romance is&nbsp;The Photograph, which stars Issa Rae as Mae, a museum curator whose estranged&nbsp;photographer mother suddenly dies, leaving clues to her storied life behind for her daughter. As Mae begins to pick up the pieces, a journalist named Michael (LaKeith Stanfield) shows up looking to write a story about her mother, and the two of them find they share an undeniable connection. Critics say&nbsp;The Photograph, which cuts between Mae’s relationship with Michael and her mother’s own love story in the past, is a quiet, soulful romance that explores the ways in which one generation’s decisions can echo into the next. While Rae and Stanfield are arguably better known for their comedic work, the reviews point out their easy chemistry as dramatic leads, with a solid supporting cast — which includes Lil Rel Howery, Teyonah Paris, and Chelsea Peretti — helping to flesh out the narrative. Some may find the film a tad languid for their tastes, and the storytelling may not be quite clever enough to offer many surprises, but&nbsp;The Photograph rests on the strength of its stars, who all do admirable work.Downhill (2020)  37%On the flipside of&nbsp;The Photograph, we have&nbsp;Downhill, which charts the steady breakdown of a marriage&nbsp;after a near tragedy. Said couple is played by Will Ferrell and Julia Louis-Dreyfus, who play Pete and Billie Staunton, an American couple with two kids who travel to Europe for an Alpine ski vacation. When a controlled avalanche set off by the resort induces a momentary panic, Pete flees the scene and abandons his family, causing a rift between him and Billie that&nbsp;forces them to reexamine their relationship. Directed and adapted by Nat Faxon and Jim Rash (The Way Way Back),&nbsp;Downhill is an English-language remake of the 2014 Swedish dark comedy&nbsp;Force Majeure, and critics say what could and should have been a fantastic reinterpretation is merely a pale imitation of its predecessor. While Ferrell and Louis-Dreyfus have proven in the past that they can handle subtler material, reviews say Ferrell’s character in particular seems to have lost the edge that made his existential dilemma in the original film so palpable, and the overall softening of the themes at play undermines the satire at its core.&nbsp;In the end,&nbsp;Downhill is a safer, watered-down rendition of the story, neither as darkly funny nor as poignantly subversive as its Swedish counterpart, and it’s likely to go down as something of a missed opportunity.Fantasy Island (2020)  8%For anyone too young to remember,&nbsp;Fantasy Island began as a television series that ran from 1977 to 1984, centering around a mystical vacation destination where visitors could live out their fantasies… for a price. The proprietor of the island, one mysterious Mr. Roarke (played by&nbsp;Ricardo Montalbán), mostly used the fantasies as a means of teaching his guests valuable moral lessons, and while the&nbsp;admittedly Faustian premise rarely turned deadly, there was often a hint of menace in its&nbsp;Twilight Zone-esque storylines. All of that said, leave it to Blumhouse to take that premise and put a horror spin on it in this week’s&nbsp;Fantasy Island, in which&nbsp;Michael Peña’s Mr. Roarke plays host to a group of young visitors who get a lot more than they bargained for when they disembark “ze plane” in hopes of fulfilling their wildest fantasies. Things don’t quite work out according to plan, of course, and their jaunty, indulgent adventures quickly take a turn for the horrific. We’d love to tell you what the critics thought of&nbsp;Fantasy Island, but reviews won’t start pouring in until Friday morning, so in the meantime, guess that Tomatometer.Also&nbsp;Opening This Week In Limited Release The Rest of Us (2020) ,&nbsp;starring Heather Graham in a drama about a woman who connects with her recently deceased ex-husband’s new family, is at 100%.

Jordan&nbsp;and Jamie Foxx), undersea danger (Underwater,&nbsp;starring&nbsp;Kristen Stewart&nbsp;and&nbsp;Vincent Cassel),&nbsp;and&nbsp;a&nbsp;corporate rivalry&nbsp;(Like a Boss,&nbsp;starring&nbsp;Tiffany Haddish&nbsp;and&nbsp;Rose Byrne). What are the critics saying?1917 (2020)  89%Fresh off a couple of surprise Golden Globe wins for&nbsp;Best Director and Best Motion Picture – Drama,&nbsp;1917 expands into wide release this week to afford broader audiences the opportunity to see writer-director Sam Mendes’ ambitious spectacle on the big screen. Ingeniously crafted from several long takes to&nbsp;spin its narrative as a single, unbroken&nbsp;shot, the story follows a pair of British soldiers in World War I (played by George MacKay and Dean-Charles Chapman) who are tasked with delivering an urgent message to a battalion behind enemy lines in order to prevent a massive ambush. It’s the most anticipated film opening this month&nbsp;by a wide margin, according to our fans on social media, and it’s already won heaps of awards (particularly for its stunning cinematography, courtesy of the legendary Roger Deakins) en route to what will likely be a strong showing at the Oscars in February. It’s also Certified Fresh, with critics calling it an immersive and visceral journey that is, of course, technically impressive, but also grounded in a moving tribute to the sacrifices made by the soldiers engaged in the war.Just Mercy (2020)  85%Another film expanding into more theaters this week after a limited release back in December is Destin Daniel Cretton’s&nbsp;Just Mercy, which has already earned star Jamie Foxx a SAG Award nomination. Based on a true story, the film chronicles the efforts of a Harvard-educated attorney named Bryan Stevenson (played by Michael B. Jordan) to exonerate Walter McMillian (Foxx), who was convicted and sentenced to death for the murder of a teenager in 1987. It was a landmark case for Stevenson, who had set out to represent those he believed were wrongly accused of the crimes they were sent to prison for, and it spanned several years as he battled the systemic racism that allowed McMillian’s conviction in the first place.&nbsp;Just Mercy&nbsp;also impressed the critics enough to earn the Certified Fresh distinction, with reviews praising its timely, timeless themes and its outstanding performances. Though it skirts the edges of feeling overly earnest, it manages to overcome its less than subtle messaging with enough nuance and compelling drama to make it well worth a watch.Underwater (2020)  47%Former Twilight star&nbsp;Kristen Stewart has, by all accounts, done an excellent job carving out a unique path in Hollywood, starring in a number of acclaimed indie films and earning rave reviews for her performances. But she still makes time for genre fare every once in a while; last year, it was the&nbsp;Charlie’s Angels reboot, and this week, it’s a deep-sea thriller called, appropriately,&nbsp;Underwater. Stewart stars alongside Vincent Cassell, T.J. Miller, Jessica Henwick, Mamoudou Athie, and John Gallagher Jr., who together comprise a research crew stationed at a facility seven miles below the surface of the ocean. When an unseen force rips their vessel to shreds, the surviving members must figure out a way to get to safety… and avoid whatever it was that did the damage. Critics are fairly split on&nbsp;Underwater, with some crying foul at its all-too-familiar setup and reliance on horror cliches, while others call it a competently&nbsp;crafted&nbsp;thriller that, yes, wears its inspirations on its sleeve, but also mimics them quite effectively. In other words, your mileage may vary here, but if you’re looking for something scary at the theaters this weekend, this is probably at least better than last week’s&nbsp;The Grudge.Like a Boss (2020)  21%Tiffany Haddish has been a comedy queen since her breakout role in 2017’s Girls Trip, and Rose Byrne has proven her own chops in several projects, most notably in 2011’s Bridesmaids. Throw in a scenery-chewing Salma Hayek,&nbsp;and you’d be forgiven for assuming the result would be a surefire hit. The reviews for&nbsp;Like a Boss, however, would indicate otherwise. Haddish and Byrne play Mia and Mel, a pair of odd-couple BFFs who run a modest cosmetics company together but are deep in debt. When they decide to sell 51% of their company to Hayek’s makeup mogul Claire Luna and their business begins to tank, Mel and Mia find themselves at odds with each other, even as they must work together to take Claire down and save their brand.&nbsp;Like a Boss isn’t without its share of laughs, with its heavy dose of physical humor and raunchy jokes, but critics say the film doesn’t explore Mel and Mia’s relationship deeply enough to make their redemptive turnaround feel earned. Plus, thanks to a repetitive series of clashes and reconciliations and a story whose turns are stale and predictable, it feels longer than its 83-minute runtime. Haddish and Byrne have solid chemistry, and they and Hayek appear to be having fun, but that’s one of the few bright spots&nbsp;Like a Boss offers, so if you aren’t a particularly big fan of any of the stars, you may find yourself counting the ways in which it could have been a better movie.Also&nbsp;Opening This Week In Limited Release The Woman Who Loves Giraffes (2020) ,&nbsp;a documentary about naturalist Anne Innis Dagg’s groundbreaking studies on wild giraffes in the 1950s, is at 100%.

What are the critics saying?Jumanji: The Next Level (2019)  71%Let’s be honest: The 2017 reboot-quel Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle had no business turning out as entertaining as it did, but entertaining it was, not to mention profitable. How profitable, you may ask? It made just under $1 billion worldwide off a $90 million budget, so it shouldn’t surprise anyone that we get a follow-up this week. In Jumanji: The Next Level, the original four teens are off to college and separated from each other, and Spencer (Alex Wolff) is longing for the good old days when he inhabited the body of The Rock (and who wouldn’t?). Having repaired the Jumanji console after it was destroyed at the end of the first film, Spencer heads back into the game solo, and his pals decide to go in after him — except this time, they’ve inadvertently dragged Spencer’s grandfather (Danny DeVito) and his estranged BFF (Danny Glover) into the game, too. Aside from that last wrinkle, though, much of The Next Level&nbsp;plays out the same way as the first, and that seems to be just fine for most critics, who feel that whatever the sequel loses in freshness, it largely makes up for with a willingness to go to some wacky lengths for laughs. It may feel overly familiar to some, but those who enjoyed the first adventure are probably just as likely to enjoy this one, which takes some of those expectations and fiddles with them just enough to keep things interesting.Richard Jewell (2019)  77%Back in 1996, smack dab in the middle of the Summer Olympics in Atlanta, Georgia, a pipe bomb exploded in Centennial Olympic Park, killing one person and injuring dozens more. The man who originally discovered the bomb, a security guard named Richard Jewell, alerted the authorities and helped evacuate spectators to safety, and he became a hero in the process. Well, for a few days, anyway, until reports began to surface that he was a “person of interest” in the FBI’s investigation, at which point Jewell underwent a grueling trial by media that changed his life forever. Clint Eastwood‘s latest directorial effort, Richard Jewell, is a dramatization of these events, with Paul Walter Hauser&nbsp;playing the title character at the center of the whirlwind, Sam Rockwell as his old friend and eventual attorney, and Kathy Bates as Jewell’s mother Bobi — they’re the good guys. On the other end, we have Jon Hamm as an unscrupulous G-man and Olivia Wilde as the Atlanta Journal-Constitution writer who broke the story of the FBI’s interest in Jewell. It’s an impressive cast, and critics say each performer offers striking work under Eastwood’s steady direction, even if the story itself has been somewhat oversimplified for dramatic effect. Eastwood clearly has a message on his mind in&nbsp;Richard Jewell, and he largely succeeds in communicating it clearly and effectively. He’s in comfortable territory here, and it works to his advantage; fans of his work should find plenty to enjoy.Uncut Gems (2019)  91%Josh and Benny Safdie&nbsp;had something of a coming-out party last year with&nbsp;Good Time, a kinetic thriller that showcased some of the best work of star Robert Pattinson‘s post-Twilight career. The Safdies decided to follow that up with another tense drama, this time starring frequent critical whipping boy Adam Sandler, and most critics agree the risk paid off in spades. In&nbsp;Uncut Gems, Sandler plays Howard, a New York City jeweler with a self-destructive gambling addiction who regularly places sporting bets with money that doesn’t belong to him. Howard comes into possession of a rare, uncut Ethiopian opal that captures the attention of NBA star Kevin Garnett, which leads to a series of ill-advised collateral swaps, basketball wagers, and mob-style shakedowns as he attempts to pay off his debts by selling the stone at auction. Critics say the Certified Fresh&nbsp;Uncut Gems is a relentless thrill-ride that amps up the anxiety at every turn and benefits from stellar work by its cast, especially Sandler, who&nbsp;had some folks pegging him&nbsp;for a Best Actor nod at the Oscars. He’s proven in the past that with the right material, he can pull off serious roles like nobody’s business, and this is quite possibly his best effort to date. The film is unnerving and propulsive, and it should lead to even bigger opportunities for the Safdies.Bombshell (2019)  68%Director Jay Roach is nothing if not experienced in relaying timely stories about hot-button topics to the general moviegoing public, having helmed films like&nbsp;Recount and&nbsp;Game Change, so this week’s&nbsp;Bombshell thus falls squarely within his wheelhouse. He’s also got a ridiculously talented roster of actors at his disposal for the film, from stars Charlize Theron, Nicole Kidman, and Margot Robbie to supporting characters played by the likes of&nbsp;John Lithgow, Kate McKinnon, and&nbsp;Allison Janney, as well as a script by The Big Short&nbsp;screenwriter Charles Randolph, so it’s slightly disappointing that the film isn’t doing better with critics. The ripped-from-the-headlines story retraces the scandal that brought down Fox News chief Roger Ailes (Lithgow), who was accused by Megyn Kelly (Theron), Gretchen Carlson (Kidman), and other women (represented by Robbie, playing a composite character) of sexual harassment. Reviews have been quick to sing the praises of the three luminous women in the lead roles — all of whom have secured SAG Award nominations — and most critics have been satisfied by the film’s entertaining treatment of the subject matter,&nbsp;though some lament its reluctance to delve deeper into the culture at large surrounding the scandal. It’s not quite a scathing indictment, and those familiar with the story won’t necessarily learn anything new, but it’s presented entertainingly enough to warrant a watch.Black Christmas (2019)  39%Modern horror remakes didn’t use to inspire a whole lot of confidence,&nbsp;but in the last few years, we’ve gotten decent-to-great do-overs of&nbsp;It,&nbsp;Suspiria, and&nbsp;Halloween (OK, that last one was technically a sequel). Enter this week’s&nbsp;Black Christmas, which hopes to put a contemporary spin on the seminal 1974 slasher&nbsp;whose&nbsp;first remake, back in 2006, is itself one of the reasons we generally don’t think too highly of these types of efforts. Writer-director&nbsp;Sophia Takal&nbsp;and co-writer&nbsp;April Wolfe to return to the sorority house and tell a new story. While it still centers on a mysterious figure stalking and killing a group of college coeds, the latter are no longer mere victims; they fight back, and ferociously. Only a handful of critics have weighed in on&nbsp;Black Christmas so far, and the response has been fairly split. Not everyone agrees about whether the film’s underlying feminist themes were handled gracefully, and some feel its bloodless violence robs the film of some of its bite, but a small majority feel that the cast’s committed performances — Imogen Poots in particular — help elevate what might otherwise be another forgettable retread. It may not be the scariest or most subversive horror flick around, in other words, but it’s relatively harmless fun for anyone in the mood for something decidedly more sinister during the holidays.Also&nbsp;Opening This Week In Limited Release Colewell (2019) ,&nbsp;starring Karen Allen in a drama about a small-town mail clerk who must reexamine her life when the post office where she works announces it’s closing, is at 100%.

What are the critics saying?Dark Waters (2019)  89%As if we didn’t already have enough reasons to be&nbsp;fed up with gigantic, multinational corporations, director Todd Haynes‘ drama&nbsp;Dark Waters reminds us there’s plenty more to keep the fires stoked. Based on a 2016 New York Times Magazine article, the film recounts how a corporate attorney named Robert Bilott (played by Mark Ruffalo), whose firm represented corporations like the DuPont chemical company, transformed into an environmental crusader when he discovered what DuPont’s production of Teflon was doing to farm cattle — and later, humans — in West Virginia. Part mystery, part courtroom drama,&nbsp;Dark Waters&nbsp;has earned high praise from critics, who call the film a powerful, timely, and ultimately infuriating condemnation of predatory corporate practices. Not prone to extravagant dramatic touches, Haynes manages to craft a heady underdog story that maintains a steady course, sticks to the facts, and pulls an understated but moving performance from Mark Ruffalo. If you’re looking for fireworks, you won’t get those here, but this story is an important one, and it manages to shine all the same.Playmobil: The Movie (2019)  18%In 2014,&nbsp;The LEGO Movie proved it was possible, however improbable, to craft an engaging, entertaining film from source material that isn’t inherently narrative in nature. That film wasn’t the first to make the attempt, and it certainly won’t be the last, as evidenced further by this week’s&nbsp;Playbmobil: The Movie. Adapted from the popular German toy line first introduced in the 1970s, the film centers on a young woman (played by Anya Taylor-Joy) whose younger brother (Gabriel Bateman) is magically transported to an animated dreamland, compelling her to follow him and traverse landscapes populated by pirates, gladiators, and other fanciful creatures to rescue him. Unfortunately, critics say&nbsp;Playmobil is a regrettably mediocre outing that offers little aside from a barrage of colorful images and a brisk but ultimately generic and uninspired story. Never mind that Harry Potter himself (Daniel Radcliffe) lends his voice to James Bond-like secret agent, or that singers like Meghan Trainor and Adam Lambert are on hand to belt out musical numbers; according to the reviews,&nbsp;Playmobil is a whole lot of flash and glitter with very little behind it.Also&nbsp;Opening This Week In Limited Release Midnight Family (2019) ,&nbsp;a documentary about a family running a private ambulance business in Mexico City, is at 100%.

What are the critics saying?Birds of Prey (And the Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn) (2020)  79%Talk to anyone who saw 2016’s&nbsp;Suicide Squad, and they’re likely to tell you the best part about the movie was Margot Robbie’s performance as Joker’s best girl, Harley Quinn. Warner Bros. clearly knew this, too, considering the studio announced a Harley Quinn spinoff even before&nbsp;Suicide Squad was released. Four&nbsp;years later, audiences finally get to see Birds of Prey, and the praise for it so far has been effusive. Working from a script by Christina Hodson, director Cathy Yan jumps back and forth in time to explain how Harley and “Mistah J” broke up, how she gets pulled into the orbit of nightclub owner-cum-sadistic crime boss Roman Sionis (Ewan McGregor), and how her story intertwines with the women who would form her ragtag crew (Jurnee Smollett-Bell, Mary Elizabeth Winstead, Rosie Perez, and Ella Jay Basco). Some were reasonably concerned we might have another Suicide Squad on our hands, but critics say it’s all as flamboyant, irreverent, unhinged, action-packed, and gloriously fun as one should expect from a Harley Quinn movie. That said, it does earn its R rating, with plenty of colorful language and bone-crushing violence (thanks, in part, to John Wick director Chad Stahelski, who helped choreograph the action), so it may not be the most ideal girl-power flick for young&nbsp;women. But anyone hoping for a loopy carnival ride of an adventure starring one of Hollywood’s most dynamic actors will likely leave the theater satisfied.Also&nbsp;Opening This Week In Limited Release Cane River (2020) ,&nbsp;a revival of the 1982 romance set in Louisiana about a forbidden love affair between a Creole man and a Black woman, is at 100% Come to Daddy (2020) ,&nbsp;starring Elijah Wood in a psychological horror comedy about a man who attempts to reconnect with his estranged father at a remote cabin, only to face his dark past, is Certified Fresh at 92%.

What are the critics saying?Ford v Ferrari (2019)  92%Director James Mangold is no stranger to the Oscars, his most recent film&nbsp;Logan having earned him a Best Adapted Screenplay nomination, and he looks poised to make some noise again at the next ceremony with his latest film,&nbsp;Ford v Ferrari. The last time Mangold took on a story based on true events — the 2005 Johnny Cash biopic&nbsp;Walk the Line, specifically — the end result was five Academy Award nominations, and based on the reception to&nbsp;Ford v Ferrari so far, it’s not out of the question to assume more nominations are in the cards. Matt Damon and Christian Bale star as legendary car designer Carroll Shelby and British racecar driver and engineer Ken Miles, respectively, who were hired by the Ford Motor Company after its president, Henry Ford II, felt slighted by Ferrari owner Enzo Ferrari pulling out of a business deal between the two companies. Shelby and Miles’ mission? To develop and race a car that would defeat Scuderia Ferrari in the 24 Hours of Le Mans race in 1966. Critics say&nbsp;Ford v Ferrari not only delivers on the pulse-pounding action on the race track but also serves up outstanding performances from Damon, Bale, and their supporting cast, as well as a crowd-pleasing story infused with plenty of human intrigue. Even if you aren’t an auto enthusiast, this is likely to be a satisfying drama that maybe doesn’t take many risks but hits almost all the right notes.Charlie's Angels (2019)  52%Elizabeth Banks did a pretty respectable job when she made her feature directorial debut with Pitch Perfect 2 in 2015, so for her sophomore effort, she decided to help revive and reinvent a classic franchise with similar female bonding themes.&nbsp;Charlie’s Angels began as a television series back in the mid- to late-1970s and found new life in a pair of cheeky, early 2000s action flicks starring Cameron Diaz, Lucy Liu, and Drew Barrymore — both revolved around a trio of female agents who specialized in investigation and espionage and were commanded by a mysterious man named Charlie. In this modern update, the angels (or would-be angel, in one case) are played by Kristen Stewart, Ella Balinska, and Naomi Scott, and they comprise just one team of many around the world who all take orders from various “Bosleys” — their own is played by Banks herself. When one of the trio discovers the company she works for is developing a potentially dangerous technology, she unwittingly stumbles upon a conspiracy that the Angels must work to unravel. Critics say&nbsp;Charlie’s Angels is an earnest effort from all involved, with a particularly sprightly performance from Kristen Stewart, but it’s also a little disappointingly rote, as far as action fare goes, and it doesn’t make the greatest case for why it was revived. That said, it’s energetic, breezy, and appropriately cheeky, even if it is formulaic, and it may be just fun enough to pass the time for most.The Good Liar (2019)  63%Ian McKellen and Helen Mirren are two of modern cinema’s most celebrated and revered actors, so it may surprise some to learn that, between their extensive resumes, they have yet to share the screen together. That all changes this week with&nbsp;The Good Liar, a twisty, dramatic thriller that critics say doesn’t quite live up to the talents of its two esteemed stars. McKellen plays a veteran conman who sets his sights on a wealthy widower (Mirren) and inserts himself into her life. As he dodges her suspicious grandson, the elder pair grow closer, but his past threatens to catch up with him and bring the whole scheme crashing down. Critics say&nbsp;The Good Liar, directed by Bill Condon (Beauty and the Beast,&nbsp;Mr. Holmes), just misses the mark; though both McKellen and Mirren are magnetic on screen, the story twists itself into impossible knots in its efforts to squeeze intrigue out of what amounts to a fairly basic premise, and the end result may be a little difficult for some viewers to swallow. Though it sports all the trappings of a classic mystery, it only halfway meets its ambitious goals and ends up feeling like a pulpier take on better-executed films.Also&nbsp;Opening This Week In Limited Release Mickey and the Bear (2019) ,&nbsp;a drama about a young woman seeking independence from her Iraq War veteran father, is at 100%.

What are the critics saying?Countdown (2019)  26%Every great accomplishment begins with a small idea, something that sparks the imagination or inspires a flurry of creative impulses, but sometimes small ideas stay small ideas. They may get gussied up in the trappings of larger ideas, but they remain small ideas. That appears to be what happened with&nbsp;Countdown, a high-concept horror&nbsp;flick that asks and answers the question, “What if there was a mobile phone app that could predict the exact moment of my death?” Elizabeth Lail stars as Quinn, a young nurse who, along with her colleagues, downloads the titular app out of morbid curiosity after an unusual encounter with a patient and discovers, much to her chagrin, that she may only have days before her time is up. And what happens to those who attempt to side-step their digitally predestined fate? It still comes to pass, of course, albeit under… spookier circumstances. Critics say&nbsp;Countdown is a derivative thriller that reinterprets familiar ideas&nbsp;into a just-different-enough hodgepodge of jump scares and unnecessary subplots in order to stretch its central conceit to feature length. That said, most also agree that Lail and co-star Jordan Calloway are both likable leads, and it’s a fairly short run to the finish line, so if you’re just looking to get the heart rate up for a little bit, it may do the trick.Black and Blue (2019)  52%If a film is marketed as a “cop thriller,” there’s a pretty good chance that corrupt officers are going to figure into the plot at some point. Maybe they shake down local gangsters for cash, maybe they pilfer from the evidence room, maybe they’re secretly involved in organized crime. Whatever the case, it’s kind of refreshing when the film puts that bit of bad business front and center right from the jump, and that’s what we get in&nbsp;Black and Blue. Naomie Harris (a.k.a. the James Bond franchise’s current Moneypenny) stars as a rookie cop who catches an officer-involved shooting — one that she wasn’t supposed to see —&nbsp;on her body cam and has to dodge both the corrupt officers involved and the distrustful members of the surrounding community as she hoofs it back to the station. Critics say Harris contributes a committed performance, and that helps elevate the material, but the film struggles to find a balance between its heady themes and more visceral thrills. Taken as a pure action thriller, it’s decent, if familiar, and taken as a commentary on the current state of community policing, it’s a little thin and simple. Go into it expecting a strong treatment of both angles, and you may be disappointed.The Current War: Director's Cut (2019)  60%It’s got an impressive A-list cast, a turn-of-the-20th-century period setting, and a basis in historical fact, and it’s executive produced by Martin Scorsese, all of which would seem to make&nbsp;The Current War a solid awards season contender. Strange, then, that it’s been sitting on a shelf since 2017. The story here is that the film — which recounts the corporate rivalry that erupted between Thomas Edison and George Westinghouse (together with his partner Nikola Tesla) over the supply of electricity as a utility — originally premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival two years ago in September, and was set to be distributed by The Weinstein Company that same November. Then, of course, the allegations against Harvey Weinstein came out, TWC sold off the rights to the film, and it sat in limbo until 101 Studios picked up the distribution rights and scheduled for release, well, this weekend. This gave director&nbsp;Alfonso Gomez-Rejon&nbsp;some extra time to retool the movie after its lukewarm reception at TIFF in 2017, and here we are. For what its worth, critics who have seen&nbsp;the&nbsp;Director’s Cut say it’s marginally better than what was shown in Toronto, but it still suffers from the same fundamental problem: despite its star power and some well-crafted costumes and production design, the drama falls a little flat. That said, the performances are all ace, and everything really does look beautiful here, so if you just want to spend some time in a historical setting with the likes of Benedict Cumberbatch, Michael Shannon, Nicholas Hoult, Katherine Waterston, and Tom Holland, you won’t be disappointed.The Lighthouse (2019)  90%If director Robert Eggers‘ debut feature, 2016’s&nbsp;The Witch, was divisive, audiences should now at least have some idea what they’re in for if they decide to see&nbsp;The Lighthouse.&nbsp;And since the film is expanding to several hundred more theaters this week, there will certainly be more audiences who see it. Robert Pattinson stars as a young lighthouse keeper who accompanies a grizzled veteran keeper played by Willem Dafoe as they relieve another pair&nbsp;of keepers on an isolated island, where they’ll learn to work together over the course of a few months. As time passes, the isolation winds its way through their psyches and they begin to lose their grip on reality… or do they? Critics say&nbsp;The Lighthouse is beautifully shot — it’s photographed on black and white film, in an unconventional aspect ratio — and impeccably acted by both of its leads, who endured a famously grueling shoot. You may not be able to decipher all the mysteries hidden within the film — and perhaps that is as Eggers intended — but it should be a fascinating journey to undertake if you can stomach a bit of weirdness.&nbsp;Also&nbsp;Opening This Week In Limited Release Making Waves: The Art of Cinematic Sound (2019) ,&nbsp;a documentary about the work of sound designers in cinema, is at 100%.

What are the critics saying?Stuber (2019)  42%If you ever thought a hybrid of The Big Sick and Michael Mann’s Collateral sounded like a terrific idea, this week’s Stuber might be the ride for you. Like The Big Sick, Stuber stars Kumail Nanjiani as a mild-mannered Uber driver — named Stu, of course — who is roped into a frequently violent wild goose chase across Los Angeles in search of a murderous drug dealer. The large, imposing man responsible for said roping is LAPD detective Vic Manning (played by Dave Bautista), who requires Stu’s services because he’s recovering from a Lasik operation. Will the two of them learn to put aside their differences and work together in harmony? Will they help each other confront some hard truths about themselves? Will cars be chased and heads be busted? The answer to all of those questions is likely to be “yes,” and critics say it’s a little disappointing that Stuber doesn’t do more with its talented cast, which also includes Karen Gillan, Mira Sorvino, and Betty Gilpin. There’s also quite a bit of violence and a some tonal inconsistencies, but if you don’t mind that, there may some fun to be had here.Crawl (2019)  84%Director Alexandre Aja cut his teeth on horror remakes like 2006’s The Hills Have Eyes and 2010’s Piranha, as well as thrillers like High Tension&nbsp;and Mirrors, so he knows his way around a good scare or two. In Crawl, he combines a few different common fears — of drowning, of small spaces, of… alligators — into a disaster survival thriller, and early reviews say it’s schlocky, to be sure, but it’s also satisfying and a lot of fun. Kaya Scodelario plays Haley, a Florida woman who makes a beeline for her father’s home to help evacuate him (Barry Pepper) before a massive hurricane makes landfall. As the storm hits and flood waters begin to rise, the two of them become trapped inside the house, where a few hungry gators have decided to poke around for a snack. Crawl is clearly not an attempt at high art, but the film recognizes this and, according to critics, makes good on the simple promises of its premise. If you come looking for some gleeful mayhem and outrageous thrills, that’s exactly what you’re going to get, and you’ll probably have a pretty good time getting it.Also&nbsp;Opening This Week In Limited Release The Farewell (2019) ,&nbsp;starring Awkwafina in a comedy-drama about a young woman who returns to China when her grandmother is diagnosed with a terminal illness — and isn’t told about it — is Certified Fresh at 100%.

Williams), divers in peril&nbsp;(47 Meters Down: Uncaged,&nbsp;starring&nbsp;Sophie&nbsp;Nélisse&nbsp;and&nbsp;Corinne Fox), a&nbsp;missing mom (Where’d You Go, Bernadette,&nbsp;starring&nbsp;Cate Blanchett&nbsp;and&nbsp;Billy Crudup), and&nbsp;a man inspired by The Boss (Blinded by the Light,&nbsp;starring&nbsp;Viveik Kalra&nbsp;and&nbsp;Hayley Atwell). What are the critics saying?The Angry Birds Movie 2 (2019)  73%Considering its non-narrative source material, there are likely few who would have guessed that&nbsp;The Angry Birds Movie 2&nbsp;could become the best-reviewed video game movie of all time. Yet, here we are, with the mobile app-inspired animated adventure poised to take the crown away from Detective Pikachu, who mounted the throne just earlier this year. Jason Sudeikis, Josh Gad, Maya Rudolph, Bill Hader, and Danny McBride all return to voice their characters from the first film, as Red (Sudeikis) and the birds join forces with Leonard (Hader) and the pigs against a new enemy (voiced by Leslie Jones) bent on taking over their islands. Also, there’s a subplot about three young birds attempting to retrieve some lost eggs. It’s all harmless stuff, say the critics, who also point out that&nbsp;The Angry Birds Movie 2 is fast-paced, zipping from set piece to set piece, and full of both potty jokes for the kids and more pop culture-savvy humor for the adults. When all is said and done, and the Tomatometer score settles a bit, this may indeed become the best video game movie yet, and most seem to be just fine with that.Good Boys (2019)  80%On paper, it’s a little tough to suss out who exactly is supposed to be the target audience for&nbsp;Good Boys. Its R rating means kids the same age as the three leads won’t be able to see it — some of the movie’s marketing has been keen to point that out — and there’s no guarantee that those who&nbsp;are of appropriate age to see the film will get much of a kick out of a trio of pre-teens getting into outlandish shenanigans en route to a&nbsp;spin-the-bottle party. Yet, here we are, with the film earning fairly enthusiastic praise from a majority of the critics — presumably all adults — who have seen it. Jacob Tremblay, Keith L. Williams, and Brady Noon play the titular&nbsp;Boys, one of whom is invited to a kissing party where he may get to smooch his crush. But when an attempt to spy on the girls with a drone goes sideways, the threesome embark on a riotous journey that will teach them more than they ever wanted to know. Critics say&nbsp;Good Boys, written and directed by&nbsp;The Office vets Gene Stupnitsky and Lee Eisenberg, is frequently funny, getting a lot of mileage out of the boys’ naivete about grown-up things, and surprisingly earnest. It’s&nbsp;essentially&nbsp;a middle-school riff on&nbsp;Superbad, but less cynical, and with noticeably more jokes about sex toys.47 Meters Down: Uncaged (2019)  45%First off, we’ll get the obvious question out of the way: Why isn’t this movie called&nbsp;48 Meters Down? Seems like the most logical way to name a sequel to&nbsp;47 Meters Down, and it’s a whole lot less clumsy than its actual title:&nbsp;47 Meters Down: Uncaged. Yet, here we are, wondering how cages factor into this story about scuba divers in Mexico terrorized by sharks. This time around, it’s a quartet of young women on vacation who take an underwater excursion to explore some submerged Mayan ruins, only to discover they’ve invaded the hunting grounds of a school of ravenous sharks. Critics are currently split on the Uncaged, with some calling it a standard B-movie thriller that knows what it sets out to do and does it fairly successfully, while others lament what they feel are sluggish pacing, subpar writing, and a lack of originality. At the very least,&nbsp;47 Meters Down: Uncaged is tracking on the Tomatometer to be on par with the first film — a tad better, even — so if you enjoyed that one, you’re likely to be on board with this one, too.Where'd You Go, Bernadette (2019)  49%It’s tempting to think that the combination of an acclaimed director, a supremely talented cast, and best-selling source material should make for a surefire bet at the cineplex, even if we’ve seen similar projects fail time and again in the past. Yet, here we are, staring down the release of Richard Linklater‘s&nbsp;Where’d You Go, Bernadette?&nbsp;as critics lament what could have been. Based on the novel of the same name and&nbsp;starring an ensemble cast that includes Billy Crudup, Kristen Wiig, Judy Greer, Laurence Fishburne, and, in the title role, Cate Blanchett,&nbsp;Where’d You Go&nbsp;revolves around a stay-at-home mom (she’s agoraphobic) and former hotshot architect who gradually suffers a nervous breakdown and takes flight from her domestic troubles in order to rekindle her creative instincts. Though he does occasionally dip into the Well of Whimsy, this is Linklater’s&nbsp;The Secret Life of Walter Mitty by way of Wes Anderson, which, according to critics, isn’t as enjoyable as it might sound to some. While most critics have few negative things to say about Blanchett’s central performance, many of them find the movie surrounding her less impressive, largely due to a sprawling but thin plot that fails to explore more interesting themes surrounding its enigmatic protagonist. Where’d You Go, Bernadette? may appeal&nbsp;Linklater completionists (they exist, right?), but others may leave the theater dissatisfied.Blinded by the Light (2019)  89%Jukebox musicals are, on the whole, hit-or-miss affairs, as it’s understandably difficult to shape dialogue around frequently nebulous pop-song lyrics without turning the enterprise into a cloying mess. Yet, here we are, with just such an endeavor based on the hits of Bruce Springsteen earning the best reviews of any wide release this week. Loosely adapted from a memoir by British journalist Sarfraz Manzoor (who also co-wrote the script), Blinded by the Light&nbsp;follows teenaged aspiring writer Javed (Viveik Kalra) as he struggles to escape his hometown and his strict, traditional family; he finds the strength to stand on his own when he’s introduced to the music of The Boss, who inspires him to follow his own path. Critics say that while the film is not without its movie musical cliches, the cast — which includes Hayley Atwell as a supportive teacher — is well-suited to the material, and the story is so charming that it overpowers any sense of excessive sentimentality. Will Springsteen fans enjoy it? Very much so, but those just along for the ride will likely find their spirits suitably lifted.Also&nbsp;Opening This Week In Limited Release Aquarela (2019) ,&nbsp;a documentary about visceral power and beauty of water in its various natural forms on Earth, is at 100%.

What are the critics saying?Hustlers (2019)  87%The Toronto International Film Festival has already seen the world premieres of several high-profile movies, including the latest from directors Rian Johnson and Taika Waititi, as well as the Tom Hanks-powered Mr. Rogers biopic and Eddie Murphy’s return to the big screen. But in between all the buzz for those films, we also got our first look at&nbsp;Hustlers, a based-on-true-events caper starring Jennifer Lopez and Constance Wu, which happens to open everywhere this week, and critics couldn’t be more pleasantly surprised. Loosely adapted from a New York Magazine piece published in 2015, the story revolves around a group of enterprising strippers at a New York City club, led by a seasoned vet (Lopez) and her eager protege (Wu), who decide to carry out some financial justice on their wealthy clientele in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis. Critics say&nbsp;Hustlers is not only a satisfying chronicle of&nbsp;cosmic comeuppance, but also an intelligently crafted satire that’s smart enough not to let everyone off the hook, and most agree that Lopez’s performance in particular is worth the price of admission.The Goldfinch (2019)  25%Speaking of adaptations,&nbsp;The Goldfinch appears to illustrate — for the umpteenth time — how having all the right ingredients sometimes still isn’t enough to guarantee a successful transition from page to screen. The film is based on the eponymous 2013 novel, which won the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction; it’s directed by John Crowley, whose last film, 2015’s&nbsp;Brooklyn, earned three&nbsp;Academy Award&nbsp;nominations and cemented Saoirse Ronan’s status as a perennial Oscar darling; it was shot by the legendary Roger Deakins, who most recently won an Oscar for his work on Blade Runner 2049;&nbsp;and it features a cast that includes rising star Ansel Elgort, Nicole Kidman, Jeffrey Wright, Sarah Paulson, Luke Wilson, and Denis O’Hare. Despite that impressive pedigree, critics say the film, which recounts the experiences of a young boy who grows up into a life of crime after his mother is killed in a bombing, is strangely drab and soulless. There are differing perspectives on why that’s the case — some point to wooden acting, others the sense of self-satisfaction, and still others the lack of dramatic heft — but most agree that the end product is a largely unsatisfying translation that misunderstands what made the source material so compelling.Brittany Runs a Marathon (2019)  88%Meanwhile, a smaller film that opened in just a handful of theaters a few weeks ago is expanding in hopes of attracting more eyeballs. The Cerfiied Fresh&nbsp;Brittany Runs a Marathon stars frequent scene-stealer Jilllian Bell in her first headlining role as a hard-partying New Yorker who, true to the film’s title, decides to turn her life around by training for the New York City Marathon to shed some weight. In the process, she struggles with issues that a wide swath of the audience is likely to find relatable, from career paralysis to relationship problems, and critics say Bell is more than up to the task. She’s proven in the past that she’s hilarious, but the role also offers her ample opportunity to infuse her character with nuance, and most agree she does so fantastically. While some concede that the story takes a couple of strange turns, they also find Bell and her co-stars (including Utkarsh Ambudkar, Michaela Watkins, and Lil Rel Howery) so charming that it isn’t difficult to overlook some of the film’s shortcomings.&nbsp;Brittany Runs a Marathon is&nbsp;a feel-good dramedy with fairly wide appeal, so if you weren’t able to see it before, now’s your chance.Also&nbsp;Opening This Week In Limited Release One Cut of the Dead (Kamera o tomeru na!)

What are the critics saying?Gemini Man (2019)  26%There are few stars left who can carry a film on charisma alone, and Will Smith is one of them. So what happens when you cast him in an action blockbuster opposite… himself? That’s what we find out this week in&nbsp;Gemini Man,&nbsp;Ang Lee‘s sci-fi thriller about an aging assassin (Smith) on the cusp of retirement who suddenly finds himself on the run from an agent hired by his old employers. Surprise — it’s actually a cloned, younger version of himself! If this all sounds a bit familiar, that’s because the film was originally conceived some 20 years ago, and in that time we’ve gotten movies like&nbsp;The Island,&nbsp;The 6th Day,&nbsp;Timecrimes, and&nbsp;Looper,&nbsp;many of which cover similar territory (especially Looper). Critics say that&nbsp;Gemini Man&nbsp;is helped by Smith’s presence in the lead role, as well as some of Lee’s intriguing directorial decisions, but the de-aging technology used to create the younger Will Smith dips a little too far into the uncanny valley, and despite some committed performances by the cast, the storytelling is rote and dated, packed with ineffective one-liners and groanworthy dialogue.The Addams Family (2019)  45%When cartoonist Charles Addams created The Addams Family back in 1938, there was no way he could have known that it would blossom into a multi-media franchise. His satirical take on the prototypical nuclear American family became a successful television series in the 1960s, spawning an animated series in the 1970s, a pair of cult classic films in the early 1990s, and yet another animated series shortly thereafter. And that doesn’t even cover the video games, the stage musical, and various other forms of entertainment based on the characters. This week, we get the latest iteration on the big screen in&nbsp;The Addams Family, an animated film that not only boasts a stacked voice cast that includes Charlize Theron, Oscar Isaac,&nbsp;Chloë Grace Moretz, Finn Wolfhard, Allison Janney, and Bette Midler (plus even more, but whew!), but also incorporates character designs directly inspired by Addams’ original cartoons. The story follows the kooky titular family as they flee yet another town that misunderstands them and settle into an abandoned asylum in New Jersey, only to&nbsp;butt heads with a home improvement reality show host whose goal is to homogenize the entire town. The Addamses have always stood for the power of individuality and represented the part of all of us that sometimes feels like an outsider, which is typically great fodder for a children’s film, but critics say&nbsp;The Addams Family&nbsp;mostly misses the mark. Not only does it drown viewers in its sweetness, its script is somehow both altogether predictable and disappointingly disjointed to feel like a single cohesive tale. It’s probably plenty engaging for toddlers, but it may be hit-or-miss for anyone older than that.Jexi (2019)  19%As long as we’re doing high-concept movies this week, we might as well talk about&nbsp;Jexi. Adam DeVine stars in this comedy about a phone-obsessed pop culture writer named Phil whose life begins to change for the better when some new A.I. software called “Jexi” (voiced by Rose Byrne) boosts his confidence and helps him make some smart decisions. The downside? As things start to look up for Phil, Jexi gets jealous and resorts to all kinds of shenanigans to keep him to herself. This is, in other words, something of a&nbsp;cross between&nbsp;Her and&nbsp;Fatal Attraction, and we’d love to be able to tell you what the critics thought, but the film wasn’t widely screened for critics. You know what that means: take a stab at what you think&nbsp;Jexi‘s Tomatometer will be in the comments!Also&nbsp;Opening This Week In Limited Release Parasite (Gisaengchung) (2019) ,&nbsp;Bong Joon-ho‘s Palme d’Or-winning mystery about a family of con artists whose scam on wealthy benefactors is jeopardized by an unexpected development, is Certified Fresh at 100%.

See what the critics are saying about this week's movies!by Alex Vo and Ryan Fujitani | October 17, 2019 |  CommentsThis week at the movies, we’ve got&nbsp;a misunderstood sorceress (Maleficent: Mistress of Evil, starring&nbsp;Angelina Jolie&nbsp;and&nbsp;Elle Fanning)&nbsp;and apocalypse survivors (Zombieland: Double Tap,&nbsp;starring&nbsp;Jesse Eisenberg&nbsp;and Emma Stone). What are the critics saying?Maleficent: Mistress of Evil (2019)  39%Disney’s efforts to reinterpret their classic animated films as live-action fare have been a little hit-or-miss with critics, as we saw as recently as this past summer, but they still do pretty well at the box office. This was the case when the current remake trend kicked off with 2010’s&nbsp;Alice in Wonderland and continued with the studio’s next effort, 2014’s&nbsp;Maleficent, which only scored 53% on the Tomatometer but made over $750 million and became Angelina Jolie’s highest-grossing movie ever. It’s unclear if this week’s follow-up,&nbsp;Maleficent: Mistress of Evil, will be as big of a commercial success, but critics say it’s about on par with its predecessor. This time around, Jolie’s titular misunderstood Disney villain finds herself at odds with her goddaughter Princess Aurora’s (Elle Fanning) future in-laws, who seek to separate the worlds of human and fairies for good. Co-stars Imelda Staunton, Sam Riley, and Juno Temple all return to reprise their roles, joined by newcomers Michelle Pfeiffer, Chiwetel Ejiofor, and Ed Skrein, and critics say they do admirable work with the material. But the fact remains that the storytelling feels rather perfunctory, and the film makes only feeble attempts to grapple with some of the weightier themes it evokes. The visuals are as spectacular as they were the first time around, and Jolie and Pfeiffer in particular are fun to watch, but this may please only the biggest fans of Maleficent’s recent realignment as someone to root for.Zombieland: Double Tap (2019)  69%It’s been 10 years since the end of the long-running&nbsp;Zombieland&nbsp;saga, which had seen its empire rise to one movie, and one failed Amazon pilot. But the media landscape has changed a lot in the intervening decade:&nbsp;The Walking Dead&nbsp;premiered,&nbsp;Resident Evil&nbsp;games got bad, and then good again, and Brad Pitt solved&nbsp;World War Z. Frankly, we are up to here with zombies. And just as the dead keep coming back in some half-baked metaphor, so too does a quality comedy sequel script rise to the top in this biz, insisting to be given life.&nbsp;Woody Harrelson,&nbsp;Jesse Eisenberg,&nbsp;Emma Stone, and&nbsp;Abigail Breslin&nbsp;are back reprising their geographically-named zombie slayer roles, who have all moved into the White House and transformed it into an impregnable fortress. But when love’s many splendored machinations threaten to tear the group asunder, it’s back on the road for more misadventures, involving powered-up undead, doppelganger crews,&nbsp;Rosario Dawson&nbsp;as an Elvis-loving hotel proprietress, and&nbsp;Zoey Deutch’s scene-stealing ditz. Critics can be tough on comedies, especially their sequels, but here’s one zombie follow-up that works, even if it’s got less teeth in its bite.&nbsp;Zombieland: Double Tap&nbsp;has&nbsp;the creative “survival rules” graphics. It’s got splatter, and it’s got slapstick. The chemistry between the four leads is&nbsp;just as top-shelf as in the first, but the expanded cast is push-and-pull. Some new characters not only get the laughs but also reveal new dimensions in the established crew, while others detract from the flow of the film. Nearly unanimous is praise for Deutch, as the improbable survivor Madison, with some calling her a comedy revelation. Also on everyone critic’s mind: Stick around during those credits. It’s a doozy.Also&nbsp;Opening This Week In Limited Release Greener Grass (2019) ,&nbsp;a surreal suburban satire about two friends engaged in a game of passive-aggressive&nbsp;one-upsmanship, is at 100%.

What are the critics saying?Ad Astra (2019)  83%Director James Gray‘s previous work includes films like&nbsp;The Immigrant and&nbsp;The Lost City of Z, so he may not be the first person who comes to mind when you think “epic space drama.” That said, Gray’s quieter sensibilities may have worked to his benefit in his latest project,&nbsp;Ad Astra. Brad Pitt stars in the&nbsp;sci-fi mystery as an astronaut who embarks on a dangerous journey into space both to investigate an interstellar threat to Earth and to locate his missing father (Tommy Lee Jones), who undertook a similar mission decades earlier and disappeared. Critics say the film is an ambitious, beautifully photographed space adventure that balances big questions alongside more personal themes and does it fairly well. It may not quite stick the landing flawlessly, but Pitt turns in a noteworthy performance and Gray largely succeeds in grounding the epic scope in effective human drama. The end result is a more cerebral odyssey that still features enough thrills to please genre fans.Downton Abbey (2019)  84%Downton Abbey, the wildly popular ITV series about the Lords, Ladies, and servants who populate the titular estate, ended its six-series run in 2015, and fans have been hungry for more ever since. Now, almost four years later, the world is finally getting what it asked for. Hugh Bonneville, Elizabeth McGovern,&nbsp;Michelle Dockery,&nbsp;Maggie Smith, and the rest of the cast are back for a big-screen continuation of the series, which finds the Crawleys and their staff blessed with a visit from the King and Queen of England themselves. A culture clash ensues, family rivalries heat up, and various relationships are put to the test — in other words, it’s everything you might want and expect from a&nbsp;Downton Abbey&nbsp;movie. Just ask the critics, most of whom say the film&nbsp;effectively&nbsp;captures&nbsp;the essence of the series and delivers pretty much exactly what fans are looking forward to. It&nbsp;likely won’t&nbsp;be as engaging for the uninitiated, but even they may be won over by its charms.Rambo: Last Blood (2019)  26%John Rambo’s introduction to the world back in 1982 was titled&nbsp;First Blood, so it’s fitting — a little&nbsp;too on the nose, even — that this week’s entry in the franchise, the fifth and presumably final installment, is called&nbsp;Rambo: Last Blood. What, precisely, is it that gets Rambo’s last blood boiling, you may ask? How about the kidnapping of his beloved sort-of “niece,” with whom he’s been running a family ranch in Arizona, by a Mexican drug cartel intent on&nbsp;trafficking her as a sex slave. While the first film in the series is highly regarded, none of the subsequent films has earned higher than 41% on the Tomatometer, which puts&nbsp;Last Blood on par with the rest of the sequels. That’s probably no surprise to anyone, and depending on whether or not you’re a fan of the vigilante anti-hero’s ultraviolent tactics, this one is either going to be right up your alley or another Rambo movie to avoid.Also&nbsp;Opening This Week In Limited Release Midnight Traveler (2019) ,&nbsp;a documentary about Afghan director Hassan Fazili‘s own journey seeking refuge for his family after the Taliban marks him for death, is at 100%. Villains (2019) ,&nbsp;starring&nbsp;Bill Skarsgård&nbsp;and Maika Monroe&nbsp;in a thriller about two would-be burglars who are taken captive by the not-so-normal suburbanites whose home they’ve broken into, is at 84%.

What are the critics saying?Abominable (2019)  82%You’re probably thinking to yourself, “Isn’t this the third animated family movie about not-so-abominable snowpersons that’s been foisted upon me, the unsuspecting average moviegoer, in the last year alone?” And you would be correct, dear unsuspecting average moviegoer:&nbsp;Smallfoot hit theaters almost exactly a year ago, we got&nbsp;Missing Link back in mid-April, and this week sees the release of&nbsp;Abominable, from the same studio (as the poster proudly declares) that gave us&nbsp;How to Train Your Dragon. The previous two films were both Certified Fresh, and so far, it looks like&nbsp;Abominable is enjoying a similarly positive reception. Chloe Bennett (Marvel’s Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.)&nbsp;voices a young woman in Shanghai named Yi, who’s never fully recovered from losing her father. When she encounters an escaped Yeti hiding out on her rooftop, she and her friends set out on the journey of a lifetime to escort their new friend back to its home on Mt. Everest. In other words, this isn’t exactly groundbreaking stuff, as far as storytelling goes, but it hits all of the requisite beats so charmingly that critics find it difficult to resist. Toss in a supporting cast that includes Eddie Izzard and Sarah Paulson, as well as some striking visuals of China’s vast and varied landscape, rendered in gorgeously framed cinematography, and&nbsp;Abominable is shaping up to be a pretty solid piece of family entertainment.Also&nbsp;Opening This Week In Limited Release First Love (Hatsukoi) (2019) ,&nbsp;Takashi Miike’s crime thriller about a young couple in love who get mixed up in a bloody gang war , is at 100%.

Is Certified FreshPlus, Pet Sematary is better the second time around, Jordan Peele's The Twilight Zone is appropriately thought-provoking, and The Best of Enemies should be better.by Ryan Fujitani | April 4, 2019 |  CommentsThis weekend at the movies,&nbsp;we’ve&nbsp;got a&nbsp;silly superhero (Shazam!, starring&nbsp;Zachary Levi&nbsp;and&nbsp;Mark Strong),&nbsp;a cursed graveyard (Pet Sematary, starring&nbsp;Jason Clarke&nbsp;and&nbsp;Amy Seimetz), and an unlikely partnership&nbsp;(The Best of Enemies, starring&nbsp;Taraji P. Henson&nbsp;and&nbsp;Sam Rockwell). What are the critics saying?Shazam! (2019)  90%If the critical and commercial success of Wonder Woman and Aquaman wasn’t quite enough to convince some moviegoers that Warner Bros. and DC were headed in the right direction, maybe their latest big-screen effort will seal the deal. Zachary Levi, Asher Angel, Jack Dylan Grazer, and Mark Strong star in this part-superhero origin story, part-coming-of-age comedy about a teen named Billy Batson, who is recruited by a wizard who bequeaths him the power to transform into an adult with superpowers. As Billy learns to control his newfound abilities, he draws the attention of an evil man who wants Shazam’s powers for himself. Critics say Shazam!, directed by David F. Sandberg (Lights Out, Annabelle: Creation — weird choice, we know, but it worked!), is a blast, full of childlike wonder, genuine laughs, and an abundance of heart that grounds it. This is about as pure as fantasy wish fulfillment can get, and it’s a rock-solid piece of blockbuster entertainment.Pet Sematary (2019)  57%It only took six years from the time Stephen King published Pet Sematary to see it adapted for the big screen, but it took another 30 — and a misguided 1992 sequel — before anyone decided to give it another go. Taking the reins this time are directing duo Kevin Kölsch and Dennis Widmyer, who previously helmed the well-received indie thriller Starry Eyes, and who make a few changes to the original story. In the updated version, a Boston doctor (Jason Clarke) relocates with his wife (Amy Seimetz) and two children to Maine, where he learns about a mysterious burial site behind their new home that’s rumored to bring the dead back to life. When tragedy hits the family, he decides to test those rumors, and things begin to spiral out of control. With regard to the critics, not everyone is on board with the new interpretation, and those who aren’t feel that the narrative fails to do enough to justify remaking the original. That said, the overall reaction has been positive, with reviews touting the performances for selling their grief with authenticity and the directors for effectively harnessing the more disturbing elements of the source material.The Best of Enemies (2019)  54%By now, most of us have seen our fair share of films that essentially serve as odes to racial reconciliation, heartfelt dramas and dramedies that pit a pair of unlikely partners against each other and gradually bring them into agreement. One of those movies just won Best Picture at the Oscars. This week, we get a new entry in the genre, and critics say it’s earnest but all too familiar. Taraji P. Henson and Sam Rockwell anchor Best of Enemies as civil rights activist Ann Atwater and Ku Klux Klan leader C.P. Ellis, respectively, who were both called up on to lead their North Carolina community in a decision over school segregation in 1971. In the process of co-chairing the summit, the two of them came to terms with each other and learned something about mutual respect. If that sounds like a template you’ve heard before, it’s because you have, and critics are largely split on whether the rest of the film — the acting, the period-accurate trappings — is enough to make up for that. Critics say Best of Enemies is a noble effort buoyed by strong performances, but its by-the-numbers narrative is a little tired, the film fails to portray its characters with much nuance.What’s New on TVThe Twilight Zone: Season 1 (2019)  70%The Twilight Zone explores the strangeness of the modern world through Rod Serling‘s winning formula, creating a thought-provoking — if not always spine-tingling — showcase for Jordan Peele and his exceptional crop of collaborators.Also&nbsp;Opening This Week In Limited Release Amazing Grace (2019) , a concert documentary of Aretha Franklin’s 1972 Los Angeles performance of the titular gospel album, is at 97%.

What are the critics saying?Dark Phoenix (2019)  22%The latest chapter of the X-Men franchise proper (and likely the final one to feature these characters for some time) takes its narrative straight from one of the most beloved and celebrated stories from the comics, and it’s one we’ve seen before. “The Dark Phoenix Saga,” as its known, has been recounted in two different animated series and made its way onto the big screen in the form of 2006’s X-Men: The Last Stand. The writer for that film, Simon Kinberg, who also stuck around to write or produce all of the subsequent films, makes his directorial debut here, following telepathic mutant Jean Grey (Sophie Turner) as she struggles to control the immense — and dangerous — power that awakens within her when she suffers an accident in space. Series regulars James McAvoy, Michael Fassbender, Jennifer Lawrence, Nicholas Hoult, and the rest of the young X-Men all return to reprise their roles, but critics say their efforts here are largely in vain, due to uninspired storytelling, some wooden performances, and a not altogether surprising feeling of “been there, done that.” Die-hard fans may be able to recognize some of Kinberg’s winks and nods in Dark Phoenix, and anyone looking for a two-hour diversion may feel satisfied, but the end result is a decidedly underwhelming franchise conclusion that fails to capitalize on its potential.The Secret Life of Pets 2 (2019)  60%2016’s The Secret Life of Pets did for domesticated cats and dogs what Toy Story did for dolls and action figures, taking audiences on a mostly fun-filled adventure with likable characters voiced by a talented cast. Most of them are back for The Secret Life of Pets 2, which splits the action into three loosely connected narrative threads and, critics say, suffers a little bit for it. Patton Oswalt is game as the replacement voice for Max (previously voiced by Louis C.K.), who freaks out when his owner Katie (Ellie Kemper) brings home a baby; Kevin Hart’s Snowball teams up with newcomer Daisy (Tiffany Haddish) to rescue a white tiger from a circus; and Jenny Slate‘s Gidget attempts to retrieve Max’s favorite toy from a cat-infested neighboring apartment. It’s all harmless stuff that should resonate with younger audiences, and there’s probably just enough to engage everyone else. Just don’t expect to be blown away by any new tricks, as it were.What’s New on TVBig Little Lies: Season 2 (2019)  86%Gorgeous and gripping,&nbsp;Big Little Lies‘s second season doubles down on the dark humor and gives its impressive cast even more juicy drama to chew on — especially the excellent&nbsp;Meryl Streep.The Handmaid's Tale: Season 3 (2019)  81%The Handmaid’s Tale‘s third season reigns in its horrors and inspires hope that revolution really is possible — if only the story would stop spinning its wheels and get to it already.Black Mirror: Season 5 (2019)  68%Though Black Mirror‘s abbreviated fifth season never quite reaches the heights (or surprises) of previous installments, it remains one of TVs strangest philosophical offerings — for better or worse.Also&nbsp;Opening This Week In Limited Release The Last Black Man in San Francisco (2019) ,&nbsp;a drama about a man attempting to reclaim the historic San Francisco home his grandfather built, is Certified Fresh at 93%.

What are the critics saying?Godzilla: King of the Monsters (2019)  42%It’s right there on the packaging:&nbsp;Godzilla: King of the Monsters. What more could you want from a movie about a giant lizard fighting other behemoths for supremacy? Apparently quite a bit, according to the critics. While the film’s impressive cast of humans includes Vera Farmiga, Kyle Chandler, Sally Hawkins, Bradley Whitford, David Strathairn, and Eleven herself, Millie Bobby Brown, the reviews say they don’t offer enough incentive for the story to detour away from the kaiju action. In other words, you know exactly what you’re getting with this movie, and whether or not that’s enough for you as a moviegoer will depend on how much you just want to sit back and watch giant creatures pummel each other. For some, that’s a dream come true; for others, it’s a yawn.Rocketman (2019)  89%Music biopics aren’t a new phenomenon, but with the recent success of Bohemian Rhapsody — and Rami Malek‘s Oscar-winning performance — you can expect a few more to come down the pipeline in the near future. This year already gave us the Netflix feature The&nbsp;Dirt, focusing on hard rockers Mötley Crüe, and this week brings us Rocketman, a fantasy-tinged look back at the life of Elton John. Taron Egerton takes on the challenge of portraying John in the film, which traces his upbringing and musical career, culminating in his lifelong friendship with songwriter Bernie Taupin (played by Jamie Bell). It also happens to be directed by Dexter Fletcher, the same man who took over and completed Bohemian Rhapsody in the wake of Bryan Singer‘s dismissal from the project. Critics say Rocketman is an affectionate, entertaining portrait that benefits from Egerton’s powerhouse performance, John’s indelible music, and some inventive cinematic flourishes, and it should both please longtime fans and serve as a worthy introduction for neophytes.Ma (2019)  56%Director Tate Taylor has employed the talents of Octavia Spencer in almost every one of his films to date, and in 2011, their work together on The Help earned Spencer an Oscar for Best Supporting Actress. Their latest collaboration, Ma, is their first thriller, and while critics don’t see any Academy Awards in the film’s future, they largely agree it benefits a great deal from Spencer’s presence in the central role. She plays Sue Ann, a lonely veterinary assistant who buddies up to a group of local teens by purchasing liquor for them and offering her basement as a safe space for them to party. Soon enough, the teens discover Sue Ann isn’t quite what she seems, and things take a sinister turn. Critics say Ma has a lot of potential that it doesn’t quite capitalize on, but Spencer is clearly enjoying herself, and her charismatic performance goes a long way toward making up for the story’s pacing issues and narrative problems. It’s a tad predictable, but the scenario is wacky and unusual enough — and Spencer is so fun to watch — that for some, it might just be worth the price of admission.What’s New on TVSwamp Thing: Season 1 (2018)  92%By leaning into the horror of it all, Swamp Thing swims deep into the trenches of this strange world and returns with a scary good TV show.When They See Us: Season 1 (2019)  97%Ava DuVernay pulls no punches in When They See Us, laying out the harrowing events endured by the Central Park Five while adding a necessary layer of humanity to their story that challenges viewers to reconsider what it means to find justice in America.Good Omens: Miniseries (2019)  84%A smörgåsbord of heavenly imagery and irreverent hilarity, Good Omens works thanks to to Michael Sheen and David Tennant‘s very-nearly-holy (or maybe unholy?) chemistry — though, at only six episodes long, it’s a rare adaptation that may have benefited from being a little less faithful to the good book.Also&nbsp;Opening This Week In Limited Release Too Late to Die Young (Tarde para morir joven) (2019) ,&nbsp;a coming-of-age drama about three kids growing up in the post-Pinochet Chile of 1990, is at 100%.

What are the critics saying?Avengers: Endgame (2019)  94%Well, it’s finally here. After over a decade and 21 films, the great — and wildly successful — experiment that has been the Marvel Cinematic Universe is ready to bring its first volume to a close. We say “first volume” because, by all indications, the franchise is set to continue for the near future, even if we can’t quite predict whether or not the upcoming slate of Marvel movies will be anywhere near as successful. Avengers: Endgame follows up on last year’s Infinity War, which ended with half of all life being snapped into oblivion by big bad Thanos, by bringing together the remaining heroes to figure out if there’s anything they can do to fix the situation. We’ll refrain from spoilers here, but suffice it to say critics are largely quite pleased with how Endgame brings everything full circle, providing epic battles, poignant character moments, and suitably satisfying conclusions to some narrative threads. In other words, this is everything Marvel fans could hope for, and those who have been following along with the exploits of Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, Hulk, Black Widow, Hawkeye, and the rest of the gang should leave the theater fully content, if maybe a little bit sad.Also&nbsp;Opening This Week In Limited Release Little Woods (2019) ,&nbsp;starring Tessa Thompson and Lily James in a drama about two wayward sisters who attempt to settle their recently deceased mother’s mortgage debt, is Certified Fresh at 97%.

What are the critics saying?Us (2019)  93%Remember when Jordan Peele was just one half of the comedy duo that made fun of football players’ names, geeked out about “Liam Neesons,” and participated in the 1987 Jazz Fit Championships?&nbsp;That all changed, of course, with 2017’s Get Out, when he revealed he had a knack for working behind the camera as well. This week, audiences will be treated to the highly anticipated follow-up to that film, Us, and it looks like they will not be disappointed. The film follows a young family who embark on a seaside vacation to Santa Cruz, only to be confronted by bad omens and, eventually, evil doppelgängers of themselves. Who are they, where did they come from, and what do they want? Critics say Us is an ambitious, inventive horror film that isn’t just suitably terrifying but also thoughtful in ways that aren’t immediately apparent. The performances are top-notch, and the film deftly combines thrills with subtle social commentary and even a few laughs to ease the tension. In other words, Jordan Peele has delivered another winner and further established himself as one of the most exciting young talents to watch.Gloria Bell (2019)  91%Before Chilean writer-director Sebastián Lelio won the Best Foreign Language Film Oscar for A Fantastic Woman last year, he came to prominence with a slice-of-life drama called Gloria in 2013. That film, which starred Paulina García as a lonely, free-spirited woman who discovers romance as she navigates through middle age, earned almost universal acclaim, so it would be natural to approach Lelio’s own English-language remake of it with some skepticism. Thankfully, critics say Gloria Bell, which recasts García’s role with Julianne Moore and co-stars John Turturro as her would-be lover, carries a poignant charm all its own. The kudos have come largely in the form of praise for Moore’s vulnerable, magentic performance in the lead role, and for Lelio’s measured treatment of a story that could have easily devolved into melodrama. Even for those who have seen the original, Gloria Bell is an engaging and quietly affecting showcase for a confident director and a powerhouse actor.Cruel Intentions (1999)  55%Back in 1999, teen movies were all the rage; see American Pie, Election, The Virgin Suicides, and Varsity Blues, just to name a few. One particular subset of the genre, modernized adaptations of classic literature, was especially successful, bringing us hits like 10 Things I Hate About You and She’s All That, and this week, one of them gets a re-release to celebrate its 20th anniversary. Cruel Intentions cast the glittery quartet of Sarah Michelle Gellar, Reese Witherspoon, Ryan Phillippe, and Selma Blair in a contemporary, high school-set version of Pierre Choderlos de Laclos’s steamy novel Dangerous Liaisons, and it went on to earn over $75 million worldwide. The film, which centers on a pair of stepsiblings who engage in a competitive game of predatory seduction, has drawn something of a cult following over the years, so if you’re a fan, now’s your chance to catch it on the big screen again.What’s New on TVThe Act: Season 1 (2019)  88%Disturbingly nuanced performances from Patricia Arquette and Joey King make The Act a convincing case for the ongoing dramatization of true crime stories.Also&nbsp;Opening This Week In Limited Release Roll Red Roll (2019) ,&nbsp;a documentary about the sexual assault scandal that rocked a small-town high school football team in Ohio, is at 100%.

What are the critics saying?Long Shot (2019)  81%It’s probably no surprise that the title&nbsp;Long Shot&nbsp;holds a double meaning. For one, it refers to the relationship between a shlubby out-of-work journalist played by Seth Rogen and the ambitious, immaculately put-together woman who used to babysit him, played by Charlize Theron. But it also refers to the presidential campaign run by Theron’s character, the U.S. Secretary of State hoping to parlay her success in that role into a bid for the White House. Luckily, according to the critics, the far-fetched romance works, largely thanks to the talents of Theron and Rogen, who make a lively if unlikely couple and play off each other with an easy chemistry. As for the politics? Well, they’re really there to provide an excuse for Rogen and Theron to get into improper hijinks, and evidently, most of it works. Does everything turn a little mushy at the end? Maybe, but with Rogen and Theron doing ace work and director&nbsp;Jonathan Levine&nbsp;more in&nbsp;50/50&nbsp;mode than&nbsp;Snatched&nbsp;mode,&nbsp;Long Shot&nbsp;is a funny, sometimes even thoughtful comedy that hits more often than it misses.UglyDolls (2019)  27%You’d think that making a movie based on a non-narrative toy would be a difficult enough endeavor to discourage most people from taking it on, but success stories like The LEGO Movie and Trolls have given some studios the courage to try anyway. It’s in that spirit that we have UglyDolls, an animated feature based on the popular plush toys of the same name, and unfortunately, critics are largely unimpressed with it. Kelly Clarkson and Nick Jonas headline an all-star cast of pop artists and comedians lending their voices to the film, which follows the adventures of an upbeat UglyDoll named Moxy who strikes out on a journey to find the human world and be accepted by a child. Along the way, she and her friends come across the Institute of Perfection, whose leader Lou will do everything in his power to stop her. Critics say the film’s core message of self-acceptance is admirable, but one we’ve encountered time and time again in the genre, and it’s not delivered in a particularly inventive way here. UglyDolls also cribs rather blatantly from its better predecessors, and its would-be anthems are catchy but ultimately disposable. There’s nothing terribly offensive about the movie, but it’s likely to appeal only to the youngest audiences.The Intruder (2019)  33%What’s creepier than looking outside your window and seeing Dennis Quaid nonchalantly mowing your lawn? Not a whole lot, according to The Intruder, which follows young couple Scott and Annie (played by Michael Ealy and Meagan Good), who purchase and move into a new home previously owned by a man named Charlie Peck (Quaid). As it turns out, Charlie’s having a hard time letting go, and he may or may not have an unhealthy obsession with Annie, which leads to a series of increasingly alarming intrusions until it becomes an outright home invasion. If this all sounds like boilerplate stuff to you, the critics mostly agree, calling The Intruder a lackluster thriller that’s undone by its own strange twists and lapses of logic. Dennis Quaid is pretty spot on as an entitled sociopath, though, so viewers may get some mileage out of that.El Chicano (2019)  40%With the Avengers taking up all of the superhero pop culture real estate of late, it’s almost refreshing to come across a more small-scale tale of justice, particularly one as steeped in an underrepresented culture as El Chicano is. Unfortunately, critics say the effort is mostly wasted here. Raul Castillo stars as an LAPD detective on the trail of a cartel kingpin looking to expand into Los Angeles who, inspired by childhood tales of — and a personal encounter with — a mythical figure called “El Chicano,” decides to take on the persona to fight crime outside the law. While reviews tout Castillo’s effective brooding, they also note that the film lacks nuance, with thinly drawn characters whose backstories feel perfunctory rather than enlightening. El Chicano is ultimately a dark, overly gritty crime procedural-cum-vigilante thriller that relies on cliche and fails to reach its ambitious goals, but it may still serve an audience hungry for something akin to a Latino Batman.Also&nbsp;Opening This Week In Limited Release Knock Down the House (2019) ,&nbsp;a documentary chronicling the efforts of four women who ran for Congress in the 2018 U.S. midterm elections, is Certified Fresh at 100%.

What are the critics saying?Toy Story 4 (2019)  97%“Do we really need another&nbsp;Toy Story movie?”&nbsp;For a significant chunk of moviegoers, that was the first question that came to mind when&nbsp;Toy Story 4 was announced, but here we are, almost a decade after&nbsp;Toy Story 3, and it looks like the wait was worth it. Tom Hanks, Tim Allen, and most of the rest of the voice cast are back — albeit in a slightly more limited capacity — in a new adventure that centers on a homemade toy named Forky (voiced by Tony Hale) who’s having trouble comprehending and accepting his own existence. Woody takes it upon himself to help Forky fit in, and in the process, he reconnects with an old friend and begins to reexamine his own choices. It was always going to take a monumental achievement to make a return trip to this universe worthwhile, and by most accounts, critics say first-time director Josh Cooley has succeeded.&nbsp;The Certified Fresh&nbsp;Toy Story 4&nbsp;is yet another triumph for Pixar that&nbsp;somehow manages to&nbsp;find poignant new ways to tug on heartstrings and entertain audiences of all ages, and with a supporting voice cast of new characters that includes Christina Hendricks, Key &amp; Peele, and Keanu Reeves, this one is poised to be another hit.Child's Play (2019)  63%Speaking of sentient toys that belong (or once belonged) to a boy named Andy, we’ve also got&nbsp;Lars Klevberg‘s reboot of&nbsp;Child’s Play hitting theaters this week. Now, this one was made without the involvement of original series creator Don Mancini, who himself is planning a&nbsp;Child’s Play TV series, or Brad Dourif, who was replaced by Mark Hamill as the voice of killer doll Chucky. The origin story is also different this time around, as Chucky is no longer the reanimated soul of a serial killer, but simply an out-of-control A.I. robot whose only crime is that he loves too intensely. The object of his affections? A lonely tween named Andy (Gabriel Bateman) whose single mother Karen (Aubrey Plaza) gifts him the killer doll for his birthday. Critics say this modernized take on&nbsp;Child’s Play&nbsp;is both more timely and a little less interesting, and while the film often seems aware of its own silliness, it doesn’t always fully commit to one tone. Still, it’s a mostly entertaining romp with some gruesome kills, a healthy sense of humor, and, for some, likely a few surprises.Anna (2019)  33%Going all the way back to&nbsp;La Femme Nikita and&nbsp;The Fifth Element — and more recently with&nbsp;Lucy — writer-director Luc Besson has enjoyed pretty consistent success with action films driven by female protagonists, even if his work outside those parameters hasn’t always been quite as impressive. He returns to that well again in this week’s&nbsp;Anna, which&nbsp;is unmistakably a familiar tale, but mostly because it sat on a shelf for a year while the similarly themed&nbsp;Atomic Blonde and&nbsp;Red Sparrow beat it to theaters.&nbsp;Former supermodel Sasha Luss plays the titular character,&nbsp;a Cold War era KGB agent literally posing as a model who gets wrapped up in an international tug of war between her agency and the CIA; car chases and double-crosses ensue. Unsurprisingly,&nbsp;Anna was not widely screened for critics, so we currently only have the bare minimum number of reviews to generate a Tomatometer score. For what it’s worth, the few critics who have chimed in so far say the movie bears some recognizable Besson trademarks, and whether you find them entertaining or bothersome will largely depend on your affection for his previous work.What’s New on TVDas Boot: Season 1 (2018)  85%Das Boot possesses the atmospheric pressure of its cinematic forebear while adding new depth to its compelling ensemble, making for a riveting international production.City on a Hill: Season 1 (2019)  76%Though City on a Hill‘s meandering story can’t quite match its ambitions, it’s entertaining — and even occasionally riveting — to watch Kevin Bacon and company take on bureaucracy.Also&nbsp;Opening This Week In Limited Release Emanuel (2019) ,&nbsp;a documentary about the aftermath of the 2015 mass shooting at the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in South Carolina, is at 100%.

Reilly) and a ruthless veep (Vice,&nbsp;starring&nbsp;Christian Bale&nbsp;and&nbsp;Amy Adams).&nbsp;What are the critics saying?Holmes and Watson (2018)  10%One of the most enduring literary characters of all time, Sherlock Holmes has been portrayed on stage, television, and film hundreds of times by dozens of actors, from Basil Rathbone to Robert Downey Jr. to Benedict Cumberbatch. With this week’s Holmes &amp; Watson, Will Ferrell adds his name to the list, appearing opposite Step Brothers co-star John C. Reilly as the iconic duo, whose talents are enlisted to help prevent the assassination of the Queen of England. Unfortunately, critics almost unanimously agree that this comedic take on Sir Arthur Conan Doyle’s legendary sleuth is an unfortunate misfire that squanders the talents of all involved, including a supporting cast that includes Ralph Fiennes, Rebecca Hall, Kelly Macdonald, and Rob Brydon. There are far better comedies showcasing the chemistry between Ferrell and Reilly, and the unwieldy mix of anachronistic references and potty humor on display here do little to reinforce their on-screen legacy.Vice (2018)  65%After directing a series of absurd comedies starring Will Ferrell like the Anchorman movies, Talladega Nights, and Step Brothers, Adam McKay took a soft turn into more adult territory with 2015’s&nbsp;The Big Short, an unusual and inventive look at the housing bubble that led to the 2008 financial crisis. This week marks the next step in his evolution, as he tackles the rise to power of former U.S. Vice President Dick Cheney with similar storytelling panache in Vice, starring Christian Bale as the enigmatic veep, Amy Adams as his wife Lynne, Steve Carell as Donald Rumsfeld, and Sam Rockwell as George W. Bush. Critics say McKay’s irreverent tone sometimes feels like a mismatch for the serious material the film covers, but it’s nevertheless an ambitious undertaking that’s made better by strong performances from its A-list cast — especially Bale, who disappears into the role under eerily spot-on makeup and more than a few extra pounds. While it may not be as incisive or amusing as The Big Short, Vice is still worth a watch for a glimpse into the life of a famously unknowable man.Also&nbsp;Opening This Week In Limited Release Stan &amp; Ollie (2019) ,&nbsp;starring Steve Coogan and John C. Reilly in a profile of the iconic comedic duo Laurel &amp; Hardy’s later years, is at 89%.

That was likely the thought behind The Upside, a remake of the 2011 comedy The Intouchables, which was a wildly successful hit in its native France. Kevin Hart stars as an ex-con who stumbles into a job interview to be the full-time caretaker of a wealthy quadriplegic (Bryan Cranston). He accepts the position, and as the two get to know each other, an unexpected bond begins to form between them. Critics say the film’s talented leads give it everything they’ve got, but they’re unable to escape the by-the-numbers execution and overly sentimental, cliche-ridden script. Fans of Hart and Cranston may find it worth a watch, but you’re likely better off catching the original.A Dog's Way Home (2019)  59%We love puppies as much as anyone, but seriously, what’s with all the dog-themed movies lately? Last summer, we saw&nbsp;Dog Days,&nbsp;Alpha, and&nbsp;A.X.L. all open within a span of two weeks, and&nbsp;this week, we get&nbsp;A Dog’s Way Home. To be fair, they haven’t all been bad —&nbsp;Alpha was surprisingly Certified Fresh — and when it comes to entertaining young audiences, the bar is typically set pretty low. That said,&nbsp;A Dog’s Way Home, which follows the adventures of its titular lost canine as it treks 400 miles across Colorado wilderness to return to its owner, isn’t half bad, according to the critics. They say it’s appropriately adorable and heartfelt,&nbsp;even if it’s surprisingly a little dark for its target audience&nbsp;and feels like something we’ve seen before. It should make for a solid night at the movies for the family, as long as you bring enough tissues for everyone.On the Basis of Sex (2019)  72%Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg is enjoying a unique moment in the spotlight right now, and not necessarily for any reason pertaining to one of her famous dissents. After the book about her exploits,&nbsp;Notorious RBG: The Life and Times of Ruth Bader Ginsburg, became a New York Times bestseller in 2015, a documentary titled simply&nbsp;RBG was released last year to widespread acclaim. In addition, we also got a biographical drama called&nbsp;On the Basis of Sex, which follows a young Ginsburg (Felicity Jones) during her years in law school, her professorship at Rutgers, and her earliest efforts to battle gender discrimination through legal means. This week,&nbsp;On the Basis of Sex&nbsp;expands into wide release, and critics say it’s an inspiring portrait of an endlessly fascinating woman during a watershed moment in her career, even if it plays it fairly safe and relies a bit too heavily on familiar storytelling beats. It isn’t particularly deep, but it’s well-acted and probably worth a watch for anyone curious about Ginsburg’s early career.If Beale Street Could Talk (2019)  95%In 2016, director Barry Jenkins took home a slew of awards, including the Academy Award for Best Picture (botched announcements aside), for his romantic drama&nbsp;Moonlight.&nbsp;That film&nbsp;was based on a play by&nbsp;Tarell Alvin McCraney, who also took home an Oscar for Best Adapted Screenplay for his work on the script. Following on the heels of that, Jenkins brings us another romance based on existing material,&nbsp;If Beale Street Could Talk, adapted from the novel by celebrated writer James Baldwin. Newcomer Kiki Layne plays Tish Rivers, a young woman in early 1970s Harlem working to free her wrongly imprisoned fiancé Fonny (Stephan James) before their child is born — the story jumps from the present to&nbsp;flashbacks of their courtship and the events leading to Fonny’s arrest. Another film expanding to wide release this week after a limited opening in late 2018,&nbsp;Beale Street has already racked up all kinds of awards, including a Golden Globe win for supporting actress Regina King, and critics say it’s a powerful, thought-provoking love story buoyed by incredible performances. Look for this one to continue picking up trophies as the awards season continues.Replicas (2019)  11%There are those who say Keanu Reeves doesn’t age, that he’s some sort of supernatural being sent to bless us with exceedingly friendly fan interactions, meme-worthy candid photos, and feature films of frequently unpredictable quality for as long as Hollywood will allow. Reeves may or may not be immortal, but his on-screen family in the new film&nbsp;Replicas certainly is not. They perish tragically in a car accident, and this fuels his character’s obsessive&nbsp;quest to grow clones of his wife and three kids in order to re-implant facsimiles of their consciousness and bring them back to life, as it were. It’s a personal take on a frequently explored sci-fi theme, and we’d love to tell you what the reviews are saying about it, but Replicas&nbsp;wasn’t screened for critics.

Ultimately, after years of delays, Cameron found himself occupied by Avatar and its sequels, so he handed the reins over to Robert Rodriguez. The film centers on a scientist (Christoph Waltz) who discovers a deactivated cyborg (played in motion-capture by Rosa Salazar) in a junkyard and gives her a new body, only to realize her previous function was much more lethal. Alita: Battle Angel has impressed critics with its groundbreaking, immersive special effects — par for the course with any film produced by James Cameron — but it takes some of its narrative cues from better films that have come before. It’s an eye-popping theater experience, to be sure, and if that’s what you’re looking for, Alita delivers enough entertainment value to keep you in your seat. Just don’t expect to be blown away — or even particularly engaged — by its story.\n\n            \n        \n\n\n        \n            \n                Isn't It Romantic (2019)  70%\n            \n            \n                \n            \n            \n              \nThe danger in making a film that aims to be a genre takedown is that it can easily fall prey to the same cliches it’s attempting to ridicule, resulting in a final product that feels disingenuous and sometimes phony. In other words, it’s an incredibly risky proposition, and according to the reviews, this week’s Isn’t It Romantic just manages to pull it off, mostly thanks to its star, Rebel Wilson. The story follows a cynical architect who wakes up from a mugging encounter to discover that she has become the star of her own romantic comedy. Critics say the meta narrative, while not entirely fresh, still offers a few surprises and clever gags, and Wilson lights up the screen as the unwilling protagonist of her own love story. It doesn’t have much of a story outside of its initial high-concept premise, and it’s perhaps not as smart as it thinks it is, but you could definitely do worse for a Valentine’s date movie.\n\n            \n        \n\n\n        \n            \n                Happy Death Day 2U (2019)  71%\n            \n            \n                \n            \n            \n              \nIn 2017, Universal and Blumhouse mixed the trappings of a classic slasher film with the déjà vu antics of Groundhog Day and achieved surprisingly effective results, so this week we get a return trip through the time loop with a slightly different twist. Jessica Rothe reprises her role as college student Tree Gelbman once again finds herself reliving the same day over and over again. Only thing is, this time around, the person responsible for her death in the first film is also murdered here, which means there’s a new killer on the loose. Critics say Happy Death Day 2U isn’t quite as much fun as the original — as the Arizona Republic’s Bill Goodykoontz writes, “a movie can only be a pleasant surprise once” — and it gets a little bogged down in trying to explain why what’s happening is happening, but it still packs some bloody thrills and hearty chuckles for the horror-comedy aficionados among us.\n\n            \n        \n\nWhat’s New on TV\n\n\n\n    \n        Doom Patrol: Season 1 (2019)  96%\n    \n    \n        \n    \n    \n      \nDC Universe finds breakout material in this iteration of Doom Patrol thanks to a fully committed cast and the writing’s faith in weirdness.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        The Umbrella Academy: Season 1 (2019)  76%\n    \n    \n        \n    \n    \n      \nThe Umbrella Academy unfurls an imaginative yarn with furtive emotion and an exceptionally compelling ensemble, but the series’ dour sensibility often clashes with its splashy genre trappings.\n\n    \n\n\nAlso&nbsp;Opening This Week In Limited Release\n\n Hotel by the River (2019) , Hong Sang-soo‘s drama about a dying man who retreats to a hotel and meets two women, is at 94%.\n Birds of Passage (Pájaros de verano) (2019) ,&nbsp;a crime drama about an indigenous Wayúu man in 1970s Colombia who enters the illicit drug trade to support his family, is Certified Fresh at 91%.\n Fighting with My Family (2019) ,&nbsp;starring Florence Pugh and Nick Frost in Stephen Merchant‘s comedic look at the ascent of wrestling superstar Paige, is at 91%.\n Sorry Angel (Plaire, aimer et courir vite) (2019) ,&nbsp;a 1990s-set romance about a writer with AIDS who meets and falls in love with a young filmmaker, is at 88%.\n Ruben Brandt, Collector (2019) ,&nbsp;an animated film about a troubled man who embarks on a crime spree as a means of therapy, is at 83%.\n Mega Time Squad (2019) ,&nbsp;about a petty criminal who steals an ancient time-travel device and discovers how dangerous it is, is at 75%.\n Donnybrook (2019) ,&nbsp;which follows three characters in a no-holds-barred underground cage-fighting tournament, is at 48%.\n Patrick (2019) ,&nbsp;about a struggling young woman who is gifted a spoiled pug, is at 36%.\n\n                                            \n                \n            ","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"Apple, kids, joker, kong","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/14163634/Alita_Battle_Angel_CC_Rep.jpg","slug":"alita-battle-angel-is-style-over-substance-but-the-style-is-killer"},{"id":"47508741374267","title":"Aquaman Is See-Worthy","content":"Critics Consensusvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Aquaman Is See-WorthyPlus, Mary Poppins Returns, Bumblebee, The Favourite, and Vanity Fair are Certified Fresh, but Second Act and Welcome to Marwen disappoint.by Ryan Fujitani | December 20, 2018 |  CommentsThis weekend at the movies,&nbsp;we’ve&nbsp;got an origin story (Aquaman,&nbsp;starring&nbsp;Jason Momoa&nbsp;and&nbsp;Amber Heard),&nbsp;a&nbsp;magical&nbsp;visitor (Mary Poppins Returns,&nbsp;starring&nbsp;Emily Blunt&nbsp;and&nbsp;Lin-Manuel Miranda),&nbsp;a&nbsp;bug’s life&nbsp;(Bumblebee,&nbsp;starring&nbsp;Hailee Steinfeld&nbsp;and&nbsp;John Cena), an ad maven (Second Act,&nbsp;starring&nbsp;Jennifer Lopez&nbsp;and&nbsp;Leah Remini), a&nbsp;fantasy artist (Welcome to Marwen,&nbsp;starring&nbsp;Steve Carell&nbsp;and&nbsp;Leslie Mann),&nbsp;a royal rivalry (The Favourite,&nbsp;starring&nbsp;Emma Stone&nbsp;and&nbsp;Rachel Weisz), and another royal rivalry (Mary Queen of Scots,&nbsp;starring&nbsp;Saoirse Ronan&nbsp;and&nbsp;Margot Robbie).&nbsp;What are the critics saying?Aquaman (2018)  65%Aquaman may not be the coolest or most popular DC Comics character to find his way to the big screen, but if Jason Momoa has any say in the matter, the chracter’s reputation is about to change. In his first solo outing, the half human, half Atlantean prince must contend with not only a threat of war from his home kingdom but also an adversary with a personal vendetta. It’s a swirl of special effects and blockbuster action that critics say is appropriately super-sized and a welcome continuation of the fun, lighter tone of Wonder Woman, and it’s aided by a stellar cast that includes Amber Heard, Nicole Kidman, Willem Dafoe, and Patrick Wilson. That said, Aquaman‘s over-the-top antics may not be for everyone, and those in search of a decidedly less CGI-driven movie will almost certainly want to look elsewhere.Mary Poppins Returns (2018)  80%How do you follow up a celebrated classic movie musical featuring one of Hollywood’s favorite stars with over half a century’s worth of adoration lavished up on it? It certainly doesn’t hurt if you cast someone of, say, Emily Blunt’s caliber in the central role and recruit multiple Tony Award-winner Lin-Manuel Miranda to bring life to some of the big song-and-dance numbers. In Mary Poppins Returns, Blunt plays the magical nanny, who pays a visit to now grown-up Banks children Michael (Ben Whishaw) and Jane (Emily Mortimer) in order to impart a few more life lessons to Michael’s own three children. While it’s near impossible not to invite comparisons to the 1964 Julie Andrews original, critics say Emily Blunt is charming in the role, and Mary Poppins Returns succeeds in channeling its predecessor’s familiar magic to deliver a satisfying, whimsical adventure for the whole family.Bumblebee (2018)  90%The films of the Transformers franchise have never been critical darlings (the first is the highest-rated at 57%), but they’ve consistently made boatloads of money, so it wasn’t altogether surprising that, after five installments, Paramount decided it was time for a spinoff. The result is this week’s Bumblebee, a prequel story set in 1987 that recounts the fan-favorite sidekick’s first days on Earth as an Autobot scout tasked with setting up a base of operations. His efforts are thwarted by a pair of Decepticons, and suffering from amnesia, he befriends a teenager (Hailee Steinfeld) who helps him get his groove back. Directed by Travis Knight (Kubo and the Two Strings), Bumblebee has drawn the best reviews of the franchise from critics who say its focus on a smaller-scale story, its revamped retro character designs, and its emphasis on genuine emotion make it a series standout, and it’s already Certified Fresh.Second Act (2018)  43%If there’s any time of the year best-suited for wish fulfillment, it’s the holiday season, and if there’s any actress best-suited to play a working woman who overcomes unlikely odds on the way to success, it might be Jennifer Lopez. In Second Act, Lopez plays struggling retail manager Maya, who is mistakenly hired as a high-level marketing consultant and uses the opportunity to turn her life around. Unfortunately, while critics say Lopez is clearly committed to her role and the film aims for the heart with its feelgood message, it’s also suffers from unusual tonal shifts, an unfocused narrative, and shopworn platitudes. That said, it works as a bit of counterprogramming against the big-budget fare opening this week and might serve as a pleasant enough diversion for anyone who knows what they’re getting into.Welcome to Marwen (2018)  34%In 2000, a man named Mark Hogancamp was severely beaten outside of a bar and suffered a nine-day coma that left him with partial brain damage. Unable to recall much of his life before the incident, he found comfort in crafting a miniature World War II-era town in his back yard as a form of therapy. Hogancamp’s story came to public attention with the help of a photographer who discovered his work and the acclaimed 2010 documentary Marwencol, but this week, it gets the biopic treatment courtesy of director Robert Zemeckis and star Steve Carell, who plays Hogancamp himself. Mixing live-action with fantastical recreations of Hogancamp’s unique art, Welcome to Marwen&nbsp;follows the tragic events that resulted in Hogancamp’s condition and explores his relationships to the powerful women he depicts in his work. Unfortunately, critics say the film largely fails to comprehend why Hogancamp’s journey is so remarkable, choosing instead to lather on phony sentimentality and&nbsp;focus more on&nbsp;showcasing its spectacular effects than the human story at its core.The Favourite (2018)  93%In the first of two films based on true stories about regal squabbling that are expanding into wide release this week, we have Yorgos Lanthimos‘ The Favourite. The film stars Olivia Colman as 18th century British monarch Queen Anne, Rachel Weisz as the Queen’s advisor and secret lover Sarah Churchill, and Emma Stone as Abigail Hill, the younger cousin of Sarah who schemes to repair her tarnished reputation by replacing Sarah as the Queen’s “favourite.” Critics say the performances from all three stars, as well as the razor-sharp writing from Deborah Davis and Tony McNamara, are stellar, and Lanthimos’ wry sense of humor fits perfectly into the perdiod setting and darkly comic history being depicted. It’s already won a number of awards heading into Oscar season, so don’t be surprised to see it when the nominations are announced.Mary Queen of Scots (2018)  62%Two weeks ago, when there were no new films opening in wide release, we chose to lead with a period drama that was only hitting 4 theaters. So of course it had choose the week when we had 6 other wide releases to expand. For those of you who missed it last time, Academy Award nominees Saoirse Ronan and Margot Robbie co-star as Mary Stuart and Queen Elizabeth I, respectively, in Mary Queen of Scots, which focuses on the former’s return to the Scottish throne and her challenge to the latter’s claim over Scotland. Critical reaction to the film has waned quite a bit since its initial release, but most still agree that its two celebrated young stars are consistently compelling to watch, even if it all doesn’t quite add up to the sum of its impressive parts. If you read about Mary Queen of Scots here two weeks ago and lamented the fact that it wasn’t playing near you, go and check again, and you may find yourself spending an evening with Ronan and Robbie.What’s New on TVVanity Fair: Miniseries (2018)  89%Olivia Cooke‘s brilliant portrayal of the feisty and scheming Becky Sharp in Vanity Fair makes this adaptation of Thackeray’s classic novel more relatable for a 21st century audience.Also&nbsp;Opening This Week In Limited Release Cold War (Zimna wojna) (2018) ,&nbsp;Pawel Pawlikowski‘s romantic drama about a&nbsp;singer and a jazz musician&nbsp;living in 1950s Poland who fall in love and find their relationship tested by Cold War politics, is Certified Fresh at 93%.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"love, Country, Elton, tv, dragons, review, Plus","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/20182246/Aquaman_CC.jpg","slug":"aquaman-is-see-worthy"},{"id":"47508741366071","title":"Critics Shatter Glass","content":"Critics Consensusvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Critics Shatter GlassPlus, Dragon Ball Super: Broly is a treat for fans, Netflix's new doc is Fyre, and season 2 of The Punisher is a disappointment.by Ryan Fujitani | January 17, 2019 |  CommentsThis weekend at the movies,&nbsp;we’ve&nbsp;got&nbsp;superheroes&nbsp;(Glass,&nbsp;starring&nbsp;Samuel L. Jackson, Bruce Willis,&nbsp;and&nbsp;James McAvoy) and Super Saiyans (Dragon Ball Super: Broly).&nbsp;What are the critics saying?Glass (2019)  36%In 2000, before superhero movies were all the rage, director M. Night Shyamalan followed up his breakout hit&nbsp;The Sixth Sense with&nbsp;Unbreakable, starring Bruce Willis as a security guard who discovers he possesses supernatural powers. It earned a cult following over the ensuing decade and a half, when Shyamalan’s thriller&nbsp;Split revealed itself to be a sequel to the film. This week, we close out the trilogy with&nbsp;Glass, which reunites Willis’ David Dunn with&nbsp;Unbreakable co-star Samuel L. Jackson’s Elijah Price and&nbsp;Split star James McAvoy’s Kevin Wendell Crumb, as all three find themselves captured in the same mental hospital, facing off against a mysterious psychiatrist. Critics say that, despite a few&nbsp;entertaining flourishes,&nbsp;Glass fails to capitalize on the inventiveness of its predecessors and succumbs to Shyamalan’s most indulgent tendencies.Dragon Ball Super: Broly (2019)  82%If you’re an average moviegoer, you may not have seen much marketing behind Dragon Ball Super: Broly, but rest assured that the series it represents has been popular with young audiences for decades, and those who are fans are likely aware of the film’s existence. This is, in fact, the 20th feature film to come from the iconic&nbsp;Dragon Ball anime series, and it focuses on series protagonists Goku and Vegeta’s encounters with another Saiyan like them, Broly, with tragic connections to their past. If you’re a&nbsp;Dragon Ball fan who’s been waiting for the film to open, critic reviews aren’t going to mean much to you, but for what it’s worth, most of them say it’s packed with eye-popping, beautifully animated action, and it reintroduces a character many fans feel was mishandled in the past. If you’re unfamiliar with the series, chances are you’ll be lost, but for those who have kept up, this should be a treat.What’s New on TVA Discovery of Witches: Season 1 (2018)  94%A Discovery of Witches smartly grounds its flights of fancy with a lived-in authenticity and harnesses the chemistry between its two star-crossed leads to make for a promising foray into the occult.[Premiering Thursday 1/17 on Sundance Now.]Fyre (2019)  92%Fyre&nbsp;smolders with agonizing tension when a party in paradise goes awry, but this slickly assembled documentary reserves its greatest horror for damning observations about the fallacy of opulence.[Streaming Friday 1/18 on Netflix.]Brexit (2019)  80%With acerbic wit and a mesmerizingly eccentric performance from Benedict Cumberbatch, Brexit energetically renders recent history with unflinching poise.[Airing Saturday 1/19 on HBO.]Marvel's The Punisher: Season 2 (2019)  61%The Punisher‘s second season leaves fans torn between the undeniably action-packed fun and the underwhelming portrayal of the charismatic Frank Castle.[Streaming Friday 1/18 on Netflix.]Also&nbsp;Opening This Week In Limited Release What Is Democracy?

Even before that film went into production, however, Warner Bros. had already begun development on their own adaptation of Kipling’s book, with Christian Bale, Cate Blanchett, Benedict Cumberbatch, and Naomie Harris lending their voices to the animal characters and Andy Serkis, who voices Mowgli’s bear friend Baloo, at the helm as director. The end result is Mowgli: Legend of the Jungle, a decidedly darker take on the source material that follows a young boy raised by wolves who must decide whether to remain in the jungle or return to civilization. The film opens in a handful of theaters this week, with an eventual release on Netflix next Friday, and according to critics, its move to the streaming platform may have been a strategic one by Warner Bros. While Serkis’ passion for the project is clear and the A-list cast is reliably effective, critics say Mowgli suffers from comparisons to the Disney film, both in the quality of its special effects and in the consistency of its tone, and the final product is a messy — if ambitious — misfire.The Possession of Hannah Grace (2018)  18%It would be easy to dismiss any horror film with the word “possession” in its title as simply another riff on the formula that&nbsp;William Friedkin’s&nbsp;The Exorcist&nbsp;made popular. Fortunately, this week’s&nbsp;The Possession of Hannah Grace&nbsp;seems to understand that and takes the concept in a slightly different direction. Shay Mitchell stars as Megan, a night-shifter working alone in a hospital morgue where the mutilated body of a woman who died during an exorcism is delivered. The woman, of course, is Hannah Grace, and as Megan eventually discovers, she may not be quite as dead as everyone seems to think. Is the twist on the genre enough to set the film apart from its peers, and does its R rating mean we can expect more brutal thrills than your typical teen-friendly horror movie? We can’t really say, since&nbsp;The Possession of Hannah Grace&nbsp;wasn’t screened for critics.

This week at the movies,&nbsp;we’ve&nbsp;got a death trap masquerading as entertainment&nbsp;(Escape Room,&nbsp;starring&nbsp;Deborah Ann Woll&nbsp;and&nbsp;Taylor Russell).&nbsp;What are the critics saying?Escape Room (2019)  51%For decades, Hollywood has tapped into the zeitgeist for inspiration to come up with new and inventive ways to scare the pants off audiences, and if there’s any modern phenomenon absolutely ripe for the horror flick treatment, it’s the rising popularity of escape rooms. Enter the aptly titled Escape Room, which brings together six strangers from varying backgrounds to navigate a series of increasingly deadly themed rooms designed to test their mettle — or maybe there’s a more sinister ulterior motive to the proceedings. That’s what the film asks viewers to ponder, anyway, as each character faces the prospect of a violent death by way of clever traps. Critics say Escape Room features&nbsp;some amusing set pieces and effective tension, but its twists are contrived and its death-trap mechanics feel like a derivative mish-mash of the Saw and Final Destination films. It’s likely to satisfy anyone who buys into its set-up, but it may also feel like a puzzle you’ve solved before.Also&nbsp;Opening This Week In Limited Release Communion (Komunia) (2019) ,&nbsp;a documentary about a 14-year-old girl who has assumed responsibility for her layabout father and autistic brother, is at 100%.

Reilly&nbsp;and Sarah Silverman),&nbsp;a&nbsp;ring rivalry (Creed II, starring&nbsp;Michael B. Jordan&nbsp;and Tessa Thompson), a legendary outlaw (Robin Hood, starring Taron Egerton&nbsp;and&nbsp;Jamie Foxx), an unlikely friendship&nbsp;(Green Book, starring&nbsp;Viggo Mortensen&nbsp;and&nbsp;Mahershala Ali), and a&nbsp;doomed campaign (The Front Runner, starring&nbsp;Hugh Jackman&nbsp;and&nbsp;Vera Farmiga).&nbsp;What are the critics saying?Ralph Breaks the Internet (2018)  88%2012’s Wreck-It Ralph was a pleasant surprise that succeeded in transcending its various video game references to deliver a smart, engaging comedy for audiences of all ages. But once you’ve explored that world, where do you go next? According to the film’s follow-up, Ralph Breaks the Internet, the answer is the World Wide Web. John C. Reilly and Sarah Silverman return to voice Ralph and Vanellope, who venture out into the vast online ecosystem in an effort to save Vanellope’s game, “Sugar Rush,” from being shut down for good. Critics say Ralph Breaks the Internet is a clever, hilarious sequel that both expands on its universe and characters and includes enough web-savvy meta humor to keep kids and adults laughing. Toss in a supporting voice cast that includes Taraji P. Henson, Gal Gadot, and a returning Jane Lynch, and you’ve got another winner from Disney.Creed II (2018)  83%In one of the more seamless transitions of the past several years, Sylvester Stallone successfully passed the baton — or the boxing glove, as it were — to Michael B. Jordan, as the Rocky franchise effectively became the Creed franchise. For Steven Caple Jr.’s&nbsp;Creed II, co-writer (and, again, co-star) Stallone tapped into a character defining moment of Rocky’s past to moved Adonis Creed’s own story forward, and critics say it’s a solid effort all around, even if the results are somewhat predictable. This time around, Adonis is challenged by Viktor Drago (Florian Munteanu), the hulking son of the Russian boxer Ivan Drago (Dolph Lundgren) who killed his father Apollo in the ring. Meanwhile, Adonis has also just begun a new chapter in his relationship with Bianca (Tessa Thompson), making his fight with Viktor all the more risky. While there aren’t many surprises to be had in Creed II, critics agree that it’s still an effective drama that resonates on an emotional level and furthers the pugilistic saga in satisfying ways.Robin Hood (2018)  15%The first stories of Robin Hood, the merry outlaw who steals from the rich and gives to the poor, surfaced as early as the 14th century in England, and his tale has been told countless times since then in various forms. Thanks to its inherently cinematic quality, the legend quickly found its way into cinema, and this week brings us the latest iteration of the character on the big screen. In Robin Hood, Taron Egerton plays the rogue archer, who returns from the Crusades to find the evil Sheriff of Nottingham (Ben Mendelsohn) ransacking the poor and decides to mount a rebellion with his new pal Little John (Jamie Foxx). Critics say Robin Hood makes feeble attempts to modernize the themes and relies too heavily on bombastic action sequences to make up for its thin characterizations, and audiences might be better off seeking out any number of the superior previous adaptations.Green Book (2018)  77%Director Peter Farrelly, along with his brother Bobby, struck comedy gold with absurd movies like Dumb and Dumber and There’s Something About Mary, so it’s a little surprising that his latest, a solo directorial effort, is a big part of the Oscar conversation. Based on a true story, Green Book stars Viggo Mortensen as a New York bouncer who takes a job as a chauffeur for famous Jamaican pianist Don Shirley (Mahershala Ali) during the 1960s. Utilizing a guidebook intended to help black travelers avoid racial confrontations, the pair tour the American Deep South together and forge an unlikely friendship. Critics say Green Book benefits from a smart script that deftly handles some sensitive themes and a pair of charismatic leads who have wonderful chemistry together, and it signals a potentially fruitful new direction for Peter Farrelly.The Front Runner (2018)  59%In 1988, former Colorado senator Gary Hart was a leading Democratic candidate for U.S. President on his way to winning his party’s official nomination until news broke about a possible extramarital affair, which he refused to acknowledge or address. The resulting scandal not only led to Hart dropping out of the race, but also signaled a dramatic shift in the way political news would be covered. This week’s The Front Runner, the latest drama from Jason Reitman, aims to tell that story and shed light on the man at its center, played by Hugh Jackman. While Jackman turns in a magnetic performance as Gary Hart, critics say the film has little room left for any of its esteemed supporting cast — which includes Vera Farmiga, J.K. Simmons, and Alfred Molina, among others — and fails to dive deep enough into its central issues to make a compelling argument.

Put ’em both together and you ought to have yourself a rollicking good time, right? We now have what would seem to be the definitive answer with The Meg, and unfortunately, critics say it never really hits that B-movie sweet spot the way you might expect. An adaptation of the 1997 Steve Alten bestseller, it stars Statham as Jonas Taylor, a rescue diver whose previous experience with sharks happens to come in extra handy when he winds up in an underwater research station under attack by a 75-foot Megalodon. It’s the type of preposterous setup begging for ladles full of action thriller cheese, but reviews describe the end results as rarely more than just okay. As a home viewing experience, it isn’t hard to see this attracting a cult following over the years. For the price of a ticket to the theater, however, it sinks.Dog Days (2018)  62%If our culture’s ever-expanding collection of internet memes is anything to go by, people love Love Actually&nbsp;almost as much as they love dogs, so why not just go ahead and put them together? Critics say that’s pretty much what director Ken Marino has done with Dog Days, in which an ensemble cast (including Eva Longoria, Nina Dobrev, Adam Pally, and Finn Wolfhard) play Los Angelenos whose intertwining lives and loves are fluffed up by a menagerie of canine companions. As one might expect of a rom-com titled Dog Days and released in the dog days of August, reviews describe a movie made of decidedly undemanding stuff; if you’re expecting much more than an air-conditioned interlude with a handful of heartwarming moments, you may come away disappointed. On the other hand, from its poster on down, one could hardly accuse this movie of pretending to be anything it isn’t — which is to say that if you’re in the market for Dog Days, you know exactly what you’re getting. In the context of the genre, it might be a bit of a mutt, but you’ve probably seen mangier.Slender Man (2018)  8%Studio tussles, release delays, pleas for common decency — all manner of obstacles conspired to keep Slender Man&nbsp;from reaching theaters, but his creeping advance cannot be denied. Perhaps the only thing capable of finally thwarting this internet-inspired, true crime-adjacent horror outing is the utter lack of interest it seems to be generating among the critical set: if the number of early reviews are anything to go by, there isn’t much in the way of anticipation for the movie, which attempts to turn a freaky-looking meme into the basis for a chilling tale about teenagers in supernatural peril. If you’re into horror movies, critics say you’ve almost certainly seen worse — but there really isn’t much about any of this that’s honestly scary, or even terribly memorable. Add in the staunch (and understandable) opposition of family members involved in the real-life 2014 assault inspired by the character, and you’re left with a fairly long and compelling list of reasons to beware this Slender Man.BlacKkKlansman (2018)  96%Spike Lee has dabbled in a number of genres over the years, but he’s typically best remembered as a filmmaker with a strong social conscience — one that returns to center stage with his new release, this weekend’s BlacKkKlansman. Inspired by the real-life story of Ron Stallworth, an African-American police detective who infiltrated his local Ku Klux Klan in 1979, Lee’s latest joint blends purely entertaining drama and pointed social commentary as only his films can — and critics say it’s one of the writer-director’s best, seething with a potent fury that’s brought powerfully to life by a solid ensemble led by John David Washington as Stallworth and rounded out by Laura Harrier, Adam Driver, and Topher Grace. It may not be the type of thing you’ll want to seek out if you’re in the mood for mindless entertainment, but BlacKkKlansman&nbsp;has a lot to say about America’s past, present, and future, and it proves one of modern cinema’s most singular visionaries hasn’t lost a step.What’s New on TVBetter Call Saul: Season 4 (2018)  99%Well-crafted and compelling as ever, Better Call Saul‘s fourth season deftly balances the show it was and the one it will inevitably become.Insatiable: Season 1 (2018)  11%Broad stereotypes, clumsy social commentary, and a failed attempt at “wokeness” make Insatiable&nbsp;hard to swallow.Also&nbsp;Opening This Week In Limited Release A Prayer Before Dawn (2018) , starring Joe Cole as a young British boxer trapped in the hell of the Thai prison system, is Certified Fresh at 93%.

The studio hopes to extend that streak with this weekend’s Christopher Robin, starring Ewan McGregor as a grown-up version of Winnie the Pooh’s old pal, worn down by adult life and desperately in need of a little childhood magic. Naturally, a certain honey-loving bear resurfaces in Christopher’s life, reminding him of simpler times… and throwing a stuffed-with-fluff monkey wrench into a very important week at the office. It’s the type of setup we’ve seen play out in scores of family-friendly films over the years, and sticking the landing between “heartwarming” and “cloying” can be tricky, but critics say&nbsp;Christopher Robin does a fairly commendable job managing that balancing act, even if the film doesn’t quite measure up to the original stories by A.A. Milne.&nbsp;If you feel like it’s been too long since you visited the Hundred Acre Wood with this willy nilly silly old bear and his lovable menagerie of animal friends, a little critical bother probably won’t keep you from buying a ticket.The Darkest Minds (2018)  15%Alexandra Bracken’s The Darkest Minds launched a hit series of YA books in 2012, and the resultant trilogy — about a world in which a pandemic has wiped out most of the human population under the age of 20, and bestowed superpowers on the rest — has been waiting its turn for the big-screen treatment while a slew of other sci-fi-fueled YA bestseller adaptations filed into theaters. That type of patience is often a virtue — but rarely in Hollywood, where the latest trends tend to produce a glut of similar pictures that quickly leads to familiarity… and critical contempt. Such is the sad fate that has befallen this weekend’s film adaptation of The Darkest Minds, which reviews describe as a dystopian grab bag of genre clichés we’ve watched play out in countless other like-minded pictures — and often to more entertaining effect. (Even Darkest Minds&nbsp;star Amandla Stenberg will be familiar to audiences courtesy of her tenure in the Hunger Games&nbsp;franchise.) There’s no way of knowing whether these write-ups would have been any warmer had Minds&nbsp;arrived at the dawn of the YA boom, but as it stands, this is one would-be franchise starter that the critics are calling dead on arrival. Consider screening one of your similarly themed favorites — or reading the books — instead.The Spy Who Dumped Me (2018)  49%Scores of Saturday&nbsp;Night Live veterans have tried making the leap to the big screen over the last several decades, and not all of them have been cut out for film stardom. In fact, it’s a tricky transition no matter how talented a star might be — a difficulty that would seem to be facing current SNL&nbsp;cast member Kate McKinnon. A clear standout during recent seasons of the show, she’s also building a budding film career, but she’s yet to find a role that truly takes advantage of her impressive gifts — and unfortunately, critics say The Spy Who Dumped Me&nbsp;only adds to that somewhat disappointing streak. A comedy that pairs McKinnon with Mila Kunis for a caper throwing two ordinary gals into the midst of international espionage, Dumped has just enough action and laughs to pass the time, but as many reviews have pointed out, “just enough” is a pretty major disappointment when you’re talking about this cast. The stars are likable and the feminist spin is welcome, but both of The Spy Who Dumped Me‘s leads have been — and almost certainly will be — in more compelling fare.Death of a Nation (2018)  0%Most of the time, even if we feel like we know how well a movie will do with critics, the end results are still a mystery until that Tomatometer settles down. There are exceptions to every rule, however, and for this one, we look to the filmography of self-styled provocateur Dinesh D’Souza, who’s been facing the wrong end of the pundits since earning positive reviews for 2004’s Michael Moore Hates America. His last few releases have earned scathingly negative reviews, and Death of a Nation&nbsp;— in which D’Souza compares Democrats to Nazis and the Trump administration to Abraham Lincoln — continues the pattern, with critics dismissing the filmmaker’s arguments as more fundamentally unsound than ever. If you’re part of D’Souza’s target audience, those warnings doubtless won’t matter much; for everyone else, Death of a Nation isn’t worth seeking out unless you really want to see how things look from the right-wing fringe.Eighth Grade (2018)  99%For many of us, middle school is a time of emotional turmoil, if not outright torment. All those melodramatic ups and downs should offer rich creative ground for filmmakers to travel, and yet most movies that make the attempt fail to truly capture the fraught hormonal battleground of the age. It’s gotten to the point where any adolescence-fueled movie that resists pandering or patronizing is worth holding up for special praise, and Eighth Grade — which marks the feature debut for writer-director Bo Burnham — has definitely earned its plaudits on that front; since making its festival debut earlier this year, this bittersweet look at a girl’s last few weeks before eighth grade graduation has attracted a wave of praise from pundits who’ve deemed it a refreshingly honest depiction of its moment. But Burnham’s work only tells part of the story: the movie, opening wide this weekend after a well-received limited run, is further elevated by an impressive central performance from Elsie Fisher as the story’s protagonist, 13-year-old Kayla. It all adds up to one of the happier surprises of the year, a film that’s sure to be part of the conversation during awards season, and a release now playing on more screens than ever — so if you’ve been looking forward to seeing it, check those local listings now.What’s New on TVMaking It: Season 1 (2018)  100%Making It puts a whimsical, refreshing new spin on reality TV — one made even more fun by well-matched hosts Amy Poehler and Nick Offerman.The Sinner: Season 2 (2018)  97%In its second season,&nbsp;The Sinner&nbsp;establishes itself as an engrossing who-dunnit thriller series with staying power.Also&nbsp;Opening This Week In Limited Release Night Comes On (2018) , in which a young woman exits juvenile detention on a quest to avenge her mother’s death, is at 100%.

Comedy is more like alchemy than addition, and as our latest example, here’s Night School, starring Tiffany Haddish and Kevin Hart in the ostensibly humorous story of a high school dropout who belatedly goes back to get his GED after his life is turned upside down. Both stars are very funny, with hit comedies to prove it; unfortunately, critics say School‘s scattered screenplay is more of a collection of set pieces than an actual story, and without any real investment in the characters, the chuckles are tough to come by. Of course with all this talent in one place, sparks are bound to fly on at least a couple of occasions, and Haddish and Hart are ably supported by a talented ensemble that includes Taran Killam, Mary Lynn Rajskub, and Rob Riggle; it’s just that it doesn’t add up to much more than a movie that leaves you wishing these stars had been brought together for a comedy that wasn’t (ahem) strictly remedial.Smallfoot (2018)  76%For a guy whose marquee idol looks could have easily led him down a far less interesting path, Channing Tatum has consistently demonstrated an admirable willingness to try just about anything onscreen, along with an impressive ability to jump from acclaimed lower-profile releases to mainstream hits. He’s at it again with this weekend’s Smallfoot, an animated outing about a yeti whose discovery of a human ends up throwing his community into upheaval. Rounded out by supporting work from Common, LeBron James, Zendaya, and Danny DeVito, this family-friendly feature — did we mention it’s also a musical? — might look pretty odd on paper, but critics say it’s actually well worth seeking out for families in the mood for a fun night out at the movies. If the results still end up falling a bit shy of the bar set by some of Warner Bros. Animation’s more illustrious competitors, audiences can still expect a solidly entertaining adventure for younger viewers — and all of us can clearly still expect the unexpected from Mr. Tatum.Little Women (2018)  30%Hollywood certainly seems to have gotten a lot more remake-prone in recent years, but as film buffs are fully aware, studios have been dipping into the vaults for properties to revisit pretty much all along — and as a result, certain stories have been filmed more times than most of us can count. No, we aren’t talking about A Star Is Born&nbsp;— not yet, anyway. Instead, this is all leading up to the latest Little Women, which adapts the classic Louisa May Alcott novel by bringing the plot into the present. It’s a somewhat novel twist for an oft-told tale, and it isn’t hard to root for any picture that gives Lea Thompson a leading role; unfortunately, critics say none of it goes far enough to justify this particular version of a story many people have already seen. Reviews describe a movie whose sincerity is admirable and whose themes remain as resonant as ever, but one that’s also ultimately more of a creative exhuming than a fresh spin. It’s a bummer for fans of heartfelt female-centric drama, but on the bright side, there are plenty of other Little Women to watch already — and Greta Gerwig is bringing yet another one to audiences next year.Hell Fest (2018)  39%A man, a plan, a… carnival full of screaming teens? For a number of film fans, these are all the basic ingredients you need for a killer horror movie, and this weekend’s Hell Fest&nbsp;has them all present and accounted for. Directed by Gregory Plotkin, whose genre bona fides include helming Paranormal Activity: The Ghost Dimension&nbsp;and editing Get Out, this slasher outing imagines the inevitably gory chaos that might unravel if a serial killer decided to indulge his darkest desires at a Halloween theme park. It’s a slick enough setup, and it’s undeniably promising that the cast includes Candyman and Final Destination&nbsp;vet Tony Todd, but as for the actual movie itself, we still don’t have a verdict, because Hell Fest didn’t screen for critics. While we wait for those reviews to start coming in, lay your best guesses on us with a round of Guess the Tomatometer.Also&nbsp;Opening This Week In Limited Release Free Solo (2018) , a documentary about free climber Alex Honnold’s attempt to scale El Capitan, is at 100%.

In fact, it’s inspired enough feats of cinema that a director would have to be blessed with a lot of moxie to try and add to the list — which is why it’s extra fortunate that this weekend’s First Man&nbsp;is being brought to us by the award-winning duo of Damien Chazelle and Ryan Gosling. Chazelle, who most recently directed Gosling in the acclaimed hit musical La La Land, reunites here with his leading man to tell the story of Neil Armstrong, the Apollo 11 astronaut who became the — wait for it — first man to walk on the moon. They’re obviously telling a very different type of story, but critics say their respective strengths are well served by this biopic, which foregoes a fair bit of the expected sweeping space vistas and epic narrative grandeur in favor of a more intimately focused drama that pulls back the curtain on Armstrong’s occasionally quite arduous personal journey. As an inspiring example of what we’re capable of when we work together or a gripping piece of solidly crafted entertainment that’s further elevated by stellar cinematography and an outstanding supporting performance by Claire Foy, First Man&nbsp;looks like a fittingly successful voyage.Goosebumps 2: Haunted Halloween (2018)  47%Hollywood famously pumps out mediocre horror sequels as if it were controlled by an occult hand. But while it was probably inevitable that the delightful Goosebumps&nbsp;would get a part two, critics say Goosebumps 2: Haunted Halloween is too slavishly devoted to the original template to take any — ahem — spook-tacular risks. Once again, a group of youngsters must stop the evil machinations of Slappy the Dummy, who escapes from the pages of an enchanted book; this time out, Slappy’s got a gang of monsters to help sow chaos in the small town of Wardenclyffe. The pundits say that kids will probably like this new Goosebumps&nbsp;just fine, but their parents or guardians are likely to wonder what happened to the wit and energy of its predecessor.Bad Times at the El Royale (2018)  74%In his feature debut The Cabin in the Woods, director Drew Goddard demonstrated an almost preternatural knack for wringing fresh surprises out of well-worn genre cliches. Now he’s back in the director’s chair with the Tarantino-inspired thriller Bad Times at the El Royale, and critics say Goddard and his cast are in top form. El Royale&nbsp;is the story of seven strangers (whose ranks include Jeff Bridges, Chris Hemsworth, Dakota Johnson, Jon Hamm, and Cynthia Erivo) who congregate at the titular motel and find out what happens when things start to get surreal. The pundits say the cast is terrific, the plot is deliciously twisty, and the production design is impeccable, and even if it doesn’t deliver all that it promises, the Certified Fresh El Royale&nbsp;is definitely worth a visit.What’s New on TVThe Haunting of Hill House: Miniseries (2018)  93%The Haunting of Hill House is an effective ghost story whose steadily mounting anticipation is just as satisfying as its chilling payoff.Titans: Season 1 (2018)  78%Despite a few tonal growing pains, Titans does justice to its source material and truly shines when its titular ensemble finally assembles.Also&nbsp;Opening This Week In Limited Release Liyana (2018) , an animated adventure combining African tradition and actual events, is at 100%.

The suburbs, babies, grandparents — they’ve all been twisted in genre cinema’s chilly grasp, and given the deep-seated emotions many people have regarding religion, it’s no surprise that its tenets and imagery have long ranked among filmmakers’ favorite nightmare fuel. With this weekend’s The Nun, producer James Wan expands his burgeoning Conjuring&nbsp;cinematic universe by giving the demon Valak, one of The Conjuring 2‘s scarier creatures, her own standalone feature — and explaining the backstory of the wimpled menace along the way. Of course, as horror fans are all too aware, it’s often what we can’t see, don’t know, and don’t understand that proves scariest; go back to one boogeyman too often, and its effectiveness can rapidly diminish. According to the critics, that’s exactly what’s happened with The Nun, which hurls a series of jump scares at the audience in order to try and cover up for a slow and familiar story. We’ve seen Conjuring spinoff franchises struggle out of the gate before, so here’s hoping if there’s a follow-up, the reviews are kinder; overall, this is still one of the better mainstream horror series going, and it’d be a real shame if it made a (cough) habit of earning disappointing Tomatometers.Peppermint (2018)  12%As the star of the long-running hit series Alias, Jennifer Garner proved herself more than capable of playing a believable action hero — but when she started cracking skulls on the big screen in Daredevil&nbsp;and its spinoff Elektra, the results were less than spectacular. More than a decade after the latter film crashed and burned in theaters, Garner’s got a shot at genre redemption with Peppermint, in which she plays a woman who nearly dies in an attack that kills her husband and daughter — and after emerging from a yearlong coma, dedicates herself to exacting revenge on the people responsible. Sadly, critics say she needn’t have bothered; while Garner remains a charismatic screen presence, and more than a few reviews have given her credit for her clear commitment to the role, it still doesn’t add up to much besides reheated Death Wish, with all the borderline irresponsible fearmongering that goes with the territory. If you’re seriously in the mood to watch some bad guys get thunked this weekend, Peppermint&nbsp;might do the trick — but then again, you could also just watch a better-made vigilante thriller instead.God Bless the Broken Road (2018)  17%While one wide release uses religious iconography to give filmgoers the willies this weekend, God Bless the Broken Road&nbsp;takes an altogether different faith-based direction. Helmed by God’s Not Dead&nbsp;director Harold Cronk, this drama — which takes its title from Marcus Hummon’s oft-covered country single — adapts the Jennifer Dornbush novel of the same name to tell the story of a single mom (Lindsay Pulsipher) struggling to put her life back together after her husband is killed in action during a tour of duty with the U.S. Army in Afghanistan. When her nine-year-old daughter (Makenzie Moss) befriends a racecar driver (Andrew Walker), love starts to bloom… only to be threatened by our grieving protagonist’s fear of losing another beau to a dangerous vocation. You pretty much know where this is all heading, which is a big part of why the target demographic responds to it — and why critics tend to turn up their noses at it. We’ve still only seen a handful of reviews for Broken Road, but early returns suggest this will be yet another earnest, religion-tinged drama that hits a hard dead end with the pundits. If it’s in your wheelhouse, odds are that won’t make much of a difference.What’s New on TVMayans M.C.: Season 1 (2018)  72%Mayans M.C.&nbsp;is a thrilling drama with compelling characters, but it struggles to find its pace and the Tellers are hard to forget.The Purge: Season 1 (2018)  42%Bloated and boring, The Purge kills its own fleetingly fun premise and proves that not all stories work better on the small screen.Also&nbsp;Opening This Week In Limited Release I Am Not a Witch (2018) , about a young Zambian girl accused of witchcraft after an incident in her school, is Certified Fresh at 100%.

The latter has always been the case for the Predator&nbsp;movies, which have offered a case study in diminishing returns since the beefy fun of the first installment; whether facing off against Danny Glover, Adrien Brody, or even Xenomorphs, these nasty-looking intergalactic big game hunters have never been quite as much fun as they seemed in 1987. This weekend’s franchise reboot — suitably titled The Predator&nbsp;— was supposed to change all that with an adventure that brought the big guys back to Earth for a hunt that echoed the original while upping the ante in various ways. With director/co-writer/Predator&nbsp;vet Shane Black at the helm, and an ensemble cast that includes Sterling K. Brown, Olivia Munn, and Jacob Tremblay, it looked like a solid blend of top-shelf talent and genre thrills; unfortunately, the disappointing reality is more of a noisy muddle that fails to clear the bar set by the first film — or even 2010’s space-set Predators. Critics say The Predator&nbsp;has its moments, but they’re neither plentiful nor impactful enough to ever be as much fun as they ought to be. If the past is any indication, we may very well see a sequel at some point, so here’s hoping that one hits closer to the mark; in the meantime, this is one would-be franchise revival that needs to get to the choppa.A Simple Favor (2018)  84%From Poltergeist&nbsp;to Desperate Housewives&nbsp;and beyond, filmmakers have used well-groomed suburbs as a deceptively placid mask for countless types of nastiness, so on the surface, A Simple Favor&nbsp;— starring Anna Kendrick as a blogger determined to uncover the truth behind the disappearance of her friend (Blake Lively) — might seem to be another variation on a familiar theme. On the other hand, it also has a terrific cast (rounded out by Jean Smart and Crazy Rich Asians&nbsp;star Henry Golding), a talented director at the reins in Paul Feig, and a script adapted from the Darcey Bell novel by American Horror Story vet Jessica Sharzer. Critics say all that talent makes all the difference for a movie that adds up to a fairly delightful — and delightfully ridiculous — mommy noir, with all the plot twists, dark humor, and beautiful people audiences might expect. It isn’t the most high-profile wide release of the weekend, but filmgoers who aren’t absolutely intent on seeing alien blood spilled may want to do themselves this Favor.White Boy Rick (2018)  57%Richard Wershe Jr. became an FBI informant at the age of 14, ended up in jail for selling cocaine before he turned 20, and has endured further painful scrapes with the law since being paroled in 2017. It’s a grim story tinged with sensationalism, which makes it somewhat surprising that it took until now for it to reach the big screen in the form of White Boy Rick. Starring Richie Merritt as Wershe and Matthew McConaughey as his father, this Yann Demange-directed drama seeks to highlight the surreal aspects of the story while also making it clear that his economic background — and a judicial system stacked against non-violent drug offenders — are tied into much broader problems in America, and while that’s certainly an admirable goal, critics say it can make for a somewhat less than satisfying viewing experience. Although Merritt and McConaughey have both received their share of praise for their performances, White Boy Rick&nbsp;can’t quite reconcile its domestic drama elements against its social commentary components, and in presenting Wershe as a sympathetic product of unusual circumstance, the story undermines some of its own points. It isn’t without its strengths, but this is one fascinating real-life story that isn’t always well served by its dramatization.Unbroken: Path to Redemption (2018)  38%With 2014’s Angelina Jolie-directed Unbroken, audiences were offered a dramatized version of the stranger-than-fiction real-life saga of Louie Zamperini, an Olympic runner and U.S. Army officer who survived against incredible odds — and through unconscionable treatment — as a prisoner of war during World War II. As incredible as the events depicted might have been, they only told part of Zamperini’s story, an oversight that this weekend’s Unbroken: Path to Redemption&nbsp;seeks to correct. Dubbed a “spiritual sequel” and starring a completely different cast, this chapter focuses on Zamperini’s (Samuel Hunt) struggles after the war, as well as the religious awakening that helped him let go of the past. It’s an undeniably inspiring tale, but critics say the film version — directed by Harold Cronk, who brought the similarly faith-focused God Bless the Broken Road&nbsp;to theaters last week — preaches ham-handedly to the choir with a screenplay that fails to find much relatable drama in Zamperini’s journey in spite of Hunt’s best efforts. Evangelically inclined filmgoers will likely be comfortable ignoring the reviews, but for everyone else, this is one life that’s still better summed up in the pages of its bestselling source material, Laura Hillenbrand’s Unbroken: A World War II Story of Survival, Resilience, and Redemption.What’s New on TVBoJack Horseman: Season 5 (2018)  98%BoJack Horseman continues confidently down the thematic rabbit hole with a fresh and poignant season that’s as devastating as it is hilarious.American Vandal: Season 2 (2018)  98%American Vandal trades one type of potty humor for another in an ambitious second season that manages to double down on the explicit gags while subtly addressing serious social issues.The First: Season 1 (2018)  66%Sean Penn gives an intensely poignant performance as the driven but conflicted Tom Hagerty in The First‘s rather slow-moving first season.Also&nbsp;Opening This Week In Limited Release The Dawn Wall (2018) ,&nbsp;a documentary about the life and public exploits of free climber Tommy Caldwell, is at 100%.

It’s fitting, then, that his son Brian has taken that experimental spirit and injected it into The Happytime Murders, an R-rated black comedy following a murder mystery that takes place in a world populated by humans and puppets. A blend of ostensibly cuddly characters and enthusiastically adult humor, this is the kind of movie that sounds too gonzo to be real — and it almost wasn’t, enduring a decade in development before facing a lawsuit from the studio behind Sesame Street. After all that, it saddens us to report that Happytime&nbsp;is getting murdered by critics; reviews describe a clumsy comedy that’s too busy being aggressively edgy to actually be funny, never mind put a fresh spin on a story whose rough outline should be familiar to anyone who’s seen Who Framed Roger Rabbit.

Critics have had no such qualms with Crazy Rich Asians, however — while the movie’s cast and content is being rightly celebrated as a triumph of representation, it’s also being held up as a romantic comedy so purely entertaining that some reviews suggest it could single-handedly improve the genre as a whole. Adapted from the Kevin Kwan novel, Crazy&nbsp;tells the story of Nick Young (Henry Golding) and Rachel Chu (Constance Wu), a couple whose trip to a wedding in Singapore serves as her introduction to his family — and the audience’s introduction to a whole lot of glitz, glamour, and delightful characters, the latter of which are played by a bustling ensemble rounded out by Michelle Yeoh, Ken Jeong, and a scene-stealing Awkwafina. While we eagerly await the day when a movie like Crazy Rich Asians no longer represents a bold, rare studio gambit on a film built around non-white leads, fans of effervescent comedy and over-the-top movie romance can safely set aside time for the movie this weekend, secure in the knowledge that they’re in for a couple hours of near-universally acclaimed entertainment.Mile 22 (2018)  23%Mark Wahlberg has made plenty of worthwhile movies over the course of his career, and a number of them have been filmed under the direction of Peter Berg; in fact, this weekend’s Mile 22&nbsp;marks the fourth time the duo have worked together, extending a partnership that already included the acclaimed outings Lone Survivor, Deepwater Horizon, and Patriots Day. Sadly, their luck has run out with critics, at least for now — reviews describe this action thriller, starring Wahlberg as a CIA operative tasked with delivering an agency asset (Iko Uwais) for extraction before he’s killed, as a toxic blend of confused writing and choppily edited action, populated with generally unlikable characters. Being a fan of this genre often means agreeing to accept certain disappointments in exchange for your killer set pieces, but Mile 22 seems to have very little to offer on any front; here’s hoping that if and when Berg and Wahlberg hook up for a fifth project, they find a way to regain their mojo.Alpha (2018)  80%Young people and canines have been united for epic big-screen adventures countless times over the years, but Albert Hughes‘ Alpha&nbsp;might be the first to try and depict how our two species developed such an indelible bond. Set during the Ice Age, the story follows a young human hunter (Kodi Smit-McPhee) who’s seriously injured in pursuit of his quarry — and strikes out for home while relying on the assistance of a wolf with whom he develops a mutually beneficial relationship. The rough outline of this tale will be familiar to most filmgoers, but critics say the end result is still solidly entertaining; Hughes, making his solo feature debut here after co-helming a series of films with his brother, enlivens the material with IMAX-ready action, and Smit-McPhee delivers an affecting performance in a role whose demands were largely physical. It isn’t the highest-profile release of the summer, but for the young adventurer in us all, Alpha&nbsp;leads this weekend’s pack.What’s New on TVInsecure: Season 3 (2018)  92%Insecure returns for a third season as authentic and exuberant as the star who made it, but with an added layer of growth that keeps it moving forward.Also&nbsp;Opening This Week In Limited Release Minding the Gap (2018) , assembled from a dozen years of documentary footage focused on skateboarders in Rockford, IL, is at 100%.

Stubby: An American Hero, starring Helena Bonham Carter&nbsp;and Gérard Depardieu), and&nbsp;a political thriller in Lebanon&nbsp;(Beirut, starring&nbsp;Jon Hamm&nbsp;and&nbsp;Rosamund Pike).&nbsp;What are the critics saying?Rampage (2018)  51%It really wasn’t all that long ago that the idea of making a movie out of an arcade game about giant monsters smashing buildings (and/or each other) would have seemed preposterous, if not completely beyond the range of special effects technology. Times have changed in a multitude of ways, however, and modern Hollywood is all about finding franchises even if you have to look in the unlikeliest of places — or turn the wildest of scenarios into lifelike blockbuster entertainment. Case in point: Rampage, a Dwayne Johnson-led adaptation of the coin-op classic that asked players to smash cities to rubble as a giant lizard, gorilla, or werewolf. Obviously, that setup is a little light on the narrative side, so a team of screenwriters have conspired to imagine a scenario in which a trio of innocent animals are embiggened and embark on a spree of destruction that can only be stopped by a kind-hearted primatologist (Johnson) and a genetic engineer (Naomie Harris). Pretty much par for the course with Johnson, in other words — and the critical response is more or less also what you’d expect, with reviews running the gamut between “big dumb fun” and just “dumb.” If you were waiting to see what the critics thought about Rampage&nbsp;before buying a ticket, then you may want to steer clear… but who are we kidding? You almost definitely weren’t.Blumhouse's Truth or Dare (2018)  15%Add up the grosses and average out the Tomatometers for Blumhouse’s latest handful of low-budget horror outings, and it’s clear that they’re on a pretty incredible tear: Split, Get Out, and Happy Death Day all hit paydirt last year, and that winning streak continued with the box office success of Insidious: The Last Key in January. The studio rides that hot hand into this weekend’s Truth or Dare, about a group of college seniors (including Lucy Hale and Tyler Posey) who make the ill-fated decision to engage in a round of the titular game… with freaky supernatural results. When all else fails, “kill a bunch of pretty young people” is always a reliable fallback setup for a horror movie, so genre enthusiasts may get a few thrills out of the end results; unfortunately, critics are typically harder to impress, and they say this is all standard stuff — neither inventive nor scary enough to set Truth or Dare apart from the decades of dreary slashers that came before it. If you’re really in the mood to listen to people scream in the dark for an hour and a half, go for it — but all things considered, the box office fate suffered by Battleship&nbsp;is still probably a scarier game-related Hollywood story.Isle of Dogs (2018)  90%Wes Anderson has never made what most people would consider children’s movies, so when he ventured into the traditionally kid-friendly arena of stop-motion animation with 2009’s Fantastic Mr. Fox, it came as something of a surprise. As it turns out, the medium is a perfect fit for the writer-director’s gentle whimsy and attention to detail — and he’s back with Isle of Dogs, now entering wide release. Anderson’s latest outing tells the story of Atari (Koyu Rankin), a Japanese boy determined to rescue his dog (voiced by Liev Schreiber) from an island where the animals have been quarantined during an outbreak of canine flu — again, not your average setup for an animated movie, but one that critics say provides rich creative ground for a cinematic experience that’s deeply enjoyable on a number of levels. Another acclaimed addition to Anderson’s filmography, Isle&nbsp;ranks among 2018’s best-reviewed movies thus far, and offers one of your safest destinations at theaters this weekend.Sgt. Stubby: An American Hero (2018)  89%If you’re like most people, then an animated movie about a dog who served with honor in the trenches during World War I probably doesn’t rank high on your cinematic wish list — but that doesn’t mean it’s impossible to make a good one, and Sgt. Stubby: An American Hero&nbsp;is here to offer proof. Although a good many filmgoers are likely unfamiliar with the real-life Stubby’s military exploits, his story is legitimately incredible, and critics say it’s been told here with sensitivity and charm by director/co-writer Richard Lanni. Viewers with young children may balk at the prospect of taking the family to see a movie about a dog whose life was repeatedly in mortal danger — or raise a skeptical eyebrow at the notion of a well-reviewed animated release from a studio that isn’t one of the usual suspects — but if you’re looking for a worthy cartoon diversion, it looks like this Stubby&nbsp;stands tall.Beirut (2018)  82%It’s tough to jump from TV star to marquee idol, and even most of the Hollywood vets who’ve been lucky enough to make the leap — like George Clooney and Bruce Willis — needed a few mulligans before they really found their footing on the big screen. It’s far from unusual, in other words, that the film industry hasn’t really seemed to know what to do with Jon Hamm since he started focusing on movies after Mad Men&nbsp;went off the air; although he certainly looks&nbsp;like a movie star, he’s spent the last few years waiting for his breakout film role. The sober-minded and relatively complex Beirut&nbsp;may not be the project that truly marks that transition, but critics say this is the type of stuff Hamm really needs more of — a movie that takes advantage of his ability to play charismatic yet damaged individuals, set against the backdrop of a gripping conflict. He stars here as Mason Skiles, a former diplomat who’s lured back into his old trade as part of an operation to help save the life of a friend he left in the titular city, and reviews describe a Tony Gilroy-scripted drama that should satisfy fans of Tony Gilroy-scripted dramas — even if this one doesn’t quite do justice to the thorny real-life conflicts that fuel its plot. Absorbing despite its flaws and elevated by strong work from Hamm and Rosamund Pike, Beirut&nbsp;looks like the place to be for fans of grown-up political intrigue this weekend.What’s New on TVKilling Eve: Season 1 (2018)  96%Seductive and surprising, Killing Eve‘s twist on the spy vs. spy conceit rewards viewers with an audaciously entertaining show that finally makes good use of Sandra Oh‘s talents.Howards End: Miniseries (2018)  87%A superbly-mounted adaptation of E.M.

It’s all very impressive, but it’s also nice to take a little breather once in awhile and enjoy some good old-fashioned, low-stakes superhero action — and fittingly, that’s just where Marvel’s smallest heroes come in. This sequel to 2015’s Ant-Man&nbsp;reunites audiences with titular hero Scott Lang (Paul Rudd), still working alongside Hope van Dyne, a.k.a. the Wasp (Evangeline Lilly), and her dad Hank Pym (Michael Douglas). This time out, the trio seek to rescue Hope’s mom Janet (Michelle Pfeiffer) from the Quantum Realm, all while battling the occasionally intangible Ghost (Hannah John-Kamen) — and then there’s the question of where all this ties into the cosmic battle being faced by the MCU’s other heroes in Avengers: Infinity War. That’s a lot of action for a single sequel, and critics say Ant-Man and the Wasp&nbsp;definitely doesn’t lack moving parts, but director Peyton Reed manages to wrangle them all into a fun, funny pause between senses-shattering rounds of the war with Thanos. At a time when superhero cinema seems eager to test the limits of its dramatic stakes, here’s a reminder that smaller stories can be just as satisfying.The First Purge (2018)  56%It isn’t at all uncommon for horror movies to slip in some deeper sociopolitical subtext between all the jump scares and the screaming, but the Purge&nbsp;franchise has been a little more open about it than most — which makes sense, given that it takes place in a not-so-distant future in which the United States government has created an annual 12-hour period of sanctioned lawlessness. It’s a premise that lends itself to all sorts of pointed commentary on current events, and with The First Purge, the series doubles down on that aspect of the story by taking audiences back to the beginning — revealing that the Purge essentially got its start as a government conspiracy designed to carry out race- and class-based genocide. That’s a lot for a movie to bite off between bloody set pieces, and while critics say it’s to The First Purge‘s credit that writer and franchise mastermind James DeMonaco doesn’t lack ambition, it’s ultimately too much for this installment to handle. Reviews describe a prequel that has interesting ideas, but can’t balance them against its need for gory action, and while the end result might still satisfy hardcore Purge&nbsp;fans, it doesn’t live up to its own evident goals.What’s New on TVSharp Objects: Miniseries (2018)  92%A nearly unbearable slow burn, Sharp Objects maintains its grip with an unshakably grim atmosphere and an outstanding cast led by a superb Amy Adams.Also&nbsp;Opening This Week In Limited Release Sorry to Bother You (2018) , starring Lakeith Stanfield as a telemarketer struggling to balance his ideals against his corporate success, is Certified Fresh at 95%.

Usually, anyway — sometimes your mom ends up going back to school at your university and totally (albeit unintentionally) harshing your vibe. Such is life for Life of the Party‘s Maddie Miles (Molly Gordon), who finds herself sharing a campus with her mother Deanna (Melissa McCarthy) after her parents split up. It’s a painful new chapter for Deanna, but she turns lemons into lemonade by — as one might reasonably infer from the title — discovering her inner twentysomething, taking full advantage of college life so enthusiastically that her fellow co-eds nickname her Dee Rock. If you’re reading this and thinking you’ve seen these storyline beats play out before in Rodney Dangerfield‘s Back to School, well, you aren’t far off; unfortunately, critics say it’s nowhere near as funny this time around. McCarthy remains a fierce talent, and she’s surrounded with a terrific supporting cast here, including Maya Rudolph, Gillian Jacobs, and Matt Walsh, but reviews describe Life of the Party&nbsp;as a frustratingly middling comedy that never really figures out what to do with all that talent and fails to produce consistent laughs. With all these funny people in one place, the end result isn’t without a few moments, but all things considered, this is a serviceable premise that’s already been explored to more entertaining effect.Breaking In (2018)  27%As Sally Field taught us in Not Without My Daughter, there’s no situation too dangerous or daunting to keep a mother from her child — and this weekend, Gabrielle Union is delivering that lesson all over again with Breaking In, in which hell hath no fury like a woman whose kids have been taken captive and held for ransom in a home equipped with a seemingly impenetrable security system. It’s an appealingly gonzo setup for a movie being released in time for Mother’s Day, and Union, always a strong screen presence, would seem to be well-matched for the role of a woman prepared to prove that, as the poster promises, “payback is a mother.” Alas, what looks interesting on paper often tends to lose its way on the journey to the big screen, and that appears to be the case for Breaking In. Critics say that while Union is clearly committed to the role — and the best thing about the movie — it isn’t enough to make up for thinly sketched characters and a slapdash plot that evaporates under scrutiny. Union deserves more chances to prove she can carry a picture — and hopefully, this won’t be the last time Hollywood serves up a left-field choice for Mother’s Day weekend — but in the meantime, this is one thriller you don’t need to rush out and see.What’s New on TVPatrick Melrose: Miniseries (2018)  90%Patrick Melrose is a scathing indictment of British high society’s inherited dysfunction, cruelty, and the wealth that enables them.

While the 1993 original — based on Michael Chrichton’s 1990 bestseller — was an all-around smash, subsequent Jurassic&nbsp;works saw diminishing returns, with 1997’s The Lost World&nbsp;and 2001’s Jurassic Park III&nbsp;failing to recapture the magic with critics as well as filmgoers. The series rebounded with its fourth entry, 2015’s Jurassic World, which introduced a new cast (led by Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard) contending with the legacy of the beasts unleashed in the original trilogy, starting a new chapter in the saga that’s now continued with this weekend’s Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom. It’s a rebooted story, but some aspects of the franchise have stayed the same — including, unfortunately, its varying critical mileage. While far from disastrous, reviews describe a sequel that struggles to take the Jurassic&nbsp;audience into new or truly exciting territory; aside from that inherently awesome premise, there isn’t much to warrant a fifth installment in the series. All of which is to say that whatever its storyline deficiencies might be, this is still a summer action thriller about dinosaurs, and if you’re in the mood for that kind of thing, Jurassic Park: Fallen Kingdom will probably just about get the job done.What’s New on TVMarvel's Luke Cage: Season 2 (2018)  85%Marvel’s Luke Cage&nbsp;nearly matches the successes of its debut season with a satisfyingly complex narrative and a solid ensemble cast led by Alfre Woodard‘s standout performance as the archvillainess Black Mariah.Also&nbsp;Opening This Week In Limited Release Marlina the Murderer in Four Acts (2018) , the occasionally surreal odyssey of a woman who fights back against the leader of a local gang in decidedly emphatic fashion, is at 96%.

Brown).&nbsp;What are the critics saying?Ocean's 8 (2018)  69%As far as gimmicks for rejuvenating a franchise go, flipping the gender of the main cast has to rank among the simplest. Yet it can also be pretty effective under the right circumstances — like, say, when you’re trying to squeeze a spinoff out of a film series that has traditionally reveled in the glamorous machismo of an all-male ensemble. For proof, observe Ocean’s 8, starring Sandra Bullock as Debbie Ocean, estranged sister of heist-lovin’ Danny (George Clooney), whose exploits fueled the Steven Soderbergh-directed Ocean’s remake trilogy. Turns out targeting wealthy marks runs in the family, and so does rounding up partners in crime who are as dazzlingly charming as they are morally flexible: Debbie’s got her eye on a $150 million necklace at the Met Gala, and she knows just the crew to help her rip it off. As the title implies, it’s an eight-woman team, and it puts Bullock in pretty good company: Awkafina, Cate Blanchett, Helena Bonham Carter, Anne Hathaway, Mindy Kaling, Sarah Paulson, and Rihanna round out the cast. Critics say they’re all put to solidly entertaining use in this light caper; as with the more recent Ocean’s&nbsp;installments, all that star power — and the charisma of the stars — is often enough to carry the movie even when the plot isn’t as dazzlingly smart as it thinks. If it doesn’t quite reach the fizzy heights of the last trilogy’s best moments, this still looks like a perfectly entertaining time at the movies, and one that gives an oft-used formula a welcome — albeit simple — twist.Hereditary (2018)  89%Family! Can’t live with ’em, can’t live with… the terrifying supernatural curses unleashed when they die. Debuting writer-director Ari Aster explores this eternal tension in Hereditary, starring Toni Collette as a woman whose home life takes an extreme turn for the worse after her mother passes away, sparking an exploration into the family’s past that turns up all sorts of unpleasant information — not to mention some unwanted encounters with what appears to be the darkest, nastiest corners of the great beyond. Horror fans have been gifted with a succession of great new entries in the genre over the last few years, but even by those elevated standards, critics say Hereditary&nbsp;is something special — a movie that’s strong enough to not only rattle your cage and leave you sleeping with the lights on, but tell a story that’s truly, upsettingly powerful on an emotional level. It certainly isn’t for the faint of heart, but if you’re in the mood to be frightened, hurry up and check your local listings.Hotel Artemis (2018)  58%There’s nothing quite like the fun of watching a piece of well-made genre pulp, and on paper, this weekend’s Hotel Artemis&nbsp;— which imagines a near-future Los Angeles containing a secret hospital for dangerous criminals — would certainly seem to fit the bill. Aside from a John Wick-adjacent premise that includes powerful secret societies operating outside the law, it arrives packing some serious acting heat: Jodie Foster plays the nurse who runs the titular institution, and she’s joined in the cast by an impressive array of talent that includes Jeff Goldblum, Sofia Boutella, Jenny Slate, and fast-emerging TV breakouts Sterling K. Brown and Bryan Tyree Henry. Top all that off with a script from Iron Man 3&nbsp;and Mission Impossible: Rogue Nation&nbsp;vet Drew Pearce — making his feature directorial debut — and you’ve got the makings of a hard-hitting good time at the movies. Critics say that’s more or less what Hotel Artemis&nbsp;delivers, and although it doesn’t exactly punch above its weight in terms of originality or impact given that intriguing pedigree, Wick&nbsp;fans and those who miss the John Carpenter of the ’80s should still find it worth the price of a ticket.What’s New on TVPose: Season 1 (2018)  96%Charged with energy, poise, and confidence, Pose pirouettes between artistic opulence and deliciously soapy drama to create a fresh new addition to Ryan Murphy‘s lexicon.Marvel's Cloak &amp; Dagger: Season 1 (2018)  89%Cloak &amp; Dagger&nbsp;blends soapy drama with superhero grit to create an exciting, surprisingly thoughtful addition to the genre — even if it falls prey to a certain amount of narrative bloat.Succession: Season 1 (2018)  88%The spectacle of rich people behaving badly makes Succession entertaining, but only up to a point.Also&nbsp;Opening This Week In Limited Release On the Seventh Day (En el Séptimo Día) (2018) , about a young migrant worker caught between his commitment to his soccer team and his job, is at 100%.

It wouldn’t be unreasonable to argue that Johnson does this kind of thing better than any other actor working today, and critics say his presence is precisely why this highly derivative outing works as well as it does; while it certainly suffers in comparison to the classics that clearly inspired it, it benefits from its charismatic leading man, as well as writer-director Rawson Marshall Thurber‘s ability to keep things moving along at a briskly compelling clip. It’s no Die Hard, in other words, but if you’re in the mood for an action movie that’s roughly as entertaining as it is implausible and includes a number of bad guys getting their just desserts, Skyscraper&nbsp;stands just about tall enough.Hotel Transylvania 3: Summer Vacation (2018)  62%Adam Sandler has been making people laugh with his arsenal of funny voices for decades, so it only stands to reason that he’d be a natural for animated work. Still, when the SNL&nbsp;vet signed up to play Dracula in 2012’s Hotel Transylvania, few could have foreseen just how successful it’d be at the box office — or that it’d end up starting a franchise that adds its third installment with this weekend’s Hotel Transylvania 3: Summer Vacation. This time out, Dracula is dragged on a cruise by his daughter Mavis (Selena Gomez) and son-in-law Johnny (Andy Samberg), where he falls for a passenger (Kathryn Hahn) who ends up being the granddaughter of his sworn enemy Van Helsing (Jim Gaffigan). Hijinks (and wedgies) inevitably ensue, and while the end result is unlikely to be looked back upon as classic animated entertainment, it’s a surprising high mark for the Hotel Transylvania&nbsp;saga, delivering more than enough colorful silliness for critics to recommend it as a family-friendly summer diversion. Plan your next trip to the theater with your kids accordingly — and pencil in summer 2021 for the inevitable Hotel Transylvania 4.Sorry to Bother You (2018)  93%Long familiar to fans of socially aware and politically conscious hip-hop through his work with the Coup and Street Sweeper Social Club, rapper and producer Boots Riley has now made the leap into filmmaking with Sorry to Bother You, and to say he stuck the landing would be an understatement — this sci-fi-tinged dark comedy is rolling into its wide release after wowing a succession of critics and earning a spot among the best-reviewed movies of the year. Starring Atlanta&nbsp;vet Lakeith Stanfield opposite Tessa Thompson (Thor: Ragnarok, Creed), Riley’s debut feature imagines an alternate reality in which making a living in America often means indentured servitude — and the tension between material success and hanging onto one’s principles is more pronounced than ever. It’s a loaded premise, to say the least, and critics say Riley and his cast take full advantage, delivering a wildly ambitious film that deftly juggles sharp wit, pointed commentary, and hard-hitting subtext even as it flat-out entertains. What it may lack in the costumed vigilantes and CGI-assisted pyrotechnics we expect during blockbuster season, Sorry to Bother You&nbsp;more than makes up for in narrative substance; if the reviews are anything to go by, this is one 2018 summer movie we’ll still be talking and thinking about months from now.Also&nbsp;Opening This Week In Limited Release Eighth Grade (2018) , a coming-of-age comedy from writer-director Bo Burnham in which an eighth grade girl (Elsie Fisher) approaches the end of middle school, is Certified Fresh at 98%.

Nelson), some of Hollywood’s funniest fellows trying to touch one another without permission (Tag, starring&nbsp;Ed Helms,&nbsp;Jeremy Renner, and Jon Hamm), and a remade blast from the blaxploitation past (Superfly, starring Trevor Jackson&nbsp;and Jason Mitchell).&nbsp;What are the critics saying?Incredibles 2 (2018)  93%If you’re going to try and follow up an acclaimed blockbuster, you might as well take your time getting the sequel right — and in animation, where time can stand still forever, you have the added benefit of not needing to rush your cast back in front of the camera. Still, after waiting nearly 15 years for a second installment of The Incredibles, fans can be forgiven a certain amount of impatience; while the creative teams at formerly franchise-averse Pixar dreamed up new stories for the characters in Toy Story, Cars, Finding Nemo, and Monsters Inc., the ability to return to theaters continued to elude the superpowered Parr family. All that waiting has finally paid off with Incredibles 2, which reunites the original voice cast for a new adventure serving up more of the domestic turmoil, superhero satire, and brilliantly animated action that made the first one such a hit. It’d be tough to improve on the original Incredibles, and critics say that while this sequel doesn’t quite pull off that feat, it comes impressively close, adding yet another acclaimed entry to Pixar’s already estimable filmography. If you were a kid when The Incredibles&nbsp;came out, you might have kids of your own now — and like all the best stuff the studio has put out, the whole family can look forward to enjoying Incredibles 2.Tag (2018)  56%On one hand, it’s easy to believe Hollywood has long since exhausted most of the reasonable possibilities for comedy that exist in movies about grown men acting like boys. On the other, when you’ve got the Wall Street Journal writing about a real-life group of guys who take a month off every year to continue the game of tag they’ve been playing since they were kids, well, it’s awfully hard to resist the temptation to turn that into a film. Enter the descriptively titled Tag, starring Hannibal Buress, Jon Hamm, Ed Helms, Jake Johnson, and Jeremy Renner as the fellows in question — a talented bunch whose commitment to the story was reflected in the set injury Renner sustained, breaking both of his arms and necessitating some last-minute CGI limb replacements in post-production. It would be wonderful to report that Renner’s suffering came in service of one of the year’s best-reviewed action comedies; alas, the truth is that critics are kinda meh on Tag, which reviews describe as funny and engaging in fits and starts, but ultimately not consistent or committed enough to fully deliver on its premise. Still, this is one talented cast, and even the critical pans say the movie isn’t without its moments, so if you’re in the mood for some arrested development laughs, you may want to check your local listings.Superfly (2018)  51%Released in 1972, the original Superfly&nbsp;helped lead the blaxploitation wave with a thoughtful Harlem-set drama about a drug dealer looking for one last big score; the movie’s trappings may look somewhat dated today, but thanks to Ron O’Neal‘s performance as main character Youngblood Priest — not to mention a killer Curtis Mayfield soundtrack — it still feels fresh. It’s easy to understand why music video veteran Director X wanted to take a shot at updating the story, and its themes are just as relevant as they were more than 45 years ago; unfortunately, critics say those themes have mostly been lost in this new version, which is far more focused on style than substance. Starring Trevor Jackson as Priest, the 2018 edition moves the action to Atlanta, but the basic contours of the story remain the same — which is part of why a number of reviews have outlined pundits’ disappointment with the lost social subtext. This Superfly&nbsp;will make its fortune by and by, thanks to Director X’s way with an artfully arranged scene or set piece, but as is so often the case with remakes, the original still reigns supreme.What’s New on TVThe Bold Type: Season 2 (2018)  100%The Bold Type presents an aspirational yet refreshingly realistic portrait of young women’s careers, friendships and love lives in a big city.Strange Angel: Season 1 (2018)  71%A beautiful slow burn, Strange Angel shoots for the stars, but gets a little lost in its own orbit.Also&nbsp;Opening This Week In Limited Release Eating Animals (2018) , a documentary about the commercial factory farming industry and its various impacts, is at 100%.

Whether it’s Mother Nature or Billy Zane out to get you, the movies make it easy to assume you won’t be in any hurry to get back on the water if you’re lucky enough to ever return to shore. This weekend’s Adrift, starring Shailene Woodley and Sam Claflin as a pair of ill-fated sailors, has the added benefit of being based on the true story of two lovebirds who set out for San Diego from Tahiti — and ended up sailing right into a ferocious hurricane. All manner of hardships follow, with Woodley (who plays real-life adventurer Tami Oldham) shouldering the brunt of the responsibility for getting the couple back to safety after the storm; as one might expect, the end result is something of a dramatic showcase for the Big Little Lies star, and critics say she makes the most of it. While reviews describe Adrift&nbsp;as a viewing experience whose narrative occasionally feels uncomfortably close to its title, it’s still a beautifully shot voyage that’s ultimately well worth taking.Upgrade (2018)  88%Take one part Six Million Dollar Man, add one part Death Wish&nbsp;revenge fantasy, and you’ve got Upgrade, starring Logan Marshall-Green as a man widowed and left for dead in a violent mugging. Approached by an inventor with an experimental cure that will not only heal his battered body, but grant him superhuman abilities, he accepts — and embarks on a quest to exact vengeance against his wife’s killers. It’s the type of setup that’s lent itself to countless low-budget genre outings, but in the hands of writer-director Leigh Whannell, this is one sci-fi thriller that actually delivers. Critics say Saw&nbsp;and Insidious&nbsp;vet Whannell is thoroughly in his element here, serving up grisly — and occasionally even inventive — action that’s leavened with enough humor to keep all the viscera from feeling too real. Whether you’re in the mood for a futuristic action movie with an old-school heart or you simply really enjoy watching wronged men beat the stuffing out of their antagonists, it looks like you can count on Upgrade living up to its name.Action Point (2018)  15%Audiences have been getting their yuks out of pratfalls since the days of Commedia dell’ arte, and it’s been a staple of cinema since Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton left filmgoers rolling in the aisles. All of which is to say that although Johnny Knoxville’s Jackass&nbsp;stunts tend to be viewed as lowbrow entertainment, it’s part of a proud tradition — and with this weekend’s Action Point, the long-suffering star takes a step further into scripted comedy with a movie about the owner of a failing, and decidedly unsafe, amusement park. It’s kind of like Jackass, in other words, which should put it right in Knoxville’s wheelhouse — and just as importantly, satisfy fans who’ll be expecting plenty of painful-looking set pieces. As for whether it’ll satisfy critics, well, that’s still an open question as of this writing.

Into the latter camp squarely falls Super Troopers, the low-budget laugher about incompetent cops that debuted to negative reviews and lukewarm box office in 2002, only to earn cult status over a decade-plus of home video viewing. More than 15 years after the original came and went with a whimper, meow’s the time for Super Troopers 2, which reunites the Broken Lizard gang for another round of goofball comedy. The importance of the plot here is secondary at best, but for those keeping track, it involves a border dispute between the United States and Canada; it’s a suitably silly premise for these characters, but unfortunately, the second time isn’t really the charm in terms of critical response. Reviews describe a film that simply isn’t all that funny — unless your idea of hilarious is rehashing gags from a previous movie or taking cheap shots at our neighbors to the north, this is one belated sequel that looks like a long-awaited disappointment.I Feel Pretty (2018)  35%With her hit Comedy Central series, her stand-up specials, and her breakout big-screen success&nbsp;Trainwreck, Amy Schumer has more than demonstrated a gift for making people laugh by finding the humor in painful or awkward situations.&nbsp;I Feel Pretty, the latest outing from writer-director duo&nbsp;Abby Kohn&nbsp;and&nbsp;Marc Silverstein&nbsp;(Never Been Kissed), would seem to have plenty of potential for tapping into that knack: Schumer stars as Renee Bennett, a woman whose deep-seated insecurities about her body are magically erased after she takes a header at the gym and wakes up believing she’s got supermodel looks. With a star who’s as adept at projecting brash overconfidence as she is at taking a fall for comedic effect, plus a premise poised to offer funny and thought-provoking observations about how much of the way others see us is tied into our own self-image,&nbsp;Pretty&nbsp;had the makings of a hit. Alas, critics say the end result is a largely unfunny affair that whiffs where it counts, playing at a fresh perspective on its rich themes without ever really figuring out where to go with them.Traffik (2018)  27%Don’t you just hate it when you head off on a weekend getaway with your significant other, only to cross paths with a depraved motorcycle gang of sex traffickers who simply will not leave you alone? Writer-director Deon Taylor understands — as evidenced by the arrival of Traffik, starring Paula Patton and Omar Epps as a couple whose romantic trip to the mountains is ruined after they inadvertently come into the possession of a cell phone belonging to some very bad people who are determined to retrieve it by any means necessary. Away from home in a secluded area, outnumbered and outmatched by violent foes — it’s the type of premise that’s produced plenty of watchable movies over the years, and the cast (which also includes the ever-compelling William Fichtner) isn’t short on charm. There’s at least a chance that it’ll all add up to a decent night out at the movies here, but since Traffik&nbsp;wasn’t screened for critics, we can’t say for sure just yet.

Yes, she’s one of the most acclaimed working actors in the business, and yes, she can command an arthouse audience with the best of ’em — but sometimes she feels like rolling up her sleeves and firing off a few rounds in some genre fare, and this weekend marks just one such occasion. Winchester&nbsp;presents a fictionalized — and presumably pretty scary — take on the story of Sarah Winchester, who inherited her husband’s vast fortune after the pioneering arms manufacturer’s sudden death in 1881. Convinced her family was haunted by the vengeful spirits of the countless people killed by her family’s wares, the widow Winchester was said to have kept crews working on her mansion constantly throughout the latter decades of her life, all in an attempt to keep the other side at bay. It all adds up to the stuff of a compelling paranormal feature, and Mirren is absolutely up to the task; unfortunately, the review embargo for Winchester&nbsp;hasn’t been lifted yet, so we can’t tell you what the critics think.

That all changes with 12 Strong, a Jerry Bruckheimer-produced look at the United States special ops unit who led the invasion into Afghanistan on horseback and were later honored with a monument at Ground Zero at the World Trade Center site in New York. As one might expect given its production pedigree, this isn’t the most thoughtful or reflective movie — but it also isn’t quite the jingoistic outing one might assume. The end result, according to critics, is an odd hybrid: a war drama that definitely doesn’t skimp on the action and/or flag-waving patriotism, but hints just enough at a deeper exploration of the real-life conflict at its center — and the thousands of lives affected — to leave some viewers wanting more. If it ends up being something less than the sum of its parts, they’re still solidly entertaining; in particular, reviews point to solid performances from the well-chosen ensemble, especially Hemsworth, who offers another hint of the wide-ranging potential waiting beyond his tenure in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Whether it succeeds in its mission to make audiences feel good about U.S. military involvement in the region may not be entirely clear, but if you’re among the target audience, feel free to safely saddle up for 12 Strong.Den of Thieves (2018)  42%Even diehard fans of the genre know better than to look for originality in an action movie released in January, so it should come as absolutely no surprise that critics approached Den of Thieves&nbsp;with a wary eye. Starring Gerard Butler as an LAPD officer determined to thwart a Federal Reserve heist plotted by a brilliant crew of thieves (Curtis “50 Cent” Jackson, O’Shea Jackson Jr., and Pablo Schreiber), this looks like just the type of shoot-’em-up thriller you might expect to find lurking at your local theater during the first few weeks of the year — and while the reviews basically back that up, they’ve also been surprisingly kind in context. It’s altogether unlikely to win any high honors (or even be remembered) come awards season, but as far as this type of thing goes, critics admit it does a decent amount with its obvious inspirations (which include Michael Mann’s classic Heat). Whether it’s worth the price of a ticket is for you to decide, but for the right audience under the right conditions, Den of Thieves&nbsp;appears painless enough.Forever My Girl (2018)  24%It’s been a little while since we had a new Nicholas Sparks movie in theaters — and unfortunately for the perennially bestselling author’s fans, that isn’t going to change anytime soon. But in the meantime, star-crossed romance enthusiasts have Forever My Girl, starring Alex Roe as a country star who’s drawn back to his hometown — and back into contact with the woman he left at the altar (Jessica Rothe) — after the death of his childhood best friend. Critics say writer-director Bethany Ashton Wolf pulls out all the Sparksian stops with this feature, but they’re nowhere near enough to keep it from suffering the same fate as many like-minded features: with a main character many pundits find off-putting and a central romance that wilts without sufficient onscreen chemistry, it’s heading into theaters with some of the weekend’s worst write-ups. Of course, if gauzily lit star-crossed lovers in a small-town setting is your thing, you’ve long since learned to shrug off a picture’s negative critical reception, so Forever My Girl‘s brutal reviews probably won’t stop you — but if you come away thinking this picture is more than a few tissues shy of a full box, don’t say we didn’t try to warn you.Call Me by Your Name (2018)  94%Who says January is a dumping ground for the least loved offerings in the studio vaults? We’ve got a trio of Certified Fresh releases opening wide this weekend, led by Call Me By Your Name. A critical favorite since the start of its limited run late last year, this exquisitely filmed coming-of-age romance — directed by Luca Guadagnino from a script by James Ivory — boasts some intoxicatingly lovely Italian landscapes to go with its handsome leading men (Timothée Chalamet and Armie Hammer), both of whom turn in outstanding performances. Name&nbsp;has earned nearly unanimous praise from pundits during its slow rollout over the last several weeks, and their decree couldn’t be clearer: if you’re capable of love and you care about cinema, this is one movie you don’t want to miss. Check your local listings accordingly.I, Tonya (2018)  90%Figure skating isn’t typically at the top of the list of sports most Americans care about, but there have definitely been exceptions — and the months leading up to the 1994 Winter Olympics, in which leading competitor Nancy Kerrigan was clubbed in the knee by associates of rival skater Tonya Harding, are definitely on that list. Harding’s story has been given the biopic treatment with I, Tonya, and it’s got a pretty impressive pedigree: Craig Gillespie (Lars and the Real Girl) directed, with Wolf of Wall Street&nbsp;and Suicide Squad&nbsp;breakout star Margot Robbie playing Harding among a stellar ensemble that includes Allison Janney as her mother and Sebastian Stan as her husband Jeff Gillooly, who was ultimately sentenced to two years in prison for his role in the scheme that injured Kerrigan. Critics say that this profoundly disquieting chapter in sports history has been refashioned into a darkly amusing indictment of modern pop culture in general, anchored by some truly outstanding performances from Robbie and Janney in particular. If it isn’t quite a triple axel, this Tonya&nbsp;still skates to a solid — and potentially award-winning — finish.Phantom Thread (2018)  91%All things must eventually come to an end, and with this weekend’s Phantom Thread, we’re evidently saying goodbye to one of the best: Daniel Day-Lewis has said that his performance in Paul Thomas Anderson‘s latest film will be his last. Each of Anderson’s movies is automatically appointment viewing for cineastes, and Day-Lewis’ retirement adds an extra layer of urgency; critics, meanwhile, have come out solidly in favor of this period drama, which follows the saga of a brilliant dressmaker who falls in love with a young lady (Vicky Krieps) and finds his well-appointed bachelor lifestyle coming (ahem) apart at the seams. With their previous collaboration, 2007’s There Will Be Blood, these two set the bar impossibly high — so it’s all the more to Phantom Thread‘s credit that it’s earned a nearly identical level of critical acclaim. Time will tell where this effort fits in either man’s filmography; for now, it’s enough to know that you can safely purchase a ticket and expect an enthrallingly uncompromising cinematic experience.What’s New on TVBlack Lightning: Season 1 (2018)  96%Black Lightning doesn’t reinvent superhero TV, but it does give the genre a necessary jolt with real-world plots, scary new villains, and a star-making performance from Cress Williams.American Crime Story: The Assassination of Gianni Versace (2018)  89%The Assassination of Versace&nbsp;starts with a bang and unfurls slowly, moving backward through an intricate (and occasionally convoluted) murder mystery anchored by a career-defining performance from Darren Criss.Also&nbsp;Opening This Week In Limited Release Mary and The Witch's Flower (2018) , the animated adventures of a young girl who stumbles upon a magical flower granting her special powers for a single night, is at 92 percent.

What are the critics saying?Insidious: The Last Key (2018)  33%Insidious&nbsp;was a wildly profitable success during its 2011 theatrical run, but one that reached its closing credits with a major problem: in killing off Lin Shaye’s Elise Rainier, it deprived the inevitable franchise of one of its most compelling characters. Insidious: Chapter 2&nbsp;tried working its way out of that corner by incorporating Elise as a spirit, then took a more pronounced pivot with Chapter 3, which traveled back in time to tell a prequel story featuring her as a main character. Based on the healthy box office returns, fans were eager for more of the parapsychologist’s scary adventures — and thanks largely to Shaye’s performance, that installment marked a critical rebound for the series, all but ensuring a fourth chapter. Shaye is back for this weekend’s Insidious: The Last Key, which follows the events of Chapter 3; unfortunately, critics say that despite her reliably solid work, the end result is a disappointing regression that falls back on cheap jump scares in a futile attempt to cover for its jumbled plot. It’ll more than likely still end up turning a profit, but this is one horror franchise that may have run its course with four films — and will hopefully lead to more leading roles for its tremendously talented star.Molly's Game (2018)  81%Molly Bloom was a nationally ranked skier whose exit from the sport led to a stranger-than-fiction rise and fall that saw her running a high-stakes poker game trafficked by superstars — and, ultimately, taken down in an FBI sting that led to an array of criminal charges for more than 30 people. Naturally, Bloom’s story led to a book deal, and it’s been begging for the big-screen treatment — which it’s now been given courtesy of Molly’s Game, starring Jessica Chastain as Bloom and Idris Elba as her lawyer, with acclaimed screenwriter Aaron Sorkin penning the script (and making his feature directorial debut). With ingredients like these, it’d be awfully hard to miss; happily, critics say Sorkin has more or less stuck the landing here, delivering a drama that lives up to its outlandishly entertaining premise while making plenty of room for all the barbed rapid-fire dialogue his previous projects have been known for. On top of all that, you’ve got the ever-reliable Elba and a Chastain performance that some scribes are calling a career best. If any of this sounds appealing to you, don’t delay — sign up for Molly’s Game at a theater near you.Also&nbsp;Opening This Week In Limited Release In Between (2018) , a drama about three Palestinian women living in Tel Aviv, is at 97 percent.

What are the critics saying?All the Money in the World (2017)  79%There were times in 2017 when it seemed like Hollywood couldn’t go a day without being rocked by a new scandal, so it’s perhaps only fitting that the year’s last wide release should be shadowed by behind-the-scenes drama. When setting out to film All the Money in the World, his account of the real-life kidnapping that grabbed headlines in 1973 when an heir to the Getty fortune was held for ransom, director Ridley Scott cast Kevin Spacey as billionaire Jean Paul Getty. But when Spacey was accused of an array of sexual misconduct in late October, Scott quickly enlisted Christopher Plummer to replace him, rounding up the cast for a rapid-fire round of reshoots that somehow only bumped the movie’s release back by a few days — and even more incredibly, seem to have been seamlessly inserted into the rest of the movie. In fact, critics say Plummer’s one of the best things about Money, which is grounded by his solid work and further enlivened by a tremendous turn from Michelle Williams as Abigail Harris, mother to the kidnapped J. Paul Getty III (Charlie Plummer). While some scribes feel Scott and screenwriter David Scarpa may have bitten off a little more than they could chew in terms of telling a ripping yarn while delving into timely socioeconomic subtext, the end result remains a solidly well-acted drama — and one that deserves to be seen apart from its luridly fascinating production pitfalls.What’s New on TVBlack Mirror: Season 4 (2017)  86%Black Mirror proves with its fourth season that the series still has ample source material to terrify fans with technology that is now — or soon could become — an integral part of our lives.Also&nbsp;Opening This Week In Limited Release The 19th Annual Animation Show of Shows (2017) , a roundup of exceptional animated shorts from around the world, is at 100 percent.

Henson&nbsp;and Lyriq Bent), and our latest assurance that the Almighty’s still hanging in there (God’s Not Dead: A Light in the Darkness, starring&nbsp;John Corbett&nbsp;and&nbsp;Jennifer Taylor).&nbsp;What are the critics saying?Ready Player One (2018)  72%In 2011, author Ernest Cline hit the bestseller charts with his book Ready Player One&nbsp;— a sci-fi adventure blending dystopian futurism, ’80s and ’90s nostalgia, and the basic plot of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory&nbsp;into a story that was pretty much begging for the big-screen treatment even before its impressive sales made an adaptation inevitable. Now the Ready Player One&nbsp;movie is finally here, courtesy of the best director for the job: Steven Spielberg, a guy whose filmography helped shape the era that looms large over the nostalgia-drenched action. Tye Sheridan stars as Wade Watts, a kid who escapes his hardscrabble existence by tooling around the VR network known as OASIS — a hugely popular diversion whose creator (Mark Rylance) has died and left behind an Easter egg bestowing complete control and unfathomable wealth to its finder. Naturally, a worldwide competition to unearth the egg ensues, with Wade in the midst of an increasingly perilous quest to beat countless competitors (including Ben Mendehlson as the CEO of a company bent on overtaking OASIS) while testing his encyclopedic knowledge of the pop culture of yore. It’s the type of thing that sits squarely in Spielberg’s wheelhouse, even if it depends on mashing the nostalgia button in a way that triggers those old endorphins just as often as it invites criticism that Hollywood has run out of ideas. Fortunately, the pundits say that even if Ready Player One&nbsp;isn’t exactly breaking new ground, it’s a perfect vehicle for Spielberg’s particular brand of storytelling — and even if you don’t catch every reference embedded in the movie, it still adds up to a fun adventure that earns its place in the director’s oeuvre.Tyler Perry's Acrimony (2018)  17%We’ve been here before, Tyler Perry fans. A new Perry film, led by one or more talented stars (in this case, Taraji P. Henson and Lyriq Bent), telling a story ripe with possibility for the sort of rich melodrama that’s helped make this writer-director a thriving industry unto himself — all of it sadly lacking enough reviews to offer any kind of clear idea as to what the critics might think. Of course, bad reviews never stopped a Tyler Perry movie from making bank at the box office, and even if the critics have their knives out for Tyler Perry’s Acrimony, there’s no reason to think audiences will turn down the opportunity to watch the story of a woman (Henson) who may have finally had enough when she learns that her husband (Bent) has been fooling around. Until we find out for sure, how about a round of Tyler Perry’s Guess the Tomatometer?God's Not Dead: A Light in Darkness (2018)  10%Fans of faith-based cinema have been faced with a bounty of choices lately. Two weeks ago, I Can Only Imagine&nbsp;arrived in theaters; last week, Paul, Apostle of Christ&nbsp;made its way to the cineplex; and this weekend, they’re followed by the third installment in Pure Flix’s God’s Not Dead&nbsp;trilogy, God’s Not Dead: A Light in Darkness. As with the previous two chapters, the cast includes Pure Flix co-founder David A.R. White as Reverend Dave, and he’s joined here by returning God’s Not Dead&nbsp;vet Shane Harper, reprising his role as Josh Wheaton to help tell the story of a congregation forced to rebuild after their church building burns down. As for how the franchise is holding up with the critics this time out, it’s unfortunately too soon to say — only a few reviews are in as of this writing. While we wait for more, let’s play Prophesize the Tomatometer!What’s New on TVThe Terror: Season 1 (2018)  94%A thriller wrapped in a prestige drama package, The Terror makes for gripping, atmospheric supernatural horror.Roseanne: Season 10 (2018)  69%Roseanne‘s return finds the show’s classic format, original cast, and timely humor intact, even if the latest batch of episodes suffers from sporadically uneven execution.Also&nbsp;Opening This Week In Limited Release Love After Love (2018) , starring Andie MacDowell as the matriarch of a family left adrift after her husband and the father of her children passes away, is at 100%.

The duo united for the final three installments in the Hunger Games film franchise, which racked up billions at the box office while proving that its Oscar-winning star could handle action thriller set pieces just as capably as she shouldered dramatic material. It’s a combination that’s being put to the test again with this weekend’s Red Sparrow, based on the Jason Matthews novel about a Russian spy (Jennifer Lawrence) whose assignment puts her in the path of a CIA op (Joel Edgerton) — and leaves her struggling over whether she’s really fighting for the good guys. It’s got all the ingredients for a thrillingly topical globetrotting adventure, which might be part of why critics say the end result is something of a disappointment; while Lawrence the director remains a proficient helmsman and Lawrence the star is just as magnetic as ever, the story never manages to follow through on its intriguing themes. It’s always a pleasure to see J-Law kicking butt on the big screen — just don’t expect Red Sparrow&nbsp;to leave much more than a stylish peck of an impression.Death Wish (2018)  18%He’ll always be arguably best remembered as an action star, but Bruce Willis has more than proven his dramatic chops — and Charles Bronson‘s Death Wish&nbsp;franchise, despite its subsequent slide into ludicrous exploitation fare, started out with the germ of an affecting idea about a grieving father and husband determined to deliver justice in a lawless land. All of which is to say that Willis leading a Death Wish remake is an idea not without a certain amount of promise: when he’s on his game, few actors communicate bruised bravado better, and the story of a man driven to vigilantism after his family is destroyed by violent crime could play to his strengths in any number of ways. As for how this all actually plays out on the big screen, well, we can’t tell you: a late-lifting embargo means that as of this writing, critics’ thoughts regarding this remake are still largely unknown. When reviews roll out this late, it’s rarely a good sign, but we’re still Wish-ing for the best here — and while we wait for those quotes to come in, we’re passing the time with a round of Guess the Tomatometer.What’s New on TVAtlanta: Robbin' Season (2018)  98%Donald Glover continues to subvert expectations with a sophomore season of Atlanta that proves as excellent as it is eccentric.The Looming Tower: Miniseries (2018)  88%Well-acted and powerfully written, The Looming Tower delivers gripping counter-terrorism drama rendered even more soberingly effective through its roots in real-life events.Also&nbsp;Opening This Week In Limited Release Dance Academy: The Comeback (2018) , starring Xenia Goodwin as a young dancer determined to make a — you guessed it — comeback after a devastating injury, is at 100 percent.

The Maze Runner&nbsp;movies were forced to confront this principle in action when leading man Dylan O’Brien was injured on the set of the third installment, Maze Runner: The Death Cure; O’Brien’s surgery and recovery led to a delay of roughly a year, and although a person’s health is obviously far more important than the commercial fortunes of a film, there’s no denying that most releases in this genre have a fairly limited shelf life, and by waiting, The Death Cure&nbsp;risked seeing its window swing shut. On the other hand, its prolonged gestation doesn’t seem to have affected this chapter’s critical reception; like the prior Maze Runner outing, 2015’s The Scorch Trials, it’s edging up on a 50 percent Tomatometer, with reviews describing a saga-concluding adventure that proves occasionally exciting in a generally predictable fashion. For fans who’ve followed along until now and are still along for the ride, Maze Runner: The Death Cure&nbsp;should prove an engaging enough conclusion — but as with any other film series approaching its end, the unconverted probably need not apply.Hostiles (2018)  70%Writer-director Scott Cooper has earned widespread critical acclaim by finding the emotional pull in stories about hard people having hard times in hard places, and with this weekend’s Hostiles, his creative journey takes him back to the late 19th century and way out west, where a U.S. Cavalry officer stationed in New Mexico (Christian Bale) is ordered to bring a dying Cheyenne chief (Wes Studi) back to his tribal land in Montana. Along the way, their group encounters a ruined home where a shellshocked widow (Rosamund Pike) is grieving the murder of her family by a Comanche war party — a meeting that irrevocably alters the journey for all concerned. It’s the setup for the type of wind-whipped frontier drama we’ve already seen countless times, and critics say Hostiles&nbsp;definitely hews to its share of conventions. The end results still engage, however, thanks to Cooper’s determined direction and layered story — not to mention typically great work from Bale and Studi as well as a standout performance from Pike. While it ultimately may not lead audiences down many trails they haven’t already explored, Cooper’s latest outing makes it well worth saddling up for genre fans.Also&nbsp;Opening This Week In Limited Release Kickboxer: Retaliation (2018) , the latest installment in the long-running rebooted martial arts series, is at 100 percent.

The answer — or something like it — might lie in Game Night, in which a married couple (Jason Bateman and Rachel McAdams) find their weekly get-together with friends turned upside down when Bateman’s brother (Kyle Chandler) adds a murder mystery twist that soon seems all too real. It’s a solid setup for the type of pitch-black lunacy that co-directors John Francis Daley and Jonathan Goldstein are known for, and although they’re not responsible for the script — that honor goes to former Disney writer Mark Perez — critics say the end result is still a comedy that just about lives up to its loaded premise, thanks in no small part to the efforts of a well-chosen cast. Whether you’re a fan of the people involved or simply in the mood for some laughs with a slightly nasty edge, Game Night&nbsp;looks like a winner.Annihilation (2018)  88%In this week’s cinematic equivalent of “unstoppable force meets immovable object,” author Jeff VanderMeer’s allegedly unfilmable sci-fi bestseller Annihilation&nbsp;meets acclaimed young director Alex Garland — and the winner turns out to be the audience. Critics say that this horror-tinged science fiction drama may not be the most faithful adaptation of the book, but it distills its core themes into a thoughtful, unapologetically challenging experience that leavens its weightier ingredients with genre thrills, outstanding performances from an ensemble cast, and a refreshing willingness to get weird. Expect the unexpected from Annihilation&nbsp;— and if the box office is kind, expect some sequels too, since VanderMeer’s book has a couple of follow-ups already on store shelves.Every Day (2018)  62%At this point, a filmgoer could definitely be forgiven for assuming that if you’ve seen one young adult romance, you’ve seen ’em all. There are exceptions, however, and despite what its rather generic title and fresh-scrubbed marketing materials might suggest, Every Day&nbsp;definitely adds a wrinkle to the genre. An adaptation of the David Levithan novel, this Michael Sucsy-directed drama follows the budding love between 16-year-old Rhiannon (Angourie Rice) and A — a literal wandering soul who inhabits a different body (ahem) every day. As a way of exploring gender fluidity — and the setup for a film whose cast is refreshingly diverse — it has a lot of potential. But while a number of critics have responded to the end result, the overall reception is turning out to be somewhat lukewarm. It’s still early for Every Day, with just a handful of reviews posted, and if you or your fellow filmgoers of choice are part of the target audience for this type of story, then you may still want to investigate. On the whole, however, this looks like something of a missed opportunity.Also&nbsp;Opening This Week In Limited Release November (2018) , a black-and-white sci-fi romance set in 19th century Estonia, is at 100 percent.

A Madea Halloween, starring&nbsp;Tyler Perry&nbsp;and&nbsp;Cassi Davis), a detective on the trail of a serial killer (The Snowman,&nbsp;starring&nbsp;Michael Fassbender&nbsp;and&nbsp;Rebecca Ferguson), and the tale of an unlikely real-life friendship (Same Kind of Different as Me,&nbsp;starring&nbsp;Greg Kinnear&nbsp;and&nbsp;Renée Zellweger). What are the critics saying?Only the Brave (2017)  87%It can feel like it’s almost impossible to find a real hero these days — from the scurrilous behavior we see in the headlines to the darkness that seems to plague most modern incarnations of our most beloved cinematic good guys, life (and pop culture) makes it easy to second-guess who you’ve been rooting for. But in&nbsp;Only the Brave, the lines are pretty clear: on one side, you’ve got a raging wildfire threatening to engulf Arizona; on the other, you have the band of determined first responders who battled the blaze, some of whom paid the ultimate price for their dedication. It’s an old-fashioned tribute to heroism, in other words, and critics say it’s a darned effective one — a down-to-earth change of pace for&nbsp;Oblivion&nbsp;and&nbsp;Tron: Legacy&nbsp;director&nbsp;Joseph Kosinski, it’s led by a solid ensemble cast rounded out by&nbsp;Jeff Bridges, Josh Brolin, and Miles Teller. Both as a stirring drama and a powerful tribute to the real-life firefighters who lost their lives, it’s being lauded as the kind of movie that sends you out of the theater full of emotion. If you’ve ever complained that Hollywood doesn’t make ’em like they used to,&nbsp;Only the Brave&nbsp;looks like a good way to invest your theatergoing dollars this weekend.Geostorm (2017)  16%As the writer and producer of effects-fueled movies like Independence Day&nbsp;and the 1998 Godzilla, Dean Devlin has learned a thing or two about blockbuster spectacle during his career — and Gerard Butler, star of 300&nbsp;and the [Insert City Here] Has Fallen&nbsp;franchise, certainly knows his way around some CGI and a bunch of explosions. This weekend, the duo unite for Geostorm, a futuristic sci-fi action thriller — written, produced, and helmed by first-time director Devlin — in which Butler plays a satellite designer racing against time to save humanity after the machines controlling Earth’s climate go haywire. We can definitely expect a lot of serious looks, millions of dollars’ worth of special effects, and perhaps the destruction of a landmark or two, but unfortunately, the few critics who have weighed in thus far haven’t been particularly impressed by Devlin’s brand of world destruction, which they describe as flashy but ultimately uninspired.&nbsp;While more reviews&nbsp;steadily&nbsp;roll in and the Tomatometer begins to settle,&nbsp;feel free to check out our list of 24 disastrous disaster movies.Tyler Perry's Boo 2! A Madea Halloween (2017)  4%A year after scaring up nearly $75 million with Boo! A Madea Halloween, Tyler Perry has donned his most famous creation’s getup for the inevitable sequel. The tenth film in Perry’s wildly popular Madea&nbsp;series, Tyler Perry’s Boo 2! A Madea Halloween&nbsp;finds the title character in a haunted campground, where she, her cousin Aunt Bam, and their friend Hattie wind up in the middle of all manner of supernatural shenanigans. There will certainly be a lot of screaming involved, although whether any of it will come from the critics, we can only imagine. Boo 2!&nbsp;wasn’t screened in advance, so we’re still waiting on word regarding whether the scribes think Madea’s latest is worth your hard-earned income. In other words, guess the Tomatometer!The Snowman (2017)  7%All things considered, “Harry Hole” probably has to be one of the more unfortunate names for a big-screen police detective, but when an actor with Michael Fassbender’s steely charisma is playing a character, names don’t matter as much — and anyway, ol’ Harry has been thrilling readers with his bestselling exploits for 20 years, courtesy of author Jo Nesbø’s apparently boundless imagination for twisted crime stories. Detective Hole makes his Hollywood debut with this weekend’s The Snowman, helmed by director Tomas Alfredson (Let the Right One In, Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy) and adapted from the seventh novel in the series, in which he must find and decommission a serial killer with a distinctively nasty calling card. Needless to say, this movie would seem to have all the right ingredients for a chilly good time, which makes it all the more disappointing that critics have rejected it so resoundingly — reviews describe a movie that misses the mark on any number of levels, from its clichéd and uninvolving plot to its troublingly sexist overtones. Fassbender remains an actor with more than enough cinematic authority to flash a badge and catch a perp, but The Snowman&nbsp;looks like a cold case in all the wrong ways.Same Kind of Different As Me (2017)  40%Only the Brave&nbsp;isn’t the only movie based on a real-life story this week. We also have Same Kind of Different as Me, inspired by the book written by Ron Hall and Denver Moore about how fundamentally both of their lives changed after they struck up a friendship sparked by Hall’s wife. Starring Greg Kinnear as Hall, Djimon Hounsou as Moore, and Renée Zellweger as Deborah Hall, Different&nbsp;makes its way to theaters after a long delay in the studio pipeline — this is a picture that was originally scheduled to be released last April, which doesn’t tend to bode well for a movie’s critical fortunes. Alas, we can’t say for sure quite yet, and you know what that means: it’s time to play Guess the Tomatometer for the second time this week.What’s New on TVMindhunter: Season 1 (2017)  96%Mindhunter distinguishes itself in a crowded genre with ambitiously cinematic visuals and a meticulous attention to character development.Also&nbsp;Opening This Week In Limited Release Jane (2017) , a documentary about animal rights advocate Jane Goodall’s life and pioneering work, is at 100 percent.

What are the critics saying?Kingsman: The Golden Circle (2017)  51%He may not be a household name for non-comics readers, but Mark Millar’s work has inspired a growing number of screen adaptations, including Wanted, the Kick-Ass&nbsp;franchise, and Kingsman: The Secret Service&nbsp;— which gets its own sequel this week in the form of Kingsman: The Golden Circle. Another gleefully over-the-top sendup of the spy thriller genre, this installment keeps its tongue firmly in cheek while upping the action, doubling down on the heavily stylized violence, and reuniting members of the original cast (some of whom seem to be blithely disobeying the laws of nature). Sadly, critics say it all adds up to a disappointingly hollow spectacle; although diehard fans of the first film and viewers in the mood for cheerfully tasteless humor might find it worth a trip to the theater, this Kingsman‘s mad dash to outdo its predecessor comes at the expense of the infectious spirit that made it a hit.The Lego Ninjago Movie (2017)  56%It was awfully easy to be cynical about the idea of&nbsp;The LEGO Movie, but the film’s clever humor, infectiously anarchic spirit, and eye-catching animation proved you can turn a feature-length toy commercial into compelling — and even downright moving — viewing.&nbsp;Three years later, we’ve got ourselves a whole LEGO cinematic universe, which expands to include one of the plastic brickmaker’s more popular offshoots with this weekend’s&nbsp;The LEGO Ninjago Movie. Based on the Ninjago toy and TV mythology, which is too elaborate to delve into here but involves the ninjas and dragons so beloved among the target LEGO demographic, this spinoff follows the adventures of six teens (led by Dave Franco) determined to thwart an evil warlord (Justin Theroux) with the help of their wise Master Wu (Jackie Chan). It’s just the type of self-affirming quest we’ve seen plenty of times before, in other words — and exactly the kind of formula previous&nbsp;LEGO&nbsp;outings have effectively tweaked. Unfortunately, that streak stops here: reviews describe an animated adventure that isn’t quite fun or funny enough to disguise its overall familiarity with earlier&nbsp;LEGO&nbsp;films, and more than a few critics have argued that without a creative shakeup, the franchise could be in trouble. That being said, the target demographic should still find it perfectly entertaining, so prepare to purchase matinee tickets… and field requests for a few Ninjago sets after the end credits roll.Friend Request (2017)  17%Between FOMO, political arguments, and managing overlapping circles of occasionally contentious relationships, social media can certainly feel like it’s bad for your health. But in Friend Request, it’s straight up fatal — at least for Laura (Alycia Debnam-Carey), a college student whose busy social life takes a dark turn after she adds a mysterious young woman (Liesl Ahlers) to her online circle. There’s the gem of a nicely novel wrinkle in the old nubile slasher formula here, but critics say the movie doesn’t take it anywhere near far enough, content to settle for yet another unremarkable addition to the long list of movies about attractive young people meeting grisly fates. In the context of the genre, the reviews are far from the worst one might expect, but all things considered, this is a Friend Request you might be better off ignoring.What’s New on TVThe Good Place: Season 2 (2017)  100%By voluntarily blowing up its premise, The Good Place&nbsp;sets up a second season that proves even funnier than its first.Also&nbsp;Opening This Week In Limited Release Unrest (2017) , a documentary about the societal and physical struggles faced by sufferers of Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, is at 100 percent.

What are the critics saying?Murder On The Orient Express (2017)  60%Strangers on a train, trapped in an avalanche, with murder afoot and the world’s greatest detective on the case: in a career full of classic mysteries, Murder on the Orient Express&nbsp;ranks among author Agatha Christie’s most brilliantly conceived stories. Naturally, it’s already been adapted more than once, including a 1974 big-screen version directed by Sidney Lumet and boasting some of the most famous actors of its day — an all-star ensemble spirit recaptured in the Kenneth Branagh version pulling into theaters this weekend. The award-winning director also leads the cast as renowned detective Hercule Poirot, whose dreams of a leisurely ride on the titular train are dashed when a passenger (Johnny Depp) approaches him for help, and is subsequently found stabbed to death by one of his fellow travelers — a group that includes characters played by Judi Dench, Michelle Pfeiffer, Penélope Cruz, Willem Dafoe, and Daisy Ridley, just to name a few. With all the talent assembled, it’d be a surprise if Branagh’s Orient&nbsp;was less than entertaining, so the good news is that critics say this retelling makes solid use of its source material and its sterling cast. The bad news? While it has its moments, it hardly feels essential — and for anyone who already knows the story, Christie’s twists will have lost their ability to surprise. Don’t be afraid to buy a ticket for this voyage, in other words, but you might want to temper your expectations, especially if you already know whodunit.Daddy's Home 2 (2017)  21%‘Tis the season… for holiday-themed sequels adding an older generation of actors to play the parents of the original stars! Ho, ho, ho. One week after A Bad Moms Christmas&nbsp;sought to double down on the laughs by introducing the bad moms’ moms, here comes Daddy’s Home 2, the second chapter in the comedic saga of mild-mannered suburban Brad (Will Ferrell) who’s learning how to coexist with his stepkids’ father Dusty (Mark Wahlberg). After spending the first film largely at odds, the two have struck up a friendship — which is put to the test in the sequel, thanks to Christmas visits from Ferrell’s PDA-dispensing pops (John Lithgow) and Wahlberg’s uncouth old man (Mel Gibson), not to mention interference from the biological father (John Cena) of Dusty’s&nbsp;stepchild. It’s the stuff holiday nightmares are made of — or big laughs, if the cast and the screenwriters play their cards right. Unfortunately, we can’t tell you which is which yet with Daddy’s Home 2, because reviews are still embargoed.

What are the critics saying?It (2017)  86%Plenty of Stephen King’s bestsellers have made the journey to theaters over the last several decades, but 1986’s It&nbsp;— about friends forced to do battle with an ancient evil plaguing the streets of their quaint Maine town — has thus far been relegated to the small screen. That changes with this weekend’s Andrés Muschietti-helmed adaptation, which covers the book’s first half, focusing on the group’s younger years and their first terrifying battle against the being known as Pennywise. Filmgoers have certainly been eager to see a blockbuster-sized It, and broke the horror movie ticket presale record to prove it; happily, critics say that show of faith has been richly rewarded with one of the better films derived from the King oeuvre. By sticking to the book’s opening act, Muschietti’s given his movie more room to develop its characters — and just as importantly, made it possible to balance the story’s supernatural horror against moments of humor and the real-world drama of its deeper themes. Even if you already know the story by heart, be prepared to sleep with the lights on for a night or two… and maybe eye red balloons suspiciously for a while, too.Home Again (2017)  32%It’s been a little while since Hollywood served up an old-fashioned romantic comedy, and Home Again — starring Reese Witherspoon as a single mom whose life is upended when she decides to house a trio of younger men — certainly seems to fit the bill. And for good reason: aside from rom-com veteran Witherspoon, the movie comes with an impressive pedigree. Producer Nancy Meyers is a name familiar to fans of the genre as the writer and/or director of entries like Baby Boom, Father of the Bride, and Something’s Gotta Give&nbsp;— and writer-director Hallie Meyers-Shyer, who’s making her directorial debut here, is Meyers’ daughter. In other words, Home Again&nbsp;looks like a surefire winner on paper, which makes it all the more disappointing that so many critics have been so resolutely unimpressed with the end result. Reviews describe a film that definitely has its share of Meyers’ creative DNA, for better as well as for worse; if fans of the aforementioned hits will likely find it acceptably entertaining, they may also feel like they’ve seen it all done better before. On the other hand, it’ll help you avoid scary clowns this weekend.What’s New on TVThe Deuce: Season 1 (2017)  93%The Deuce again demonstrates David Simon‘s masterful grasp of urban grit, while never losing detailed sight of its colorful characters.Also&nbsp;Opening This Week In Limited Release Trophy (2017) , a documentary about the environmental impact of African big game hunting, is at 100 percent.

What are the critics saying?Thor: Ragnarok (2017)  93%The Marvel Cinematic Universe‘s decade of box office domination has been pretty much all-around impressive, but not all superhero blockbusters are created equal, and the Thor&nbsp;franchise has been the de facto black sheep among the studio’s growing roster of critical and commercial hits. That looks likely to change with the third installment, Thor: Ragnarok, which sees acclaimed indie director Taika Waititi taking the reins for a colorful adventure that bears witness to the destruction of Asgard, the exile and enslavement of Thor, and a Norse doomsday prophecy — and somehow manages to make it all a lot of fun. Critics say Waititi’s loose, improv-friendly approach brings out the best in leading man Chris Hemsworth, who gets an able assist from Mark Ruffalo as the Hulk, and the cast lives right up to the MCU tradition of stocking its ensembles with respected veterans — in this case Jeff Goldblum, who appears as the Grandmaster, and Cate Blanchett, who strides into the Marvel Universe as the nefarious Hela. Nearly 20 movies into the MCU, the mythology is more unwieldy than ever, but Marvel keeps managing to find a way to balance its rich history against good old-fashioned popcorn fun — and Thor: Ragnarok&nbsp;looks like it’s even more fun than most.A Bad Moms Christmas (2017)  32%Last year’s Bad Moms&nbsp;wasn’t really anyone’s idea of a critic’s favorite. It united an extremely talented cast in pursuit of mildly transgressive comedy honoring an underserved audience, however — and it made plenty of money in the bargain, so a sequel was basically a foregone conclusion. It arrives in the form of A Bad Moms Christmas, which reunites leads Mila Kunis, Kristen Bell, and Kathryn Hahn in an appropriately holiday-themed follow-up that, following the grand sequel tradition, ladles on another helping of the original ingredients while managing to somehow raise the stakes. In this case, it’s by introducing the bad moms’ bad moms — played by Christine Baranski, Cheryl Hines, and Susan Sarandon — who show up to visit their daughters and threaten to derail our harried heroines’ holidays. Throw in some petty theft, day drinking, and a little yuletide twerking, and you’ve got yourself an appropriately bawdy time; unfortunately, critics say none of it is really all that amusing. The cast definitely has comedic chops, and their efforts are good for a chuckle or two, but reviews describe a movie more focused on raunchy gags than an engaging story — and one that splits up its engaging leads far too much of the time. Here’s hoping that A Bad Moms Fourth of July&nbsp;hits more often than it misses; in the meantime, you might as well wait to watch this until you’ve got a tall mug of high-proof eggnog to help pass the time.LBJ (2017)  58%A nation divided! A White House in turmoil! No, it isn’t a documentary about the aftermath of the 2016 election — that’s 11/8/16, also opening this week. We’re talking about LBJ, the new Rob Reiner release starring Woody Harrelson as the cantankerous Texas senator who ascended to the presidency after John F. Kennedy’s assassination. You don’t have to be a historian to know Johnson’s legacy is a fascinating blend of ambition and ideals, and by all rights, this should be a brilliantly entertaining biopic, especially with an old pro like Reiner directing a star who’s recently delivered some of the best work of his career. Alas, critics say it just wasn’t to be: at its best, LBJ&nbsp;merely skims the surface of its subject’s story, and even though it benefits from focusing on a narrow period in his political career, the end result is neither as illuminating nor as hard-hitting as it should have been — flaws thrown into even starker relief by the mounds of latex altering Harrelson’s appearance. If you want to watch a solid movie about our 36th president this weekend, your best bet is still last year’s HBO release All the Way, starring Bryan Cranston as Johnson.What’s New on TVAlias Grace: Miniseries (2017)  99%Biting social commentary and Sarah Gadon‘s hypnotic performance make Alias Grace a worthy addition to the Margaret Atwood adaptation catalog.Also&nbsp;Opening This Week In Limited Release Lady Bird (2017) , a dramedy from writer-director Greta Gerwig about the tumultuous relationship between a teenager (Saoirse Ronan) and her mother (Laurie Metcalf), is Certified Fresh at 100 percent.

What are the critics saying?Blade Runner 2049 (2017)  88%After Blade Runner‘s 1982 theatrical run ended in box office defeat, a sequel was the furthest thing from anyone’s mind — not least because it was based on a Philip K. Dick short story with a beginning, middle, and end. But 35 years later, what was once a Ridley Scott flop has become a cult favorite that’s widely acknowledged as a towering sci-fi classic, and there isn’t a major studio left in Hollywood that isn’t eager to leverage a brand name property into a franchise. Enter Blade Runner 2049, in which director Denis Villeneuve attempts the unenviable task of following up a film that’s not only a generational touchstone of its genre, but ended up exerting a massive tonal and aesthetic influence. Is it even possible to continue the original in a way that honors Dick’s universe while living up to the first film’s brilliance? Time will obviously tell regarding its eventual cultural legacy, but as far as first reactions are concerned, critics have had no problem acknowledging Blade Runner 2049 as a brilliant cinematic achievement in its own right. Starring Ryan Gosling as K, a new Blade Runner whose replicant-hunting duties put him on a quest that leads him to Rick Deckard (a returning Harrison Ford), the film is described as a thoughtful, deliberately paced expansion of its predecessor’s world — and one that packs a thrilling visual wallop, courtesy of work from cinematographer Roger Deakins that has more than a few pundits pointing to awards season. Screen your copy of the Blade Runner&nbsp;Final Cut and get to a theater; this is the rare thinking person’s popcorn flick that critics almost universally agree is worth the trip.The Mountain Between Us (2017)  38%Being in a plane crash isn’t much fun, but surviving can be pretty cool — and if you get to walk away from the wreckage with Kate Winslet or Idris Elba, that seems like a nice bonus too. But it has its ups and downs in this weekend’s The Mountain Between Us, in which Winslet and Elba are thrown together by fate after their charter plane crashes, leaving her Alex Martin (a photojournalist) to wander the snowy Utah wilderness alongside his Dr. Ben Bass (a surgeon) in an increasingly desperate fight to stay alive. Adapted by Paradise Now&nbsp;and Omar&nbsp;director Hany Abu-Assad (working from a screenplay by Chris Weitz and J. Mills Goodloe) from Charles Martin’s bestselling novel, this Mountain&nbsp;has all the beautiful scenery — and beautiful stars — one could ask for from a sweeping wilderness survival romance, as well as a couple of terrific actors in the lead. Yet as far as most critics are concerned, it remains perplexingly less than the sum of those parts, with solid work from its stars hampered by a plot-driven story and undermined by some distracting clichés. The performances aren’t the problem here, and there’s plenty of pretty scenery to enjoy even without a truly compelling story; still, all things considered, the view from this Mountain&nbsp;looks like a missed opportunity.My Little Pony: The Movie (2017)  46%Once widely regarded as little more than a perfectly innocuous addition to the same girl-focused block of animated half-hour toy commercials that included Strawberry Shortcake&nbsp;and Rainbow Brite&nbsp;in the ’80s, the My Little Pony&nbsp;franchise has enjoyed a remarkable resurgence over the last decade or so. Sparked by the wildly popular My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic&nbsp;series and stoked by its spinoffs, this colorful ode to equine harmony has never been more popular — which is what makes it a great time for My Little Pony: The Movie. Of course, as filmgoers of a certain age may recall, this isn’t the Ponies’ first trip to theaters; there was also a My Little Pony movie in the summer of 1986, but it arrived with neither the all-star voice cast nor the all-ages audience that this one has lined up. The storyline, which finds our hooved heroes trying to thwart a threat to Equestria, may be little more than a feature-length version of a show episode, but that might be exactly what Pony fans are looking for. As for the rest of us? Not many critics have posted reviews of My Little Pony: The Movie, but the few who’ve written it up say it lives up to its title, for better and for worse — if you want to see a My Little Pony&nbsp;movie, this is for you; otherwise, feel free to give it a pass.Victoria &amp; Abdul (2017)  66%Dame Judi Dench has long since proven that she has more than enough talent to play any character she darn well pleases. But as evidenced by her Oscar-winning work in 1997’s Mrs. Brown, she’s uniquely well-suited to the role of Queen Victoria — and fans of that acclaimed arthouse hit have something special to look forward to this weekend, as Dench returns to the throne for Victoria &amp; Abdul. Opening a chapter into the Queen’s later years, this Stephen Frears-directed dramedy adapts Shrabani Basu’s book about the real-life friendship between the titular monarch and Abdul Karim, an attendant who served in her retinue during the final 15 years of her reign. Needless to say, there’s a lot of rich history to be mined from this fictionalized account, and while critics have been open in their disappointment with the soft-focus approach the film takes to the story’s more serious themes, most agree that Dench’s performance is enough to make it a worthwhile — albeit less than enlightening — watch.The Stray (2017)  40%There’s nothing quite like the bond between a dog and its human. For proof, we point you to the many, many heart-tugging dramas about pooches that Hollywood’s pumped out over the years — including the brand new The Stray, which has the added bonus of including a faith-based component in its uplifting tale. Directed and co-written by former studio exec Mitch Davis and inspired by events in his own life, it tells the story of — you guessed it — a stray dog whose arrival impacts one family in all sorts of miraculous ways. It’s a setup with all sorts of tear duct-purging potential, but the small handful of critics who’ve seen it say The Stray&nbsp;scampers past “heartwarming” and goes howling into full-on melodrama, aggressively working the audience’s emotions along the way. If you’re predisposed to pup cinema or looking for some old-fashioned family entertainment, you might be moved; otherwise, it’s probably safe to wait until the movie’s on home video before throwing it a bone.Also&nbsp;Opening This Week In Limited Release Faces Places (Visages, villages) (2017) ,&nbsp;a documentary about the relationship between filmmaker&nbsp;Agnès Varda&nbsp;and and photographer&nbsp;JR, is at 100 percent.

What are the critics saying?Suburbicon (2017)  28%George Clooney and the Coen brothers have made Hollywood magic together on more than one occasion — from O Brother, Where Art Thou?&nbsp;to Intolerable Cruelty, Burn After Reading, and Hail, Caesar!, whenever you see their names together, it’s a pretty reliable indicator that you’re in for a fun time at the movies. They’ve reunited for Suburbicon, with a twist: this time out, Clooney’s in the director’s chair, working from an older Coens script that he polished with his longtime collaborator Grant Heslov — and unlike their previous projects, it’s far less of a goofball laugher. Instead, this dark comedy stars Matt Damon as a ’50s suburbanite embroiled in a murder mystery that’s unraveling while the neighborhood is up in arms about a black family moving in — all ingredients that Clooney and the Coens have made effective use of before. Here, however, critics say the plots feel awkwardly jammed together, and the end result is a movie that’s fatally undermined by tonal inconsistencies that serve to highlight the flaws in that long-shelved screenplay. Less than the sum of its impressive parts, Suburbicon seems destined to become an unloved footnote in the filmographies of all parties involved.Thank You for Your Service (2017)  77%For decades in Hollywood, soldiers were treated more or less like action heroes, with noble adventures whose broader implications — and aftereffects — weren’t cause for concern after the closing credits. In more recent years, however, it’s become far more common for movies to delve into what it means&nbsp;to be a soldier, and how difficult it can be to grapple with one’s actions on the battlefield once your tour of duty is over. Writer-director Jason Hall adds to that tradition with Thank You for Your Service, which stars Miles Teller as one among a group of veterans who return from the war in Iraq to discover that their time in the emotional trenches is just beginning. It’s far from feel-good entertainment, in other words, but the story’s nothing if not timely — and critics say Hall and his cast honor real-life veterans with an admirably straightforward drama whose quiet, grounded approach to depicting post-traumatic stress disorder only augments its power. This definitely isn’t the easiest watch among the new arrivals at the cineplex, but if you’re searching for something thought-provoking at the theater this weekend, start with Service.Jigsaw (2017)  32%Between the&nbsp;2004 original&nbsp;and 2010’s&nbsp;Saw 3D, the&nbsp;Saw&nbsp;franchise&nbsp;was an annual institution for horror lovers, with an increasingly elaborate mythology to match the wickedly inventive (and frequently lethal) traps that sent a long list of victims screaming over the edge. Diminishing returns brought the saga to its alleged end with the seventh installment, but no film series stays dead for long anymore — and with this weekend’s&nbsp;Jigsaw, the&nbsp;Saw&nbsp;franchise gets its own stab at reinvention. This time around, police investigators are faced with a spate of new murders that seem to fit the Jigsaw killer’s M.O.; while they race against time to catch the culprit (or culprits), the killings pile up, presumably laying the groundwork for a new era of&nbsp;Saw&nbsp;movies along the way. Obviously, it remains to be seen whether audiences will turn out in sufficient numbers to justify any sequels — and unfortunately, we know just as little about how the critics will react to&nbsp;Jigsaw, because it wasn’t screened in advance. While we wait, let’s make do with a round of Guess the Tomatometer… which is still a lot more fun than trying to extricate yourself from one of those gross traps.What’s New on TVStranger Things: Season 2 (2017)  94%Stranger Things‘ slow-building sophomore season balances moments of humor and a nostalgic sweetness against a growing horror that’s all the more effective thanks to the show’s full-bodied characters and evocative tone.Also&nbsp;Opening This Week In Limited Release The Work (2017) , a documentary look at a groundbreaking prison therapy group, is at 100 percent.

What&nbsp;are the critics saying?Dunkirk (2017)  92%World War II has been used as the backdrop for so many movies that at this point, it can be tempting to believe we’ve seen it all and know the whole story. Yet in the right hands, there are still compelling, unique, and impactful tales of the conflict waiting to be told — and with this weekend’s Dunkirk, critics say Christopher Nolan delivers on all three counts with a film that might be considered an all-time classic of the genre. Starring Fionn Whitehead and an ensemble that includes Kenneth Branagh, Cillian Murphy, Mark Rylance, and Tom Hardy, the story dramatizes the mission to evacuate surrounded Allied soldiers during the spring of 1940 — an incredible undertaking that saved hundreds of thousands of troops through the efforts of a coalition that included soldiers and civilians. Reviews describe a harrowing yet ultimately inspiring experience that honors its heroes with gripping suspense, immersive drama, and thrilling spectacle, as well as another impressive chapter in an increasingly acclaimed filmography that looks likely to be a major awards season contender.Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets (2017)  47%As a writer, director, and producer, Luc Besson has dabbled in a variety of genres throughout his career, with frequently acclaimed results — but for fans of the filmmaker’s more visually striking flights of sci-fi fancy, it doesn’t get much better than 1997’s colorfully zany The Fifth Element. He’s back in outer space this weekend with Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets, the $200 million realization of Besson’s lifelong dream to adapt the French comic series Valérian and Laureline&nbsp;into an eye-popping spectacle about a pair of space-time travelers (Dane DeHaan and Cara Delevingne) on a mission to secure the future of the universe. And if spectacle is all you’re looking for, this definitely delivers; critics say that whatever its flaws, Valerian&nbsp;delivers on the visual front, with colorful spacescapes and countless aliens (including one played by Rihanna, whose scene-stealing appearance left several critics lamenting its brief length). Unfortunately, reviews describe a much more muddled affair on the narrative front, further compounded by DeHaan and Delevingne’s failure to match the vividness of their eye-popping environs with their own somewhat stilted performances. There’s plenty to see here, warn the pundits, but it’s best enjoyed if you can disengage your brain.Girls Trip (2017)  91%The post-Bridesmaids&nbsp;era has offered no shortage of bawdy comedies about ladies having an R-rated good time, but more often than not, the end results have left critics largely chuckle-free. The makers of this weekend’s Girls Trip&nbsp;are looking to buck that trend with the raunchy adventures of four friends (Regina Hall, Queen Latifah, Jada Pinkett Smith, and Tiffany Haddish) whose trip to New Orleans for the Essence Festival offers no shortage of opportunities for bonding, female empowerment, and — most importantly — rude humor. For the most part, they appear to have been successful: led by an unforgettable performance from the cheerfully filthy Haddish, Trip&nbsp;strikes the tricky balance between building a compelling narrative with rootable characters and putting them in a series of boundary-pushing, guffaw-inducing set pieces. Whether you’re going out to the movies with your own Flossy Posse or just looking for some laughs, Girls Trip looks like it’s one of the better options to come along in quite some time.What’s New on TVOzark: Season 1 (2017)  70%Ozark&nbsp;hasn’t yet reached the same level as the classic crime dramas to which it will inevitably be compared, but its satisfyingly complex plot — and a gripping performance from Jason Bateman — suggest greater potential.Also&nbsp;Opening This Week In Limited Release The Girl Without Hands (La Jeune fille sans mains) (2017) , an animated drama about a girl whose father sells her to the Devil, is at 100 percent. The Untamed (La región salvaje) (2017) , a dark blend of sci-fi, horror, and social commentary from Mexican filmmaker&nbsp;Amat Escalante, is at 92 percent.

What&nbsp;are the critics saying?Annabelle: Creation (2017)  71%For filmgoers old enough to remember the days of regularly issued Friday the 13th and Nightmare on Elm Street sequels, the idea of a horror franchise that retains its spine-tingling effectiveness as it goes along — to say nothing of actually improving — might sound more than a little absurd. There’s an exception to every rule, however, and the spookily consistent Conjuring series seems ready to keep making bumps in the night (and at the box office) for the foreseeable future: while 2014’s Annabelle spinoff failed to resonate with critics, it scared up enough ticket receipts to warrant a sequel — and as reviews for this weekend’s Annabelle: Creation attest, this is one creepy-looking doll who’s far from finished making filmgoers scream. Critics say this prequel story doesn’t do much audiences haven’t seen before, but for once, the old genre tropes are trotted out in service of a well-told story whose effective scares are bolstered by strong atmosphere and acting. Grab a few friends and get ready for a solidly undemanding horror outing — and maybe plan on sleeping with the lights on for a few nights too.The Glass Castle (2017)  52%For those in search of a sadly more realistic brand of horror this weekend, there’s The Glass Castle, which reunites director Destin Daniel Cretton with his Short Term 12 star Brie Larson in a dramatization of author Jeannette Walls’ bestselling autobiography. Starring Larson as Walls opposite Woody Harrelson and Naomi Watts as the mother and father of the family, Castle details the peripatetic lifestyle and abject poverty in which the four Walls children grew up, as well as their painful path to adult independence from their dysfunctional parents. It’s undeniably compelling material for a memoir, let alone a screen adaptation; unfortunately, critics say The Glass Castle doesn’t quite do it justice, setting out to split the difference between harrowing and heartwarming and failing to fully hit either mark. Still, there’s a tremendous cast here, united in service of one heck of a real-life story, and Castle‘s stronger elements aren’t always overpowered by its flaws. If you’re in the mood for adult drama or in need of a good cry, this just might hit the spot.The Nut Job 2: Nutty by Nature (2017)  14%Much of the time, being a movie critic seems like a pretty sweet gig: You get to see the big films before everyone else, you’re being paid to do something most people do for fun, and if you’re lucky and/or talented enough to reach an audience, you enjoy a certain measure of cultural gatekeeper status. There’s a downside to everything, however, and for many film critics, it takes the shape of releases like The Nut Job 2: Nutty by Nature. A follow-up to the 2014 original — which amassed a grim 10 percent on the Tomatometer but raked in more than $120 million worldwide — this installment reunites members of the voice cast (including Will Arnett and Katherine Heigl) for another colorfully animated adventure about talking critters facing a crisis. Will Surly and the gang be able to foil the mayor’s plan to turn their home into an amusement park? We’re pretty sure you can guess how it’ll all turn out, just as you could have predicted critics wouldn’t exactly be enthused about having to turn out for a Nut Job sequel. Like a lot of poorly reviewed cartoons, Nutty by Nature should prove reasonably diverting for the youngest audience members, but there’s no shortage of clearly superior alternative options.What’s New on TVMr. Mercedes: Season 1 (2017)  83%Mr. Mercedes propels its tense, creepy narrative with quick-witted dialogue, strong characters, and terrifying surprises.Also&nbsp;Opening This Week In Limited Release The Farthest (2017) , a documentary about the incredible journey of the spacecraft Voyager, is at 100 percent.

What&nbsp;are the critics saying?Despicable Me 3 (2017)  58%Animation has long been widely regarded as kids’ stuff, but as the medium’s current golden age has repeatedly proven, it’s more than capable of dazzling us with brilliant visuals and&nbsp;making us feel a broad array of emotions. On the other hand, sometimes you just want a colorful cartoon to make you laugh — and that’s where movies like the Despicable Me&nbsp;franchise come in. Critics say Despicable Me 3&nbsp;fits right in with the rest of the series, offering more of the zany, rapid-fire humor and brightly hued aesthetic that’s made these movies family-friendly hits, as well as a story that gives Steve Carell an opportunity to pull double duty as main character Gru and his long-lost twin brother Dru. It won’t win any awards for depth, but it’ll make kids of all ages laugh. They’ll probably also beg for more Minions toys, but that can be dealt with after the end credits roll.Baby Driver (2017)  92%It’s hardly unusual to see a flashy action movie or two in theaters as we head into the Fourth of July weekend, but it isn’t often that they arrive with much in the way of critical acclaim. Baby Driver&nbsp;offers a happy exception to that rule: a nearly unqualified hit with the pundits, Edgar Wright’s latest effort boasts an impressive 98 percent on the Tomatometer — making it not only one of the summer’s safest critical bets, but one of the best-reviewed movies of the year thus far. Starring Ansel Elgort as the titular getaway driver and rounded out by an ace ensemble that includes Kevin Spacey, Jamie Foxx, Eiza González, and Jons Hamm and Bernthal, it’s a fast-paced, music-driven popcorn feast that balances its kinetic feats against solid storytelling; whether it’s incredible set pieces or compelling narrative you’re after, reviews say Baby Driver delivers.The House (2017)  20%Will Ferrell and Amy Poehler can both be awfully funny on their own, so putting the two of them together should double your odds for laughs. And speaking of odds, The House&nbsp;— about a pair of desperate suburbanites who start an illegal casino in their home after raiding their daughter’s college fund — would seem to have plenty of potential for hilarity. Unfortunately, we can’t tell you whether Warner Bros.’ bet will pay off with critics, because the movie wasn’t screened early; until those reviews start rolling in, we’re left to play Guess the Tomatometer. Snake eyes or jackpot? Lay your odds here.What’s New on TVPreacher: Season 2 (2017)  91%Preacher‘s sophomore season benefits from more focused storytelling without sacrificing any of its gorgeous, violent, insane fun.Also&nbsp;Opening This Week In Limited Release The B-Side: Elsa Dorfman's Portrait Photography (2017) , a documentary about the titular photographer known for her work with large-format Polaroid pictures, is at 95 percent.

What&nbsp;are the critics saying?Transformers: The Last Knight (2017)  15%The Transformers&nbsp;toy line was all about delivering fun that was “more than meets the eye,” but the live-action films it’s spawned have focused on visual thrills above all else — to their continued critical detriment and vast financial gain. It’s obviously too soon to tell what the box office holds for the fifth installment in the series, but as far as the critics are concerned, this weekend’s Transformers: The Last Knight&nbsp;offers more of the same; instead of serving up relatable characters or a compelling, sensible story, it races from one boffo, CGI-driven set piece to the next, using Anthony Hopkins and Merlin the Wizard to continue building the franchise’s vast alien robot mythology. Judging from the way the past Transformers&nbsp;features have performed, that’s just fine with audiences — and if you’ve enjoyed the Michael Bay-helmed saga thus far, there’s little reason to expect your mileage will vary much this time out. Plan accordingly, but don’t say we didn’t warn you.What’s New on TVGLOW: Season 1 (2017)  94%With spot-on 1980s period detail, knockout writing, and a killer cast, GLOW shines brightly.Also&nbsp;Opening This Week In Limited Release Inversion (Varoonegi) (2017) , a dramatic look at traditional gender roles in Iran through one woman’s battle to maintain control of her life, is at 100 percent.

What do the critics have to say?Cars 3 (2017)  69%We’ve been trained to expect a lot from Pixar over the years, and when one of their movies isn’t poignant, thought-provoking, hilarious, and&nbsp;visually dazzling, it can feel like a pretty big letdown. Enter the studio’s Cars&nbsp;franchise: while plenty of fun in the context of just about any other company’s output, it’s the black sheep of the Pixar catalog, and critical reaction for the first two films in the series (and their cousins in the Planes&nbsp;franchise) has ranged from mild disappointment to outright disdain. It’s rare for the third film in a trilogy to improve upon its predecessors, so there was little reason to expect Cars 3&nbsp;would enjoy a critical rebound, but it’s actually proving to be something of a happy surprise; although it isn’t on par with Pixar’s finest — and a notch below the original Cars&nbsp;— critics say this chapter impresses with a storyline that manages to inject some intelligence and honest emotion into the anthropomorphic automotive saga. Don’t expect Toy Story&nbsp;levels of entertainment, in other words, but your kids will probably love it, and you’ll be just fine too.Rough Night (2017)  45%Rough Night has one heck of a funny cast, and its behind-the-scenes pedigree includes veterans of the acclaimed series Broad City; by all rights, there should be no shortage of laughs in this story of a buttoned-down bride-to-be (Scarlett Johansson) who finds herself embroiled in a weekend of increasingly ill-advised shenanigans with her old college buds (Kate McKinnon, Jillian Bell, Ilana Glazer, and Zoë Kravitz). Unfortunately, reviews describe a movie that falls victim to too many of the pitfalls that have undermined a majority of the girls-night-out comedies in the post-Bridesmaids&nbsp;era: it’s neither raunchy enough to surprise nor fully fleshed-out enough to make viewers really care about the characters, and as a result, it never manages to be more than a handful of funny moments. Of course, there’s nothing wrong with a handful of funny moments — but given the assemblage of talent here, you’d have every right to expect better.All Eyez on Me (2017)  18%Tupac Shakur was a singular talent and one of the more influential recording artists of his generation — and he died far too young, slain in a drive-by shooting in 1996 at the tender age of 25. There’s loads of raw material for a compelling biopic, in other words, which makes it all the more frustrating that the first theatrical feature to dramatize Shakur’s life story, All Eyez on Me, is shaping up to be such a muddled mess. Although star Demetrius Shipp Jr. looks the part as Shakur, critics say the movie stumbles between merely uninspired and flat-out clumsy, with neither the depth nor the insight its subject deserves. There’ll doubtless be another attempt to honor his legacy on the big screen at some point; in the meantime, there’s always the music.47 Meters Down (2017)  52%There haven’t been many shark thrillers since Jaws&nbsp;that have really come close to truly frightening audiences en masse, but the darn things are so creepily lethal that filmmakers keep coming back to them anyway. This weekend’s 47 Meters Down, starring Mandy Moore and Claire Holt as sisters whose diving expedition goes terribly awry, is far from the worst entry in the much-maligned subgenre, but it ain’t exactly Jaws, either. While critics haven’t been overly impressed with its thinly sketched characters and occasionally muddled story, some have also taken pains to point out that the movie definitely has its moments — and if you can lower your expectations a little, there’s some fleeting B-movie fun to be had, silly dialogue and all.Also&nbsp;Opening This Week In Limited Release Harmonium (Fuchi ni tatsu) (2017) , a drama about a family’s reckoning from director Koji Fukada, is at 100 percent. SCORE: A Film Music Documentary (2017) , in which top film composers are seen discussing the composition of film music, is at 100 percent.

Miller&nbsp;and&nbsp;James Corden). What&nbsp;are the critics saying?Atomic Blonde (2017)  78%Charlize Theron is certainly no stranger to big-screen action, but it’s been awhile since she had the opportunity to carry an entry in the genre by herself — and her 2005 starring vehicle, Aeon Flux, didn’t exactly turn out the way it was supposed to. It seems fairly likely that a far kinder fate awaits this weekend’s Atomic Blonde, in which Theron plays a superspy tasked with taking down a Berlin espionage ring during the waning days of the Cold War. Reviews describe a sleek, set piece-stuffed experience, with director David Leitch (John Wick) adding an extrai eye-catching layer of visual style to this adaptation of Sam Hart’s 2012 graphic novel The Coldest City — and Theron remains equally compelling whether she’s wearing a glamorous evening gown, breaking a bad guy’s face, or doing both of those things at the same time. The movie’s story, alas, is more of a mixed bag, but with moves this cool, most critics say there’s little reason to quibble; if you like going to the theater to watch villains get punched, Atomic Blonde should be right up your alley.The Emoji Movie (2017)  7%As Hollywood has taught us repeatedly in recent years, just because something sounds like a crazy idea for a movie and/or a crass cash grab, that doesn’t mean the end results can’t be delightfully entertaining. (The LEGO Movie, anyone?) Still, even if it’s possible for filmmakers to spin cinematic gold out of conceptual straw, that doesn’t mean it’s likely; sometimes what sounds like a bad idea is exactly that, and The Emoji Movie offers colorful yet creatively bankrupt proof. If nothing else, this animated adventure lives up to its title — it really is a movie populated with walking, talking emojis — so it could hardly be argued that anyone who buys a ticket won’t know exactly what they’re going to get. But if you’re somehow still on the fence about heading out to see it, critics universally urge you to reconsider; words like “meh,” “idiotic,” and “regret” — along with, yes, a handful of appropriately scornful emojis — sum up scribes’ viewing experiences. Here’s hoping things turn out better for that Fruit Ninja movie in the works.What’s New on TVMidnight, Texas: Season 1 (2017)  61%Midnight, Texas&nbsp;doesn’t suck as much as it should.Also&nbsp;Opening This Week In Limited Release Women Who Kill (2017) , about podcast hosts whose professional bond is put to the test when a new relationship stirs up uncomfortable emotions, is at 100 percent.

What are the critics saying?The Great Wall (2017)  35%The idea of a movie starring Matt Damon and Willem Dafoe fighting monsters under the direction of the great Zhang Yimou sounds awfully hard to resist. It isn’t hard, in other words, to understand how The Great Wall&nbsp;got made — or envision a picture that lives up to the brilliantly wacky delights suggested by its premise. Unfortunately, critics say this is an instance in which the reality is far less interesting than the concept: Zhang’s brilliant eye and the cool special effects aren’t enough to offset a fundamentally flawed script that buries interesting ideas under clumsy clichés and a scattered narrative. Like many of you, we’d watch either of these guys in almost anything, but The Great Wall&nbsp;looks like a dismal exception to that rule.Fist Fight (2017)  25%What do Ice Cube, Charlie Day, and onscreen violence have in common? Under the right circumstances, they can all be pretty darn funny. There was good reason, in other words, to hope for the best from Fist Fight, a comedy about two teachers who end up poised for a physical altercation after looming layoffs and a manipulative principal conspire to put them at odds. Sadly, critics say those hopes have been dashed by the rather uninspired end result, which fails to make much use of its intriguingly matched leads — or any of the other funny people in the cast, including Kumail Nanjiani and Jillian Bell — beyond handing them a few decent one-liners. There’s a lot of talent assembled here, so you won’t walk away without a couple of chuckles, but filmgoers hoping for lots of laughs out of Fist Fight seem likely to be disappointed.A Cure For Wellness (2017)  42%Most people are a little paranoid about getting deathly ill, more than a few of us are at least a little creeped out by hospitals, and many filmgoers would agree that director Gore Verbinski can send an effective chill down the spine when he’s got a mind to. So A Cure for Wellness, starring Dane DeHaan in a thriller about a man sent to retrieve his CEO from a spa in the Alps where the methods of treatment may be more troubling than they seem, would appear to have all the necessary ingredients for an enjoyably unsettling night at the movies. Alas, while critics are quick to point out that Verbinski’s distinctive style remains in full effect, this is one exercise in ickiness whose sum is decidedly less than its clammy parts. Those with an extreme fondness for creepy imagery — or tolerance for horror movies clocking in at over two hours in length — may respond to this Cure; everyone else should probably think about waiting for this to reach the rental market, or simply rewatch some classic Cronenberg instead.What’s New on TVHUMANS: Season 2 (2016)  94%Humans continues to quietly distinguish itself in the sci-fi drama category — and prove better than most of its flashier AI competition.Big Little Lies: Season 1 (2017)  93%Bitingly funny and highly addictive, Big Little Lies is a twisty, thrilling, enlightening ride led by a first-rate cast.Doubt: Season 1 (2017)  53%Doubt struggles with tone in its premiere episode, but ultimately develops into a passable courtroom/workplace drama that is buoyed by a talented cast.Also&nbsp;Opening This Week In Limited Release Keep Quiet (2017) , a documentary about an outspoken latter-day Nazi’s spiritual journey after learning of his Jewish heritage, is at 100 percent.

Simmons), and a star-studded action thriller (Collide, starring Nicholas Hoult and Felicity Jones). What are the critics saying?Get Out (2017)  98%Horror movies are often judged according to how effectively they scare us, but the classics are almost always about more than visceral thrills, and with Get Out, first-time feature director Jordan Peele offers a reminder of the genre’s versatility. Inverting suburban horror tropes, the storyline finds a young black man (Daniel Kaluuya) meeting his white girlfriend’s (Allison Williams) parents for the first time — a visit that starts with all the awkward tension you’d expect before taking a progressively more sinister turn. The reviews say Peele’s pulled off an audacious debut here, blending horror and comedy in service of a storyline whose scary elements are just one layer of an intelligent, timely look at modern American race relations. If you’re up for a frightening night out that’ll also make you laugh and make you think, critics urge you to Get Out&nbsp;and see this.Rock Dog (2017)  47%Back in the bad old days, “kid-friendly entertainment” at the movies often meant “you take what you can get,” which made for years of middling-to-subpar releases that earned some decent coin at the box office despite dismissive (or downright poor) critical buzz. Our current golden age of animation has seen major studios like Disney, Pixar, and DreamWorks offering a slew of incredible choices for families, making it harder for independent releases to grab the spotlight — but as far as this weekend’s Rock Dog&nbsp;is concerned, it seems like that might not be such a bad thing. Critics say this CG tale of a dog (Luke Wilson) who abandons his traditionally mandated sheepherding duty to pursue his rock ‘n’ roll dreams isn’t bad, necessarily, but it might not be worth rushing out to the theater. In spite of a talented voice cast and some decent musical numbers, Rock Dog too rarely rises above the middle-of-the-road storytelling suggested by character names like Fleetwood Yak (Sam Elliott). Save this one for a rainy day or a long car ride after the kids have burned through the top-shelf queue.Collide (2017)  24%“How far would you go for the one you love?” asks Collide‘s poster, and it’s an interesting enough question — especially given that it’s surrounded by an impressive list of stars that includes Anthony Hopkins, Ben Kingsley, Felicity Jones, and Nicholas Hoult. Unfortunately, we can’t tell you much about how this long-delayed action thriller goes about answering that question, because it wasn’t screened for critics.

What are the critics saying?The Fate of the Furious (2017)  67%With fast cars, a charismatic cast, enjoyably absurd action sequences, and enough ever-expanding mythology to rival a soap opera, the Fast &amp; Furious&nbsp;franchise includes some of the most critic-proof movies in modern Hollywood — which makes the enthusiastic reviews that have greeted recent installments arguably even more impressive. The Fate of the Furious adds an eighth chapter to the saga, and looks likely to extend the series’ Fresh streak; while some critics have turned up their noses at this chapter’s story, which finds fans’ beloved Dom (Vin Diesel) inexplicably in the clutches of a villainess (Charlize Theron) hatching an evil plan with potentially global consequences, it’s the pedal-to-the-metal set pieces that are this franchise’s bread and butter — and on that front Fate&nbsp;delivers, adding just enough bro-tastic repartee between the stars to make this one of the better-reviewed Furious&nbsp;films. None of which is probably likely to sway your moviegoing decision either way, but if you’re in the audience this weekend, at least you know the critics had a good time too.What’s New on TVBetter Call Saul: Season 3 (2017)  97%Better Call Saul shows no signs of slipping in season 3, as the introduction of more familiar faces causes the inevitable transformation of its lead to pick up exciting speed.Also&nbsp;Opening This Week In Limited Release Glory (2017) , about the bureaucracy-fraught aftermath of one man’s decision to do the right thing, is at 100 percent.

What are the critics saying?Ghost in the Shell (2017)  43%Scarlett Johansson has convincingly kicked butt in more than one action movie, and the enduring popularity of the Ghost in the Shell&nbsp;media franchise has long since ably demonstrated its story’s appeal. Put the two together, and what do you have? A gorgeous techno-thriller with committed work from its leading lady — but one that, like its protagonist, isn’t quite what it was in its original incarnation. As the Major, a machine-enhanced law enforcement officer whose mind has been transplanted from a ruined flesh-and-blood body, Johansson acquits herself admirably enough that many critics are willing to look past the accusations of whitewashing that dogged the production; more troublesome, however, is the live-action Ghost‘s inability or unwillingness to satisfyingly deal with the story’s many intriguing philosophical questions. Instead, viewers are left with some solid acting and loads of cool special effects — fine for a fun night out, but still something of a disappointment in the context of the source material.The Boss Baby (2017)  53%America loves to laugh at talking toddlers, and — as millions of 30 Rock&nbsp;fans are still happy to attest — Alec Baldwin can be a pretty funny guy. So The Boss Baby, which puts Baldwin’s voice inside its pint-sized protagonist, should be a safe bet, right? Unfortunately, as we’ve seen all too often in this space, what looks great on paper can be a painful ordeal on the screen, and critics say this movie — inspired by Marla Frazee’s board book of the same name — offers yet another example. The premise, just fine for a short story, suffers from being stretched to feature length, and screenwriter Michael McCullers fills the gap with all the scatological humor one might fear from a 3D animated movie about a baby with a briefcase. The youngsters in your life will probably want to see it — and they might very well laugh themselves silly — but the reviews point to a nominally kid-friendly film with little to offer older chaperones.What’s New on TVHarlots: Season 1 (2017)  92%Harlots uses its titillating subject matter to draw the viewer into a deeper drama about the intersection of survival, business, and family.Imaginary Mary: Season 1 (2017)  27%Imaginary Mary‘s appealing cast is canceled out by uninspired material and a ridiculous premise whose deficiencies are compounded by an unfunny, ill-advised CGI creature.Also&nbsp;Opening This Week In Limited Release David Lynch: The Art Life (2017) , a documentary profile of the director and his art, is at 100 percent.

What are the critics saying?The Lost City of Z (2017)  86%Exotic danger, a forgotten people, one man determined to press on against seemingly insurmountable odds — The Lost City of Z&nbsp;offers a variation on the classic noble explorer’s story, with one crucial twist: it’s all based on reality. Inspired by David Grann’s hit nonfiction book of the same name, Lost City dramatizes the incredible exploits of&nbsp;British explorer Percy Fawcett (Charlie Hunnam), whose adventures in the Amazon turned up evidence suggesting the region was once home to a hitherto unknown great lost civilization. A stately drift downriver from the whip-cracking Indiana Jones-style adventure that thrill-seeking film fans might expect, this sweeping historical epic takes a thoughtfully old-fashioned approach to a genre all too often exploited for cheap thrills — and most critics agree it pays handsome dividends. Whether you’re in the mood for gorgeous cinematography, fact-based drama, or simply a movie that reminds us of the incredible things we can achieve when we refuse to give up on a dream, The Lost City of Z is worth seeking out this weekend.Free Fire (2017)  69%Cinema can be uniquely thought-provoking, but sometimes, you just want to watch a movie that puts a bunch of gun-toting maniacs in a building and lets the bullets fly. Filmgoers with just such a hankering can now head out to Free Fire, the latest from Kill List&nbsp;director Ben Wheatley — and as you’d expect given its pedigree, this is an action thriller that offers ample bang for one’s buck. Wheatley’s rounded up a talented ensemble cast (including Brie Larson and Armie Hammer) to imagine the bullet-riddled shenanigans that might erupt if an arms deal went awry between a homicidally volatile group of people, and while a number of critics have pointed out that the end results might not be completely original, most agree that the experience is still plenty of fun. If you’re looking for a shoot-’em-up this weekend, Free Fire should satisfy.The Promise (2017)  51%Director Terry George proved his knack for fact-based historical drama with In the Name of the Father and Hotel Rwanda, which probably has at least a little to do with why he was able to round up Oscar Isaac and Christian Bale for The Promise — and why this look back at the last days of the Ottoman Empire seemed like a sure bet for one of the year’s first prestige-picture hits. Alas, critics say George has fallen short of the mark this time around; while the cast is great and the real-life story is powerful, The Promise&nbsp;neglects to use it as much more than the backdrop for a fairly uninspired love triangle. If it teaches a few people about the horrors of genocide, it’ll still be a worthy entry in the actors’ filmographies, but the chances we’ll be talking about this movie come awards season seem very low.Disneynature: Born In China (2017)  85%Disneynature and Earth Day have become an annual tradition, and this weekend, Born in China&nbsp;continues it with a colorful introduction to the flora and fauna native to the titular nation. If you’ve watched previous Disneynature releases like African Cats or Chimpanzee, you know what to expect here: beautifully filmed up-close looks at wildlife, usually accompanied by voiceover narration (provided here by The Office&nbsp;vet John Krasinski), all in service of a nonfiction narrative balancing the dangers facing our natural world against our reasons to hope for the future. Critics say Born in China&nbsp;accomplishes those goals reasonably well, and although it works better as a series of stunning images than a narrative — and your tolerance for anthropomorphism had better be high — it all adds up to another of the studio’s heartwarming animal adventures.Unforgettable (2017)  28%Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned, or so the saying goes, although there’s also something to be said for the fury of a film critic forced to watch another jealousy-fueled thriller pitting woman against woman in a catfight to the finish. Unforgettable, starring Katherine Heigl as a bitter ex-wife conniving to make life miserable for her ex-husband’s new bride (Rosario Dawson), has all the Lifetime-ready ingredients that would seem to make it ripe for a critical bashing — yet in the context of the genre and general expectations, the reviews have actually been surprisingly kind. Admittedly, the pundits haven’t exactly been effusive in their praise, and more than a few have pointed out that plenty of other movies have done this sort of thing far more effectively, but Heigl and Dawson breathe enough life into their roles to make Unforgettable&nbsp;marginally better than expected. On balance, it’s still more “bad” than “so bad it’s good,” but it’s been awhile since a major movie indulged in this level of glossy camp; if that’s your thing, feel free to seek out a screening — the closer to midnight, the better.Phoenix Forgotten (2017)  45%It’s been far too long since Hollywood brought us a classic alien abduction movie, but there’s reason to hope that Phoenix Forgotten&nbsp;might be the UFO thriller to end the drought. Inspired by an incident that made real-life headlines 20 years ago, it comes shrouded in decades of allegedly factual mystery — just the sort of thing that sends tingles down the spines of genre aficionados jonesing for a close encounter of the big-screen kind. Unfortunately, it wasn’t screened for critics, so we can’t tell you whether Phoenix Forgotten&nbsp;is worth checking out; in the meantime, we’ll just have to make do with another round of Guess the Tomatometer.What’s New on TVFargo: Season 3 (2017)  93%Thanks in part to a memorable dual performance from Ewan McGregor, Fargo mostly maintains the sly wit and off-kilter sensibility it displayed in its first two seasons.Also&nbsp;Opening This Week In Limited Release The Happiest Day in the Life of Olli Mäki (Hymyilevä mies) (2017) , inspired by a crucial period in the life and career of the titular Finnish boxer, is at 100 percent.

What are the critics saying?Kong: Skull Island (2017)  75%A man, a plan, a giant ape: these ingredients have come together to create creature-feature magic on more than one occasion since King Kong&nbsp;debuted in 1933, and they’re back together again for this weekend’s Kong: Skull Island. Starring Brie Larson, John Goodman, Tom Hiddleston, and Samuel L. Jackson, the big furry guy’s latest onscreen adventure basically hits the reboot button on the Kong&nbsp;saga, sending a group of intrepid adventurers out to an uncharted island where giant creatures fight for dominance — including the nasty “skull crawlers” that have pushed Kong’s kind to the verge of extinction. Director&nbsp;Jordan Vogt-Roberts lays some heavy Apocalypse Now vibes over the ’70s-set action, but there are some progressive narrative elements in the mix too — none of which are as important as the all-out giant monster action, which critics say is pretty cool even if we’ve seen more or less all of this before. The fate of Legendary’s emerging “MonsterVerse” hinges on how well Kong: Skull Island fills its chest-thumping brief; fortunately, reviews describe a movie that manages to deliver all the effects-driven excitement audiences are looking for. If it sometimes skimps on the human drama underneath it all, well, that’s par for the course — and hey, maybe 2019’s Godzilla: King of the Monsters&nbsp;will make room for a few more character-driven moments. (Just kidding!)Also&nbsp;Opening This Week In Limited Release Uncertain (2017) , a documentary look at the residents of a small Texas town, is at 100 percent.

What are the critics saying?Smurfs: The Lost Village (2017)  40%At this point, there are no surprises with the Smurfs — you’re either on board with the little blue creatures debuted by Belgian artist Peyo in 1958 or you find their antics insufferable, and never the twain shall meet. With that in mind, it’s worth noting that this weekend’s Smurfs: The Lost Village&nbsp;represents something of a departure from recent installments in the franchise, given that it’s an all-animation outing instead of the live-action/CGI hybrids of the previous trilogy, but the story remains substantially the same. On one side of the story, you’ve got the Smurfs happily smurfing along; on the other, you have their eternal nemesis, the wicked wizard Gargamel (voiced by Rainn Wilson). This adventure adds a few new narrative wrinkles, but as has been the case with recent Smurfs&nbsp;outings, critics aren’t impressed — whether it’s the rather mundane story or the middle-of-the-road animation, reviews identify no shortage of deficiencies for discerning family audiences. The next time you’re in urgent need of a cinematic babysitter, it might do in a pinch, but this Lost Village&nbsp;probably isn’t worth finding at a theater near you.Going in Style (2017)  47%If a movie offers a brilliant cast a too-rare opportunity to shine — but still ends up being somewhat less than compelling — should it still be celebrated on some level? That’s the question facing critics this weekend with Going in Style, which puts veteran talents Alan Arkin, Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman, and Ann-Margaret back in the spotlight for a loose remake of the somewhat forgotten 1979 dramedy of the same name. Like the original, which starred George Burns, Art Carney, and Lee Strasberg, the plot finds a trio of retirees plotting a robbery — but this time around, instead of just looking for one last adventure, our protagonists are righteously ticked off after being cheated out of their pensions by unscrupulous bankers. There’s an opportunity to justify this remake with a fresh timely perspective, in other words; alas, critics say director Zach Braff leaves it on the table — along with just about everything else that might have made the movie more than a painless passing diversion. That being said, the opportunity to watch these old pros work together might make Going in Style&nbsp;worth a watch… if only to let Hollywood know there’s still a demand for its stars’ services.The Case for Christ (2017)  59%An Easter-season dramatization of the real-life marital/spiritual crisis that engulfed journalist Lee Strobel after his wife experienced a religious awakening, The Case for Christ&nbsp;(starring Mike Vogel and Erika Christensen as the Strobels) purports to tell the tale of his unexpected journey upon setting out to debunk Christianity once and for all. We’d love to tell you what the critics have to say about all this, but unfortunately, the movie didn’t screen for them ahead of time — and you know what that means.

What do the critics have to say?Incarnate (2016)  17%The cineplex giveth, and the cineplex taketh away. Over the Thanksgiving holiday, we had no fewer than four wide releases vying for your movie dollar; this weekend, our studio overlords have seen fit to bring us merely one. Incarnate&nbsp;tells the story of a young boy (David Mazouz) who shows signs of demonic possession, leading his understandably concerned mom (Carice van Houten) to reach out to the Vatican — who, in turn, enlists the aid of an exorcist (Aaron Eckhart) whose methods involve probing into the possessed’s subconscious. It has a fairly intriguing cast, and a cinematic battle with the devil sounds like it might be an entertaining break from holiday shopping, but unfortunately, we can’t tell you whether Incarnate&nbsp;is worth a trip to the theater, because it wasn’t screened for critics. Guess that Tomatometer!Believe (2016)  33%At the opposite end of the good-and-evil spectrum, we have Believe&nbsp;— the story of an auto plant owner (Ryan O’Quinn) whose business woes seem likely to end his tradition of bankrolling his small, depressed Virginia town’s annual Christmas pageant. After some ruffians work him over, he ends up on the doorstep of a single mom (Danielle Nicolet) who might just have the bookkeeping acumen he needs to save his company — and whose son (Isaac Ryan Brown) has his heart set on playing the Archangel Gabriel in the aforementioned pageant. You can pretty much bank on a heartwarming final act in which everyone’s dreams come true, but as of this writing, Believe&nbsp;only has a couple of reviews to its name, so we’ll have to wait for the last critical word.

What do the critics have to say?Moana (2016)  95%For families heading to the cineplex with young ones in tow this weekend, the choice is simple: Disney’s Moana, starring&nbsp;Auli’i Cravalho as a Polynesian chieftain’s daughter tasked with &nbsp;a quest that sends her in search of the demigod Maui (Dwayne Johnson) in an effort to save her tribe. Just about any old family-friendly release has good odds of making money this time of year, but happily, critics say Moana&nbsp;is really something special — a release that not only boasts the visual splendor Disney audiences expect, but subverts the studio’s standard princess-in-peril storyline in some genuinely refreshing ways. Reviews point to an animated adventure you can feel good about taking the kids to see — and one you might want to take in even if you’re child-free.Allied (2016)  60%A sweeping World War II spy epic starring Brad Pitt and Marion Cotillard, and directed by Robert Zemeckis? On paper, Allied&nbsp;looks like exactly the kind of lavishly assembled absorbing drama starring beautiful people that critics and audiences swoon for during awards season — yet as we all know far too well by now, a movie that looks great in theory doesn’t always add up on the screen. There’s certainly no arguing its pedigree, or the fact that the sheer talent assembled can’t help but add up to a certain amount of entertainment value, and ultimately, Allied‘s old-fashioned Hollywood grandeur helps compensate for its inability to recreate the level of epic wartime drama achieved by the classic films it affectionately emulates.Bad Santa 2 (2016)  24%Almost exactly 13 years to the day after Bad Santa&nbsp;gave fans of yuletide-themed black comedy something to ho-ho-ho about, Billy Bob Thornton is back with the sequel. This weekend’s appropriately titled Bad Santa 2 reunites Thornton with original cast members Tony Cox and Brett Kelly, and boasts direction from Mean Girls&nbsp;vet Mark Waters; unfortunately, none of the above is enough to keep critics from lumping coal all over the end result. Reviews describe a second installment with little of the charm of the first — and a comedy that tries too hard to shock while neglecting to tell an involving story. Plenty of people loved the first one, and holiday movies that avoid going overboard with sentimentality are hard to come by, so you might be tempted to see Bad Santa 2, but it sounds like you’ll be better off just watching the original again.Rules Don't Apply (2016)  55%It’s been a long time since we had a new Warren Beatty movie — and even longer since we had one he directed. Rules Don’t Apply&nbsp;ends that long drought by fulfilling his decades-long ambition to make a Howard Hughes biopic of sorts that zeroes in on a story in which the reclusive billionaire (Beatty, who also wrote the screenplay in addition to directing) looms over the would-be relationship between one of the actresses in his stable (Lily Collins) and her driver (Alden Ehrenreich). This is obviously a movie with a fairly stellar pedigree, and it would be wonderful if we could say Beatty’s passion project is being greeted with critical adulation; alas, reviews describe a romantic dramedy that, while definitely not without its moments, is ultimately more of a pleasant curiosity than a must-see release. See it because it’s a Beatty production (and to get a look at Ehrenreich in action before he goes supernova in the “young Han Solo” movie), but it might be a good idea to adjust your expectations.What’s New on TVSearch Party: Season 1 (2016)  100%Search Party is an engaging, weird, dark, funny mystery elevated by exceptional performances throughout.Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life (2016)  87%Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life provides a faithful and successful revival of the quirky, sweet, and beloved series fans fell in love with over a decade ago.Also&nbsp;Opening This Week In Limited Release Baden Baden (2016) , about a young woman’s summer spent taking stock of her life, is at 94 percent.

Henson and Octavia Spencer), a monster calling (A Monster Calls, starring Lewis MacDougall and Felicity Jones), and supernatural warfare (Underworld: Blood Wars, starring Kate Beckinsale and Theo James). What are the critics saying?Hidden Figures (2017)  93%Certain periods tend to get the historical drama treatment more than others, and the civil rights struggle of the 1950s and 1960s has seen more than most. Yet as this weekend’s Hidden Figures&nbsp;capably proves, there are still compelling stories left to tell. Helmed by St. Vincent&nbsp;director Ted Melfi and featuring a stellar cast led by Taraji P. Henson, Octavia Spencer, and&nbsp;Janelle Monáe, Figures&nbsp;shines a spotlight on the efforts of some brilliant NASA employees working in the space program leading up to John Glenn’s historic launch — employees who just happened to be African-American women during a heavily segregated era, and whose contributions helped alter national paradigms in any number of far-reaching ways. It’s inspirational stuff, and critics say Melfi and his cast do right by it; if you’re in the mood for a little fact-based uplift at the movies this weekend, you know just where to look.A Monster Calls (2017)  86%The phrase “YA adaptation” tends to bring a certain type of movie to mind, but this weekend’s A Monster Calls&nbsp;proves the genre is roomy enough to tell all sorts of stories. Starring&nbsp;Lewis MacDougall as a boy struggling to come to terms with his mother’s (Felicity Jones) terminal illness, Monster&nbsp;blends harsh reality with grim fantasy, imagining a world in which a hulking tree (voiced by Liam Neeson) comes to him with a series of stories — and a life-or-death challenge. Directed by J.A. Bayona from a script written by Patrick Ness (adapting his own bestselling novel), A Monster Calls occupies a dark spot that may be too challenging for younger viewers, but critics say it’s dazzling and emotionally affecting viewing, with a depth and resonance that makes it worth absorbing the sadness of the story.Underworld: Blood Wars (2017)  21%If you’re the sort of filmgoer who has a hankering for multiple movies about the eons-long war between vampires and werewolves, odds are you may not be inclined to put much stock in what critics think — and this weekend’s Underworld: Blood Wars, the fifth entry in the Underworld&nbsp;series, proves there’s a substantial number of people who have just such a hankering. Once again, franchise star Kate Beckinsale dons her character’s trademark skintight black leather getup for battle; once again, critics say the results are as narratively drab as the monochromatic color schemes these movies are known for. But if you’ve watched along this far, that probably isn’t much of a deterrent — and if you just want to see vampires and werewolves duke it out, all that other stuff may not matter much anyway.What’s New on TVSherlock: Season 4 (2017)  54%Sherlock makes a welcome and shocking return, and Cumberbatch and Freeman are game, but it may prove difficult to live up to the lofty expectations created by the series’ lengthy hiatus.The Mick: Season 1 (2016)  58%Kaitlin Olson‘s considerable charm isn’t enough to keep the intermittently funny The Mick from falling prey to conventional storylines and hard-to-root-for characters.Also&nbsp;Opening This Week In Limited Release The Ardennes (D'Ardennen) (2017) , about the relationship between two brothers in the grim fallout from their botched attempt to get away with a crime, is at 50 percent.

What are the critics saying?Doctor Strange (2016)  89%At some point, Marvel is bound to take this whole thing one sequel too far, or try and adapt a property that simply won’t work on the big screen. It won’t happen this weekend, however: critics say Doctor Strange&nbsp;is yet another in an impressively long streak of crowd-pleasing comics adaptations out of the MCU, with inventive CGI effects and a terrific cast (led by Benedict Cumberbatch, Tilda Swinton,&nbsp;Chiwetel Ejiofor, Mads Mikkelsen, and Rachel McAdams) enlivening what is, at bottom, yet another origin story in a genre that already has more than its share. If you’re steadfastly opposed to movies about sorcerers, you may want to sit this one out, but otherwise, Doctor Strange&nbsp;delivers a finely calibrated, solidly crafted variation on the studio’s incredibly successful formula, and this weekend, the box office looks likely to be saying “make mine Marvel.”Trolls (2016)  75%Troll dolls have been around for decades, but aside from a few cameo appearances in the Toy Story&nbsp;series, they’ve never really gotten their big-screen due. That all changes this weekend with the descriptively titled Trolls, which repurposes the fuzzy-haired little goobers as the stars of a rainbow-hued DreamWorks Animation adventure with an impressive celebrity voice cast that includes&nbsp;Anna Kendrick, Justin Timberlake, Zooey Deschanel, and Russell Brand. Given that it’s a toy tie-in aimed at little ones, critics say the end result punches above its weight class: although this certainly isn’t the most inventive or subversive family-friendly film, its message is delivered agreeably enough, and the soundtrack may finally bump that Frozen CD from the top spot in your kids’ heavy rotation. For the younger set, Trolls&nbsp;looks like this weekend’s safe bet — and better than it needed to be.Hacksaw Ridge (2016)  84%Mel Gibson‘s filmography on either side of the camera has ably demonstrated he’s a solid hand with tormented protagonists and visceral violence, and his latest directorial effort, Hacksaw Ridge, delivers in spades on both counts. Inspired by the real-life tale of conscientious objector and World War II veteran Desmond Doss (Andrew Garfield), Ridge recounts his principled stand off the battlefield as well as his incredible heroism on it — all leading up to the bloody skirmish that saw him save the lives of 75 men without firing a single shot. It’s a project right in Gibson’s wheelhouse, and critics say he’s responded with a thought-provoking gut punch of a war drama that stands shoulder to shoulder with his best efforts behind the lens. Although it’s far from his most subtle work, and not designed to be an easy watch, Hacksaw&nbsp;offers hard-hitting entertainment for action aficionados in the mood for something with a little extra heft.What’s Hot on TV&nbsp;The Crown: Season 1 (2016)  88%Powerful performances and lavish cinematography make The Crown&nbsp;a top-notch production worthy of its grand subject.People of Earth: Season 1 (2016)  89%People of Earth skillfully grounds its high-concept premise with a strong story, quirky humor, and sweetly relatable humanity.Stan Against Evil: Season 1 (2016)  67%Stan Against Evil&nbsp;is a light, gruesome horror-comedy whose premise is fun but has yet to solidify its tone and characters.Also&nbsp;Opening This Week In Limited Release Peter and the Farm (2016) , a documentary look at one man’s troubled personal and agricultural legacy, is at 100 percent.

What do the critics have to say?Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children (2016)  64%Tim Burton‘s love of ornate visuals and dark whimsy hasn’t always jibed with the mainstream, but with his adaptation of Miss Peregrine’s Home for Peculiar Children, he’s tackling a property that’s not only squarely in his wheelhouse, but has enough of an audience to encourage hopes for a blockbuster. Inspired by Ransom Riggs’ YA bestseller, Peculiar follows the adventures of Jake (Asa Butterfield), a grieving boy who stumbles into a time loop populated by strange and wonderful people — just in time to be drawn into their life-or-death battle against a terrifying foe (Samuel L. Jackson). Packed with quirk (and franchise potential), the story sets the table for a cinematic feast of truly Burtonian proportions; unfortunately, reviews describe an end product that’s something less than the sum of its parts. Perhaps too frightening for younger viewers and too loose with the source material for hardcore fans of the books, Burton’s Peculiar Children may prove a hard sell — but one not without its charms for the director’s fans and those seeking something strange and a little dark at the cineplex this weekend.Deepwater Horizon (2016)  83%How do you turn a catastrophic real-life disaster into entertainment? It’s tricky, obviously, but with Deepwater Horizon, director Peter Berg proves it can be done. Inspired by the events leading up to the 2010 oil spill that killed 11 crewmen and left a devastating environmental imprint in the Gulf of Mexico, this ensemble thriller stars Mark Wahlberg as a rig worker who leaps into the fray after the explosion that threatens the lives of his crew — and critics say he does a fine job, along with a list of co-stars that includes Kurt Russell, John Malkovich, and Kate Hudson, while Berg remains a dependably deft hand with a senses-rattling set piece. While many critics have hastened to add that Deepwater might have been more satisfying if it took the time to consider the regional aftermath of the events it dramatizes, reviews still point to an absorbing, well-acted action drama with some extra poignant nonfictional heft.Masterminds (2016)  34%Comedy is subjective, but even taking individual tastes into account, this weekend’s Masterminds boasts a pretty impressive pedigree: Owen Wilson, Zach Galifianakis, Kristen Wiig, Jason Sudeikis, Leslie Jones, and Kate McKinnon are just a few of the funny people in its ensemble cast, and if that isn’t enough, it also has Napoleon Dynamite director Jared Hess at the helm — as well as a script inspired by the true story of an absurd bank heist sparked by a toxic blend of greed and unrequited love. Alas, critics say most of that potential is squandered here; although the movie almost can’t help but manage a handful of funny moments, they’re smothered in an aggressively wacky caper that mistakes questionable hairstyles for genuine laughs.Queen of Katwe (2016)  94%For a cerebral game that may not seem inherently cinematic, chess has served as the backdrop for some pretty entertaining films over the years — a list upon which Disney’s Queen of Katwe&nbsp;can now claim a spot of honor. This inspirational drama finds director Mira Nair commanding a stellar cast led by&nbsp;Lupita Nyong’o and David Oyelowo,&nbsp;and starring newcomer&nbsp;Madina Nalwanga&nbsp;as real-life Ugandan chess champion Phiona Mutesi, and although its portrayal of Mutesi’s life might be guilty of indulging in a few stereotypical Hollywood shenanigans, the story of this unlikely prodigy is undeniably compelling. Critics say Nyong’o and Oyelowo deliver outstanding performances, while Nair has earned some of her best reviews since 2002’s Monsoon Wedding. If it’s feelgood fare you seek this weekend, check your local listings for Queen of Katwe.&nbsp;What’s Hot&nbsp;on TVTransparent: Season 3 (2016)  100%Uniquely its own, and compelling and poignant as ever, Transparent continues to transcend the parameters of comedic and dramatic television with sustained excellence in its empathetic portrayal of the Pfefferman family.Marvel's Luke Cage: Season 1 (2016)  90%An immersive, socially conscious narrative and a confident, charismatic lead performance make Marvel’s Luke Cage a stellar sampling of the new Marvel/Netflix universe.Pitch: Season 1 (2016)  93%A terrific lead performance and well-constructed setup and timely themes make Pitch a home run.Westworld: Season 1 (2016)  87%With an impressive level of quality that honors its source material, the brilliantly addictive Westworld balances intelligent, enthralling drama against outright insanity.Also&nbsp;Opening This Week In Limited Release Long Way North (Tout en haut du monde) (2016) , a period adventure following a 19th-century teenaged Russian aristocrat on a beautifully animated Arctic quest, is at 100 percent.

What are the critics saying?Rogue One: A Star Wars Story (2016)  84%Not content to rule this year’s box office with a string of hits that already includes Finding Dory, The Jungle Book, Zootopia, Moana, and — oh yeah — a pair of Marvel blockbusters, Disney tops it all off this weekend with Rogue One: A Star Wars Story, which officially marks the spot where the company’s stewardship of the storied franchise shifts from saga revival to annual event. This standalone feature takes a look at the fledgling Rebellion’s life-or-death quest to steal the Empire’s plans for the first Death Star, and introduces viewers to a (mostly) new cast of characters while making room for a few major cameos from the original trilogy. It’s pretty much a guaranteed smash, in other words — and fortunately for those of us who won’t be able to resist seeing it, critics say it’s also a pretty great time at the movies. While Rogue One&nbsp;may not quite stand shoulder-to-shoulder with the best entries in the Star Wars&nbsp;series, reviews describe a thrilling, poignant, and surprisingly dark chapter that honors its predecessors while suggesting intriguing new avenues for its inevitable follow-ups.Collateral Beauty (2016)  14%For those in search of a more earthbound time at the movies, there’s Collateral Beauty, starring Will Smith as a high-powered executive whose friends hatch a scheme to draw him back from the emotional abyss after he’s crippled by grief. With that heartstring-tugging premise and a cast rounded out by an ace ensemble that also includes Helen Mirren, Kate Winslet, Keira Knightley, and Edward Norton, this looks like a holiday season winner; unfortunately, looks can often be deceiving, and critics say this is definitely an example. While even its harshest detractors admit the movie’s affecting in spots, it’s fatally undermined by thinly sketched characters and a plot that’s far too obvious with its emotional manipulations. There are far better options if you’re in the mood for a really good cry this weekend — including pretending you’re Smith while reading Collateral Beauty‘s reviews.Manchester by the Sea (2016)  96%Speaking of sob-worthy cinema, here’s Manchester by the Sea, starring Casey Affleck and Michelle Williams in the tale of a guy whose seemingly aimless drift hits a rocky patch when his older brother (Kyle Chandler) passes away, leaving him custody of his nephew (Lucas Hedges) — and sending him back to the hometown where a painful past still haunts him. In a lot of ways, it’s decidedly a downbeat story, but critics say writer-director Kenneth Lonergan does a brilliant job of walking the line between sobering drama and dismal wallow, aided and abetted by a cast that brings his characters vividly to life. One of the year’s more passionately acclaimed films, it’s already gathering awards buzz — and while it lacks the laser dogfights of its marquee competition this weekend, Manchester by the Sea exerts its own unique, lingering impact.What’s New on TVStar: Season 1 (2016)  35%Despite Queen Latifah‘s strong performance, Lee Daniels’ Star&nbsp;is weighed down by sloppy melodrama and overly cartoonish stereotypes.Also&nbsp;Opening This Week In Limited Release Neruda (2016) , an homage to the Nobel-winning poet from director Pablo Larraín, is Certified Fresh at 100 percent.

What do the critics have to say?Arrival (2016)  94%Hollywood has imagined mankind meeting alien life countless times, making it fairly difficult to grab a film fan’s attention with yet another entry in the genre. Difficult, but not impossible: with this weekend’s Arrival, director&nbsp;Denis Villeneuve delivers a refreshingly thoughtful take on first contact that’s also already one of the year’s most widely acclaimed releases. Starring Amy Adams as a linguist called upon to decipher our visitors’ communication before the planet tilts into war, this Venice Film Festival favorite has critics spewing the kinds of superlatives that don’t ordinarily come attached to movies featuring aliens and spaceships. As we settle into prestige season at the cineplex, this looks like one release capable of bridging the gap between popcorn entertainment and pundits’ praise.Almost Christmas (2016)  49%It wouldn’t be the holidays at the movies without at least one warmhearted ensemble dramedy about a squabbling family solving its differences in time to bond over carols under the tree. It isn’t even Thanksgiving yet, but at the theaters this weekend, it’s Almost Christmas, the latest from writer-director David E. Talbert (Baggage Claim, First Sunday). Starring a crowded cast that includes Danny Glover, Kimberly Elise, Omar Epps, Mo’Nique, and J.B. Smoove, Christmas&nbsp;brings several generations together under one roof for the holidays, and if you’ve gotten this far, you pretty much know the drill — just as it most likely won’t surprise you that critics aren’t overly impressed with the end result, which has been accused of stuffing an overload of clichés into an already unnecessarily crowded plot. Unless you’re in a rush to watch a holiday movie in theaters this weekend, it looks like you can safely skip Almost Christmas.Shut In (2016)  7%The old trapped-in-a-house gambit is a pretty dependable horror setup, and we know Naomi Watts is pretty darn talented. Unfortunately, we can’t tell you much more about Shut In, in which Watts stars as a grieving mom caring for her paralyzed son during a major storm while growing increasingly convinced there’s an intruder in her home, because it wasn’t screened in advance for critics.

A Madea Halloween, starring Perry and Cassi Davis). What are the critics saying?Jack Reacher: Never Go Back (2016)  38%The first Jack Reacher&nbsp;wasn’t exactly a critical darling in 2012, but it had a slew of bestselling books just waiting to inspire sequels — and more importantly, a hefty enough worldwide gross to justify the expenditure — so Tom Cruise comes sprinting back into action this weekend with Jack Reacher: Never Go Back. Unsurprisingly, critics are even less enthused this time around, and reviews describe Reacher’s second big-screen outing about the way you’d expect; although Cruise remains an aggressively watchable presence and Cobie Smulders makes for a fine co-star, the boilerplate plot (and the absence of Werner Herzog, who played the first film’s villain) adds up to a sequel that struggles to (ahem) reach its predecessor’s rather low bar. See it if you’re itching for action this weekend, but temper your expectations accordingly.Ouija: Origin of Evil (2016)  82%Speaking of sequels to movies that didn’t inspire much in the way of critical applause, here’s Ouija: Origin of Evil. The 2014 original racked up a pitiful 7 percent on the Tomatometer — but it also made more than $100 million against a budget of $5 million, so a follow-up was a foregone conclusion. Few might have guessed, however, the critical reversal of fortune enjoyed by this new installment, which is garnering some of the best reviews earned by any horror movie this year. Although a number of writers have pointed out that Origin of Evil&nbsp;isn’t anywhere near the scariest or most original movie in its genre, they’re just as quick to praise director Mike Flanagan (Oculus, Hush), whose skill helps make this not only better than its predecessor, but solidly entertaining in its own right.Keeping Up With The Joneses (2016)  19%Are you an impassioned fan of Jon Hamm, Gal Gadot, Isla Fisher, or Zach Galifianakis? Have you ever stopped to consider the hilarity that might ensue if a couple of secret agents moved in next door to a pair of bored suburbanites? If you answered “yes” to either of those questions, then Keeping Up with the Joneses&nbsp;might be just the movie for you — but otherwise, the vast majority of critics are urging you to give this putative comedy a wide berth. Reviews say the cast gives it their all, but they’re consistently let down by Greg Mottola‘s listless direction and an uninspired script. If you’re in the mood to watch any or all of these stars, you’ll probably be far better served by queuing up one of their many superior efforts.Tyler Perry's Boo! A Madea Halloween (2016)  19%Last but not least, we have Boo! A Madea Halloween, writer-director Tyler Perry’s ninth outing as the titular tough matriarch. This time around, she’s apparently facing off against an array of paranormal entities — all while dealing with some juvenile delinquents. Unfortunately, because it wasn’t screened in advance, that’s all we can tell you… and you know what that means: it’s time to Guess the Tomatometer!What’s New&nbsp;on TV&nbsp;Black Mirror: Season 3 (2014)  86%Black Mirror answers the call for a larger season with half a dozen solid episodes that prove Charlie Brooker remains a masterful dystopian storyteller.The Rocky Horror Picture Show: Let's Do the Time Warp Again (2016)  27%Laverne Cox‘s fabulous portrayal of Frank N.

What do the critics have to say?Ghostbusters (2016)  74%The 1984 Ghostbusters was such a massive hit that not even the original cast and creative team could put together a completely satisfying follow-up. But much like the undead who plagued New York in the original, no intellectual property is allowed to lie fallow for too long in modern Hollywood — and our latest proof is the 2016 Ghostbusters. Directed by Paul Feig from a script he co-wrote with Katie Dippold, this franchise reboot assembles a new squad of comedy stars, led by Melissa McCarthy and SNL&nbsp;vets Leslie Jones, Kate McKinnon, and Kristen Wiig, to battle a fresh round of paranormal threats. It’s a familiar premise, obviously, but one that critics say still packs plenty of laughs — largely thanks to the game efforts of the new ghostbustin’ foursome, whose chemistry helps prop up a story that’s arguably overly beholden to its inspiration. Reviews point to a summer movie that’s flawed but fun, and does more than enough to honor its franchise roots while setting up a sequel (or several) of its own.The Infiltrator (2016)  72%In the ’80s, G.I. Joe told us that knowing is half the battle. But for casting directors, half the battle is hiring Bryan Cranston, who’s spent the last several years delivering some of the best work of his career. By pretty much all accounts, Cranston turns in another stellar performance in this weekend’s The Infiltrator, dramatizing the real-life undercover efforts of U.S. Customs agent Bob Mazur on his quest to bring down infamous drug lord Pablo Escobar; in fact, according to more than a few critics, it’s Cranston’s work that just about single-handedly makes the movie worth watching. Of course, he’s aided and abetted by a solid ensemble that includes John Leguizamo, Diane Kruger, and Benjamin Bratt, and if you’re the type of person who loves a true-life crime drama, then seeing it’s a pretty safe bet. But the reviews describe a fairly routine story that’s often elevated by its star, so adjust your expectations accordingly.What’s New&nbsp;on TVMr. Robot: Season 2 (2016)  89%Unique storytelling, a darker tone, and challenging opportunities for its tight cast push Mr. Robot even further into uncharted television territory.Stranger Things: Season 1 (2016)  97%Exciting, heartbreaking, and sometimes scary, Stranger Things acts as an addictive homage to Spielberg films and vintage 1980s television.Also&nbsp;Opening This Week In Limited Release Phantom Boy (2016) , an animated fantasy about a kid whose ghostly powers allow him to explore New York City, is at 90&nbsp;percent.

What do the critics have to say?Pete's Dragon (2016)  88%The original Pete’s Dragon is definitely not without its charms, but it’s arguably better remembered for its technical achievements than the rest of its agreeably corny contents — which is exactly what made it an intriguing choice for Disney’s ongoing series of remakes, reboots, and reimaginings. Rather than living up to a classic, director David Lowery just needed to do a better job of telling the original story, and let the special-effects wizards do the rest. According to critics, that’s exactly what the new Pete’s Dragon represents: with a strong cast led by Robert Redford and Bryce Dallas Howard, a breathtaking CGI title character, and a thoroughly heartwarming take on the tale of a lost boy and his awe-inspiring pal, this is the rare remake that most reviews describe as vastly superior to the original. In a summer that’s already featured a couple of big kid-friendly winners, Pete’s Dragon offers one more opportunity for families to take a trip to the cineplex together and come away satisfied.Sausage Party (2016)  82%Cartoons that act and talk dirty can be inherently funny simply because of the dissonance in seeing kids’ stuff in a grown-up context. But once the novelty wears off, what’s the point? Critics say Seth Rogen and Evan&nbsp;Goldberg provide a satisfactory answer with Sausage Party, which imagines a world in which our food talks — like sailors — and enjoys sexcapades that would make Mickey Rourke and Kim Basinger blush. But underneath all the ribaldry, reviews describe an animated effort with some surprisingly thought-provoking things on its mind — including humanity’s relationship with religion. If that sounds like an awful lot to (ahem) bite off for a cartoon, it only underscores how deftly Sausage Party brings an unexpected medium (and an all-star voice cast that includes Rogen, Kristen Wiig, Jonah Hill, and Salma Hayek) to bear on its surprising themes. Just make sure you leave the kids at home.Florence Foster Jenkins (2016)  87%Florence Foster Jenkins’ real-life singing career (so to speak) has long been the butt of jokes for music geeks of a certain stripe; her collected works, issued most popularly on the novelty record The Glory (????) of the Human Voice, represent a surreal example of how badly things can go awry when recording technology falls into the wrong hands. What’s funny through the speakers can seem awfully pointless and mean-spirited on the screen, however — a problem Florence Foster Jenkins circumvents by treating its subject with dignity. Directed by Stephen Frears and starring Meryl Streep and Hugh Grant, Florence surveys Jenkins’ life and legacy with enough self-awareness to give viewers some laughs, but critics say the end result is also quite poignant — due in no small part to Streep and Grant’s performances, which lend genuine human feeling to a story that’s too often been played for laughs.What’s Hot&nbsp;on TVThe Get Down: Season 1 (2015)  77%The Get Down‘s vibrant music and energetic young cast help to elevate its meandering narrative.Also&nbsp;Opening This Week In Limited Release Hell or High Water (2016) , a politically tinged heist thriller about two bank robbers and the Texas Ranger on their trail, is Certified Fresh at 100 percent.

What do the critics have to say?Suicide Squad (2016)  26%Everyone wants their own shared cinematic universe these days, and on paper, Warner Bros. has a better shot than most, but their DC Extended Universe — DCEU for short, natch — has had a bumpy early go of it. Suicide Squad&nbsp; was supposed to be the movie that finally turned things around, with a killer cast (including&nbsp;Viola Davis, Margot Robbie, Will Smith, and Jared Leto) and an entertaining premise assembling a team of superpowered villains to save the world from an even greater threat. Unfortunately, the DCEU remains DOA among critics; while more than a few reviews spare some kind words for the performances (particularly Robbie and Smith’s) and the welcome influx of humor, none of it’s enough to rescue what most scribes describe as a muddled, mind-numbingly over-the-top, and overall unpleasant affair. Diehard fans may find a few fun set pieces among the noisy wreckage, but on the whole, it’s hard to see much more than missed opportunities here.Nine Lives (2016)  14%It’s been an awfully long time since Hollywood gave us a good old-fashioned heartwarming comedy about a person whose spirit gets trapped in the body of an animal, and we’d love to be able to tell you that this weekend’s Nine Lives — starring&nbsp;Kevin Spacey as a billionaire whose consciousness ends up in a cat — lives up to the time-honored standard set by the classics of the genre. Alas, the picture hasn’t been screened for critics, so you know what that means: it’s time to Guess the Tomatometer!Also&nbsp;Opening This Week In Limited Release Little Men (2016) ,&nbsp;about a friendship between two boys that’s threatened by a conflict between their parents, is at 95 percent.

What do the critics have to say?Kubo and the Two Strings (2016)  97%They’ve yet to release a blockbuster on par with one of the bigger animation houses, but the folks at Laika have built an impressive reputation over the last several years — a span that’s seen the studio release a trio of critically acclaimed feature-length efforts with Coraline, ParaNorman, and The Boxtrolls. Their fourth film, Kubo and the Two Strings, looks like it’ll extend that distinguished streak; as with earlier Laika productions, reviews describe a viewing experience that’s as visually thrilling as it is narratively satisfying. An action epic set in feudal Japan, Kubo stars Game of Thrones vet Art Parkinson as the titular hero, who’s forced to embark on a quest to save his loved ones after inadvertently summoning an evil spirit whose arrival may hold the key to unlocking painful secrets from his family’s past. It’s far from the sunniest family-friendly release you’ll see this summer, but for viewers comfortable with — or seeking out — more melancholy fare, critics say Kubo and the Two Strings offers rich rewards.War Dogs (2016)  61%Jonah Hill and Miles Teller as a couple of freewheeling young bros selling arms in a ripped-from-the-headlines comedy directed by Hangover vet Todd Phillips? It might sound like a recipe for an R-rated gonzo funnybone tickler, but according to critics, while War Dogs definitely has its share of laughs, it’s actually a somewhat sobering look at the real-life dirty deeds of some of the world’s more unscrupulous individuals. In fact, that’s one of the movie’s biggest problems: while the reviews describe an entertaining enough effort, they also express general disappointment at its unwillingness or inability to take a nasty bite out of a story that truly deserves it. Hill in particular has been singled out as well worth watching for a bravura performance in a role that takes advantage of his dramatic breadth, but this might be a tale more satisfyingly told with a documentary.Ben-Hur (2016)  25%Last weekend, Disney hit critical paydirt with Pete’s Dragon, a remake of a movie few would have argued deserved classic status. Now Paramount takes the opposite approach with Ben-Hur, an updated take on the 1880 Lew Wallace novel that was turned into a classic 1925 silent film and whose 1959 adaptation was a Best Picture-winning smash that still ranks among the more widely acclaimed movies of all time. Needless to say, Timur Bekmambetov‘s new version of the biblically inspired tale has some pretty big shoes to fill, and as far as most critics are concerned, it’s nowhere near up to snuff: reviews point to an earnest would-be epic whose heart might be in the right place, but whose reach almost completely exceeds its grasp. While the climactic chase scene benefits from modern technology, fans of the 1925 and 1959 versions will find this one suffers mightily in comparison — and those who haven’t seen a Ben-Hur of an earlier vintage are urged to seek them out instead.Also&nbsp;Opening This Week In Limited Release Ixcanul (2016) , about a young Guatemalan girl on the verge of an arranged marriage, is at 100 percent.

What do the critics have to say?Sully (2016)  85%Tom Hanks excels at&nbsp;playing decent fellows, and Clint Eastwood has more than proven his ability to make compelling cinema out of stories about simple guys rising to difficult situations. All of which is to say that on paper, this weekend’s Sully — about the heroic efforts of real-life&nbsp;US Airways pilot&nbsp;Chesley “Sully” Sullenberger to save a plane full of people by landing his crippled craft in the Hudson River — looks like a complete slam dunk. Critics say the end result more or less lives up to those lofty expectations, although not quite to the extent its pedigree might suggest; instead, reviews describe a straightforward drama that runs more toward the “solidly entertaining” end of the spectrum than the ranks of surefire Oscar contenders. If Eastwood and Hanks have both made better movies, that certainly isn’t to say Sully doesn’t soar often enough in its own right — or that it isn’t well worth a trip to your local cineplex.The Wild Life (2016)  17%The story of Robinson Crusoe has been adapted for film plenty of times, and given unusual twists ranging from telling the tale with a female castaway (1954’s Miss Robin Crusoe) to transplanting the action to Mars (1964’s Robinson Crusoe on Mars). Now, that long list yet adds yet another entry with The Wild Life, a 3D animated effort offering the classic story from the perspective of the animals living on the island where Crusoe shipwrecks. It isn’t a terrible idea, but critics say this is one case where far too much has been lost in translation; overbearing and unfunny, the end result has little to offer any filmgoer who isn’t a very young child or a parent desperate for a 90-minute reprieve. If you find yourself outside either of those demographics this weekend, feel free to find other viewing options.When the Bough Breaks (2016)  12%Domestic interlopers have been used as the catalyst for cinematic thrills on numerous occasions, and this weekend’s When the Bough Breaks — starring&nbsp;Morris Chestnut and Regina Hall as a couple whose bliss is threatened by an unbalanced surrogate played by&nbsp;Jaz Sinclair — might deliver its share. Unfortunately, it wasn’t screened for critics, so we have no way of knowing yet… and you know what that means: it’s time for you to guess the Tomatometer!The Disappointments Room (2016)  0%Also arriving without the benefit of early reviews is The Disappointments Room, a thriller from Eagle Eye and Disturbia director D.J. Caruso. Starring Kate Beckinsale and Mel Raido as a couple whose new home comes with a secret (and potentially lethal) room, it could give us the first terrifying haunted house of the fall film season — or it could be a rickety dud.

What do the critics have to say?Star Trek Beyond (2016)  86%The Star Trek faithful have weathered their fair share of ups and downs with the franchise over the years, and when reboot helmer J.J. Abrams departed the bridge after 2013’s Into Darkness, he left an air of uncertainty in his wake. Fortunately for fans, it appears that incoming director Justin Lin has done the series a solid with this weekend’s Star Trek Beyond: reviews describe an installment that continues the amped-up action Abrams introduced while still leaving room for the thoughtful sci-fi that’s always been a Trek hallmark. In fact, critics say the story — which finds our heroes shipwrecked on a distant planet while doing battle with the fearsome Krall (Idris Elba) — serves as a worthy celebration of the saga’s 50th anniversary that also works pretty well as a standalone adventure. Star Trek locked down the “live long” part of Spock’s oft-quoted credo years ago; with Beyond, it seems a safe bet to prosper.Ice Age: Collision Course (2016)  18%For parents of young children, cinematic standards tend to be applied on a sliding scale — if a movie holds up reasonably well as a shared diversion, it doesn’t have to be a classic. But even by those relaxed standards, not all kid-friendly cartoons are created equal, and critics say Ice Age: Collision Course&nbsp;offers particularly painful proof. Five installments in, it can’t be getting any easier to dream up new adventures for Manny the mammoth (Ray Romano), Sid the sloth (John Leguizamo), and their pals; unfortunately, reviews point to a tired outing that shows every bit of that creative strain, with a rote story that falls back on a barrage of noisy action and stale jokes. For parents of little ones who love Ice Age, this weekend may represent a Collision Course&nbsp;with misery — but for everyone else, there are plenty of superior animated alternatives.Lights Out (2016)  76%It wasn’t all that long ago that summer was a reliable dumping ground for cheapo horror flicks offering little more than 90 minutes of air conditioning and a few mildly effective jump scares, but in recent years, genre filmmakers have really started upping their game. According to most critics, Lights Out&nbsp;is the latest example of this welcome trend: a terrifically effective chiller about a shadowy horror preying on multiple generations of a family, and the panicked but determined efforts of a young woman (Teresa Palmer) to vanquish that evil. A feature-length version of director&nbsp;David F. Sandberg‘s acclaimed short film, Lights Out&nbsp;may not necessarily go anywhere new, but his confident work, talented cast, and scary premise add up to a summertime horror movie that should leave fans screaming for all the right reasons.What’s New&nbsp;on TV&nbsp;Difficult People: Season 2 (2016)  100%Difficult People picks up even more momentum in its sophomore season, upping the addictive yet somehow relatable nastiness of its leads with fast-paced — and possibly therapeutic — hilarity.The A Word: Season 1 (2016)  75%The A Word overcomes an uneven start to offer a thoughtful, warm-hearted look at the engagingly messy lives of its protagonists — and a glimpse of challenges too rarely seen or discussed on television.Vice Principals: Season 1 (2016)  66%Vice Principals is sporadically amusing and benefits from its talented stars, but its mean-spirited humor sometimes misses the mark.Also&nbsp;Opening This Week In Limited Release Don't Think Twice (2016) , starring&nbsp;Keegan-Michael Key and Gillian Jacobs in Mike Birbiglia‘s comedy about an improv troupe’s collective reaction to the success of one of its members, is at 100 percent.

What do the critics have to say?Deadpool (2016)  85%After the epic misfire that was Fantastic Four last year, Fox keeps its superhero dream alive with Deadpool&nbsp;—&nbsp;the first R-rated Marvel movie since 2008’s Punisher: War Zone.&nbsp;Ryan Reynolds stars&nbsp;in the&nbsp;role he was born to play: a&nbsp;profane, fourth wall-breaking antihero who’s on a revenge quest to save his fiancé (Morena Baccarin), while exploiting&nbsp;several characters borrowed from the X-Men universe. For those who aren’t immediately inured to the film’s blend of mega-violence and immature, pop culture-riddled jokes, critics say it’s worth sticking around to see how far Reynolds will go in a gleefully unhinged performance.Zoolander 2 (2016)  22%In 2001, a dimwitted male model named Derek Zoolander embarked on a mission to expose an international conspiracy, delivering a slew of quotable one-liners and inspiring a cult following along the way. Almost 15 years later, Ben Stiller (who also writes and directs) returns to the role for Zoolander 2, and critics say it’s unfortunately as vapid and scatterbrained as its hero. This time out, Derek and his former rival Hansel (Owen Wilson) are tapped by Interpol to investigate when a string of murders leaves the world’s most beautiful people dead. The pundits say Zoolander 2 offers a few laughs, but it largely plays like a collection of lazy, rehashed sketches peppered with countless celebrity cameos.How To Be Single (2016)  47%How to make a solid romantic comedy: assemble a likeable cast, craft a script with a few lines of sharp dialogue, and voila! Easy, right? Well, critics say How to Be Single is best when it lets its leads let loose with the girl talk, but it too often veers into overly predictable territory. After breaking up with her college boyfriend, Alice (Dakota Johnson) moves to New York, where she befriends Robin (Rebel Wilson), who instructs her in the ways of the single life.

What do the critics have to say?X-Men: Apocalypse (2016)  47%The X-Men series has been through a reboot and a couple of spinoff franchises at this point, and all that history is a bit of a mixed blessing — on the one hand, it’s that much easier for each new entry to take advantage of the team’s decades of history in print; on the other, it gets progressively more difficult to do justice to each character as the cast and crowded mythology expand. Sadly, although it tries to honor the comics by bringing a key villain’s saga to life, critics say&nbsp;X-Men: Apocalypse stumbles under the weight of a muddled storyline that can’t fully do justice to its core components — and eventually falls back on the CGI Sturm und Drang that has reduced far too many superhero sequels to digital noise in the final act.Alice Through the Looking Glass (2016)  29%Tim Burton’s Alice in Wonderland&nbsp;had a great cast and incredible special effects, but it wasn’t exactly a critical darling. Lukewarm reviews notwithstanding, it made an absolute ton of money worldwide — which is why, even though Burton’s no longer in the director’s chair, Alice Through the Looking Glass&nbsp;was a foregone conclusion. Alas, although the core members of the cast are back (including Mia Wasikowska, Helena Bonham Carter, Johnny Depp, and Anne Hathaway), critics say new director James Bobin brings even less of the source material’s delightful whimsy to this follow-up, sacrificing Lewis Carroll’s classic stories on a brightly colored altar of computer-generated chaos.What’s Hot on TVRoots: Miniseries (2016)  96%A powerfully impressive — and still relevant — update on a television classic, Roots boasts remarkable performances, deep emotion, and occasionally jarring beauty.All the Way (2016)  87%Anchored by Bryan Cranston‘s phenomenal performance as LBJ, All the Way is an engrossing portrayal of a complicated man during a pivotal moment in US history.Wayward Pines: Season 2 (2016)  43%Wayward Pines drifts away from the intrigue and mystery established during its debut season, slipping into a dull, repetitive, and trite narrative.Also&nbsp;Opening This Week In Limited Release Lasseter's Bones (2016) , a documentary about an 85-year-old man searching the desert for a treasure his father claimed to have found in 1931, is at 100 percent.

Chevalier (2016) , a dramedy about six well-heeled Greeks aboard a boat who engage in an ill-defined but heated competition, is at 77 percent.

What do the critics have to say?\n\n\n        \n            \n                Mother's Day (2016)  8%\n            \n            \n                \n            \n            \n              \nPick a holiday, sign up a bunch of stars, and voila: you’ve got the formula for Garry Marshall’s last three directorial efforts. Critics say the latest, Mother’s Day, is about as middling as Valentine’s Day and New Year’s Eve, and for the same reasons: it’s a series of loosely connected, thinly plotted vignettes that leave its likeable cast (which includes Julia Roberts, Jennifer Aniston, Kate Hudson, and Jason Sudeikis) without much to do.\n\n            \n        \n\n\n        \n            \n                Keanu (2016)  78%\n            \n            \n                \n            \n            \n              \nKeegan-Michael Key and Jordan Peele anchored a wildly popular sketch comedy TV series, and now they’re setting their sights on the big screen. Fortunately, critics say that Keanu, in which the duo play regular guys who adopt gangster identities to retrieve a stolen kitten, is an entertaining showcase for their winning chemistry and knack for incisive satire.\n\n            \n        \n\n\n        \n            \n                Ratchet &amp; Clank (2016)  21%\n            \n            \n                \n            \n            \n              \nVideo games can be a source of rich storytelling, but that rarely translates to the medium’s various film adaptations. Based on a popular PlayStation franchise about a cat-like alien and a sentient robot teaming up to save the galaxy, this week’s Ratchet &amp; Clank seems unlikely to buck the trend, as critics say its bright visuals and silly gags may entertain the youngsters, but there’s far too little to keep anyone older engaged.\n\n            \n        \n\n\n        \n            \n                Green Room (2016)  91%\n            \n            \n                \n            \n            \n              \nBlue Ruin, director Jeremy Saulnier’s breakout film, was a shocking revenge thriller with an impeccable sense of artistry.

What do the critics have to say?Money Monster (2016)  59%A topical thriller that takes on both glib TV infotainment and Wall Street greed, Jodie Foster’s latest directorial effort is a movie with a lot on its mind. However, critics say Money Monster works best as a showcase for George Clooney and Julia Roberts, whose commanding performances help to balance the film’s occasional overreach. When the latest pick from TV stock pundit Lee Gates (Clooney) mysteriously tanks, an angry investor holds the show’s crew hostage on-air; it’s up to Gates and producer Patty Fenn (Roberts) to diffuse the situation and find out what happened to the stock. The pundits say Money Monster isn’t always plausible, but it’s suspenseful and sometimes darkly funny.The Darkness (2016)  3%When it comes to The Darkness, critics have been left in the dark — the film wasn’t screened for reviewers prior to its release in theaters. Kevin Bacon and Radha Mitchell star as a couple who unwittingly unleash a malevolent force on their home after a trip to the Grand Canyon.

However, critics say a lack of diversity is only one of its many problems, which also include bombastic performances, cheesy special effects, and a surfeit of unintentional laughs. Set (Gerard Butler) has violently claimed the throne and ruled despotically, so it’s up to Horus (Nikolaj Coster-Waldau) and Bek (Brenton Thwaites) to break his grip on power. The pundits say Gods of Egypt is a spectacularly misconceived would-be epic that might be more fun if it fully embraced its utter preposterousness.Triple 9 (2016)  54%Star-studded it may be, but Triple 9 is pretty far from Ocean’s Eleven or Now You See Me territory. Critics say this violent crime drama delivers its share of pulpy thrills, but its plot is both overstuffed and predictable. A crew of ruthless thieves comprised of former soldiers and dirty cops are blackmailed by Russian mobsters into taking on a nearly impossible heist, and to succeed, they’ll need to create a major distraction —&nbsp;a 999, code for “officer down.” The pundits say Triple 9‘s top notch roster of acting talent (which includes Casey Affleck, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Anthony Mackie, Woody Harrelson, and Kate Winslet) helps to elevate this dark, occasionally brutal genre picture.Eddie The Eagle (2016)  82%Die-hard sports fans will dimly remember Eddie “The Eagle” Edwards, the British ski jumper whose indomitable spirit and last place finish at the 1988 Winter Olympics made him a folk hero. The critics say Eddie the Eagle, a fictional retelling of Edwards’ story starring Taron Egerton in the title role, is an occasionally over-saccharine inspirational sports film that nonetheless succeeds on the basis of its infections charm and strong performances.What’s Hot on TVBroad City: Season 3 (2016)  100%Broad City returns with another strong season of Jacobson and Glazer’s hilarious outlook on the struggles of NYC life.Togetherness: Season 2 (2016)  88%Togetherness returns with its charm intact, though its compelling characters could stand to have a few more laughs.Love: Season 1 (2016)  87%Judd Apatow’s Love is an honest look at building a relationship, helped along by its two appealing leads.Also&nbsp;Opening This Week In Limited Release Only Yesterday (1991) , Studio Ghibli’s bittersweet 1990 drama from animation legend Isao Takahata, is at 100 percent.

What do the critics have to say?The Divergent Series: Allegiant (2016)  11%The critical knock on the Divergent franchise has tended to be that it’s little more than a second rate Hunger Games, and while that assessment might seem reductive to its legion of teenage fans, it essentially holds true for the latest chapter. Critics say Allegiant — in which a band of teenage revolutionaries, led by Tris Prior (Shailene Woodley), escapes post-apocalyptic Chicago, only to discover a eugenics proponent leading a community on the outskirts &nbsp;— is top-heavy with exposition and special effects, stranding its talented cast in a place-holding installment that’s unlikely to lure any newbies to the series.Miracles from Heaven (2016)  45%Even though&nbsp;it’s based on a true story, Miracles from Heaven is the kind of thing you’ve seen before; it’s the story of a mother who refuses to give up hope, even after her daughter has been diagnosed with a rare, untreatable disease. What elevates this faith-based drama, critics say, is the committed, commanding performance of Jennifer Garner, who lends urgency to a film that could have otherwise been merely a collection of melodramatic clichés.What’s Hot on TVThe Americans: Season 4 (2016)  99%With its fourth season, The Americans continues to deliver top-tier spy drama while sending its characters in directions that threaten to destroy their freedoms – and their lives.Marvel's Daredevil: Season 2 (2016)  81%Bolstered by some impressive action, Daredevil keeps its footing in Season two, even if the additions of Punisher and Elektra can’t quite fill the void left by Wilson Fisk.Crowded: Season 1 (2015)  32%A talented cast is left with no room to flourish in Crowded, a misfire whose dated feel is compounded by a pronounced lack of laughs.Also&nbsp;Opening This Week In Limited Release Fireworks Wednesday (Chaharshanbe-soori) (2016) , Iranian auteur&nbsp;Asghar Farhadi‘s drama about a housekeeper who becomes embroiled in her employers’ toxic marital conflict, is at 100 percent.

What do the critics have to say?The Angry Birds Movie (2016)  43%First the good news: at press time, The Angry Birds Movie is the best-reviewed video game film adaptation of all time. The bad news is that it’s still Rotten on the Tomatometer. It’s the story of Red (voiced by Jason Sudeikis), an oft-enraged bird who fears that a group of pigs want to invade his avian paradise. Critics say The Angry Birds Movie&nbsp;has a colorful look and a few decent gags, but it wastes a stellar voice cast on a script filled with lowbrow humor and mixed messages.Neighbors 2: Sorority Rising (2016)  64%Seth Rogen and Rose Byrne squared off against an obnoxious fraternity&nbsp;in 2014’s Neighbors,&nbsp;and the result was a Certified Fresh hit comedy. This time around, Mac (Rogen) and Kelly (Byrne) face a similar predicament when a sorority led by party girl Shelby (Chloë Grace Moretz) moves in next door, so they&nbsp;reunite with frat boy Teddy (Zac Efron) to fight fire with fire. Critics say Neighbors 2: Sorority Rising manages to squeeze enough fresh laughs out of its recycled premise to make it worth a watch, even if it doesn’t feel like a particularly necessary sequel.The Nice Guys (2016)  91%Shane Black may not have invented the odd couple action/comedy, but he’s one of its greatest purveyors – he wrote the script for Lethal Weapon and directed Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang. Now he’s back with The Nice Guys, and critics say this wild and woolly comedy – about a private eye who teams up with an enforcer to find a missing woman – boasts terrific comic chemistry between Russell Crowe and Ryan Gosling, along with a surfeit of groovy 1970s style.What’s Hot on TVLady Dynamite: Season 1 (2016)  95%Maria Bamford‘s Lady Dynamite is a vibrant, subversive, sweet, meta-fictional ride – but also a courageous, boundary-busting and ultimately deep portrayal of a troubled psyche.&nbsp;Preacher: Season 1 (2016)  89%A thrilling celebration of the bizarre, Preacher boasts enough gore, glee, and guile to make this visually stunning adaption a must-see for fans of the comic and newcomers alike.Chelsea: Season 1 (2016)  41%Chelsea comes up short in its attempts to innovate the conventional talk show format — and even worse, it frequently fails to be smart or funny.Also&nbsp;Opening This Week In Limited Release Almost Holy (Crocodile Gennadiy) (2016) , a documentary about a Ukrainian preacher who made it a personal mission to save local kids from addiction, is at 100 percent. Margarita with a Straw (2016) , starring Kalki Koechlin in a drama about a woman struggling with both cerebral palsy and matters of the heart, is at 90 percent. Weiner (2016) ,&nbsp;a&nbsp;documentary about the failed mayoral candidate and serial sexter, is at 87 percent. Maggie's Plan (2016) , starring Greta Gerwig&nbsp;and Ethan Hawke&nbsp;in a comedy about a woman who wants a baby without the responsibilities of marriage, is at 79 percent. Manhattan Night (Manhattan Nocturne) (2016) , starring Adrien Brody&nbsp;in a noirish thriller about a newspaper columnist who’s tasked by a mysterious woman to solve her husband’s murder, is at 50 percent.

What do the critics have to say?The Jungle Book (2016)  94%It’s really hard to equal — much less top — a beloved classic. But critics say director Jon Favreau may have done just that with his live-action adaptation of The Jungle Book, which takes the timeless tale of a child raised by wolves and elevates it with some of the best CGI every committed to film. It doesn’t hurt, of course that he’s abetted by a strong cast that includes newcomer Neel Sethi and voice performers Bill Murray, Scarlett Johansson, and Idris Elba. The pundits say the Certified Fresh The Jungle Book is a family friendly film of a very high order.Barbershop: The Next Cut (2016)  90%Everything’s coming up aces for Ice Cube these days. The recently-minted Rock ‘n’ Roll Hall of Famer is back with the third entry in the Barbershop series, and critics say it’s got all the warmth, ribald humor, and insightful commentary that made the first two entries big hits at the box office. Once again, Barbershop: The Next Cut doesn’t have much of a plot, but its fine cast — which includes Cedric the Entertainer, Regina Hall, Anthony Anderson, Common, and Nicki Minaj&nbsp;— &nbsp;makes for terrific company.Criminal (2016)  30%On paper, a spy thriller starring dependable folks like Kevin Costner, Gary Oldman, and Tommy Lee Jones alongside comic book heroes Ryan Reynolds and Gal Gadot sounds like a can’t-miss proposition. Unfortunately, critics say Criminal misses pretty badly, mostly because its story — about a violent felon whose brain is infused with the knowledge and memories of a crack CIA agent — is both preposterous and badly paced.What’s Hot on TVOutlander: Season 2 (2016)  92%Outlander returns for a second addictive season of mystery and sweeping romance as Claire and Jamie take on Paris.Catastrophe: Season 2 (2016)  100%Catastrophe delivers a strong second season that deepens the drama while remaining spit-take funny.The Girlfriend Experience: Season 1 (2016)  85%The darkly fascinating (and utterly bingeworthy) The Girlfriend Experience powers past any shortcomings with a breakout performance by Riley Keough.Fear the Walking Dead: Season 2 (2016)  70%Fear the Walking Dead sets sail in its sophomore season with an intriguing backdrop that doesn’t always disguise its deficiencies in comparison to its predecessor.Also&nbsp;Opening This Week In Limited Release Our Last Tango (Un Tango Más) (2016) , a documentary about Argentinian tango dancers&nbsp;Maria Nieves Rego and Juan Carlos Copes, is at 100 percent.

Wedding Doll (Hatuna Meniyar) (2016) , an Israeli drama about a young woman with a slight mental deficiency who falls in love, much to the chagrin of her protective mother, is at 70 percent. 13 Cameras (2016) , a psychological horror film about a pregnant newlywed couple who are terrorized by their invasive new landlord, is at 60 percent. Colonia (2016) , starring Emma Watson and Daniel&nbsp;Brühl in a historical drama about a young couple who attempt to escape from a notorious Chilean cult compound during the early 1970s, is at 23 percent.

What do the critics have to say?Krampus (2015)  67%If you’re tired of enforced yuletide gaiety, there’s a good chance you’ll be intrigued by Krampus‘ premise: this horror/comedy tells the tale of a Christmas spirit who bedevils anyone who refuses to participate in holiday cheer. The critics say a top-notch cast helps to make this a better-than-average frightfest, though it doesn’t always live up to its satirical aims.The Letters (2015)  29%The&nbsp;Letters boasts an undeniably compelling subject in humanitarian and Nobel Peace Prize winner Mother Teresa, and it’s got a wonderful cast in Juliet Stevenson, Rutger Hauer, and Max von Sydow.

This week at the movies, we’ve got a vengeful frontiersman&nbsp;(The Revenant, starring Leonardo DiCaprio and Tom Hardy) and haunted woodlands (The Forest, starring Natalie Dormer&nbsp;and Taylor Kinney). What do the critics have to say?The Revenant (2015)  78%Alejandro González Iñárritu took home a boatload of awards last year — including a quartet of Oscars — for Birdman, which was as much a technical marvel as it was a showcase for stellar acting. Critics say his follow-up, The Revenant, is another expertly crafted piece of cinema, even if its onscreen brutality is sometimes difficult to watch. Leonardo DiCaprio stars as real life explorer Hugh Glass, who survives a vicious bear attack during an expedition. Left for dead by his fellow hunters, Glass crawls across the wilderness to safety and seeks retribution. The pundits say the Certified Fresh&nbsp;The Revenant is potent filmmaking, with stunning cinematography and a powerhouse performance by DiCaprio, though its unflinching portrayal of Glass’ punishing ordeal may be too intense for some.The Forest (2016)  10%The Aokigahara forest near the base of Japan’s Mount Fuji is infamous as the venue of choice for hundreds of people looking to commit suicide. In other words, it might seem an ideal locale for a horror film. Critics say The Forest, unfortunately, manages to botch the opportunity. Natalie Dormer stars as Sara Price, an American who learns her twin sister Jess (also played by Dormer) has ventured into Aokigahara and disappeared. In search of the truth, Sara travels to Japan and enters the forest herself, only to be confronted by ghostly visions. The pundits say The Forest begins with an intriguing premise but fails to deliver any genuine chills.What’s Hot on TVDownton Abbey: Series 06 (2015)  89%Melodramatic characters and soapy class struggles continue to keep Downton Abbey compelling as this celebrated series approaches its grand finale.American Crime: Season 2 (2016)  95%American Crime‘s intense second season infuses a complicated, topical story with genuine emotion, and patiently allows its narrative arc to develop without sacrificing momentum.Also&nbsp;Opening This Week In Limited Release The Treasure (2016) , a Romanian comedy&nbsp;about two neighbors who learn their shared yard may hold buried treasure and work together to dig it up, is at 94 percent.

Unfortunately, critics say In the Heart of the Sea is unlikely to join that masterwork in the pantheon of maritime fiction; while the film is visually impressive, its narrative drifts aimlessly. While in the South Pacific, the Essex was attacked by a sperm whale, destroying the ship and stranding its crew in the middle of the ocean without food or water. The pundits say In the Heart of the Sea has moments of visceral excitement, but ultimately it lacks three-dimensional characters and urgency in its storytelling.&nbsp;What’s Hot on TVTransparent: Season 2 (2015)  98%Transparent‘s second season ups its dramatic stakes while retaining the poignancy and humor that have made the series such a consistently entertaining example of the best that modern serial drama has to offer.A Very Murray Christmas (2015)  68%A Very Murray Christmas preaches effectively to the converted with a parade of superstar guests and hummable songs that —&nbsp;combined with the host’s trademark presence —&nbsp;adds up to a unique holiday experience.Telenovela: Season 1 (2015)  64%Featuring a likable cast led by a charming Eva Longoria,&nbsp;Telenovela provides entertainingly predictable laughs.Also&nbsp;Opening This Week In Limited Release The Girl in the Book (2015) ,&nbsp;starring Emily VanCamp&nbsp;and Michael Nyqvist&nbsp;in&nbsp;a drama about an aspiring novelist dealing with formative trauma, is at 100 percent.

What do the critics have to say?The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 2 (2015)  69%The Hunger Games franchise has helped make Jennifer Lawrence a household name, and critics say her assured performance as Katniss Everdeen is the best thing about The Hunger Games: Mockingjay – Part 2, a satisfying — if occasionally overly grim — conclusion to the series. This time, Katniss leads a guerilla army to eliminate the despotic President Snow (Donald Sutherland) — and discovers that some within the rebellion may have agendas of their own. The pundits say Mockingjay – Part 2 is bleak and a little too long, but it’s also rousing, jolting, and intelligent, which befits a saga&nbsp;that has done much to alter the action movie landscape.The Night Before (2015)  69%When Seth Rogen, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, and director Jonathan Levine last joined forces, the result was 2011’s 50/50, a funny, heartfelt dramedy that was as moving as it was funny. Anthony Mackie joins them in their latest collaboration, The Night Before, and critics say the result is a surprisingly warm holiday bromance, even if its drug-fueled humor sometimes misses the mark. Boyhood buddies Isaac (Rogen), Ethan (Gordon-Levitt), and Chris (Mackie) have traditionally celebrated Christmas Eve with hedonistic yuletide festivities; now faced with looming adult responsibilities, the trio reunite to seek out one last, legendary party. The pundits say The Night Before is suitably raucous and unexpectedly sweet, though it might not tickle your funny bone as often as you might want.Secret in Their Eyes (2015)  39%Not every American remake of a foreign language film is doomed to failure; some, like Best Picture winner The Departed, have equaled or surpassed the originals. Unfortunately, critics say Secret in their Eyes (based upon the Oscar-winning 2009 Argentinian film of the same name) never justifies its own existence, despite the best effort of an A-list cast that includes Chiwetel Ejiofor, Julia Roberts, and Nicole Kidman. Ejiofor stars as a former FBI agent who has resumed his investigation into the murder of a colleague’s daughter after discovering new information — but solving this mystery may uncover even darker secrets. The pundits say Secret in their Eyes lacks the specific political context that made the original so chilling, and what’s left is little more than a decent police procedural.What’s Hot on TVThe Man in the High Castle: Season 1 (2015)  95%The Man in the High Castle is unlike anything else on TV, with an immediately engrossing plot driven by quickly developed characters in a fully realized post-World War II dystopia.Marvel's Jessica Jones: Season 1 (2015)  94%Jessica Jones builds a multifaceted drama around its engaging antihero, delivering what might be Marvel’s strongest TV franchise to date.Into the Badlands: Season 1 (2015)  63%Into the Badlands is loaded with off-kilter potential that’s left largely unfulfilled — although its well-choreographed action sequences should satisfy martial arts fans.Donny!: Season 1 (2015)  23%While adding nothing new to the established medical procedural formula, Dick Wolf‘s Chicago Med hits its familiar beats forcefully enough to satisfy a few genre enthusiasts.Also&nbsp;Opening This Week In Limited Release Democrats (2015) , a documentary about the fragile state of coalition government in Robert Mugabe’s Zimbabwe, is at 100 percent.

What do the critics have to say?The Visit (2015)  68%Since the runaway success of The Sixth Sense, director M. Night Shyamalan‘s career has certainly had its share of ups and (mostly) downs. However, critics say The Visit is a solid return to form, an oddball horror/comedy that doesn’t always work but surprises and shocks more often than not. It’s the story of two siblings who are invited to spend some time at their grandparents’ remote farmhouse, which our teenage heroes quickly discover is a bastion of eccentric, unnerving behavior. The pundits say The Visit is uneven, but its loose-limbed blend of laughs and scares results in Shyamalan’s most purely enjoyable big screen effort in years.The Perfect Guy (2015)  18%The Perfect Guy wasn’t screened for critics, so we currently have no way of knowing whether this latest take on the Fatal Attraction template achieves perfection. Sanaa Lathan stars as a lovelorn woman who meets a handsome stranger (Michael Ealy) who seems too good to be true, but a series of bizarre incidents leaves our heroine wondering who she can trust. Guess the Tomatometer!90 Minutes In Heaven (2015)  26%A faith-based drama boasting a strong cast, 90 Minutes in Heaven was barely screened for critics prior to its release in theaters. Hayden Christensen stars as a minister who is involved in a devastating auto accident; pronounced dead at the scene, he reawakens with a miraculous tale of a visit to the hereafter. Once again, feel free to guess the Tomatometer!What’s Hot on TVThe Late Show With Stephen Colbert: Season 1 (2015)  91%Smart, energetic, and a little bit silly, The Late Show with Stephen Colbert succeeds largely due to the charisma of its host, whose confident debut promises a bright future for the revamped show.You're the Worst: Season 2 (2015)  97%Expertly balancing character growth against edgy humor,&nbsp;You’re the Worst&nbsp;elevates the show’s excellent writing and talented cast to a new level.Hand of God: Season 1 (2014)  30%Hand of God boasts a talented cast and intriguing premise, but neither are enough to overcome a resounding lack of meaningful drama or impactful thrills.Also&nbsp;Opening This Week In Limited Release Welcome To Leith (2015) , a documentary about a small town’s resistance to an attempted takeover by white supremacists, is at 95&nbsp;percent.

What do the critics have to say?The 33 (2015)  48%The story of the brave Chilean miners who were rescued after being trapped more than 2,000 feet underground is the kind of real-life inspirational tale that practically begs for a big-screen adaptation. Unfortunately, critics say The 33 shoehorns its inherently dramatic tale into a formulaic disaster movie template. If you watched the news in 2010, you know the basic outline: a cave-in traps a group of mine workers for nearly two months, and the film follows events both below and above ground, as the miners’ families and supporters try to stay strong while a rescue team goes to work. The pundits say the cast of The 33 does well with its limited characters, but the film is ultimately too predictable and surface-level to fully resonate.Love the Coopers (2015)  18%The holidays can turn even the staunchest Scrooge into a gooey sentimentalist, so there’s nothing fundamentally wrong with a film that follows an age-old seasonal recipe. Too bad, then, that critics say that despite its all-star guest list, Love the Coopers is louder — and less funny — than a bad Christmas sweater. Diane Keaton stars as the matriarch of the Cooper clan, the members of which are all on shaky ground in their personal lives as they gather for presumed seasonal merriment. Will everyone hit some sort of low point before banding together in celebration? The pundits say Love the Coopers might jerk a tear or two, but mostly, it’s alternately too gloomy and too contrived to achieve any kind of festive goodwill.My All American (2015)  31%With so many inspirational sports films in the world, it takes something truly special to rise above the competition. Unfortunately, critics say&nbsp;My All American, the directorial debut of&nbsp;Rudy&nbsp;and&nbsp;Hoosiers&nbsp;scribe Angelo Pizzo, fails to distinguish itself from the pack, even if it’s earnest and well-acted. Based on the true story of college football player Freddie Steinmark, the film stars Aaron Eckhart as University of Texas coach Darrell Royal, who spots talent in the undersized Steinmark (Finn Wittrock) and offers him a full scholarship. Upbeat and dedicated, Steinmark leads the 1969 Longhorns through a legendary season even as he is struck with tragic news. The pundits say&nbsp;My All American&nbsp;is uplifting and heartfelt with strong performances from its cast, but it’s predictable and far from subtle, and viewers with an aversion to schmaltz should steer clear.&nbsp;What’s Hot on TVW/ Bob and David: Season 1 (2015)  89%W/Bob and David offers a long-overdue reunion between Mr. Show principals Odenkirk and Cross —&nbsp;and a suitably hilarious reminder of the reasons for their subsequent individual successes.Into the Badlands: Season 1 (2015)  63%Into the Badlands is loaded with off-kilter potential that’s left largely unfulfilled — although its well-choreographed action sequences should satisfy martial arts fans.Donny!: Season 1 (2015)  23%Often unfunny and occasionally creepy, Donny! draws unfavorable comparisons to any number of superior improvisational comedies.&nbsp;Also&nbsp;Opening This Week In Limited Release Kilo Two Bravo (2015) , a fact-based war film about a troop of British soldiers in Afghanistan who become trapped in the middle of a minefield, is at 100 percent.

In addition, we’ve got party-hearty siblings (Sisters, starring Tina Fey&nbsp;and Amy Poehler) and traveling rodents (Alvin and the Chipmunks: The Road Chip, starring Jason Lee&nbsp;and Justin Long). What do the critics have to say?Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens (2015)  93%Star Wars casts such a powerful shadow over the pop cultural landscape that it’s difficult to evaluate any of the films without nostalgia or prejudice. That said, critics say Star Wars: Episode VII – The Force Awakens both affectionately recalls the franchise’s best moments and promises an auspicious future. Daisy Ridley stars as Rey, a capable scavenger who teams up with disgraced soldier Finn (John Boyega) to help locate Luke Skwalker before the First Order, a new evil empire, can track him down. Along the way, they run into some formidable foes and friendly faces. The pundits say the Certified Fresh The Force Awakens successfully evokes the familiar wonder of its predecessors, introduces engaging new characters, and offers appropriately thrilling action in a worthy addition to the Star Wars saga.Sisters (2015)  60%The comedic chemistry between Tina Fey and Amy Poehler is so infectious, critics say, that it can carry viewers through some of the rougher patches of Sisters, a comedy that balances its gross-out humor with some big laughs and a surprising amount of heart. Fey and Poehler star as thirtysomething wild child Kate Ellis and her frumpy divorcee sister Maura, who fly home to Orlando when they discover their parents have sold their childhood house. Faced with the impending loss, they decide to let loose and throw one last raging party. The pundits say Sisters benefits from some solid gags and the inherent likability of its leads, even if it doesn’t offer many surprises.Alvin and the Chipmunks: The Road Chip (2015)  15%Say what you will about Alvin and the Chipmunks, but they’ve made one indelible contribution to seasonal merriment with “The Chipmunk Song (Christmas Don’t Be Late).” Critics say Alvin and the Chipmunks: The Road Chip is much more ephemeral — little kids will probably be mildly amused, their guardians will not, and all will forget about it hours later. This time out, Dave (Jason Lee) is planning to propose to his girlfriend, and Alvin, Simon, and Theodore think he’s going to give them the heave-ho, so they hit the road in an attempt to change his mind. The pundits say The Road Chip is, at best, a moderately inoffensive time-waster.&nbsp;What’s Hot on TVTransparent: Season 2 (2015)  98%Transparent‘s second season ups its dramatic stakes while retaining the poignancy and humor that have made the series such a consistently entertaining example of the best that modern serial drama has to offer.The Expanse: Season 1 (2015)  77%The Expanse blends sci-fi elements and detective noir into a visually compelling whole, though it takes a few episodes for the story to capture viewers’ intrigue.Childhood's End: Season 1 (2015)  70%While it doesn’t quite live up to the book that inspired it, Childhood’s End has a balanced narrative and sympathetic performances.Also&nbsp;Opening This Week In Limited Release Son of Saul (2015) , a drama about a prisoner of Auschwitz who attempts to arrange a proper Jewish burial for a dead child, is Certified Fresh at 92 percent.

What do the critics have to say?Spy 95%Melissa McCarthy made her bones as a scene-stealing supporting player, but her starring vehicles have only occasionally made the most of her comic gifts. Until now, that is: critics say Spy is an inspired, uproarious spoof of espionage thrillers loaded with self-effacing performances and sharp jabs at workplace sexism. When an arms dealer identifies several of the CIA’s top field agents, desk-bound analyst Susan Cooper (McCarthy) gets her chance to go undercover in Paris. But during the course of her mission, Cooper must endure a string of indignities, from an unflattering cover story to a borderline-psychotic fellow agent (Jason Statham) who questions her competence at every turn. The pundits say the Certified Fresh Spy boasts sharp dialogue, solid action sequences, and, most of all, a terrific showcase for McCarthy’s talents. (Check out this week’s 24 Frames for a gallery of silly spies from TV and the movies, and watch our video interview with the cast and crew.)Entourage 33%Over the course of its eight season run on HBO, Entourage entertained as both a bro wish-fulfillment fantasy and as a gentle satire of Hollywood. Entourage the movie offers up more of the same, and critics say that’s a problem — this is a low-stakes, nearly conflict-free affair that feels more like an extended TV episode than a cinematic experience. Hunky movie star Vincent Chase (Adrian Grenier) is directing his first film — an adaptation of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde — and live-wire agent-cum-studio head Ari Gold (Jeremy Piven) is freaking out about budget overruns and Vincent’s lack of filmmaking experience. Meanwhile, the rest of the gang is busy partying, carousing, and bumping into celebrities. The pundits say that Entourage may please hardcore fans, but aside from Piven’s crass, coarse performance, it’s too bland and self-satisfied to appeal to non-diehards. (Check out this week’s Total Recall for a list of essential movies about movies, and watch our video interview with the stars.)Insidious: Chapter 3 58%Plenty of horror movie part threes exist primarily to wring a few extra box office bucks out of a brand name franchise. However, while critics say that Insidious: Chapter 3 is a bit too reliant on empty jump scares, it’s smarter and more character-driven than many others of its ilk, and does a decent job of staking out new territory within the Insidious universe. Still grieving from the death of her mother, high school senior Quinn (Stefanie Scott) asks a psychic to make contact with her mother’s spirit and unwittingly draws the attention of a malevolent supernatural force in the process. The pundits say Insidious Chapter 3 can’t match the efficient terror of the original, but it’s a better-than-average fright-fest that builds considerable tension throughout. (Check out our video interview with the stars of Chapter 3.)What’s On TV:Following several episodes of setup, “Hardhome” (100 percent) blends a sharp script with spectacular blockbuster action to offer viewers a powerful, game-changing payoff.Bryan Fuller serves up another delightfully demented season of Hannibal (100 percent) featuring a hearty helping of gorgeous gore, paired with a sweet side of twisted humor (read our Q&amp;A with Fuller here).UnReal (Certified Fresh at 95 percent) uses reality TV as a suitably soapy springboard for absorbing drama.Also opening this week in limited release:Charlie’s Country, a drama about an aging warrior who struggles against the Australian government’s control over an Aboriginal community, is at 91 percent.A Pigeon Sat on a Branch Reflecting on Existence, an absurdist black comedy featuring several loosely-connected scenes about death, is Certified Fresh at 89 percent.Love &amp; Mercy, starring Paul Dano and John Cusack in a biopic of Beach Boys leader Brian Wilson at two key intervals in his life, is Certified Fresh at 88 percent.An Open Secret, an expose of the sexual abuse of child actors, is at 86 percent.Testament Of Youth, starring Alicia Vikander and Kit Harington in a period drama about writer (and eventual peace activist) Vera Brittain and her work as a nurse during World War I, is Certified Fresh at 83 percent (check out Harington’s Five Favorite Films here).The Nightmare, a documentary/horror film featuring interviews with people who suffer from sleep paralysis, is at 69 percent.Hungry Hearts, starring Adam Driver in a drama about a young mother who is unusually overprotective of her newborn, is at 60 percent.Wild Horses, starring Robert Duvall and James Franco in a drama about a Texas Ranger whose estranged son returns in the midst of a cold case investigation, is at 11 percent.Freedom, starring Cuba Gooding Jr. in a period drama about a family that escapes slavery with help from the Underground Railroad, is at zero percent.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"TV, Walt, Masterpiece, X-Men, vampires, Marvel, boxoffice, Song, 45, Endgame, Set, Christmas, Fire","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/spy-meliss-mccarthy.jpg","slug":"critics-consensus-spy-is-certified-fresh"},{"id":"47508760498668","title":"Critics Consensus: Ant-Man Is Certified Fresh","content":"Critics Consensusvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Critics Consensus: Ant-Man Is Certified FreshPlus, Trainwreck gets big laughs, and Masters of Sex is Certified Fresh.by Tim Ryan | July 16, 2015 |  CommentsThis week at the movies, we’ve got a tiny superhero (Ant-Man, starring Paul Rudd and Michael Douglas) and a commitment-phobe (Trainwreck, starring Amy Schumer and Bill Hader). What do the critics have to say?Ant-Man 83%Guardians of the Galaxy proved that even Marvel’s second-string heroes could shine on the big screen. Critics say Ant-Man continues the trend — it’s an energetic, tongue-in-cheek caper flick that builds to a thrilling climax, even if it doesn’t deviate much from Marvel’s established template. Rudd stars as Scott Lang, an ex-con looking to go straight who’s recruited by the brilliant scientist Hank Pym (Michael Douglas) to execute a daring heist. Donning a suit that allows him to change size, Lang must iinfiltrate Pym’s old lab in order to ensure that a revolutionary technology doesn’t fall into the wrong hands. The pundits say the Certified Fresh Ant-Man‘s B-movie sensibility and Rudd’s puckish humor carry the day over the movie’s more conventional superhero elements. (Watch our video interviews with Rudd, Douglas, and co-stars Evangeline Lilly, Corey Stoll, Michael Pena, David Dastmalchian, T.I., and director Peyton Reed.)Trainwreck 84%Raucous, raunchy, and insightful, Inside Amy Schumer is TV sketch comedy that soars on its star’s irrepressible charisma. Critics say Schumer’s personality shines through in Trainwreck, a sharp romantic comedy that’s both laugh-out-loud funny and occasionally quite touching. Schumer stars as a hard-partying magazine writer who has spent her life avoiding romantic entanglements — until she meets Aaron (Bill Hader). He’s successful , he’s earnest, and he really, really likes her; can our heroine find it in herself to settle down? The pundits say the Certified Fresh Trainwreck gets many of its biggest laughs from its wide range of supporting players, but it’s ultimately Schumer who ties the whole thing together. (Check out our video interviews with Schumer and co-star Vanessa Bayer.)&nbsp;What’s On TV:True Detective : Season 2 (2015)  62%Though the final scene of True Detective‘s “Down Will Come” (52 percent) is spectacular, the events hardly feel earned after a brooding, clunky hour of storytelling.&nbsp;Masters of Sex: Season 3 (2015)  69%With a six-year leap forward in the timeline, season three of Masters of Sex (Certified Fresh at 76 percent) takes an intriguing dramatic turn, but may leave a few viewers feeling frustrated.&nbsp;Ray Donovan: Season 3 (2015)  77%Ray Donovan (77 percent) expands its canvas, delves deeper into its flawed characters, and grows more compelling as it goes along.&nbsp;Also opening this week in limited release:Court, an Indian legal drama about the labyrinthine trial of a political activist on trumped-up charges, is at 100 percent.The Look of Silence, a documentary about the survivors of the Indonesian killings of 1965-66 and a companion piece to The Act of Killing, is Certified Fresh at 95 percent.A Hard Day, a Korean thriller about a detective whose involvement in a hit-and-run becomes part of a tangled criminal investigation, is at 85 percent.Alleluia, a thriller about a man who enlists a lonely widow to join his criminal hustle, is at 85 percent.Mr. Holmes, starring Ian McKellen and Laura Linney in a drama about an aging Sherlock Holmes in deep rumination about an unsolved case, is at 83 percent (check out this week’s Total Recall, in which we count down McKellen’s best-reviewed films).The Stanford Prison Experiment, starring Billy Crudup and Ezra Miller in a fictional recreation of the infamous psychological study, is at 81 percent.Woody Allen‘s Irrational Man, starring Joaquin Phoenix and Emma Stone in a dramedy about a philosophy professor who devises a murder plot to help a student in need, is at 41 percent.Lila &amp; Eve, starring Viola Davis and Jennifer Lopez in a drama about a woman who vows to track down her son’s killers, is at 40 percent.The Ardor, starring Gael García Bernal and Alice Braga in a drama about a mysterious man who defends an Argentinean family from mercenaries who want their land, is at 28 percent.Jellyfish Eyes, an animated/live-action hybrid about a group of children who bond with fantastical monsters, is at 25 percent.Ooops!

What do the critics have to say?Straight Outta Compton (2015)  89%N.W.A.’s revolutionary blend of provocative lyrics, sophisticated production, and self-mythology continues to reverberate across the pop culture landscape. &nbsp;Critics say Straight Outta Compton is an energetic document of the distinct personalities (and social conditions) that made the group hip-hop royalty — without succumbing to hagiography. The film primarily focuses on wordsmith Ice Cube (Cube’s real-life son O’shea Jackson, Jr.), studio genius Dr. Dre (Corey Hawkins), and hustler-cum-rapper Eazy-E (Jason Mitchell), as they rise from Compton celebrities to controversial chart toppers before suffering at the hands of the music biz and personal acrimony. The pundits say Straight Outta Compton doesn’t stray too far from biopic conventions, but the performances, the settings, and (especially) the music are powerful enough to delight old fans and newcomers alike.The Man From U.N.C.L.E. (2015)  68%The world isn’t exactly hurting for stylish retro spy flicks (or remakes of old TV shows, for that matter), but critics say you could do a lot worse than The Man From U.N.C.L.E., a breezy, picturesque tale of intrigue with an attractive cast and a charming sense of humor. Two agents — American Napoleon Solo (Henry Cavill) and Soviet Illya Kuryakin (Armie Hammer) — team up to stop a mysterious criminal organization that threatens both nations.&nbsp; They get an assist from Gaby Teller (Alicia Vikander), an East German mechanic who has an inside track on how to infiltrate the gang. The pundits say The Man From U.N.C.L.E. isn’t in the same league as the Mission: Impossible movies, but director Guy Ritchie keeps things moving at a brisk pace, and the period clothes, sets, and vehicles provide plenty of vintage eye candy.What’s Hot on TVTrue Detective : Season 2 (2015)  62%In True Detective‘s second season, memorable moments and intriguing characters bump up against an inconsistent tone and an overabundance of plot threads.Strike Back: Legacy (2015)  93%Strike Back‘s final season promises a big finish fueled by compelling characters and sensational video game-style action.Difficult People: Season 1 (2015)  88%Difficult People makes the unlikable likable with mean-spirited, unhappy characters who still can’t help but amuse.Also&nbsp;Opening This Week In Limited Release Meru (2015) , a documentary about an attempt to scale one of India’s most treacherous peaks, is at 92&nbsp;percent.

Jordan); runaway livestock (the stop-motion animated feature Shaun the Sheep); a veteran rocker (Ricki and the Flash, starring Meryl Streep&nbsp;and Mamie Gummer); and a creepy acquaintance (The Gift, starring Jason Bateman&nbsp;and Rebecca Hall). What do the critics have to say?Fantastic Four (2015)  9%Pity the poor Fantastic Four. Marvel’s original superhero team has never been particularly well served on the big screen, and critics say that trend continues with Fantastic Four, a jumbled attempt to reboot the franchise that boasts talented actors stranded in an oddly morose, badly paced misfire. It’s yet another origin story: Reed Richards (Miles Teller) and his pals figure out how to teleport to another dimension, but after an ill-fated trip they all end up with superpowers — and make an enemy of the evil Dr. Doom. The pundits say that Fantastic Four has a few interesting ideas that are quickly pushed aside in favor of overripe dialogue, endless exposition, and so-so special effects.Shaun the Sheep Movie (2015)  99%The cheeky Brits over at Aardman Animations — the folks who brought you Wallace &amp; Gromit and Chicken Run — are masters of the witty, whimsical stop-motion comedy. However, critics say they may have topped themselves with Shaun the Sheep, an astonishing achievement that blends Chaplinesque silent-movie &nbsp;slapstick with a surfeit of hilarious visual gags. Shaun the Sheep encourages the rest of his flock to take a day off, which eventually leads to the disappearance of their owner into the big city. The sheep attempt to recover the farmer, and hilarity ensues. The pundits say the Certified Fresh Shaun the Sheep is truly inspired in its comic lunacy, and while some of the jokes might fly over the heads of the youngest viewers, it’s sure to enchant the whole family.Ricki And The Flash (2015)  65%Meryl Streep classes up everything she touches, so it’s a little surprising to see her play a down-and-dirty rocker in Ricki and the Flash. But critics say the film has a few more tricks up its sleeve — despite its shopworn premise, Ricki and the Flash offers enough great acting and toe tapping tunes to be a little more than just the same old song. Streep stars as a singer who ditched her family to chase musical stardom. But with her estranged daughter in the midst of a personal crisis, Ricki heads home in an attempt to heal old wounds. The pundits say Ricki and the Flash isn’t earth-shaking, but it’s energetic and raggedy enough to make its formulaic elements feel fresh.The Gift (2015)  91%If you’ve seen Warrior&nbsp;or The&nbsp;Great Gatsby, you know Joel Edgerton has a commanding screen&nbsp;presence. And critics say that if the chilling, intelligent thriller The&nbsp;Gift is any indication, he’s got a promising future behind the&nbsp;camera as well. Well-to-do Simon (Jason Bateman) has a seemingly chance&nbsp;encounter with Gordo (Edgerton), an old high school classmate. But Gordo starts&nbsp;showing up everywhere Simon goes, and leaving odd gifts at his house; is there&nbsp;something in their pasts that prompted such behavior? The pundits say&nbsp;The Gift is a deeply unnerving psychological drama that&nbsp;sustains its tension from beginning to end.What’s Hot On TV:Strike Back: Legacy (2015)  93%Strike Back‘s final season promises a big finish fueled by compelling characters and sensational video game-style action.Wet Hot American Summer: First Day of Camp (2015)  93%Wet Hot American Summer: First Day of Camp offers more of the the goofy hijinks that fans of the cult classic crave, but outsiders might not be quite as enamored.Also&nbsp;Opening This Week In Limited Release Two Step (2015) ,&nbsp;a noirish thriller about a down-on-his-luck man who gets ensnared by a con artist, is at 100 percent.

What do the critics have to say?Jurassic World 71%Upon its release in 1993, Jurassic Park set a new standard for onscreen technical wizardry and reasserted Steven Spielberg’s position as the king of blockbuster auteurs. Critics say Jurassic World is a notch or two below that benchmark, but it’s still a pretty fun ride thanks to its appealing (if underutilized) cast and its vast array of suitably terrifying dinosaurs. After a few years of operation, the dino refuge/theme park Jurassic World is losing attendance, so executives have demanded the on-site scientists to develop a bigger, badder creature from the genetic material of a T-rex and a bunch of other prehistoric animals. Will the newly christened Indominus rex drum up more business for the park? Will it eventually escape captivity and wreak havoc? The pundits say Jurassic World isn’t the deepest movie on earth, but it’s sleek, tense entertainment, and a big improvement over the previous Jurassic Park sequels. (Check out our video interviews with the stars; our list of Jurassic Park movies by Tomatometer; our gallery of the deadliest dinosaurs from movies and TV; and director Colin Trevorrow’s Five Favorite Films.)What’s On TV:Thanks to its blend of potent comedy and rich character work, Orange Is the New Black (86 percent) remains a bittersweet pleasure in its third season.Underscored by an especially heartwrenching moment and a spectacular display of power, “The Dance of Dragons” (88 percent) successfully delivers the shock and awe audiences have come to expect from the series’ penultimate episodes.Odd Mom Out (80 percent) should offer laughs to its niche target demographic, but will prove most enjoyable in small doses.Also opening this week in limited release:Every Last Child, a documentary about aid workers in Pakistan who attempt to inoculate children against polio in spite of heavy resistance from the Taliban, is at 100 percent.Me &amp; Earl &amp; the Dying Girl, starring Thomas Mann and Olivia Cooke in a drama about a high school loner who befriends a classmate with leukemia, is at 87 percent.The Yes Men Are Revolting, the latest documentary from the gonzo anti-corporate activist duo, is at 86 percent.The Wolfpack, a documentary about a group of sheltered siblings who learn about the outside world by watching movies, is at 73 percent.Set Fire To The Stars, starring Elijah Wood and Celyn Jones in a drama about a young poet who acts as a handler for the irrepressible Dylan Thomas on his first tour of the United States, is at 52 percent.Live From New York!, a documentary chronicling the 40-year history of Saturday Night Live, is at 48 percent.Madame Bovary, starring Mia Wasikowska and Rhys Ifans in an adaptation of Gustave Flaubert’s classic novel, is at 43 percent.The 11th Hour, starring Kim Basinger and Peter Stormare in a drama about a woman desperate to have a child, is at zero percent.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"monster, movies, New, Trek, kong, Quiz, target, motion, Land, Moore, french, Ice, ABC, die, teaser","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/jurassic-world.jpg","slug":"critics-consensus-jurassic-world-is-a-solid-thrill-ride"},{"id":"47508760489450","title":"Mission: Impossible Rogue Nation Is Certified Fresh","content":"Critics Consensusvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Mission: Impossible Rogue Nation Is Certified FreshPlus, Vacation doesn't measure up to the original, and I Am Cait is Certified Fresh.by Tim Ryan | July 30, 2015 |  CommentsThis week at the movies, we’ve got&nbsp;spies under siege (Mission: Impossible Rogue Nation, starring Tom Cruise&nbsp;and Rebecca Ferguson) and hapless road-trippers&nbsp;(Vacation, starring Ed Helms&nbsp;and Christina Applegate). What do the critics have to say?Mission: Impossible Rogue Nation (2015)  94%The recipe for a Mission: Impossible movie: take a bunch of interesting actors, add the latest in futuristic technology, throw in a death-defying Tom Cruise stunt or two, and voila! If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it, and critics say Mission: Impossible Rogue Nation is terrific popcorn entertainment that benefits immeasurably from energetic performances&nbsp;by Cruise and relative newcomer Rebecca Ferguson. The plot is the same as usual: the IMF is on the run from both the government and a shadowy band of bad guys. But the pundits say it’s that adherence to formula that helps to make the Certified Fresh Rogue Nation such a triumph — this is assured blockbuster filmmaking at its slickest and most pleasurable.Vacation (2015)  28%Few would claim that National Lampoon’s Vacation is a deathless cinematic masterpiece, but its deft balance of warmth and sustained zaniness have made it a perennial favorite. Critics say Vacation is unlikely to engender such fondness: a game cast keeps things watchable, but the film’s labored gags are often more cringe-inducing than funny. &nbsp;Ed Helms is the latest actor to portray Rusty Griswold, and the plot is basically the same as the original: the family hits the road for Walley World, and is met with wacky characters and bizarre humiliations along the way. The pundits say Vacation is good for a dumb chuckle or two, but it’s sour where the original was sweet.What’s Hot On TV:I Am Cait: Season 1 (2015)  86%I Am Cait aims for insight rather than exploitation, treating its subject with a respect that sets it apart from other reality programming.Wet Hot American Summer: First Day of Camp (2015)  93%Wet Hot American Summer: First Day of Camp offers more of the the goofy hijinks that fans of the cult classic crave, but outsiders might not be quite as enamored.Also&nbsp;Opening This Week In Limited Release Best Of Enemies (2015) , a documentary about the legendary televised debates between William F.

What do the critics have to say?Inside Out (2015)  98%Visually daring, narratively complex, technically groundbreaking: Pixar’s best work has been all this and more,&nbsp; redefining the term “family entertainment” in the process. Critics say Inside Out is another triumph for the studio, an audacious, funny, complex film that pulls off a seemingly impossible conceit. Riley is an 11-year-old girl whose family has relocated from Minnesota to San Francisco, and she’s struggling with her emotions, which are personified by a group of colorful avatars that live and work in her brain. But when Joy (voiced by Amy Poehler) and Sadness (Phyllis Smith) find themselves stuck in the recesses of her memory banks, Riley’s mental state becomes increasingly precarious. The pundits say the Certified Fresh Inside Out, with its energetic voice performances and breathtaking animation, can stand alongside Ratatouille, WALL-E, and Up&nbsp;as a superior example of Pixar’s advancement of the medium.&nbsp;(Check out our video interviews with the stars, along with our countdown of every Pixar movie by Tomatometer.)Dope (2015)  88%Dope flies in the face of summer movie conventions: it’s a Sundance-approved teen comedy with a cast of up-and-comers that confounds expectations at nearly every turn. Critics say the film is a breath of fresh air — it’s energetic and thoughtful, and it could prove to be a star-making vehicle for talented newcomer Shameik Moore.&nbsp; A bookworm whose taste for 1990s fashion and music makes him an outcast at school and in his neighborhood, Malcolm (Moore) dreams of getting accepted to Harvard. However, when he winds up in possession of&nbsp; a bag full of drugs, our hero must come up with a plan to unload the product without ending up in serious trouble. The pundits say Dope has occasional bumpy patches, but mostly, it’s an insightful, warm-hearted film that’s bursting with personality.What’s On TVGame of Thrones: Season 5 (2015)  93%“Mother’s Mercy” wraps up a particularly dark Game of Thrones season with a finale that delivers strong character work and and a handful of appropriately bleak cliffhangers.Jonathan Strange &amp; Mr. Norrell: Season 1 (2015)  92%Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell&nbsp;sets engaging performances against an enchanting canvas, even if some of the magic from the source material gets lost along the way.True Detective : Season 2 (2015)  62%True Detective‘s&nbsp;second season stands on its own as a solid police drama, with memorable moments and resonant relationships outweighing predictable plot twists.&nbsp;Also&nbsp;Opening This Week In Limited Release Hippocrates: Diary of a French Doctor (2015) , a black comedy about an idealistic young intern learning the ropes at a dysfunctional hospital, is at 100 percent. 3 And 1/2 Minutes, 10 Bullets (2015) , a documentary about the murder trial of a man who shot a teenager after a confrontation over loud music, is at 100 percent.

What do the critics have to say?\n\n\n        \n            \n                The Transporter Refueled (2015)  16%\n            \n            \n                \n            \n            \n              \nIt’s rare — though not unprecedented — &nbsp;for a movie franchise to successfully reboot without its signature star — take Mad Max, for example. Unfortunately, critics say The Transporter Refueled could really benefit from the presence of Jason Statham; without him, the caper plotline and occasionally decent stuntwork feel thoroughly generic. This time out, Frank Martin (Ed Skrein) is hired as a wheelman for a daring, mysterious heist; as insurance, his employers kidnap Martin’s father. Vehicular and bodily mayhem ensue. The pundits say The Transporter Refueled has all the trappings of a sleek action film and little of the spark, which doesn’t bode well for potential future entries in the series.\n\n            \n        \n\n\n        \n            \n                A Walk In The Woods (2015)  47%\n            \n            \n                \n            \n            \n              \nA Walk in the Woods sounds almost foolproof: take two great actors, and send them on a hike in a scenic locale. Critics say the film&nbsp;works best when it sticks to those basic elements, but it’s also padded with sitcommy gags and a bit too much schmaltz. Based on Bill Bryson’s bestseller, the film stars Redford as a man in the midst of an emotional malaise, so he enlists an old friend to join him for a hike of the Appalachian Mountain Trail, where they meet all sorts of interesting characters. The pundits say A Walk In The Woods is pleasant but predictable, ambling about without ever arriving at a truly memorable destination.\n\n            \n        \n\n&nbsp;What’s Hot on TV\n\n\n\n    \n        Mr. Robot: Season 1 (2015)  98%\n    \n    \n        \n    \n    \n      \nMr. Robot is a suspenseful cyber-thriller with timely stories and an intriguing, provocative premise.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        Narcos: Season 1 (2015)  80%\n    \n    \n        \n    \n    \n      \nNarcos lacks sympathetic characters, but pulls in the viewer with solid acting and a story that’s fast-paced enough to distract from its familiar outline.\n\n    \n\n\nAlso&nbsp;Opening This Week In Limited Release\n\n Elle L'adore (2015) , a black comedy about a woman whose obsession with a rock star gets her into serious trouble, is at 100 percent.\n A Sinner in Mecca (2015) ,&nbsp;a documentary about a gay Muslim on his pilgrimage, is at 100 percent.\n Blind (2015) , a drama about a recently-blinded novelist whose imaginative flights of fantasy quickly devolve into paranoia and fear, is at 97 percent.\n Creep (2015) , starring Mark Duplass in a thriller about a filmmaker who is hired to film a day in the life of a very eccentric man, is at 95 percent.\n The Black Panthers: Vanguard Of The Revolution (2015) , a documentary about the history of the radical civil rights organization, is at 95 percent.\n Dope (2015) , starring Shameik Moore and Zoë Kravitz in a comedy about a bookworm who winds up in possession of&nbsp; a bag full of drugs, is Certified Fresh at 87 percent.\n The Golden Dream (La Jaula De Oro) (2015) ,&nbsp;a drama about four Guatemalan teenagers making a dangerous trek through Mexico in order to emigrate to America, is at 89 percent.\n Steve Jobs: Man in the Machine (2015) , Alex Gibney‘s documentary portrait of the Apple founder, is at 73 percent.\n Break Point (2015) , starring Jeremy Sisto&nbsp;and J.K.

What do the critics have to say?Hot Pursuit 7%On paper, Hot Pursuit looks like a can’t-miss proposition: a buddy chase picture staring two capable comedic actresses. Unfortunately, critics say the film misses very badly indeed, stranding the likes of Reese Witherspoon and Sofía Vergara in a plot of startling laziness and predictability. Witherspoon plays Cooper, a straight-laced cop tasked with transporting Daniella Riva (Vergara) across Texas to testify in court against a big-time drug trafficker. Naturally, nothing goes according to plan, and soon the pair are being pursued by would-be assassins and corrupt cops. The critics say Hot Pursuit is a comic dead zone, stuffed with stereotypes and rote situations that fail to conjure much beyond a stray chuckle here and there. (Check out this week’s Total Recall, in which we take count down Witherspoon’s best-reviewed films, and watch our video interview with Witherspoon and Vergara.)The D Train 53%Part bromance, part drama, part farce, part cringe comedy, The D Train is nothing if not ambitious. Unfortunately, critics say it’s only partly successful in realizing its various aims, and the result is thought-provoking and well-acted but tonally inconsistent. Jack Black stars as Dan, a perpetual loser who ventures from Pennsylvania to Los Angeles in order to convince Oliver (James Marsden), a former classmate and moderately successful actor, to attend their high school reunion and burnish Dan’s reputation. After a few nights of hard partying, however, Dan discovers he’s gotten more than he bargained for. The pundits say Black and Marsden are both excellent, but the The D Train can’t quite find the perfect balance between moments of darkness and light.What’s On TV:““Formalized, Complex, and Costly” (83 percent) offers satisfying action and a good shock, though the season is developing more slowly than some might prefer.“All Happy Families Are Alike” (59 percent) brings season one of Gotham to a somewhat confusing conclusion, but some exciting twists hint at a promising, and hopefully more consistent, season two.Also opening this week in limited release:I Am Big Bird: The Caroll Spinney Story, a documentary about the man who plays the beloved Sesame Street character, is at 84 percent.1001 Grams, a comedy about a Norwegian scientist whose love life is in tatters as she journeys to Paris for a conference on the weight of a kilogram, is at 83 percent.The Seven Five, a documentary about a spectacularly corrupt New York City policeman, is at 80 percent.Noble, a based-on-true-events drama about an Irish woman who worked to shelter homeless children in Vietnam, is at 79 percent.The 100-Year-Old Man Who Climbed Out the Window and Disappeared, a comedy about a 100-year-old man who climbs out a window and disappears, is at 66 percent.5 Flights Up, starring Morgan Freeman and Diane Keaton in a dramedy about an aging couple in the process of selling their apartment, is at 63 percent.Maggie, starring Arnold Schwarzenegger and Abigail Breslin in a thriller about a father attempting to save his daughter from a zombie infection, is at 56 percent.Saint Laurent, a biopic of the famed fashion designer, is at 50 percent.Spike Island, a drama about members of a teenage rock band who attend a Stone Roses gig in order to give the group a demo tape, is at 48 percent.Playing It Cool, starring Chris Evans and Michelle Monaghan in a dramedy about an aging couple in the process of selling their apartment, is at 31 percent.Preggoland, a comedy about a woman who fakes a pregnancy and can’t come clean without ruffling feathers, is at 27 percent.Bravetown, starring Josh Duhamel and Laura Dern in a drama about a New York City teen and aspiring DJ who’s sent to live with his estranged father in a blue collar North Dakota town, is at 25 percent.Skin Trade, starring Dolph Lundgren and Tony Jaa in an action thriller about two guys on the trail of the head of a human trafficking cartel, is at 13 percent.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"nfl, LGBT","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/hot-pursuit.jpg","slug":"critics-consensus-hot-pursuit-is-a-comedy-clunker"},{"id":"47508762224123","title":"Critics Consensus: Furious 7 Is Certified Fresh","content":"Critics Consensusvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Critics Consensus: Furious 7 Is Certified FreshPlus, Helen Mirren elevates the otherwise heavy-handed Woman in Gold.by Tim Ryan | April 2, 2015 |  CommentsThis week at the movies, we’ve got just one wide release: Furious 7, the latest installment of the venerable action series starring starring Vin Diesel, Paul Walker, and Michelle Rodriguez. What do the critics have to say?Furious 7 82%The Fast and Furious movies have always delivered white-knuckle thrills. However, critics say what separates Furious 7 from the pack is its heart — without skimping on its patented gravity- and logic-defying action sequences, this new installment doubles as a poignant farewell to the late Paul Walker. If you care about the plot, here it is: rogue ex-secret agent Deckard Shaw (Jason Statham) seeks revenge on our heroes after they injured his brother in the previous film, and in turn, the gang teams up with the government to bring him down. Vehicular devastation ensues. The pundits say Furious 7‘s story is as silly as ever, but its energetic, over-the-top action will satisfy fans in the series — and might even win some converts. (Check out this week’s Total Recall, in which we count down the best and worst films of the Furious 7 stars.)What’s On TV:Critics say that Darren Star’s witty writing and Sutton Foster’s charisma help to elevate Younger (92 percent) above some of TV Land’s previous sitcoms.Pundits say that Bloodline (75 percent) remains an addictive, tightly drawn brainteaser framed on a believable canvas, even though its tricky timeline detracts from the potency of the story and its characters.Also opening this week in limited release:The Hand That Feeds, a documentary about a group of deli employees who attempt to form an independent union, is at 100 percent.The Girl Is In Trouble, a thriller about an aspiring DJ who gets caught up in the dangerous doings of Manhattan’s demimonde, is at 86 percent.Lambert &amp; Stamp, a documentary about two aspiring filmmakers who became instrumental in the rise of the Who, is at 83 percent.Ned Rifle, starring Aubrey Plaza and Parker Posey in the concluding chapter of Hal Hartley‘s Henry Fool/Fay Grim trilogy, is at 78 percent.Cheatin’, Bill Plympton‘s animated romantic comedy about a couple whose courtship goes awry in bizarre fashion, is at 73 percent.That Guy Dick Miller, a documentary portrait of the cult favorite B-movie actor, is at 73 percent.5 to 7, starring Anton Yelchin and Bérénice Marlohe in a romantic comedy about a passionate affair between a married woman and an aspiring writer, is at 68 percent.Boychoir, starring Dustin Hoffman and Kathy Bates in an inspirational drama about a troubled kid with a musical gift, is at 67 percent.Woman in Gold, starring Helen Mirren and Ryan Reynolds in a drama about a woman’s search for a priceless Klimt painting stolen from her family by the Nazis, is at 47 percent.Effie Gray, starring Dakota Fanning and Emma Thompson in a period drama about a young woman who makes a break from her loveless marriage, is at 42 percent.Cut Bank, starring Liam Hemsworth and Billy Bob Thornton in a drama about a small-town guy who witnesses a crime and tries to use it to his advantage, is at 36 percent.Electric Slide, starring Jim Sturgess and Chloë Sevigny in a drama based on the life of an astonishingly prolific bank robber, is at 14 percent.Last Knights, starring Clive Owen and Morgan Freeman in a period adventure film about a warrior who seeks revenge against a bloodthirsty tyrant, is at eight percent.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"Polls, YouTube, Sabrina, classics, singing, lee","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/furious-7-2.jpg","slug":"critics-consensus-furious-7-is-certified-fresh"},{"id":"47508762241535","title":"Critics Consensus: Chappie‘s Parts Don’t Quite Fit Together","content":"Critics Consensusvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Critics Consensus: Chappie's Parts Don't Quite Fit TogetherPlus, Unfinished Business misfires, The Second Best Exotic Marigold Hotel is a pleasant trifle, and American Crime is Certified Fresh.by Tim Ryan | March 5, 2015 |  CommentsThis week at the movies, we’ve got a conflicted robot (Chappie, starring Sharlto Copley and Dev Patel), traveling businessmen (Unfinished Busines, starring Vince Vaughn and Dave Franco), and spry seniors (The Second Best Exotic Marigold Hotel, starring Judi Dench and Maggie Smith). What do the critics have to say?Chappie 32%With District 9 and Elysium, director Neill Blomkamp established himself as a purveyor of action-packed sci-fi allegories. But critics say Chappie is a much less successful mix of pulp thrills and deep thoughts; its ideas take a backseat to its overstuffed, occasionally illogical plot. It’s 2016, and Johannesburg is policed by fearsome robots called scouts. Deon (Dev Patel), an artificial intelligence expert gets his hands on a dilapidated scout and tries to give the machine a conscience, but others want to use the bot — now christened Chappie (Sharlto Copley) — as a weapon of rebellion. The pundits say Chappie is ambitious and visually striking, but its message is a little too heavy-handed and its characters aren’t developed enough. (Click through our gallery of the most dangerous robots from movies and TV shows, and watch our video interviews with Copley and co-stars Hugh Jackman and Sigourney Weaver.)Unfinished Business 10%Take a ragtag trio, send them to an unfamiliar land, and what have you got? Unfinished Busines, which critics say is a startlingly unfunny and undisciplined comedy that strands its sharp cast in a lackadaisical narrative. Vaughn stars as a small business owner who treks to Berlin with his two underlings (Dave Franco and Tom Wilkinson) to close an important deal. But our heroes get sidetracked by a variety of distractions, and hilarity (allegedly) ensues. The pundits say Unfinished Business attempts to combine gross-out gags and farcical scenarios with heartfelt sentiment, and comes up empty on nearly all counts. (Check out Dave Franco’s Five Favorite Films here.)The Second Best Exotic Marigold Hotel 65%Like The Avengers for the senior set, The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel featured a murderer’s row of super-powered British acting talent. Most of the gang is back for The Second Best Exotic Marigold Hotel, and critics say that’s the main reason to recommend this predictable trifle — though its gorgeous setting is a close second. This time out, hotel managers Muriel (Maggie Smith) and Kapoor (Dev Patel) are looking to expand the business, while an American novelist (Richard Gere) takes up residence and various other occupants fall in and out of love. The pundits say The Second Best Exotic Marigold Hotel is cinematic comfort food — less substantial than its predecessor, but warm and appetizing nonetheless. (Watch our video interview with Dench here, and check out our countdown of her best-reviewed movies here.)What’s On TV:Critics say that raw, emotional portrayals of diverse characters in dire pain mashed up with chilling narratives and a gutsy attitude make American Crime (Certified Fresh at 100 percent) a must-see.The pundits say season two of Broadchurch (87 percent) builds on its predecessor’s intrigue, with the added bonus of new characters who mesh well with the existing cast.While stocked with impressive talent, CSI: Cyber (39 percent) fails to add anything truly new to the franchise, settling for a slightly modernized twist on the same typical crimefighting scenarios.Also opening this week in limited release:Buzzard, a dark comedy about a slacker who perpetrates a series of low-level cons, is at 95 percent.An Honest Liar, a documentary portrait of magician and skeptic James “The Amazing” Randi, is at 91 percent.Faults, starring Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Leland Orser in a thriller about a troubled man who attempts to deprogram a cult member, is at 87 percent.The Aussie import These Final Hours, a dramedy about a wild party on the eve of the apocalypse, is at 84 percent.Deli Man, a documentary about an innovative delicatessen in Houston, is at 80 percent.Merchants Of Doubt, a documentary about corporate-funded pundits who inject themselves into public debates as dispassionate experts, is at 79 percent.Two Men In Town, starring Forest Whitaker and Harvey Keitel in a drama about an ex-con who’s hounded by a small-town sheriff, is at 56 percent.Road Hard, starring Adam Carolla as a stand-up comedian attempting to jumpstart both his career and his personal life, is at 33 percent.October Gale, starring Patricia Clarkson and Scott Speedman in a thriller about a grieving woman and a man with a gunshot wound under siege in a remote cabin, is at 27 percent.Kidnapping Mr. Heineken, starring Anthony Hopkins and Jim Sturgess in a drama based on the true story of the brazen kidnapping of a brewery heir, is at 21 percent.Rufus, a drama about a lonely teenage vampire looking for love, is at 17 percent.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"Fox, CBS, TV, serial, Originals, universal, documentaries, Kemper, deadpool, play, ITV","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/chappie.jpg","slug":"critics-consensus-chappies-parts-dont-quite-fit-together"},{"id":"47508764032515","title":"Critics Consensus: The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge Out of Water Is Silly Fun","content":"Critics Consensusvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Critics Consensus: The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge Out of Water Is Silly FunPlus, Jupiter Ascending is pretty but incoherent, and Seventh Son is dismally dull.by Ryan Fujitani | February 5, 2015 |  Comments&nbsp;This week at the movies, we’ve got spunky sea creatures (The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge Out of Water, with voice work from Tom Kenny and Bill Fagerbakke), a would-be space queen (Jupiter Ascending, starring Mila Kunis and Channing Tatum), and a witch slayer (Seventh Son, starring Jeff Bridges and Julianne Moore). What do the critics have to say?The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge Out of Water 81%He lives in a pineapple under the sea, but this weekend, Nickelodeon’s favorite invertebrate in trousers will emerge from the ocean to the delight of children everywhere. Critics say The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge Out of Water is funny and should satisfy the faithful, but probably won’t win any new converts. In his second trip to the big screen, SpongeBob SquarePants (voiced by Tom Kenny) and his familiar cohorts are engaged in a war with Mr. Krabs’ (Clancy Brown) rival when the secret Krabby Patty recipe is stolen. Now they must pay a visit to the surface world and confront an evil pirate (Antonio Banderas) to retrieve it. The pundits say The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge Out of Water is gleefully zany and packed with goofy gags, even if it all feels a bit familiar and calculated to appeal to existing fans.Jupiter Ascending 27%No one can deny that Andy and Lana Wachowski have a certain flair for eye-popping spectacle, and according to critics, their latest sci-fi effort, Jupiter Ascending, is no exception; if only they had developed a more cohesive story to frame all those pretty visuals. Mila Kunis stars as Jupiter Jones, a sad, unlucky janitor who discovers she’s intergalactic royalty when an alien bounty hunter (Channing Tatum) swoops into her life to whisk her into space. Jupiter soon finds herself thrust in the middle of an alien sibling power struggle, with her life and the fate of the Earth hanging in the balance. The pundits say Jupiter Ascending is a marvel to behold on the big screen, but its muddled narrative fails to match the execution of its impressive special effects. (Check out this week’s 24 Frames gallery of epic sci-fi films.)Seventh Son 12%Even Oscar contenders (and winners) star in a dud every once in a while, but rarely is the failure as epic as Seventh Son, a supernatural fantasy that critics say strands its capable cast in a flashy but derivative and exceedingly dull battle between good and evil. Jeff Bridges stars as Master Gregory, a witch-hunting knight who takes on farmboy Tom Ward (Ben Barnes) as a new apprentice when Mother Malkin (Julianne Moore), the sinister sorceress he once imprisoned, escapes and decides to unleash her vengeance upon the world. Will Gregory train his new pupil quickly enough to battle the forces of dark magic effectively? The pundits say Seventh Son is full of sound and fury that signifies nothing, topped by a couple of silly performances from otherwise first-class actors, and the final result is far more lifeless than it should be. (Check out this week’s Total Recall, in which we look back at Bridges’ 10 best-reviewed films.)What’s Hot On TV:Critics say Better Call Saul (100 percent) is a quirky, dark character study that manages to stand on its own without being overshadowed by the series that spawned it.Critics say once the cliched gags of Fresh off the Boat (Certified Fresh at 88 percent) are superceded by a grounded truthfulness, the series evolves into a humorously charming family sitcom.Thanks to a liberal dose of propulsive, bloody action and enough compelling character moments to reward longtime fans, The Walking Dead‘s (Certified Fresh at 97 percent) fifth season continues to deliver top-notch entertainment.Also opening this week in limited release:Matt Shepard Is a Friend of Mine, a documentary chronicling the life of the gay University of Wyoming student who was beaten to death in 1998, is at 100 percent.1971, a documentary about the group of citizens who broke into an FBI office and exposed the agency’s illegal surveillance program in 1971, is at 92 percent.Ballet 422, a documentary depicting life in the world of the New York City Ballet, is at 86 percent.Marjane Satrapi‘s The Voices, starring Ryan Reynolds and Gemma Arterton in a dark comedy about a serial killer who talks to his pets, is at 79 percent.Enter the Dangerous Mind, starring Gina Rodriguez and Jake Hoffman in a psychological thriller about an unstable electronic musician who falls for a woman he fears might publicly ridicule him after a failed intimate encounter, is at 30 percent.Love, Rosie, starring Lily Collins and Sam Claflin in a romantic comedy about childhood friends who spend their lives repeatedly flirting with the idea of a relationship together, is at 24 percent.Mad as Hell, a documentary profile of Cenk Uygur, the outspoken founder of The Young Turks online news program, is at 22 percent.Outcast, starring Nicolas Cage and Hayden Christensen in a medieval action-adventure about a fugitive prince and the crusader who protects him from assassination, is at 17 percent.Finally, props to Andrew LaPlant and Alex Meyer for coming the closest to The Loft‘s 10 percent Tomatometer.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"Century, Geo, Family, composers, Mystery, directors","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"critics-consensus-the-spongebob-movie"},{"id":"47508762227197","title":"Critics Consensus: Insurgent is a Muddled Mess","content":"Critics Consensusvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Critics Consensus: Insurgent is a Muddled MessPlus, The Gunman misses the mark, and iZombie and Community are Certified Fresh.by Tim Ryan | March 19, 2015 |  CommentsThis week at the movies, we’ve got a rebellious teen (Insurgent, starring Shailene Woodley and Kate Winslet) and a repentant assassin (The Gunman, starring Sean Penn and Javier Bardem). What do the critics have to say?Insurgent 28%Shailene Woodley is well on her way to becoming one of Hollywood’s brightest stars. However, critics say there’s only so much she can do to save Insurgent, a middling middle chapter with frenetic action sequences but little narrative cohesion or character development. This time out, Tris (Woodley) and her fellow Divergents are on the run from evil overlord Jeanine Matthews (Kate Winslet), who wants to exterminate the rebels and take control of futuristic Chicago’s various factions. The pundits say Insurgent is a definite step back for the franchise, as its excessive violence and confusing story overwhelm a terrific cast. (Watch our video interview with Woodley and co-stars Theo James, Miles Teller, Ansel Elgort, and Octavia Spencer, and click through our gallery of young adult novels that have been adapted to film.)The Gunman 16%The veteran actor-shooting-people action subgenre is all the rage these days, and The Gunman has two things to set it apart from the pack: geopolitics and Sean Penn. Unfortunately, critics say it’s pretty generic otherwise, with a predictable plot and a shortage of energy. Years after carrying out a hit in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Jim Terrier (Penn) is working for a humanitarian organization when he discovers he’s the target of a shadowy organization — and that his ex has fallen into its clutches. The pundits say The Gunman benefits greatly from its scenic locations, but otherwise, this is a so-so thriller that doesn’t live up to its lofty ambitions. (Check out Penn’s best-reviewed films here.)What’s On TV:Despite cast and broadcast changes, Community (Certified Fresh at 91 percent) manages to remain at the top of its quirky class.An amusing variation on the zombie trend, iZombie (Certified Fresh at 90 percent) is refreshingly different, if perhaps too youth-oriented to resonate with adult audiences.Also opening this week in limited release:Metalhead, a dramedy about a girl who immerses herself in heavy metal as a way of dealing with the death of her older brother, is at 100 percent.Spring, starring Lou Taylor Pucci in a horror film about an American backpacker who strikes up a relationship with an Italian woman who’s harboring a shocking secret, is at 95 percent.Amour Fou, a drama about writer Heinrich von Kleist and his attempt to get a society woman to join him in a suicide pact, is at 94 percent.Kumiko, the Treasure Hunter, starring Rinko Kikuchi in a drama about a woman who leaves behind her life in Japan to search for the buried cash in Fargo, is Certified Fresh at 89 percent.Backcountry, a thriller about a couple that gets lost while hiking in the remote Canadian wilderness, is at 83 percent.Jauja, starring Viggo Mortensen in a period drama about a Danish engineer who goes searching for his daughter after she runs off with a soldier, is at 78 percent.She’s Lost Control, a drama about a sex surrogate whose life is thrown into disarray when she gets too close to one of her clients, is at 75 percent.Zombeavers, a horror comedy about three friends vacationing at remote cabin who are menaced by the title creatures, is at 60 percent.Danny Collins, starring Al Pacino and Christopher Plummer in a dramedy about a veteran rocker who decides to change his ways after discovering a long-lost letter from a music legend, is at 61 percent.Tracers, starring Taylor Lautner in an action flick about a crew of thieves who use their parkour skills for a series of daring heists, is at 14 percent.Growing Up and Other Lies, starring Adam Brody and Amber Tamblyn in a comedy about a group of millennials who walk across Manhattan while discussing the state of their lives, is at 14 percent.David O.

What do the critics have to say?The Longest Ride 31%Films based on Nicholas Sparks novels are reliable fodder for critical brickbats — and reliably strong performers at the box office. Critics say the latest Sparks adaptation, The Longest Ride, is somewhat better than most, thanks to its appealing leads and director George Tillman Jr.s’ assured direction; otherwise, it’s sappy, weepy business as usual. Luke (Scott Eastwood) is a bull rider who lives on the edge, while Sophia (Britt Robertson) is an artsy gal who dreams of the big city. Their budding relationship is solidified when they meet an older man (Alan Alda) with a heartbreaking past that makes our young heroes reflect on what they want in their lives. The pundits say The Longest Ride is the cinematic equivalent of a beach read: heavy-handed, occasionally diverting, and ultimately forgettable. (Check out Sparks’ Five Favorite Films here.)Danny Collins 78%Even if his recent track record has been spotty, no one would argue that Al Pacino ranks among the finest actors in cinema history. Critics say Pacino is the main reason to see Danny Collins, but a fine supporting cast also helps to elevate this likeable dramedy above its relatively predictable plotting. Pacino stars as Collins, an aging pop star on the downside of his career whose life is changed when he discovers a long-lost letter sent to him by John Lennon. His spirit reinvigorated, Collins attempts to mend his frayed relationships with family and friends. The pundits say Danny Collins occasionally veers into schmaltzy territory, but Pacino and his co-stars are so compelling that it’s hard to resist.What’s On TV:Bloody action and extreme power plays return full throttle, as Game of Thrones (100 percent) enjoys a new-found liberation from the world of the source material, resulting in more unexpected thrills.“Severance” (98 percent), presents the age-old dilemma of human fulfillment, setting the stage for a final season layered with the big questions asked by Mad Men‘s beloved characters.The finale to the first season of Better Call Saul (86 percent) delivers a payoff that is at once comic and tragic, as Jimmy’s conversion to Saul nears completion.Also opening this week in limited release:The Iranian import About Elly, a tense drama in which a woman mysteriously disappears during a vacation on the Caspian Sea, is at 100 percent.Black Souls, an Italian drama about long-simmering conflicts between family members involved in organized crime, is at 92 percent.Ex Machina, starring Domhnall Gleeson and Alicia Vikander in a sci-fi thriller about a computer wiz who’s tasked with testing the artificial intelligence of a remarkably lifelike robot, is Certified Fresh at 88 percent.The Sisterhood Of Night, a drama about a group of teenage girls who get caught up in a community-wide witch hunt, is at 88 percent.Clouds of Sils Maria, starring Juliette Binoche and Kristen Stewart in a drama about an actress struggling with constant reminders of her advanced age, is Certified Fresh at 87 percent.Dior and I, a documentary about the fashion brand and its transition to a new artistic director, is at 81 percent.Desert Dancer, starring Freida Pinto in a drama based on the true story of an underground dance troupe that formed during the strife that followed 2009 Iranian election, is at 44 percent.Broken Horses, starring Anton Yelchin as a man trying to rescue his brother from the clutches of a drug gang, is at 29 percent.Ryan Gosling‘s Lost River, starring Christina Hendricks and Saoirse Ronan in a drama/fantasy about a financially strapped family trying to survive in magic realist Detroit, is at 23 percent.Kill Me Three Times, starring Simon Pegg and Alice Braga in a comedy/thriller about an assassin who gets caught up in a series of convoluted criminal plots, is at eight percent.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"20th, Globe, league, all-time, X-Men, 2019, Universal, awards, fresh, HBO, Awards, Discovery, monster","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/longest-ride.jpg","slug":"critics-consensus-the-longest-ride-is-a-bumpy-journey"},{"id":"47508764050952","title":"Critics Consensus: The Woman in Black 2: Angel of Death Looks Great But Lacks Scares","content":"Critics Consensusvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Critics Consensus: The Woman in Black 2: Angel of Death Looks Great But Lacks ScaresPlus, A Most Violent Year is an intelligent, immersive drama.by Tim Ryan | January 1, 2015 |  CommentsHappy New Year! This week at the movies, we’ve got just one wide release: The Woman in Black 2: Angel of Death, a period frightfest starring Phoebe Fox and Jeremy Irvine). What do the critics have to say?The Woman in Black 2: Angel of Death 23%The Woman in Black 2: Angel of Death has two strikes against it right off the bat: it’s a sequel, and it’s being released during the first weekend of the new year, which is traditionally a dumping ground for middling movies. Critics say this one is better than most, but although the film is atmospheric and visually sharp, it’s never particularly scary. It’s 1941, and a group of children have been relocated to an English country house to escape the London Blitz. But when several of the children go missing, their caretakers suspect a malevolent spirit may be responsible. The pundits say The Woman in Black 2: Angel of Death looks terrific, but it’s vaguely unsettling rather than tense.What’s Hot on TV:The pundits say The Missing (Certified Fresh at 96 percent) turns a routine premise into a standout thriller, thanks to heartfelt, affecting performances.Also opening this week in limited release:A Most Violent Year, starring Jessica Chastain and Oscar Isaac in a drama about a heating oil supplier whose business is attacked by an unknown rival, is Certified Fresh at 93 percent.The Search For General Tso, a documentary about the history behind the popular Chinese dish, is at 89 percent.[REC] 4: Apocalypse, the fourth installment of the Spanish horror franchise about the fallout from a deadly viral outbreak, is at 71 percent.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"media, Review, TV, politics, dc, movies, Family, Golden, 007, quibi, technology","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Critics-Consensus-The-Woman-in-Black-2-Angel-of-Death-Looks-Great-But-Lacks-Scares"},{"id":"47508765584914","title":"Critics Consensus: John Wick is Certified Fresh","content":"Critics Consensusvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Critics Consensus: John Wick is Certified FreshPlus, Ouija is dull, 23 Blast is earnest but predictable; and new episodes of The Walking Dead and Sons of Anarchyby Tim Ryan | October 22, 2014 |  CommentsThis week at the movies, we’ve got an avenging hitman (John Wick, starring Keanu Reeves and Adrianne Palicki), a bedeviled board (Ouija, starring Olivia Cooke and Douglas Smith), and an inspirational gridiron tale (23 Blast, starring Mark Hapka and Alexa Vega). What do the critics have to say?John Wick 86%He’s taken some lumps over the years, but when it comes right down to it, Keanu Reeves is one of our most dependable action stars. Time will tell if John Wick will join Speed and The Matrix in the action movie pantheon, but critics say this is a stylish, briskly-paced thriller with terrific fight scenes and some sly humor. Reeves stars as a retired hitman reeling from the death of his wife when mob-affiliated hoods break into his house and kill his dog. Soon, our hero is back in the game — and practically every gangster in town is in fear for his life. The pundits say the Certified Fresh John Wick is the kind of muscular, full-throttle action flick that’s made with such skill and energy you’ll barely notice how thin the plot is. (Watch our video interview with Reeves.)Ouija 6%Ah, the mysterious Ouija board. Imbued with alleged occult powers, it’s been used to add spice to plenty of frightfests over the years, from 13 Ghosts to The Exorcist to Paranormal Activity. Now, everybody’s favorite board is ready for its close-up, but critics say Ouija fails to conjure much excitement aside from a few jump-scares. When a teenager dies in an accident, her friends attempt to contact her in the great beyond, awaking a malevolent spirit in the process. The pundits say Ouija is competently made but thoroughly bland and decidedly short on creepiness.23 Blast 36%Made with the best of intentions and based upon a remarkable true story, 23 Blast would seem to have all the pieces in place to wring tears from even the most hardened pigskin fans. Unfortunately, critics say the movie could use a lesson in clock management; despite fine acting from a group of seasoned pros, the film’s narrative is a little too slack. Travis Freeman (Mark Hapka) is a high school football player who loses his vision from an inflammation of meningitis, but with the help of his family and friends, he eventually returns to the field. The pundits say 23 Blast has a nice sense of place and a few touching moments, but it’s awfully predictable.Certified Fresh on TV:After a rollicking, action-packed premiere,&nbsp;The Walking Dead&nbsp;mellowed out a bit for its second episode; critics say “Strangers”(100 percent) settles into a&nbsp;more deliberate, dialogue-heavy groove while still maintaining suspense.&nbsp;Critics were mixed (but mostly positive) for the latest episode of&nbsp;Sons of Anarchy, saying that while it relied too heavily on brutal plot twists for effect, saying goodbye to a&nbsp;familiar face gives “Greensleeves”(70 percent) some emotional weight.Also opening this week in limited release:The Heart Machine, an indie thriller about a Manhattanite who suspects his long-distance girlfriend may be&nbsp;catfishing him, is at 100 percent.Citizenfour,&nbsp;a documentary about NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden, is Certified Fresh at 98 percent.Force Majeure , a black comedy about a Swedish family on a ski trip in the Alps dealing with the fallout from a&nbsp;powerful avalanche, is at 97 percent.1,000 Times Good Night , starring Juliette Binoche and Nikolaj Coster-Waldau in a drama about an idealistic war photographer whose family fears for her safety, is at 65 percent.Laggies, starring&nbsp;Keira Knightley and&nbsp;Chloe Grace Moretz&nbsp;in a drama about an aimless woman in her late 20s who befriends a teenager as an escape from adult&nbsp;responsibility, is at 62 percent.Stonehearst Asylum, starring&nbsp;Kate Beckinsale and&nbsp;Ben Kingsley in a period thriller about a young doctor who&nbsp;discovers the inmates are literally running the asylum, is at 57 percent.White Bird in a Blizzard, starring Shailene Woodley and&nbsp;Eva Green in a dark dramedy about a teenager’s response&nbsp;to the disappearance of her overbearing mother, is at 53 percent.Alain Resnais‘ Life of Riley, a drama about a group of close friends dealing with the news that one member of their circle has a terminal illness, is at 50 percent.Exists, a found-footage horror film about a group of friends trying to find evidence of&nbsp;Bigfoot while on vacation in rural Texas, is at 29 percent.Low Down, starring&nbsp;John Hawkes and&nbsp;Elle Fanning&nbsp;in a drama about a heroin-addicted jazz pianist and his daughter, is at 18 percent.Revenge of the Green Dragons,&nbsp;a thriller about a gang member who targets his old comrades after a love affair goes wrong,&nbsp;is at 14 percent.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"Disney+, Academy, technology, on","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"critics-consensus-john-wick-is-certified-fresh"},{"id":"47508764081680","title":"Critics Consensus: Interstellar and Big Hero 6 are Certified Fresh","content":"Critics Consensusvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Critics Consensus: Interstellar and Big Hero 6 are Certified FreshPlus, The Theory of Everything is smart and well-acted, and we tell you what's Fresh on TV.by Tim Ryan | November 6, 2014 |  CommentsThis week at the movies, we’ve got a perilous space mission (Interstellar, starring Matthew McConaughey and Anne Hathaway) and a boy and his robot (Big Hero 6, featuring voice performances by Ryan Potter and Scott Adsit). What do the critics have to say?Interstellar 72%Many have tried, but few have approached 2001: A Space Odyssey‘s heady mix of philosophical depth and space adventure (though last year’s Gravity had its moments). Director Christopher Nolan is clearly gunning for the sci-fi pantheon with Interstellar, and while critics say the movie is loaded with ambition and jaw-dropping visuals, its plot is sometimes a muddle. In the not-too-distant future, Earth is on the verge of becoming uninhabitable. Coop (Matthew McConaughey) a former test pilot, is recruited for a risky mission to find another planet that might be able to sustain human life. The pundits say the Certified Fresh Interstellar veers between brilliance and bombast, but its best moments approximate a sense of awe that recalls Andrei Tarkovsky‘s’s Solaris. (Check out this week’s Total Recall, in which we count down McConaughey’s best-reviewed films, as well as our interviews with the stars.)Big Hero 6 90%Does the world need another superhero origin story? If it’s as lively as Big Hero 6, then the answer is yes; critics say this colorful, beautifully-crafted animated film scores on the strength of its distinctive setting, heartfelt story, and its loveable robotic hero, the puffy, literal-minded Baymax. Hiro Hamada is a pre-teen science geek whose older brother has invented an inflatable healthcare robot. However, tragedy strikes, and Hiro, Baymax, and a ragtag group of nerds must team up to save the city. The pundits say the Certified Fresh Big Hero 6 isn’t particularly original, but it’s briskly-paced, action-packed, and often touching. (Check out Baymax’s Five Favorite Films here.)What’s Fresh on TV:Critics say that Olive Kitteridge (Certified Fresh at 95 percent) lives up to its compelling source material, thanks to fascinating performances from the likes of Frances McDormand, Richard Jenkins, and Bill Murray.Despite a familiar Cold War spy template, critics say The Game (100 percent) has enough style, intelligence, and twists to be worth playing.Also opening this week in limited release:Actress, a documentary portrait of The Wire star Brandy Burre and her attempt to get back into showbiz, is at 100 percent.Pelican Dreams, a documentary about the rehabilitation of an injured pelican, is at 100 percent.Frederick Wiseman‘s National Gallery, a documentary about London’s eminent art museum, is at 95 percent.The Brazilian import The Way He Looks, a coming-of-age drama about a blind teenager in love, is at 94 percent.The Theory of Everything, starring Eddie Redmayne and Felicity Jones in a biopic of celebrated astrophysicist Stephen Hawking in his 20s, is at 82 percent.Why Don’t You Play in Hell?, a gonzo action flick about a group of young filmmakers who get caught up in a mob war, is at 79 percent.Plot for Peace, a documentary about the behind-the-scenes machinations that led to the fall of Apartheid in South Africa, is at 71 percent.Mr. Pip, starring Hugh Laurie as an Englishman teaching Charles Dickens to the children of a South Pacific island in the midst of war, is at 54 percent.Open Windows, starring Elijah Wood and Sasha Grey in a thriller about a hacker who manipulates an overzealous fan into cyberstalking his favorite actress, is at 47 percent.21 Years: Richard Linklater, a documentary about the indie film legend, is at 44 percent.The Better Angels, starring Diane Kruger and Jason Clarke in a meditative drama about Abraham Lincoln’s early life, is at 42 percent.Jessabelle, a horror film about a woman who returns to her Louisiana home to recover from an accident and discovers she’s being haunted by a malevolent spirit, is at 29 percent.Elsa &amp; Fred, starring Shirley MacLaine and Christopher Plummer a romantic comedy about two mismatched seniors who find love, is at 20 percent.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"Fox, drama, crime, Series, Netflix, Awards, Bros., shows, DC, HBO, Crackle, Britbox, Martial","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"critics-consensus-interstellar-and-big-hero-6-are-certified-fresh"},{"id":"47508764069387","title":"Critics Consensus: Exodus: Gods and Kings Fails to Reach the Promised Land","content":"Critics Consensusvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Critics Consensus: Exodus: Gods and Kings Fails to Reach the Promised LandPlus, Top Five is Certified Fresh, and Sons of Anarchy ties up loose ends in a satisfying fashion.by Tim Ryan | December 11, 2014 |  CommentsThis week at the movies, we’ve got a Biblical epic (Exodus: Gods and Kings, starring Christian Bale and Joel Edgerton) and a conflicted comedian (Top Five, starring Chris Rock and Rosario Dawson). What do the critics have to say?Exodus: Gods and Kings 31%It’s got a daring escape from slavery, the parting of the Red Sea, the unveiling of the Ten Commandments, and a literal river of blood — yep, the Book of Exodus is certainly one of the Old Testament’s most action-packed installments. Unfortunately, critics say that while Exodus: Gods and Kings director Ridley Scott mostly succeeds in crafting an eye-popping spectacle, he fails to bring the story’s legendary people to vivid life. You probably know the story, but if not, here goes: the orphaned Moses (Christian Bale) was raised by the Pharaoh, but he’s cast out when it’s discovered that his parents were Jewish. God reveals to Moses that he’s been chosen to lead the Israelites out of Egypt, but first he must free his people before undertaking an epic trek across the desert. The pundits say Exodus: Gods and Kings mostly avoids taking a theological stand on the story, but as a result the film’s spectacular visuals overwhelm the heat and passion this oft-told tale continues to evoke. (Watch our video interviews with Scott and stars Bale, Joel Edgerton, and Aaron Paul, and check out this week’s Total Recall, in which we count down co-star Sigourney Weaver’s best-reviewed films.)Top Five 85%Few would deny that Chris Rock is one of the best standup comedians of his generation — or that, for the most part, his movie career has left something to be desired. That’s about to change, as critics say Top Five represents a career peak for Rock as a director and actor — it’s a semi-autobiographical portrait of the artist as a neurotic that recalls Woody Allen at his best. Rock plays Andre Allen, a popular comic actor who’s about to be married to a famous reality TV star. He agrees to be profiled by a New York Times reporter (Rosario Dawson), and as they stroll about the city, Allen begins to question the decisions he’s made in his life and career. The pundits say the Certified Fresh Top Five is blessed with palpable chemistry between its leads, and the result is timely, insightful, and often hilarious. (Watch our video interviews with Rock and co-stars Anders Holm, Ben Vereen, and JB Smoove.)What’s Hot on TV:Critics say the final episode of Sons of Anarchy is, like the series itself, both twisty and turbulent, but ultimately, “Papa’s Goods” (87 percent) is a fitting farewell to the SAMCRO gang that ties up loose ends in an involving, poetic fashion.The penultimate episode of HBO’s The Newsroom, “Oh Shenandoah,” stirred up a lot of internet chatter this week, and much of it was negative; critics objected to everything from a subplot on campus rape to the unprompted death of a major character.Also opening this week in limited release:Maidan, an on-the-ground documentary about political upheaval in Ukrane, is at 100 percent.Little Feet, a drama about two siblings who trek across Los Angeles to return their goldfish to the ocean, is at 80 percent.We Are The Giant, a documentary about six protesters from different countries who participated in the Arab Spring uprising, is at 77 percent.Paul Thomas Anderson‘s Inherent Vice, starring Joaquin Phoenix and Josh Brolin in a far-out shaggy dog story featuring a disparate group of Angelinos and a convoluted kidnapping plot, is at 73 percent.Magician: The Astonishing Life and Work of Orson Welles, a documentary about the great director and actor, is at 69 percent.Six Dance Lessons In Six Weeks, starring Gena Rowlands and Cheyenne Jackson in a comedy about a woman who strikes up a friendship with her younger dance instructor, is at 67 percent.After The Fall, starring Wes Bentley and Vinessa Shaw in a drama about a financially strapped insurance salesman who turns to a life of crime, is at 57 percent.Tip Top, starring Isabelle Huppert in a comedy/thriller about two female detectives investigating the murder of a confidential informant, is at 38 percent.The Captive, starring Ryan Reynolds and Mireille Enos in a thriller about a man on a desperate search for his missing daughter, is at 29 percent.Free the Nipple, a comedy about a group of women who make a very public statement about gender equality, is at 20 percent.The Color of Time, starring James Francoe and Jessica Chastain in a cinematic essay based on the work of poet C.K.

What do the critics have to say?Strange Magic 18%On paper, an animated musical inspired by A Midsummer Night’s Dream sounds reasonably promising. Unfortunately, critics say Strange Magic could use a whole lot more pixie dust — along with visual inspiration and interesting characters. It’s the story of Marianne (voiced by Evan Rachel Wood), a fairy princess who’s been jilted by her Prince Charming. The cad then discovers a love potion, which sets off a series of battles and daring rescues. The pundits say Strange Magic is oddly charmless, and its few clever ideas are smothered by a plot that’s both patchwork and overly busy.Mortdecai 12%What’s the deal with Johnny Depp? With the exception of the animated Rango, the man who was once the biggest star in Hollywood hasn’t had a critically approved starring vehicle since Public Enemies in 2009. The critics say Mortdecai is a stunning misfire, a tonally-jarring would-be caper comedy that reduces its talented cast to broad, goofy caricatures. Depp is Charlie Mortdecai, a mustachioed, anachronistic rogue who’s tasked with recovering a stolen Goya painting; hilarity, in the form of pratfalls and double-entendres, ensues. The pundits say Mortdecai is visually sharp but comically dull; it’s an attempt at satire that seems unsure of what exactly it’s lampooning. (Check out this week’s 24 Frames for a gallery of Johnny Depp’s wildest looks through the years.)The Boy Next Door 12%The divide between trashy fun and plain ol’ trash is often razor thin. Critics say The Boy Next Door falls on the wrong side of the line, promising campy thrills that it can’t ultimately deliver. Jennifer Lopez stars as a high school English teacher who’s taking a break from her husband when she has a tryst with a teenager. Naturally, he becomes obsessed and possessive, threatening our heroine’s security and peace of mind. The pundits say The Boy Next Door simmers but never reaches full boil, so its silly dialogue and ludicrous plotting are never quite as entertaining as they could be.

This week at the movies, we’ve got unlikely CIA operatives (The Interview, starring Seth Rogen and James Franco), a resilient war hero (Unbroken, starring Jack O’Connell and Domhnall Gleeson), an indebted English professor (The Gambler, starring Mark Wahlberg and John Goodman), fractured fairy tale characters (Into the Woods, starring Meryl Streep and Anna Kendrick), and a subjugated artist (Big Eyes, starring Amy Adams and Christoph Waltz). What do the critics have to say?The Interview 51%Look, we know you’ve probably heard all about how The Interview sparked an international incident. Now that it’s popping up online and in a few theaters, it’s fair to ask: is it any good? Well, critics say The Interview is pretty funny in spots, but its tone is more sophomoric than politically astute. Dave Skylark (James Franco), the host of a trashy talk show, and his producer Aaron Rapoport (Seth Rogen) land the biggest interview of their careers: North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un (Randall Park). But before they journey to Pyongyang, the CIA recruits them to assassinate the Dear Leader. The pundits say The Interview works better as a bromance than as a political farce, and while the cast (especially Park) gives its all, the movie ultimately falls short as a satire of international relations and the media.Unbroken 51%The life of Louis “Louie” Zamperini seems tailor-made for a big-budget biopic. Unfortunately, not every great story makes for a great movie, and critics say that’s sadly the case for director Angelina Jolie‘s Unbroken, a well-meaning, occasionally stirring epic that suffers from conventional storytelling and a lack of tension. Zamperini (Jack O’Connell) was a track star who served in World War II, where he survived a plane crash by clinging to a raft for more than a month before being captured by Japanese troops and held in a prisoner of war camp for more than two years. He’s undoubtedly heroic, but Unbroken frequently feels too similar to other inspirational war films.The Gambler 44%Plenty of contemporary films borrow from the gritty imagery and moral ambiguity of mid-1970s thrillers, so a remake of The Gambler sounds like a solid bet. However, critics say that this slick, well-acted film never fully lures the audience into its protagonist’s plight. Mark Wahlberg stars as Jim Bennett, a self-destructive English professor whose gambling habit could cost him his fortune — and that of his family. Bennett turns to a loan shark for help, but he continues to sink into a hole, with potentially dire consequences. The pundits say The Gambler is slick and reasonably tense, but it lacks the existential moodiness of the classic crime flicks that inspired it.Into the Woods 71%The time seems right for a big-screen adaptation of Stephen Sondheim’s Into the Woods, a meta-musical that deconstructed fairy tales long before Frozen or Once Upon a Time. Critics say Rob Marshall mostly does right by the play, maintaining its dark spirit and bringing an imaginative touch to the sets and costumes (though it’s still a little on the long side). A mashup of Cinderella, Jack And The Beanstalk, Little Red Riding Hood, and Rapunzel, Into the Woods finds all your favorite childhood characters converging and intersecting in a story about a baker and his wife who try to lift a curse that’s been placed on them by a malevolent witch. The pundits say Into the Woods is sometimes uneven, but it’s well-staged and features fine performances from a star-studded cast. (Watch our video interviews with stars Emily Blunt, James Corden, Anna Kendrick, Christine Baranski, and Tracey Ullman.)Big Eyes 72%Once in a while, director Tim Burton departs his beguilingly wacky fantasyland for the real world; Ed Wood, a biopic of the notoriously incompetent filmmaker, is one of his most beloved films. With Big Eyes, Burton takes on another strange-but-true story, and while critics say it’s thoughtful, visually striking, and well-acted, its overall tone is sometimes hard to define. Amy Adams stars as Margaret Keane, a painter whose images of children with oversized eyes were big sellers in the 1960s. There was just one problem: While Margaret painted, her husband Walter (Christoph Waltz) took the credit and reaped the rewards, keeping his wife a virtual prisoner. The pundits say Big Eyes shows that Burton’s taste for black comedy is still strong, even if he never fully gets to the heart of his characters here.What’s Hot on TV:The pundits say The Missing (Certified Fresh at 96 percent) turns a routine premise into a standout thriller, thanks to heartfelt, affecting performances.The critics say that a talented ensemble raises Benched (67 percent) above its trite writing, resulting in a nicely diverting half-hour of comedy.Also opening this week in limited release:Selma, a fictional portrayal of the 1965 Selma to Montgomery marches from a variety of perspectives, is Certified Fresh at 100 percent.The Russian import Leviathan, a drama about a man whose life is torn apart when the mayor decides to buy his property, is at 100 percent.The Dardenne brothers‘ Two Days, One Night, starring Marion Cotillard in a drama about a woman who tries to return to work after suffering a nervous breakdown, is Certified Fresh at 93 percent.Clint Eastwood‘s American Sniper, starring Bradley Cooper and Sienna Miller in a drama about the life of Navy SEAL sharpshooter Chris Kyle, is at 72 percent.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"Tour, story, Geographic, Heroines, Paramount, Elton","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Critics-Consensus-The-Interview-Earns-Mixed-Reviews"},{"id":"47508764074509","title":"Critics Consensus: Penguins of Madagascar Is Silly Fun","content":"Critics Consensusvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Critics Consensus: Penguins of Madagascar Is Silly FunPlus, Horrible Bosses 2 is short on laughs, and The Babadook and The Imitation Game are both Certified Fresh.by Tim Ryan | November 25, 2014 |  CommentsThis week at the movies, we’ve got funny flightless birds (Penguins of Madagascar, with voice performances by Benedict Cumberbatch and John Malkovich) and desperate businessmen (Horrible Bosses 2, starring Jason Bateman and Jason Sudeikis). What do the critics have to say?Penguins Of Madagascar 73%The Madagascar movies are certainly a few cuts below, say, the Toy Story films, but give credit where it’s due: each entry has been better-reviewed than the last. Now, the scene-stealing penguins get their own movie, and critics say Penguins of Madagascar is an energetic, silly spy comedy that’s sure to please the little ones (and maybe earn a few smiles from their older companions). The nefarious octopus Octavious Brine (voiced by John Malkovich) is plotting against the world’s penguins, sour old penguin pals Skipper, Kowalski, Rico, and Private join forces with a husky named Classified (Benedict Cumberbatch) and his team of animal spies to thwart him. The pundits say some parents may find Penguins of Madagascar a little too manic, but it’s got plenty of witty lines and madcap action scenes to please the kids.Horrible Bosses 2 35%The first Horrible Bosses was a funny revenge fantasy with a serious undercurrent: it drew its dark laughs from our collective economic anxiety. Unfortunately, critics say Horrible Bosses 2 trades topical humor for tastelessness, stranding its talented ensemble in a sloppy narrative. This time out, our heroes (played by Jason Bateman, Jason Sudeikis, and Charlie Day) have formed their own company and inked a deal with wealthy retailer Bert Hanson (Christoph Waltz) to get their product in stores. But when Bert tries to double-cross them, our would-be entrepreneurs decide to kidnap his son and hold him for ransom. The pundits say that the stars keep Horrible Bosses 2 watchable from time to time, but they’re let down by a thin script that turns juvenile and misanthropic a little too quickly. (Check out as our video interviews with the stars here.)Certified Fresh on TV:The pundits say The Missing (Certified Fresh at 96 percent) turns a common premise into a standout thriller, thanks to heartfelt, affecting performances.Substantially similar to its predecessor in all the best ways, critics say this new season of The Comeback (Certified Fresh at 83 percent) thrives on Lisa Kudrow’s starring performance as Valerie Cherish.Also opening this week in limited release:The Babadook, an Australian horror film about a widow and her six-year-old who are bedeviled by a storybook monster, is Certified Fresh at 97 percent.The Kingdom of Dreams and Madness, a behind-the-scenes look at animation legend Hayao Miyazaki and his work at Studio Ghibli, is at 89 percent.The Imitation Game, starring Benedict Cumberbatch and Keira Knightley in a biopic of the brilliant mathematician and computer pioneer Alan Turing, is Certified Fresh at 84 percent.Antarctica: A Year on Ice, a documentary about the southernmost continent’s year-round residents, is at 83 percent.Before I Disappear, a drama about a troubled man whose plan to kill himself is foiled when he’s forced to babysit his niece, is at 54 percent.The Immortalists, a documentary about a pair of unconventional biologists who are attempting to “cure aging,” is at 50 percent.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"hollywood, GIFs, scorecard, movie, YouTube, zero, TNT, Winter, FXX, and, composers, aapi","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Critics-Consensus-Penguins-of-Madagascar-Is-Silly-Fun"},{"id":"47508765635103","title":"Critics Consensus: Hercules is Mighty Fun","content":"Critics Consensusvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Critics Consensus: Hercules is Mighty FunPlus. Lucy is stylish but illogical, and And So It Goes is predictable.by Tim Ryan | July 24, 2014 |  CommentsThis week at the movies, we’ve got a legendary warrior (Hercules, starring Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson and Joseph Fiennes), a brainy heroine (Lucy, starring Scarlett Johansson and Morgan Freeman), and a curmudgeonly guardian (And So It Goes, starring Michael Douglas and Diane Keaton). What do the critics have to say?Hercules 58%He was the son of a god. He had bulging biceps. He battled all manner of oversized, multi-headed mythological beast. Hercules was essentially an action hero two millennia before the birth of cinema, and critics say much of the fun of Hercules is in its commitment to swashbuckling escapism — this may not be the brainiest flick on the block, but at least it never feels like a dull classics lecture. Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson stars as Herc, who, after completing his fabled labors, assembles a crew of fighters to topple a bloodthirsty megalomaniac. The pundits say Hercules isn’t particularly deep, but it never takes itself too seriously, either, and the result is a surprisingly hearty sword-and-sandal popcorn movie. (Check out this week’s Total Recall, in which we count down Johnson’s best-reviewed films.)Lucy 67%Luc Besson, the director of such cult favorites as Léon: The Professional and The Fifth Element, has never been one for subtlety or nuance. That’s not necessarily a bad thing, though critics say his latest, Lucy, works a lot better as a stylishly eccentric thrill-ride than as a heady sci-fi trip. Scarlett Johansson stars as a student who’s kidnapped and forced to act as a drug mule. When she unintentionally consumes the drug, she quickly morphs into a hyper intelligent, telekinetic killing machine. The pundits say Lucy is short on logic and well-developed characters, but it’s slick, briskly-paced, and often quite entertaining.And So It Goes 18%Not every summer movie has to be a pulse-pounding explosion-fest, but a little energy is always nice. Unfortunately, critics say the combined talents of director Rob Reiner and stars Michael Douglas and Diane Keaton can’t do much to elevate And So It Goes‘ predictable script and slack pacing. Douglas stars as a misanthropic realtor who is suddenly tasked with caring for a granddaughter he never knew existed. Eventually, our hero takes a shine to the tot — and develops a kinship with his charming neighbor (Keaton). The pundits say And So It Goes feels more like a sitcom than a film, and only the stars’ considerable talents keep it from being a complete waste of time. (Check out this week’s 24 Frames for a gallery of dysfunctional movie families.)Also opening this week in limited release:A Most Wanted Man, starring Philip Seymour Hoffman and Rachel McAdams in a spy thriller about an intelligence officer who methodically lays a trap for a terror suspect, is Certified Fresh at 89 percent.Happy Christmas, starring Anna Kendrick and Melanie Lynskey in a drama about a party girl who moves in with an old friend and upends her domestic life, is at 84 percent.The Kill Team, a documentary about the murder of Afghan civilians by a platoon of American soldiers, is at 83 percent.A Letter to Momo, an animated drama about a lonely girl who befriends three supernatural beings, is at 67 percent.A Master Builder, starring Wallace Shawn and Andre Gregory in an adaptation of Henrik Ibsen’s classic play, is at 67 percent.Woody Allen‘s Magic in the Moonlight, starring Colin Firth and Emma Stone in a romantic comedy about a magician who attempts to debunk those who claim to have mystical powers, is at 57 percent.Beneath, a thriller about a group of miners trapped in a collapse who turn against one another, is at 50 percent.Cannibal, a thriller about a high-end tailor and methodical killer of women, is at 44 percent.Ironclad: Battle for Blood, a period action film about a 13th century Celtic siege on a Scottish castle, is at 10 percent.Very Good Girls, starring Dakota Fanning and Elizabeth Olsen in a drama about two best friends who fall for the same guy, is at six percent.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"who, Hallmark, 2017, drama, 2020, child's, anime, adventure, books, 2019, America, BBC, El, green","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Critics-Consensus-Hercules-is-Mighty-Fun"},{"id":"47508765612568","title":"Critics Consensus: Dolphin Tale 2 Is Sweet and Gentle Family Fare","content":"Critics Consensusvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Critics Consensus: Dolphin Tale 2 Is Sweet and Gentle Family FarePlus, No Good Deed wasn't screened for critics -- guess the Tomatometer!by Tim Ryan | September 11, 2014 |  CommentsThis week at the movies, we’ve got an animal rescue drama (Dolphin Tale 2, starring Harry Connick Jr. and Morgan Freeman) and a home invasion thriller (No Good Deed, starring Taraji P. Henson and Idris Elba). What do the critics have to say?Dolphin Tale 2 66%At a time when so much children’s entertainment can feel hyperactive and shrill, Dolphin Tale 2 seems decidedly old fashioned. The critics say that’s mostly a good thing — this gentle, thoughtful family drama isn’t particularly exciting, but it looks great and delivers positive messages with a minimum of schlock. Since being rescued and rehabilitated in the first film, Winter is doing just fine, but her companion has recently died. Thus, our heroes — a team comprised of marine biologists and animal rescue staffers — need to find Winter a new companion or she will be removed from the aquarium as required by law. The pundits say that while Dolphin Tale 2 is narratively thin and slackly paced, its heartfelt, inspirational story is likely to resonate with families. (Check out this week’s Total Recall, in which count down Morgan Freeman’s best-reviewed films, and watch our video interviews with Freeman and co-stars Harry Connick Jr. and Ashley Judd.)No Good Deed 12%It looks like the people behind No Good Deed were afraid it would be punished by the critics, since it wasn’t screened prior to its release in theaters. It’s the story of an ex-district attorney (Taraji P. Henson) who tries to help a stranger (Idris Elba) who claims to have car trouble. However, once she invites him into her home, his real motives prove to be much more sinister. It’s time to guess the Tomatometer!Also opening this week in limited release:Born To Fly, a documentary about the acrobatic group Extreme Action Company, is at 100 percent.Stray Dogs, a drama about a man who works as a human billboard to support his children on the streets of Taipei, is at 93 percent.The Skeleton Twins, starring Kristen Wiig and Bill Hader in a dramedy about estranged twins who reunite as both are in the midst of personal problems, is Certified Fresh at 88 percent.Honeymoon, starring Harry Treadaway and Rose Leslie in a horror film about a woman who begins to act strangely while in a remote getaway with her new husband, is at 79 percent.I Am Eleven, a documentary featuring interviews with 11-year-olds throughout the world, is at 79 percent.The Drop, starring Tom Hardy and James Gandolfini in a crime drama about a late-night robbery that stirs up trouble within the neighborhood demimonde, is at 78 percent.The Green Prince, a documentary about the collaboration between a member of Hamas and an Israeli secret service agent, is at 73 percent.The Disappearance of Eleanor Rigby, starring Jessica Chastain and James McAvoy in a drama that explores a couple’s relationship from both sides, is at 71 percent.My Old Lady, starring Kevin Kline and Maggie Smith in a dramedy about a man who inherits an apartment in Paris only to find an elderly woman squatting there, is at 63 percent.Bird People, starring Josh Charles in a drama about a businessman who decides to leave his life behind and hole up in an airport hotel, is at 60 percent.Take Me to the River, a documentary about Memphis’ influential homegrown R&amp;B sound, is at 50 percent.Swearnet: The Movie, a comedy in which the Trailer Park Boys start an internet channel that features outrageous content, is at 29 percent.At The Devil’s Door, a horror film about a real estate agent who discovers the house she’s trying to sell has a sinister secret, is at 14 percent.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"GLAAD, demand, game, Mary, X-Men, movie, shows","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Critics-Consensus-Dolphin-Tale-2-Is-Sweet-and-Gentle-Family-Fare"},{"id":"47508765602325","title":"Critics Consensus: Gone Girl is Certified Fresh","content":"Critics Consensusvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Critics Consensus: Gone Girl is Certified FreshPlus, Annabelle, Left Behind, and new TV.by Tim Ryan | October 2, 2014 |  CommentsThis week at the movies, we’ve got a mysterious disappearance (Gone Girl, starring Ben Affleck and Rosamund Pike), a spooky doll (Annabelle, starring Annabelle Wallis and Ward Horton), and the end of the world (Left Behind, starring Nicolas Cage and Lea Thompson). What do the critics have to say?Gone Girl 87%As the old promotional tagline goes, “You’ve read the book — now see the movie!” In the case of David Fincher‘s Gone Girl (adapted from Gillian Flynn‘s page-turning bestseller), critics say that’s sage advice, for the film is a psychologically penetrating thriller that’s chilling and darkly funny — and it features a performance from Rosamund Pike that’s likely to catapult her to the big-time. Nick (Ben Affleck) and Amy (Pike) are a seemly idyllic couple. However, when Amy goes missing, and the media descends on their small Midwestern town, Nick looks increasingly suspicious. The pundits say the Certified Fresh Gone Girl is well-acted, intelligent, and deeply unsettling — in short, what we’ve come to expect from Fincher. (Watch our video interview with the cast and crew here.)Annabelle 29%That creepy doll Annabelle cut such a striking presence in The Conjuring that she got her own movie. Unfortunately, the critics say it’s too bad she couldn’t get a better one; despite a few undeniably effective scares, Annabelle is by and large a compendium of horror movie cliches. A young couple with a baby on the way witnesses the shocking murder of their neighbors by a satanic cult. Soon, our heroes experience sinister goings-on throughout their house ; could that weird vintage doll the husband purchased be the cause? The pundits say Annabelle is a pretty generic haunted house flick, though it’s spooky enough on occasion to wish it were more.Left Behind 1%Nicolas Cage plus the Book of Revelations should equal apocalyptic excitement, right? Apparently not. Critics are less than — ahem — enraptured by Left Behind; they say it’s a limp, clumsily crafted potboiler with cheesy special effects and minimal character development. Based upon the bestselling novels by Jerry B. Jenkins and Tim LaHaye, the film stars Cage as Rayford Steele, a disaffected airline pilot who witnesses several passengers and crew members vanish in mid-flight. Steele must safely land the plane while chaos reigns on the ground. The pundits say Left Behind is mostly amateurish and largely bereft of thrills.Fresh on TV this week:This Amazon Prime dramedy is winning high praise for its honest, empathetic, and funny depiction of a dysfunctional family; critics say Transparent (98 percent) features top-notch performances from the likes of Jeffrey Tambor, Judith Light, Gaby Hoffmann, and many more.Gracepoint (73 percent) is an American adaptation of the critically-adored British detective series Broadchurch, both of which star David Tennant. And while critics say it’s not quite as sharp as its predecessor, it’s sophisticated and stylish, and features a strong lead performance from Anna Gunn.Also opening this week in limited release:Nas: Time Is Illmatic, a documentary about the making of one of hip hop’s greatest albums, is at 100 percent.Last Hijack, a documentary about the life of a Somali pirate, is at 100 percent.The Blue Room, a thriller about a man whose adulterous affairs lead to serious trouble, is at 90 percent.For Those In Peril, a drama about a man who survives a mysterious fishing boat accident off the coast of Scotland, is at 89 percent.The Good Lie, starring Reese Witherspoon in a drama about a group of Sudanese refugees who attempt to make new lives for themselves in the United States, is at 85 percent (check out our interview with the cast here).Copenhagen, a drama about a man who befriends a teenage girl while searching for his grandfather in Denmark, is at 83 percent.Harmontown, a documentary portrait of Community creator Dan Harmon, is at 60 percent.The Decent One, a documentary about how Nazi leader Heinrich Himmler thought about his actions, is at 50 percent.Men, Women &amp; Children, starring Jennifer Garner and Adam Sandler in a dramedy about the ways that technology has changed the way that parents and teens communicate, is at 40 percent.Inner Demons, a horror film about reality show subject who appears to be a drug addict but may be suffering from something even scarier, is at 40 percent.A Good Marriage, starring Joan Allen and Anthony LaPaglia in a thriller about a woman who makes a shocking discovery about her husband, is at 38 percent.The Liberator, a biopic of Simón Bolívar and his fight for Latin American independence from Spain, is at 27 percent.The Hero of Color City, an animated adventure about anthropomophic crayons featuring voice performances by Christina Ricci and Craig Ferguson, is at 20 percent.Drive Hard, starring John Cusack and Thomas Jane in a thriller about a racecar driver who’s enlisted to drive the getaway car as part of daring heist, is at eight percent.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"twilight, Awards, Awards, FirstLook, comedy, your, Academy, history","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"critics-consensus-gone-girl-is-certified-fresh"},{"id":"47508765618713","title":"Critics Consensus: The Identical Won’t Leave You All Shook Up","content":"Critics Consensusvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Critics Consensus: The Identical Won't Leave You All Shook UpPlus, No No: A Dockumentary is a fascinating portrait of a trailblazing ballplayer, and Wetlands is wild and transgressive.by Tim Ryan | September 5, 2014 |  CommentsThis week at the movies, we’ve got just one wide release: The Identical, starring Blake Rayne, Ashley Judd, and Ray Liotta in the fictional story of an Elvis-esque rocker and his twin brother. What do the critics have to say?The Identical 6%It’s a heartbreaking — and undeniably intriguing — bit of trivia that every Elvis Presley fan knows: the King had an identical twin brother who was stillborn. What would have happened had Jesse Presley survived? Unfortunately, critics say The Identical takes this premise and squanders it on a schmaltzy, unintentionally funny plot sprinkled with bland tunes and uneven performances. Blake Rayne plays a dual role as brothers separated by birth. One grows up to become a rock ‘n’ roll pioneer, and the other is expected to join the ministry — though he finds the lure of music hard to resist. The pundits say The Identical is well-meaning but surprisingly ham-fisted; it’s a movie about a rock star that’s short on edge or memorable music.Also opening this week in limited release:No No: A Dockumentary, a portrait of Pittsburgh Pirates pitcher Dock Ellis and the no-hitter he threw while on acid, is at 100 percent.Wetlands, a transgressive dramedy about a teenager who acts out while dealing with her parents’ divorce, is at 94 percent.Last Days in Vietnam, a documentary about the evacuation of South Vietnamese collaborators from Saigon, is at 92 percent.Memphis, a drama about a few days in the life of a troubled soul singer, is at 75 percent.God Help the Girl, starring Emily Browning in a coming-of-age comedy directed by Belle and Sebastian’s Stuart Murdoch, is at 71 percent.Thunder and the House of Magic, an animated adventure about a cat who moves into a magician’s house, is at 68 percent.Kelly &amp; Cal, starring Juliette Lewis in a drama about an alienated suburban mom who befirends a teen from the neighborhood, is at 64 percent.Trailer Park Boys: Don’t Legalize It, featuring the Canadian goofballs in a mockumentary about keeping marijuana illegal so as not to hurt their thriving business, is at 57 percent.Frontera, starring Ed Harris and Michael Peña in a drama about a murder investigation along the Mexico-Arizona border, is at 55 percent.The Longest Week, starring Jason Bateman and Olivia Wilde in a comedy about a writer who moves in with his best friend and falls in love with his girlfriend, is at 22 percent.Innocence, a dark drama about a troubled girl at a sinister boarding school, is at zero percent.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"movie, Family, pirates, Book, screen, Bros., disaster, Awards, worst, Funimation, Animation, Sematary, movies, Television","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Critics-Consensus-The-Identical-Wont-Leave-You-All-Shook-Up"},{"id":"47508766721569","title":"Critics Consensus: Dawn Of The Planet Of The Apes is Certified Fresh","content":"Critics Consensusvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Critics Consensus: Dawn Of The Planet Of The Apes is Certified FreshPlus, Boyhood is Certified Fresh as well.by Tim Ryan | July 10, 2014 |  CommentsThis week at the movies, we’ve got just one wide release: the hotly-anticipated Dawn Of The Planet Of The Apes, starring Jason Clarke, Gary Oldman and Keri Russell. What do the critics have to say?Dawn Of The Planet Of The Apes 90%Released in 2011, Rise of the Planet of the Apes showed that there was still life in the venerable Apes franchise. It looks like that was no fluke; the critics say Dawn Of The Planet Of The Apes is everything a sequel should be: visually striking, emotionally resonant, and intellectually weighty. In the decade since the rise of intelligent primates, humans and apes have lived separately, maintaining an uneasy peace. But when a group of people find an energy source in ape territory, the stage is set for an epic battle to determine which race will triumph. The pundits say the Certified Fresh Dawn Of The Planet Of The Apes is the rare part two that deepens and expands upon its predecessor, and much of the credit must go to Andy Serkis, whose motion captured performance as ape leader Caesar is a remarkable feat of physicality.

What do the critics have to say?Guardians of the Galaxy 92%How strong is the Marvel juggernaut right now? It’s so strong it’s making movie stars out of even its second and third string superheroes. The critics say Guardians of the Galaxy, with its fast-paced thrills, eye-popping special effects, and playful sense of humor, is one of the most purely enjoyable comic book adaptations in a while. Peter Quill (Chris Pratt), a devil-may-care space adventurer, teams with a group of oddballs to transport and sell a mysterious and valuable orb. However, the evil Ronan the Accuser wants to harness the orb for his own nefarious purposes, so it’s up to our heroes to save the universe. The pundits say the Certified Fresh Guardians of the Galaxy exudes the giddy swagger of old-school swashbucklers within its slick packaging, making for a funny, exciting night at the movies for comics buffs and neophytes alike. (Check out this week’s 24 Frames for a gallery of great movie spaceships, and watch our interviews with Pratt and co-stars Zoe Saldana, Vin Diesel, and Dave Bautista.)Get On Up 80%James Brown was such an electrifying performer — and his life was so colorful — that you’d be forgiven for thinking that no biopic could possibly do him justice. But critics say Get On Up comes close, thanks to a dynamite performance by Chadwick Boseman that captures the great soul singer’s onstage magnetism and offstage complexities. The film doesn’t proceed chronologically; instead, it jumps around to depict key moments in Brown’s life, from his hardscrabble childhood to his legendary Apollo concerts, from his famously rigorous work habits to his problems with the law. The pundits say the Certified Fresh Get On Up occasionally falls prey to standard biopic elements, but mostly, it’s an energetic portrait of a fascinating, often difficult man, and Boseman is simply out of sight. (Check out this week’s Total Recall for a list of some of cinema’s funkiest movies, and watch our interviews with Boseman and co-stars Octavia Spencer, Nelsan Ellis, and Jill Scott.)Also opening this week in limited release:Calvary, starring Brendan Gleeson and Chris O’Dowd in a drama about a country priest who struggles to continue his work after receiving a death threat during a confessional, is Certified Fresh at 88 percent.Finding Fela!, a documentary about the life and music of the great Nigerian Afrobeat star, is at 77 percent.Moebius, a South Korean drama about the twisted relationship between a family and another woman, is at 75 percent.Rich Hill, a documentary about three teenagers growing up in an economically depressed town in the Midwest, is at 77 percent.The Strange Little Cat, a closely-observed dramedy about a middle-class family in a Berlin apartment, is at 70 percent.The Almost Man, a Norwegian comedy about a 30-something man-child whose life is upended when his girlfriend announces that she’s pregnant, is at 67 percent.Around the Block, starring Christina Ricci in a coming-of-age drama about a troubled 16-year-old torn between the theater and a life of crime, is at 50 percent.War Story, starring Catherine Keener and Ben Kingsley in a drama about a photojournalist attempting to help a refugee escape a war zone, is at 43 percent.Cabin Fever 3: Patient Zero, a horror film about group of vacationers who find themselves in the midst of a terrifying viral outbreak, is at 38 percent.James Franco‘s Child Of God, a period drama about a troubled cave-dweller in rural Tennessee, is at 35 percent.4 Minute Mile, starring Richard Jenkins in a drama about a high school runner attempting to turn his life around with the help of a gruff track coach, is at 29 percent.Louder Than Words, starring David Duchovny and Hope Davis in a drama about a grieving couple who work to help establish a hospital for their community, is at 14 percent.Behaving Badly, starring Nat Wolff and Selena Gomez in a comedy about a guy who makes a bet that he can win the girl of his dreams, is at zero percent.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"2019, aapi, Swim, Crackle, Association, One, TCM","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"critics-consensus-guardians-of-the-galaxy-is-certified-fresh"},{"id":"47508765600276","title":"Critics Consensus: Alexander and the Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Day Is Okay","content":"Critics Consensusvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Critics Consensus: Alexander and the Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Day Is OkayPlus, The Judge, Dracula Untold, Men, Women &amp; Children, Addicted, and Certified Fresh TV.by Tim Ryan | October 9, 2014 |  CommentsThis week at the movies, we’ve got family pratfalls (Alexander and the Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Day, starring Steve Carell and Jennifer Garner); a tense trial (The Judge, starring Robert Downey Jr. and Robert Duvall); a legendary vampire (Dracula Untold, starring Luke Evans and Sarah Gadon); a failure to communicate (Men, Women &amp; Children, starring Adam Sandler and Rosemarie DeWitt); and a torrid affair (Addicted, starring Sharon Leal and Boris Kodjoe). What do the critics have to say?Alexander and the Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Day 61%&lt;pTerrible, horrible, no good, and very bad? Or terrific, honest, noteworthy, and very good? Critics say Alexander and the Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Day falls directly in the middle — it’s pleasant, charming, inoffensive, and a little tepid. Based upon Judith Viorst’s beloved children’s book, the movie stars Ed Oxenbould, who has a lousy day at school and subsequently wishes that his other family members are also stricken with bad luck as well. Hilarity and, ultimately, family bonding ensue. The pundits say Alexander and the Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Day is perfectly passable family entertainment — it’s well-meaning and reasonably funny, but nothing earth-shaking. (Watch our video interviews with stars Jennifer Garner, Steve Carrell, Ed Oxenbould, and more.)The Judge 49%It’s been a while since we’ve been treated to a weighty courtroom drama at the multiplex, so it’s not unreasonable to have high expectations for The Judge — especially since it stars Robert Downey Jr. and Robert Duvall. Unfortunately, critics say that despite its fine performances, the film is overlong and far too predictable. Hank Palmer (Downey) is a big-city attorney who returns to his hometown in Indiana for his mother’s funeral. His estranged father Joseph (Duvall), the town judge, is accused of murder, so Hank ends up defending him, while trying to make peace with the past. The pundits say The Judge is impeccably crafted, and the stars play off each other quite well, but it’s got too much melodrama and not enough suspense. (Check out our video interviews with Downey, Duvall, and more.)Dracula Untold 25%You can drive a stake through his heart, expose him to sunlight, and come at him with a convent’s-worth of crucifixes, and still, Dracula will rise again — since the silent era, we’ve been treated to hundreds of cinematic depictions of Transylvania’s favorite son. That said, critics say Dracula Untold is visually striking but narratively shaky, borrowing heavily from a wide range of fantasy/adventure movies. In 15th Century Romania, Vlad Tepes (Luke Evans) makes a deal with an old vampire in order to protect his kingdom from an invading army. He’s granted a variety of supernatural powers, but at the cost of developing a taste for blood. The pundits say Dracula Untold offers some fun battle scenes, but it’s a bit unclear on the rules of being a vampire. (See interviews with Evans, Sarah Gadon, and more.)Men, Women &amp; Children 33%In Up in the Air and Young Adult, director Jason Reitman crafted witty, portraits of lonely people trying to connect with others. Unfortunately, critics say his latest, Men, Women &amp; Children, jettisons the wit in favor of a more hectoring tone that’s only partially redeemed by the strong cast. It’s a multi-stranded ensemble piece set in a small town in Texas, in which adults and their teenage children are immersed in their phones and computers, but have difficulty communicating offline. The pundits say Men, Women &amp; Children is ambitious and well-acted, but its message ultimately overrides its storytelling.Addicted 7%We’d love to tell you what the critics thought of Addicted, but it wasn’t screened prior to its release. It’s the tale of a successful businesswoman who gets in over her head when she cheats on her husband with an artist. Guess the Tomatometer!Certified Fresh on TV this week:We’ve seen plenty of heavy, gritty superhero stories lately. What critics say makes The Flash (Certified Fresh at 96 percent) stand out is it light, likeable tone — it’s energetic, buoyant, and likely to have appeal beyond the comics crowd.The fourth iteration of Ryan Murphy’s creep fest, American Horror Story: Freak Show (Certified Fresh at 79 percent) proves there are plenty more dark corners for the series to explore; Critics say it’s stylishly presented and well-acted by returning players Jessica Lange, Sarah Paulson, Kathy Bates, and Angela Bassett.Also opening this week in limited release:Whiplash, starring Miles Teller and J.K. Simmons in a drama about an ambitious jazz drummer and his punishingly strict teacher, is Certified Fresh at 97 percent.The Overnighters, a documentary about the influx of people looking for stable jobs amidst North Dakota’s energy boom, is at 94 percent.Dead Snow 2: Red vs. Dead, the second installment of the horror/comedy franchise about Nazi zombies, is at 87 percent.Kill the Messenger, starring Jeremy Renner in a drama about investigative journalist Gary Webb’s discovery of CIA ties to a drug trafficking conspiracy, is at 71 percent (check out Renner’s Five Favorite Films here).The Canal, a horror film about a man who is haunted by a grisly murder that took place in his home, is at 71 percent.St. Vincent, starring Bill Murray and Melissa McCarthy in a comedy about a hard-living curmudgeon who bonds with his neighbor’s 12-year-old son, is at 63 percent.One Chance, a drama based on the true story of the amateur opera singer who became an overnight sensation on Britain’s Got Talent, is at 61 percent.I Am Ali, featuring audio recordings of the boxing legend, is at 42 percent.You’re Not You, starring Hilary Swank and Emmy Rossum in a drama about a woman suffering from ALS and the college student who cares for her, is at 22 percent.Autómata, starring Antonio Banderas and Melanie Griffith in a sci-fi drama about an insurance agent who investigates a self-improving robot, is at 21 percent.The Pact II, a horror film about a woman who’s bedeviled by a serial killer, is at zero percent.Kite, starring Samuel L.

What do the critics have to say?Divergent 41%Based on a series of popular young adult novels, Divergent is a sci-fi allegory about the dangers of conformity. Ironically, critics say the biggest problem with the film is that it borrows too heavily from the likes of The Hunger Games and Harry Potter, leaving its terrific cast stranded in a sea of exposition. In a dystopian future, teenagers are forced to chose one of five factions with which they’ll associate for life. However, Beatrice Prior (Shailene Woodley) doesn’t fit neatly into any one group, and her independent streak makes her a target when two rival tribes prepare for war. The pundits say Woodley gives a star-making performance, and her supporting cast is top-notch, but Divergent is too grim and jumbled to fully resonate. (Check out our gallery of co-star Kate Winslet in some of her most memorable roles.)Muppets Most Wanted 80%“Everybody knows that the sequel’s never quite as good,” sing Kermit and Fozzie in the opening scene of Muppets Most Wanted. The operative word here is “quite,” for the critics say that while this caper comedy lacks the breezy charm of The Muppets, it’s got enough laughs and catchy tunes to entertain in its own right. Hot off their successful reunion show, the Muppets decide to take their act on the road, but things quickly go amiss when they sign up with a fast-talking booking agent (Ricky Gervais) who’s in league with a wanted criminal mastermind — and who looks exactly like Kermit the Frog. The pundits say the Certified Fresh Muppets Most Wanted maintains the anarchic spirit of the Muppets, and if the story isn’t as strong this time out, the rapid-fire gags are reliably witty and inventive. (Check out our video interviews with the cast, as well as our rundown of the best films from the Jim Henson Company.)Also opening this week in limited release:The Oscar-nominated The Missing Picture, a documentary that utilizes clay figurines to tell the story of the Khmer Rouge’s reign of terror in Cambodia, is Certified Fresh at 98 percent.Cheap Thrills, starring Ethan Embry in a comedy about a down-on-his-luck guy who accepts a series of outrageous dares from a mysterious couple, is at 97 percent (also, check out co-star David Koechner’s Five Favorite Films).Jodorowsky’s Dune, a documentary on the cult director’s ambitious (but unrealized) attempt to craft a sci-fi masterpiece, is at 96 percent.A Birder’s Guide To Everything, starring Ben Kingsley and Kodi Smit-McPhee in a comedy about a 15-year-old bird watching fanatic who goes on a quest to find a supposedly extinct duck, is at 90 percent.It Felt Like Love, a coming-of-age drama about a teenage girl who romantically pursues a tough older guy, is at 83 percent.Rob the Mob, starring Michael Pitt and Andy Garcia in a dramedy about a couple of small-time crooks who smake a living stealing from members of the mafia, is at 80 percent.Lars von Trier‘s Nymphomaniac: Volume I, starring Charlotte Gainsbourg and Shia LaBeouf in a drama about a sex-obsessed woman who tells her life story to a stranger, is Certified Fresh at 76 percent.The French Minister, a comedy about a young speechwriter who must keep a scatterbrained foreign minister on task, is at 58 percent.Blood Ties, starring Clive Owen and Billy Crudup in a drama about two brothers on opposite sides of the law, is at 57 percent.Anita, a documentary about the woman who testified that future Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas sexually harassed her, is at 56 percent.Just a Sigh, starring Gabriel Byrne and Emmanuelle Devos in a dramedy about a woman whose life is upended when she meets a mysterious stranger, is at 14 percent.Maladies, starring James Franco and Catherine Keener in a drama about a down-and-out soap star looking to regain his mojo, is at 13 percent.Stay, starring Taylor Schilling and Aidan Quinn as a couple whose relationship is tested while vacationing in rural Ireland, is at 10 percent.McCanick, starring David Morse and Cory Monteith in a thriller about a detective who goes gunning for a convict who’s just been released from prison, is at 9 percent.Finally, props to Vicente Torres and Nat Brautigam for coming the closest to guessing The Single Moms Club‘s 17 percent Tomatometer.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"dark, aapi, National, series, awards, ABC, furious, Esquire, movies, critic","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/21130918/disappoints.jpg","slug":"critics-consensus-divergent-disappoints"},{"id":"47508766745134","title":"Critics Consensus: Rio 2 Fails to Take Flight","content":"Critics Consensusvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Critics Consensus: Rio 2 Fails to Take FlightPlus, Draft Day is too predictable, and Oculus is effectively spooky.by Tim Ryan | April 11, 2014 |  CommentsThis week at the movies, we’ve got Brazilian birds (Rio 2, with voice performances by Anne Hathaway and Jesse Eisenberg), a pigskin professional (Draft Day, starring Kevin Costner and Jennifer Garner), and a malevolent mirror (Oculus, starring Katee Sackhoff and Rory Cochrane). What do the critics have to say?Rio 2 48%Plenty of animated films can entertain the kiddies for two hours without leaving much of an impression. Critics say Rio 2 is visually sharp and action-packed, but it’s also overly busy and short on big laughs. Married macaws Blu (Jesse Eisenberg) and Jewel (Anne Hathaway) have settled down with their chicks in the big city, but when an ornithologist discovers a flock of endangered blue macaws, the family travels to the Amazon rainforest, where they find a group of birds who can’t relate to Blu’s city-slicker ways. The pundits say that althoughRio 2 is colorful and energetic, its lack of storytelling discipline and overabundance of musical numbers makes for a thinner experience than its predecessor. (Check out our video interview with the stars of Rio 2 here.)Draft Day 60%Moneyball proved that front-office action could be as riveting as anything on the playing field. Unfortunately, critics say that while Draft Day is slick and well acted, it suffers from predictable plotting and a shortage of insight. Costner stars as Cleveland Browns general manager Sonny Weaver, who’s tasked with rebuilding the team after another losing season. But Sonny’s not just worried about the Browns’ roster — he’s got a host of family issues to deal with as well. The pundits say Costner is rock-solid in the lead role, but the other characters aren’t as well fleshed out, and the film often fumbles the football details. (Watch our interview with the stars of Draft Day, and browse our gallery of memorable football movies.)Oculus 74%If you think you’ve seen every permutation on the haunted house horror flick template, think again. Critics say Oculus is a very effective frightfest, one that features interesting characters and an encompassing sense of dread. After the bizarre death of their parents, a pair of siblings return to their childhood home in order to confront the murderous party responsible: a haunted antique mirror that has the power to distort reality. The pundits say Oculus is sharply crafted, well acted, and often very scary.Also opening this week in limited release:Dancing In Jaffa, a documentary about a dance instructor who teaches classes for Israeli and Palestinian kids, is at 100 percent.The King of Escape, a comedy about a middle-aged tractor salesman who accompanies a teenage girl fleeing her parents, is at 100 percent.Jim Jarmusch‘s Only Lovers Left Alive, starring Tom Hiddleston and Tilda Swinton as vampires in a longstanding relationship who are reunited in contemporary Detroit, is Certified Fresh at 89 percent.Joe, starring Nicolas Cage in a drama about an ex-con who becomes a father figure for a troubled teenager, is Certified Fresh at 83 percent.No God, No Master, starring David Strathairn in a period drama about a U.S. Bureau of Investigation agent on the trail of an anarchist plot, is at 80 percent.A Fragile Trust: Plagiarism, Power And Jayson Blair At The New York Times, a documentary about the serial plagiarist, is at 71 percent.The Railway Man, starring Colin Firth and Nicole Kidman in a drama about a former prisoner of war who vows to confront the man responsible for his treatment, is at 69 percent (check out this week’s Total Recall, in which we count down Kidman’s best-reviewed movies).Hank And Asha, a romantic comedy about a couple in a long-distance relationship that corresponds by trading video missives, is at 64 percent.Cuban Fury, starring Nick Frost and Rashida Jones in a comedy about a former salsa dancing prodigy looking for love and redemption, is at 51 percent.Hateship Loveship, starring Kristen Wiig and Guy Pearce in a dramedy about a lonely housekeeper who becomes the victim of an elaborate prank, is at 44 percent.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"Bowl, USA, universe, revenge, america, LGBT","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Critics-Consensus-Rio-2-Fails-to-Take-Flight"},{"id":"47508766743085","title":"Critics Consensus: Transcendence is a Sci-Fi Snooze","content":"Critics Consensusvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Critics Consensus: Transcendence is a Sci-Fi SnoozePlus, Heaven is for Real is heartfelt but uneven; Bears is beautiful and entertaining, and A Haunted House 2 wasn't screened -- guess the Tomatometer!by Tim Ryan | April 17, 2014 |  CommentsThis week at the movies, we’ve got a techno-dystopia (Transcendence, starring Johnny Depp and Rebecca Hall), a near-death experience (Heaven Is For Real, starring Greg Kinnear and Connor Corum), a bunch of furry carnivores (the nature documentary Bears), and some supernatural high jinks (A Haunted House 2, starring Marlon Wayans and Jaime Pressly). What do the critics have to say?Transcendence 19%Sometimes a movie needs more than an intriguing premise, an all-star cast, and a distinctive visual look. Critics say that’s the case with Transcendence, a surprisingly dull and narratively muddled sci-fi drama that’s short on suspense and logic. Johnny Depp stars as Will Caster, a leader in the field of artificial intelligence research who uploads his consciousness to a computer with the intent of creating a sentient machine. In doing so, Caster runs afoul of a group of militant luddites, who fear that humans have become too dependent on technology. The pundits say Transcendence is sleekly crafted, but it largely squanders its cast on a story that never quite coheres. (Check out our video interview with the stars, as well as this week’s Total Recall, in which we count down Depp’s best-reviewed movies.)Heaven Is for Real 51%It’s an age-old puzzle for Hollywood: how to make films that appeal to devout Christians without alienating everyone else. Critics say that Heaven Is For Real ends up in the mushy middle, and the result is a well-acted, thoughtful tale that never quite follows through on the interesting questions it raises. Four-year-old Colton (Connor Corum) briefly flatlines during surgery; when he’s revived, he tells an incredible story about the deceased family members he met during his short visit to Heaven. Colton’s revelation awakens something in his father Todd (Greg Kinnear), a small-town pastor in the midst of a crisis of faith. The pundits say Heaven is for Real is well-made and often quite affecting, but its depiction of the afterlife leaves something to be desired.Bears 90%With Earth, Oceans, African Cats, and Chimpanzee, the good folks at Disneynature have delivered an unbroken string of high-quality nature documentaries. Critics say the streak continues with Bears, which offers breathtaking images of these animals in their natural environs and tends to avoid shoehorning its subjects into a narrative. Narrated by John C. Reilly, the film follows a mama grizzly bear and her two cubs as they try to survive in the Alaskan wilderness. The pundits say that Bears‘ furry protagonists are engaging and lovable, and the footage captured here is crisp and intimate. (Take a look through our gallery of memorable bears in the movies.)A Haunted House 2 8%Given the critical drubbing its predecessor received, it comes as little surprise that A Haunted House 2 wasn’t screened for reviewers prior to its release. Marlon Wayans stars as a man who moves with his new girlfriend and her kids to a new home that’s bedeviled by spectral spirits; hilarity ensues. Time to guess the Tomatometer!Also opening this week in limited release:The Final Member, a documentary about an Icelandic museum that houses a vast array of male genitalia from humans and animals, is at 100 percent.Gabrielle, a drama about a love affair between two developmentally disabled adults, is at 100 percent.Manakamana, a documentary about a cable car in Nepal that carries tourists and locals to a temple in the mountains, is at 100 percent.Soft In The Head, a dramedy about a troubled woman who ends up living at a halfway house for men, is at 80 percent.Small Time, a drama about a used-car salesman who teaches his son the tricks of the trade, is at 71 percent.Proxy, a horror film about a woman dealing with tragedy who finds herself embroiled in a conspiracy when she joins a support group, is at 69 percent.13 Sins, starring Mark Webber and Ron Perlman in a thriller about a financially-strapped salesman who must undertake a series of increasingly dangerous challenges dictated to him via cell phone, is at 60 percent.Fading Gigolo, starring Woody Allen and John Turturro in a comedy about a man who becomes an escort to help a friend in financial trouble, is at 57 percent.That Demon Within, an action/horror hybrid about a young cop who suffers from hallucinations after providing a life-saving blood transfusion to a ruthless criminal, is at 44 percent.Make Your Move, a drama about a pair of young people from different worlds who bond whie dancing, is at 20 percent.Tasting Menu, a comedy about a disparate group of people who assemble for the closing of a world-class chef’s restaurant, is at 13 percent.Authors Anonymous, starring Kaley Cuoco and Chris Klein in a mockumentary about a group of aspiring novelists, is at zero percent.A Promise, starring Rebecca Hall and Alan Rickman in a period drama about an ambitious young man who falls for his boss’ married daughter, is at zero percent.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"nightmare, NBC, rom-coms, SundanceTV, zombie, award, blaxploitation, composers, 4/20, on, archives, chucky, Larson","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Critics-Consensus-Transcendence-is-a-Sci-Fi-Snooze"},{"id":"47508766742060","title":"Critics Consensus: The Other Woman is Short On Laughs","content":"Critics Consensusvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Critics Consensus: The Other Woman is Short On LaughsPlus, Brick Mansions doesn't measure up to the original, and The Quiet Ones is spooky but not all that scary.by Tim Ryan | April 24, 2014 |  CommentsThis week at the movies, we’ve got spurned ladies (The Other Woman, starring Cameron Diaz and Leslie Mann), a ticking time-bomb (Brick Mansions, starring Paul Walker and David Belle), and a paranormal experiment (The Quiet Ones, starring Jared Harris and Sam Claflin). What do the critics have to say?The Other Woman 26%As the saying goes, hell hath no fury like a woman scorned. Unfortunately, critics say the problem with The Other Woman is it’s a bit too tepid, offering a few decent laughs but never quite nailing the female empowerment vibe it’s aiming for. Carly (Cameron Diaz) is reeling from the discovery that her boyfriend is married. She stews for a while, but upon meeting his wife (Leslie Mann) and his other girlfriend (Kate Upton), she realizes the three women have a lot in common, and collectively they decide to exact revenge. The pundits say The Other Woman has a game cast and some clever lines of dialogue, but the scenario is alternately too implausible and predictable to resonate emotionally. (Check out our video interview with the stars, as well as this week’s Total Recall, in which we count down Diaz’s best-reviewed movies.)Brick Mansions 26%A remake of the gravity-defying, parkour-infused French import District 13, Brick Mansions promises balletic action and high-wire thrills. And critics say it does indeed feature a few strong set pieces, but they aren’t enough to compensate for an overabundance of plotting and an underabundance of character development. In a crime-ridden Detroit of the near future, an undercover cop (Paul Walker) must infiltrate a heavily fortified section of town in order to diffuse a bomb that’s fallen into the hands of a vicious crime lord (RZA). The pundits say Brick Mansions is a ludicrous action flick with a few exciting moments, but mostly, it’s a pale retread of its superior predecessor. (Check out RZA’s Five Favorite Films here.)The Quiet Ones 37%Hammer Film Productions has long been a purveyor of a more elegant brand of horror film. Unfortunately, critics say The Quiet Ones is a little too classy for its own good; despite solid performances and a spooky sense of place, the film delivers occasional jolts but fails at sustaining tension. In a remote English estate, Professor Joseph Coupland (Jared Harris) and a team of students are experimenting on a young woman who’s purported to be possessed by a supernatural being. Coupland believes she’s simply mentally ill, but his hypothesis is put to the test when he and his researchers are bedeviled by increasingly terrifying incidents. The pundits say The Quiet Ones is visually striking and often creepy, but it’s also overly talky and rarely out-and-out scary.

What do the critics have to say?Godzilla 76%Poor Godzilla. Decades of campy stomp-fests have transformed the once-mighty king of the monsters into a cuddly oaf. This new Godzilla is an attempt to imbue the franchise with more weight than the typical creature feature, and critics say the result is mostly successful, with fine performances and visually striking effects making up for a tendency toward ponderousness. When a nuclear power plant near Tokyo is damaged by a series of tremors, scientist Joe Brody (Bryan Cranston) believes the cause is something more ominous than an earthquake. Years later, Joe’s son Ford (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) realizes his father was right — a terrifying beast called the Muto has been causing the tremors, and only one giant lizard can stop it. The pundits say the Certified Fresh Godzilla takes a while to get going, but if you want to watch oversized creatures wreak havoc on big cities, the movie delivers the goods in a reasonably imaginative fashion. (Check out our video interview with Cranston, as well as this week’s Total Recall, in which we present a field guide to giant movie monsters.)Million Dollar Arm 65%Who doesn’t love an underdog sports story — especially one that’s based on true events? Critics say Million Dollar Arm is as pleasant as a day at the ballpark, but don’t expect any curveballs or changeups from the script. Jon Hamm stars as J.B. Bernstein, a sports agent whose clientele is short on major league stars. SSo he travels to India and holds a contest to find two strong-armed cricket bowlers who have the stuff to become big-league pitchers. The pundits say Million Dollar Arm is well-crafted and likeable, but it’s pretty predictable, and the film makes only limited use of its setting.

What do the critics have to say?Maleficent 54%In the past few years, audiences have been treated to a tough-as-nails Snow White, an emotionally complex Snow Queen, and, ahem, Hansel &amp; Gretel: Witch Hunters. Maleficent offers a more sympathetic take on the evil fairy queen from Sleeping Beauty, but critics say that an outstanding performance from Angelina Jolie and some striking visuals can’t redeem the movie’s slack narrative and uncertain tone. Maleficent (Jolie), a powerful fairy, is betrayed by a childhood friend, who becomes a king; in turn, she places a curse upon his daughter. As the child grows up, however, Maleficent reconsiders her feelings, even as the king plots her destruction. The pundits say Maleficent deserves credit for putting a feminist spin on an old tale, but the movie can’t quite live up to its thoughtful premise — or Jolie’s inspired work in the title role. (Check out this week’s Total Recall, in which we count down Jolie’s best-reviewed movies, as well as our video interviews with Jolie and other members of the cast.)A Million Ways to Die in the West 33%Some comedies fail because they’re short on gags. On the other end of the spectrum, critics say the problem with A Million Ways to Die in the West is that it has too many — writer/director/star Seth MacFarlane packs so many jokes into this Western spoof that the most inventive comic moments are often elbowed aside by scatological smuttiness. MacFarlane stars as Albert, a cowardly rancher in a wild west town who falls for Anna (Charlize Theron), who’s handy with a gun. However, Anna is married to a wanted outlaw, and soon Albert is in his crosshairs. The pundits say A Million Ways to Die in the West has an appealing cast and some really big laughs, but overall, it’s a few notches below its obvious inspiration — Mel Brooks‘ Blazing Saddles. (Flip through our gallery of memorable Western comedies.)Also opening this week in limited release:We Are the Best!, a dramedy about three Swedish teenagers who start a punk band, is Certified Fresh at 100 percent.Manoel de Oliveira‘s Gebo And The Shadow, a drama about an elderly couple still reeling from the long absense of their son, is at 100 percent.Lucky Them, starring Toni Collette and Thomas Haden Church in a dramedy about a music writer looking for a forgotten musician who also happens to be her ex, is at 92 percent.Elena, a documentary about the disappearance of an aspiring Brazilian actress, is at 86 percent.The Hornet’s Nest, a documentary about a group of American soldiers in Afghanistan undertaking a series of missions in hostile territory, is at 86 percent.Korengal, a documentary that follows up on the soldiers featured in Restrepo, is at 80 percent.Night Moves, starring Jesse Eisenberg and Dakota Fanning in a drama about a group of radical environmentalists plotting an attack, is at 76 percent (check out co-star Peter Sarsgaard’s Five Favorite Films.)Filth, starring James McAvoy and Jamie Bell in a dramedy about a crooked cop who tries to solve a murder while undermining his colleagues, is at 73 percent.The Grand Seduction, starring Brendan Gleeson and Taylor Kitsch in a comedy about a remote community’s attempts to convince a doctor to movie to town, is at 63 percent.The Life and Crimes of Doris Payne, a documentary portrait of a notorious jewel thief, is at 63 percent.Age of the Uprising, starring Mads Mikkelsen in a period drama about a merchant who vows revenge after being humiliated by a nobleman, is at 44 percent.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"shows, FXX, Century, Extras, OneApp, superhero, USA, Calendar, Apple, television","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Critics-Consensus-Maleficent-is-So-So-But-Jolie-is-Great"},{"id":"47508767785520","title":"Critics Consensus: Noah is a Fresh Take on an Old Tale","content":"Critics Consensusvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Critics Consensus: Noah is a Fresh Take on an Old TalePlus, Sabotage is too bloody; Cesar Chavez is too bloodless; Bad Words is vulgar fun; and The Grand Budapest Hotel is Certified Freshby Tim Ryan | March 27, 2014 |  CommentsThis week at the movies, we’ve got an Ark builder (Noah, starring Russell Crowe and Jennifer Connelly); an elite DEA agent (Sabotage, starring Arnold Schwarzenegger and Sam Worthington); a labor leader (Cesar Chavez, starring Michael Peña and John Malkovich); a full-service concierge (The Grand Budapest Hotel, starring Ralph Fiennes and Saoirse Ronan); and a grown-up spelling bee champ (Bad Words, starring Jason Bateman and Kathryn Hahn). What do the critics have to say?Noah 76%If you’re going to retell one of the most epic stories in human history, you’ve got to go big. That’s exactly what director Darren Aronofsky did with Noah, and critics say this ambitious adaptation of one of the Old Testament’s most familiar tales is visually majestic and powerfully acted, though the screen is so stuffed that the main narrative occasionally gets sidetracked. Russell Crowe stars as Noah, a devout man who lives in harmony with nature. When Noah has visions of an apocalyptic flood, he builds an Ark and hits the high seas, encountering some fearsome descendants of Cain along the way. The pundits say that while Noah‘s grasp can sometimes exceed its reach, it’s a robust, inventive re-imagining of a timeless legend. (Check out this week’s Total Recall, in which we run down some of cinema’s most memorable biblical epics.)Sabotage 22%Hollywood has turned out plenty of action films about morally ambiguous law enforcement agents, and critics say Sabotage offers little beyond an overabundance of gore to distinguish itself from the pack. After stealing a huge amount of cash during a raid, several members of a DEA unit are mysteriously murdered. It’s up to the team’s leader, John “Breacher” Wharton (Arnold Schwarzenegger), to find out who’s responsible. The pundits say the actors are fine, but Sabotage is predictably plotted and cynically violent. (Check out our video interviews with the cast and crew.)Cesar Chavez 38%Even the most extraordinary lives don’t follow a three-act structure, so it’s understandable that filmmakers must cut a few corners when making a biographical film. Unfortunately, critics say Cesar Chavez is an earnest but muted portrait of the influential labor leader that fails to capture its subject’s fire and complexity. The film follows Chavez (Michael Pena) during his extended campaign to secure better earnings and conditions for migrant farm workers in California. The pundits say Cesar Chavez serves as a decent introduction to the man, but mostly it dramatizes his work and achievements without bringing them to vivid life.The Grand Budapest Hotel 92%Wes Anderson is undoubtedly one of contemporary cinema’s most distinctive stylists, and critics say he’s got another winner with em&gt;The Grand Budapest Hotel, a madcap, bittersweet period piece with outstanding performances from its illustrious cast. Ralph Fiennes stars as Gustave, a concierge at a swanky European hotel with an eccentric guest list. When Gustave’s rich octogenarian paramour bequeaths him an invaluable painting, he draws the ire of her outraged son; chaotic hilarity ensues. The pundits say the Certified Fresh Grand Budapest Hotel is laugh-out-loud funny, stylistically bold, and poignantly acted — in other words, what we’ve come to expect from Anderson, and more.Bad Words 65%Jason Bateman makes his directorial debut with Bad Words, and critics say that while this vulgar black comedy goes a little soft in the final stretch, it’s a fine showcase for the star’s sardonic, misanthropic persona. Bateman stars as Guy Trilby, a 40-something who finds a loophole that allows him to enter a national spelling bee. He proceeds to insult his juvenile competitors and appall their parents, while a reporter tries to discover what’s motivating his ruthless campaign. The pundits say Bad Words is both tasteless and slackly plotted, but it’s irreverent, well-acted, and often outrageously funny. (Check out 24 Frames for a gallery of actors with noteworthy debuts behind the camera.)Also opening this week in limited release:Brothers Hypnotic, a documentary about a band comprised of the offspring of jazz legend Phil Cohran, is at 100 percent.Mistaken for Strangers, a documentary about the relationship between the National singer Matt Berninger and his brother Tom, is at 86 percent.The Raid 2, an action flick about a cop who goes undercover to finish off the gang members who survived The Raid: Redemption, is at 78 percent.Hide Your Smiling Faces, a meditative drama about a pair of boys coming to terms with mortality, is at 75 percent.Breathe In, starring Guy Pearce and Felicity Jones in a drama about an exchange student whose arrival unsettles her American host family, is at 63 percent.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"movies, Kimmy","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Critics-Consensus-Noah-is-a-Fresh-Take-on-an-Old-Tale"},{"id":"47508767839806","title":"Critics Consensus: Anchorman 2: The Legend Continues is Certified Fresh","content":"Critics Consensusvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Critics Consensus: Anchorman 2: The Legend Continues is Certified FreshPlus, American Hustle, Saving Mr. Banks, Inside Llewyn Davis, the Selfish Giant, The Past, and Her are all Certified Fresh as well.by Tim Ryan | December 20, 2013 |  CommentsThis week at the movies, we’ve got a group of classy newsmen (Anchorman 2: The Legend Continues, starring Will Ferrell and Paul Rudd); a prehistoric family (Walking With Dinosaurs, with voice performances by John Leguizamo and Justin Long); Feds and con-artists (American Hustle, starring Jennifer Lawrence and Bradley Cooper); an uneasy artistic partnership (Saving Mr. Banks, starring Emma Thompson and Tom Hanks); and a struggling folksinger (Inside Llewyn Davis, starring Oscar Isaac and Carey Mulligan). What do the critics have to say?Anchorman 2: The Legend Continues 75%Both a goofy workplace comedy and a sly media satire, Anchorman: The Legend Of Ron Burgundy earned a dedicated cult following, though the call for a sequel escalated slowly. Well, the wait is over, and critics say Anchorman 2: The Legend Continues is pretty funny stuff; though it’s uneven and less quotable than its predecessor, it’s just as sublimely silly, and the talented cast riffs with energetic abandon. It’s the 1980s, and Ron Burgundy (Will Ferrell) and his old Channel 4 pals have been hired by a new 24-hour news network. Eschewing hard news, they focus on the sensational and the absurd — and garner big ratings in the process. The pundits say that 60 percent of the time, Anchorman 2: The Legend Continues works every time; note every joke works, but a good many do, resulting in an anarchic comedy with a thing or two to say about our contemporary media landscape. (Check out this week’s Total Recall for a roundown of memorable movie journalists, and watch our video interviews with the stars of Anchorman 2.)Walking With Dinosaurs 23%When you’ve made a movie featuring painstakingly, naturalistically rendered CG dinosaurs, what more do you need? How about wiseacre dialogue and slapstick gags? Critics say that’s exactly the trouble with Walking With Dinosaurs, in which majestic visuals are seriously undermined by pedestrian storytelling. Based on a well-regarded BBC series, Dinosaurs is the tale of a young Pachyrhinosaurus (voiced by Justin Long) who squabbles with his siblings, encounters predators, and falls in love. The pundits say the filmmakers seem to have worried that a quasi-nature documentary approach might have turned off the youngsters, but the narrative is so poorly executed that the end result isn’t all t hat entertaining, much less educational.American Hustle 92%Plenty of filmmakers have paid homage to GoodFellas over the years. Critics say that with American Hustle, director David O. Russell has done them all one better: he’s crafted a deliriously entertaining crime picture with enough rich performances and stylistic razzle dazzle to actually earn comparisons to Martin Scorsese’s masterpiece. Bradley Cooper stars as Richie, an FBI agent who busts Irving (Christian Bale) and Sydney (Amy Adams) for low-level grifting and subsequently enlists them, along with Irving’s unpredictable wife Rosalyn (Jennifer Lawrence), into a sting operation designed to ensnare corrupt New Jersey politicians. The pundits say the Certified Fresh American Hustle is filled with fascinating characters, witty dialogue, toe-tapping 1970s tunes, and a giddy momentum that’s deeply infectious. (Check out our video interviews with Cooper, Adams, Bale, and Jeremy Renner.)Saving Mr. Banks 79%As the old saying goes, never let the facts get in the way of a good story. The critics say that even though Saving Mr. Banks deviates significantly from the historical record, it still manages to be a heartwarming showbiz tale with outstanding performances from Emma Thompson and Tom Hanks. Mary Poppis author P.L. Travers (Thompson) reluctantly agrees to meet with Walt Disney (Hanks), who desperately wants to adapt her book for the screen. Travers is deeply skeptical of Disney’s plans, and he has to pull out all the stops to persuade her to collaborate on the film. The pundits say the Certified Fresh Saving Mr. Banks is funny, poignant, and perfectly acted, even if the sharp edges of the real-life story have been sanded off.Inside Llewyn Davis 92%The Coen brothers have made plenty of movies about embattled outsiders, and critics say Inside Llewyn Davis is one of the best of the bunch, a bittersweet, lushly photographed chronicle of a down-and-out folksinger that’s heartfelt and darkly comic in equal measure. Haunted by the death of his singing partner, Llewyn Davis (Oscar Isaac) is in the midst of a personal and professional slump; he has little money, no permanent address, a shortage of gigs, and a knack for snatching defeat from the jaws of victory. The pundits say the Certified Fresh Inside Llewyn Davis is an absorbing portrait of a struggling artist, stuffed with loving details that will delight music buffs. (Watch our video interviews with Isaac and co-star Carey Mulligan here.)Also opening this week in limited release:The New Rijksmuseum (Parts 1 and 2), a documentary between the renovation of the prominent Amsterdam art museum, is at 100 percent.The Selfish Giant, a drama about two British 13-year-olds who form a bond with a local scrapdealer, is Certified Fresh at 98 percent.The Past, starring Bérénice Bejo in a drama about a man who tries to get to the bottom of a shocking secret that affects his ex-wife and her family, is Certified Fresh at 95 percent.Spike Jonze‘s Her, starring Joaquin Phoenix and Scarlett Johansson in a sci-fi comedy about a man who falls in love with the voice on his computer, is at 90 percent., is Certified Fresh at 92 percent (read our interview with Phoenix here.).All The Light In The Sky, a drama about a middle-aged actress who becomes unsettled by a visit from her twentysomethng niece, is at 83 percent.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"Chilling, Certified, FirstLook, parents, CW, America, drama, TNT, GLAAD, Year, Extras, witnail, Pictures, Exclusive, Vudu","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"critics-consensus-anchorman-2-the-legend-continues-is-certified-fresh"},{"id":"47508767833660","title":"Critics Consensus: Guess Paranormal Activity: The Marked Ones‘ Tomatometer","content":"Critics Consensusvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Critics Consensus: Guess Paranormal Activity: The Marked Ones' TomatometerPlus, Beyond Outrage, The Best Offer, and Interior.

This week at the movies, we’ve got only one wide release: the found footage horror sequel Paranormal Activity: The Marked Ones, starring Andrew Jacobs and Molly Ephraim. What do the critics have to say?Paranormal Activity: The Marked Ones 39%We’d love to tell you what the critics thought of Paranormal Activity: The Marked Ones, but it was barely screened for critics prior to its release in theaters.

What do the critics have to say?Lone Survivor 75%War movies often traffic in epic, grandiose heroics, but Lone Survivor tells a more intimate story — that of dedicated soldiers at work. Critics say that perspective is refreshing, and the result is a film that’s visceral, immediate, and suspenseful — even if it’s a little short on character development. Based on a true story, the film chronicles an ill-fated mission by a group of Navy SEALs to track down a high-value Taliban target through a mountainous region in Afghanistan — a mission that turns deadly after the soldiers decide against firing on a group of civilians. The pundits say this well-crafted war film may not say much about the broader context of modern warfare, but such objectivity makes for an intense, ultimately thought-provoking experience. (Click through this week’s 24 Frames for a gallery of stars in uniform, and watch our video interview with Wahlberg and the other stars of Lone Survivor.)Her 94%With Being John Malkovich and Adaptation, Spike Jonze established himself as one of Hollywood’s most original filmmakers. And critics say he’s outdone himself with Her, taking a bizarre premise and turning it into a film that’s unique, funny, and deeply moving. Joaquin Phoenix stars as Theodore Twombly, a lovelorn writer who falls in love with OS1, his computer’s highly intelligent operating system (voiced by Scarlett Johansson). What follows is one of the strangest love stories in recent cinema. The pundits say the Certified Fresh Her is a one-of-a-kind experience: sometimes hilarious, sometimes somber, often thoughtful, and, finally, deeply resonant.The Legend of Hercules 5%It appears the folks behind The Legend of Hercules are concerned that the film is less than mighty, since it wasn’t screened for critics prior to its release. Kellan Lutz stars as the fabled hero, who must overcome exile, enslavement, and scary monsters before claiming the throne atop Mount Olympus. Time to guess the Tomatometer!

What do the critics have to say?Mr. Peabody &amp; Sherman 81%It’s never easy to stretch a series of shorts to feature-film length, especially when the source material is largely unfamiliar to its intended audience. Fortunately, critics say Mr. Peabody &amp; Sherman is a mostly successful big screen adaptation, with enough cleverness and goofy action to please kids and their parents. Canine genius Mr. Peabody (voiced by Ty Burrell) and his adopted charge Sherman (Max Charles) use the WABAC machine to travel back in time and ensure that history’s greatest moments happen as they should. However, when Sherman takes the machine for a joyride to impress a classmate, it’s up to his doggie guardian to rescue him. The critics say Mr. Peabody &amp; Sherman sometimes strains to maintain the inspired lunacy of the original cartoons, but most of the time, it’s bright, funny, exciting, and heartfelt. (Check out this week’s Total Recall, in which we run down some memorable time travel movies, as well as our interviews with the cast.)300: Rise of an Empire 45%If you’re in the mood stylized bloodshed, you’re in luck: 300: Rise of an Empire is chock full of beheadings, hacked-off limbs, and gallons of blood. But critics say beyond its admittedly impressive visuals, the film is short on the heroic bombast of its predecessor. This time out, it’s a band of plucky seafaring Greeks, lead by Themistokles (Sullivan Stapleton) against the mighty Persian navy, headed by Artemisia (Eva Green); as we eventually learn through a series of flashbacks, this fight is partially driven by personal animosity. The pundits say Green is fantastic as a bellicose she-devil, but little resonates in 300: Rise of an Empire beyond the lovingly rendered killings and decapitations.

This week at the movies, we’ve got futuristic law enforcement (RoboCop, starring Joel Kinnaman and Gary Oldman); a star-crossed romance (Endless Love, starring Alex Pettyfer and Gabriella Wilde); a time-spanning battle between good and evil (Winter’s Tale, starring Colin Farrell and Jennifer Connelly), and the complexities of love (About Last Night, starring Kevin Hart and Regina Hall). What do the critics have to say?RoboCop 48%A wicked satire disguised as a sci-fi action flick, Paul Verhoeven‘s RoboCop was one of the most brutal and subversive mainstream films of the late 1980s. The best critics can say for the new RoboCop is that it’s well-acted and reasonably exciting, but it lacks the visceral grit that made the original so compelling. When Detroit detective Alex Murphy (Joel Kinnaman) is badly injured on the job, a military contractor fits him with a robot exoskeleton in an attempt to create the ultimate crime fighter. The pundits say RoboCop is sleek and competent, but it’s short on the risk-taking verve of its predecessor. (Check out this week’s 24 Frames for a gallery of movie cyborgs.)Endless Love 16%The original Endless Love was no great shakes, but it at least earned points for audacity. Critics say the biggest problem with this remake is that it’s pretty bland, lacking the passion and energy to make this anything other than a middling melodrama. Alex Pettyfer and Gabriella Wilde stars as teenagers from different sides of the tracks who fall in love, but complications ensue when her dad demands she break up with him. The pundits say Endless Love boasts some solid supporting performances, but it’s hobbled by a predictable plot and a shortage of fireworks./m/endless_love/Winter’s Tale 13%Winter’s Tale has it all: time travel, magic realism, deathless passion, and even Satan himself. What it lacks, critics say, is logic, coherence, and restraint, and the result is an unintentionally funny schmaltz-fest that’s more likely to inspire befuddlement than swooning. It’s 1915, and Peter (Colin Farrell) has fallen in love with Beverly (Jessica Brown Findlay) while robbing her family’s mansion. When she dies of consumption, he finds himself in the present-day, where he bonds with Virginia (Jennifer Connelly) and tries to escape a demon (Russell Crowe). The pundits say Winter’s Tale looks pretty, but it’s so over-earnest and inexplicable that it ultimately falls far short of its ambitious aims. (Check out our video interview with the cast of Winter’s Tale, as well as this week’s Total Recall, in which we count down Connelly’s best-reviewed movies.)About Last Night 69%Plenty of movies capture the buzz of infatuation at the beginning of a love affair. What makes About Last Night special, critics say, is that it’s also wise about the ups and downs that follow — and it’s often hilarious to boot. The movie follows Danny (Michael Ealy) and Debbie (Joy Bryant) from their first meeting to an eventual break up; meanwhile, their friends Bernie (Kevin Hart) and Joan (Regina Hall) share a combustible bond of their own. The pundits say About Last Night doesn’t reinvent the romantic comedy wheel, but it’s refreshingly honest and insightful, and it provides a fine showcase for Hart’s onscreen talents.Also opening this week in limited release:The New Black, a documentary about the campaign to drum up African American support for same-sex marriage in Maryland, is at 78 percent.The Returned, a sci-fi thriller in which a medicine used to contain a zombie outbreak is running low, is at 60 percent.Lucky Bastard, a found-footage thriller about a porn website that recruits a contest winner for a voyeuristic and humiliating film, is at 58 percent.Jimmy P., starring Benicio Del Toro and Mathieu Amalric in a drama about an anthropologist who treats a World War II vet who suffered a debilitating head injury, is at 50 percent.Adult World, starring Emma Roberts and John Cusack in a comedy about a recent college grad and aspiring poet who reluctantly takes a job at an adult bookstore, is at 44 percent.Easy Money: Hard to Kill, starring Joel Kinnaman in a crime drama about an ex-con who sinks deeper into the drug trade, is at 27 percent.Girl On A Bicycle, a romantic comedy about an engaged bus driver who falls for a woman he accidentally injures, is at zero percent.Finally, props to Alex Meyer for guessing Vampire Academy‘s 10 percent Tomatometer.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"Pictures, VICE, Animation","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Critics-Consensus-RoboCop-is-Half-Man-Half-Machine-Half-Fresh"},{"id":"47508767835709","title":"Critics Consensus: The Wolf of Wall Street is Certified Fresh","content":"Critics Consensusvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Critics Consensus: The Wolf of Wall Street is Certified FreshPlus, Walter Mitty is sincere but uneven, Grudge Match and 47 Ronin lose the battle, Mandela is well-acted, and Believe was not screened for critics.by Tim Ryan | December 23, 2013 |  CommentsMerry Christmas! This week at the movies, we’ve got a financial fraudster (The Wolf of Wall Street, starring Leonardo DiCaprio and Jonah Hill); a timid daydreamer (The Secret Life Of Walter Mitty, starring Ben Stiller and Kristen Wiig); a pair of aging prizefighters (Grudge Match, starring Sylvester Stallone and Robert De Niro); a legendary warrior (47 Ronin, starring Keanu Reeves and Hiroyuki Sanada); a pop music sensation (the documentary Justin Bieber’s Believe); and a human rights hero (Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom, starring Idris Elba and Naomie Harris). What do the critics have to say?The Wolf of Wall Street 79%Martin Scorsese knows how to capture the vicarious allure of criminality better than just about any other filmmaker. Critics say he’s in fine form with The Wolf of Wall Street, a slick, sleek, and surprisingly funny tale of financial fraud that features a riveting performance from Leonardo DiCaprio. The film follows the rise of Jordan Belfort (DiCaprio), the founder of a boiler room that sold worthless stocks to naïve customers. Belfort’s ill-gotten gains finance a staggering level of conspicuous debauchery, but he’s shrewd enough to stay one step ahead of the government — for a while, anyway. The pundits say the Certified Fresh Wolf of Wall Street has the hyperkinetic energy you’d expect from Scorsese, but what distinguishes it from past triumphs is its wild, ribald sense of humor.The Secret Life Of Walter Mitty 51%For all its evocative detail, James Thurber’s 1939 short story The Secret Life Of Walter Mitty is pretty brief, so it takes an imagination worthy of the title character to extend it to feature film length. Critics say Ben Stiller’s fantasy world looks great and has an optimistic tone, but its story often feels episodic and tonally uneven. Stiller stars as a reverie-prone Life magazine photo editor with problems at work: he’s derided by his boss, he’s got an unrequited crush on a co-worker (Kristen Wiig), and he can’t find an image that’s set to run in the next issue. He escapes into a globe-spanning fantasyland of his own creation — which might be just the thing that snaps him out of his rut. The pundits say that The Secret Life of Walter Mitty is well-meaning and ambitious, but it pushes its emotional buttons too hard to make up for a slight story.Grudge Match 31%Sylvester Stallone and Robert De Niro played two of cinema’s most iconic boxers, and Grudge Match purports to be a lighthearted fantasy bout between Rocky Balboa and Jake “The Raging Bull” LaMotta. Unfortunately, critics say it’s more tomato can than contender — a film with a promising premise that rarely punches above its weight. Thirty years after hanging up the gloves after splitting their two matchups, bitter rivals Henry “Razor” Sharp (Stallone) and Billy “The Kid” McDonnen (De Niro) have a fisticuffs-filled reunion while performing motion capture for a video game. When news of their punch-up spreads, the two fighters agree to a long-delayed rubber match — and a lot more than pride is on the line. The pundits say Grudge Match is sporadically funny but surprisingly lumbering, its strong cast largely mired in a plot that’s overrun with clichés.47 Ronin 16%From the silent era to the present, the tale of the 47 Ronin has inspired some of Japan’s greatest filmmakers. Now it gets a big-budget Western adaptation, but unfortunately, critics say the human element gets lost under a barrage of overblown CGI effects. When a disgraced feudal lord is compelled to commit suicide after a confrontation with a corrupt official, his disgraced followers (a group that includes an orphaned swashbuckler played by Keanu Reeves). The pundits say 47 Ronin is a surprisingly dull fantasy adventure, one that leaves its talented international cast stranded within one dimensional roles.Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom 62%Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom goes into wide release this week, and critics say it’s a decent if not always inspired look at Nelson Mandela’s life that’s bolstered by a terrific central performance by Idris Elba in the title role. Based upon Mandela’s autobiography, the film follows the South African political leader’s life from his early activism to his time in prison to his election to president in the first post-Apartheid elections. The pundits say the Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom tries to cover too much ground in the great man’s life, but it’s a sincere and powerfully acted biopic that serves as a good first step for those who want to learn more about one of the great human rights champions or our era.Justin Bieber’s Believe 53%Sorry, Beliebers: we’d love to tell you what the critics thought of Justin Bieber’s Believe, but it wasn’t screened for critics prior to its release in theaters. If Bieber’s previous doc, Never Say Never, captured the rise of the pop star, Believe purports to show how his world has changed now that he’s on the cusp of adulthood.

What do the critics have to say?Out of the Furnace 54%Gritty, moody, and populated by a cast of A-listers, Out of the Furnace promises a higher class of pulp than your average vengeance thriller. But critics say that while the actors imbue their characters with heft, they’re stuck with an uneven script that serves up many fine moments but fails to fully cohere. Bale stars as Russell, a steel worker whose brother Rodney (Casey Affleck) has just come home from Iraq. But when Rodney disappears after falling in with a local criminal organization, Russell goes looking for him — a search that leads him to Harlan (Woody Harrelson), the gang’s brutal ringleader. The pundits say that Out of the Furnace is raw and atmospheric, but it’s inconsistently paced and occasionally melodramatic. (Check out this week’s Total Recall, in which we count down Bale’s best-reviewed films.)Also opening this week in limited release:The Coen brothers‘ Inside Llewyn Davis, starring Oscar Isaac and Carey Mulligan in a dramedy about a troubled singer trying to make it in the early 1960s Greenwich Village folk scene, is Certified Fresh at 95 percent (check out executive music producer T Bone Burnett’s Five Favorite Soundtracks).White Reindeer, a comedy about a suburban woman who bonds with the stripper her late husband was having an affair with, is at 94 percent (check out director Zach Clark’s Five Favorite films here).Ulrich Seidl‘s Paradise: Hope, a drama about a 13-year-old who finds love at a camp for overweight teenagers, is at 90 percent.Lenny Cooke, a documentary about the rise and fall of a celebrated high school basketball star, is at 87 percent.S#x Acts, a drama about a high school student who is sexually exploited by a group of classmates, is at 67 percent.Adventures of the Penguin King 3D, a documentary about the mating cycle of penguins, is at 50 percent.Swerve, a thriller about a man who gets caught up in a deadly situation after discovering a briefcase full of money at the scene of a car wreck, is at 43 percent.Crave, starring Ron Perlman and Edward Furlong in a psychological thriller about a freelance photographer profoundly affected by the urban violence around him, is at 38 percent.The Last Days On Mars, starring Liev Schreiber and Matt Dillon in a sci-fi horror film about a group of astronauts who discover a dangerous life form on the red planet, is at 24 percent.Twice Born, starring Penelope Cruz and Emile Hirsch in a drama about a love affair during the Bosnian war, is at 25 percent.Caught in the Web, a drama about a young woman who becomes the target of internet vigilantes after a video of her misdeeds goes viral, is at zero percent.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"Geographic, 2018, romance, 007, Channel, Awards, book, elevated, fresh, Network, and, biography, Tumblr, casting, serial","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Critics-Consensus-Out-of-the-Furnace-is-Tough-but-Uneven"},{"id":"47508767819321","title":"Critics Consensus: Guess I, Frankenstein‘s Tomatometer","content":"Critics Consensusvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Critics Consensus: Guess I, Frankenstein's TomatometerPlus, Gimme Shelter is earnest but clumsy, and Gloria is Certified Fresh.by Tim Ryan | January 23, 2014 |  CommentsThis week at the movies, we’ve got only one new wide release: the dark fantasy adventure I, Frankenstein, starring Aaron Eckhart and Bill Nighy. What do the critics have to say?I, Frankenstein 5%Apparently, the folks behind I, Frankenstein were concerned that the critics would respond to the film like torch-wielding villagers, so they decided not to screen it prior to its release in theaters.

What do the critics have to say?Ender’s Game 62%Adapting a beloved novel to the big screen is often a dicey proposition. That said, critics feel that Ender’s Game does a pretty good job of bringing its source material to cinematic life, with strong performances and a thoughtful tone that helps to make up for occasional stretches of solemnity and dullness. Earth is under siege from alien invaders, and the fate of humanity rests on the shoulders of Ender (Asa Butterfield), a bullied teenager whose precocious gifts are cultivated in order to devise a strategy to defeat the enemy. The pundits say Ender’s Game isn’t always emotionally rousing, but it’s still a smart, visually exciting sci-fi film that should (mostly) please fans of Orson Scott Card’s book. (Watch our video interviews with Ford, Butterfield, Viola Davis, and Hailee Steinfeld.)Free Birds 20%The idea of an animated action comedy starring turkeys is pretty funny in theory. Unfortunately, critics say that in practice, Free Birds is thin stuff; with its slack pace and less-than-inspired story, this is one turkey toon that never takes flight. Pampered Reggie (voiced by Owen Wilson) and activist Jake (Woody Harrelson) team up to travel back in time to the first Thanksgiving in order to kill the annual tradition of eating turkeys before it starts. The pundits say little kids might enjoy Free Birds, but their parents are likely to find the animation underwhelming and the jokes a bit flat.Last Vegas 46%A lot of people go to Vegas in search of a wild, unpredictable good time. Unfortunately, critics say Last Vegas plays things way too safe; while the combined talents of Michael Douglas, Robert De Niro, Morgan Freeman, Kevin Kline, and Mary Steenburgen keep things amiably watchable, the film never ventures outside its comfort zone. Douglas plays a longtime bachelor who’s finally tying the knot, so he meets up with a group of longtime buddies in Sin City to celebrate; revelry and reflection ensue. The pundits say the cast of Last Vegas makes for good company, but there are few surprises to be found on this trip. (Check out this week’s Total Recall, in which we count down Kline’s best-reviewed movies).Also opening this week in limited release:These Birds Walk, a documentary about a home for Pakistani street children, is at 100 percent.The Pervert’s Guide To Ideology, a documentary in which philosopher Slavoj Zizek riffs on the subtexts undergirding a vast array of popular movies, is at 94 percent.Dallas Buyers Club, starring Matthew McConaughey and Jared Leto in a drama about a man seeking treatment for HIV in the early days of the epidemic, is Certified Fresh at 94 percent.Casting By, a doc about the world of Hollywood casting directors, is at 90 percent.Belgian import The Broken Circle Breakdown, a drama that follows the highs and lows in the relationship between two bluegrass musicians, is at 83 percent.Aftermath, a drama about two brothers who suffer repercussions from their community after digging into the town’s past, is at 75 percent.In the Name Of…, a drama about a young priest who struggles with matters of the flesh while running a halfway house for troubled teens, is at 71 percent.Man of Tai Chi, directed by and starring Keanu Reeves in a martial arts film about a young fighter who competes in an underground fight club, is at 71 percent.Mr. Nobody, starring Jared Leto and Diane Kruger in a sci-fi drama about the repercussions of a child choosing which parent to live with, is at 71 percent.About Time, starring Domhnall Gleeson and Rachel McAdams in a romantic comedy about a guy whose relationship with a beautiful woman is constantly stymied by time-travel problems, is at 65 percent.Running From Crazy, a documentary about Mariel Hemingway and her attempts to come to terms wither famous family’s history, is at 44 percent.Last Love, starring Michael Caine in a dramedy about the relationship between a lonely professor and a plucky young dancer, is at 40 percentBig Sur, starring Kate Bosworth and Josh Lucas in an adaptation of Jack Kerouac’s novel, is at 38 percent.Diana, starring Naomi Watts in a biopic of the Princess of Wales, is at nine percent.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"spanish, in, independent","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Critics-Consensus-Enders-Game-is-Thoughtful-and-Well-Acted"},{"id":"47508770459202","title":"Critics Consensus: The Hunger Games: Catching Fire Is Certified Fresh","content":"Critics Consensusvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Critics Consensus: The Hunger Games: Catching Fire Is Certified FreshPlus, Delivery Man is good-hearted but uneven.by Tim Ryan | November 21, 2013 |  CommentsThis week at the movies, we’ve got teenage warriors (The Hunger Games: Catching Fire, starring Jennifer Lawrence and Josh Hutcherson) and a prolific sperm donor (Delivery Man, starring Vince Vaughn and Cobie Smulders). What do the critics have to say?The Hunger Games: Catching Fire 90%Catching fire is right — critics say the second installment of The Hunger Games is bigger and better than its predecessor in virtually every way, from the outstanding performances from its committed cast to its impeccable set design to a palpable sense of dread and urgency that imbues the material with more gravitas than your average blockbuster franchise. After winning the Hunger Games in part one, Katniss (Jennifer Lawrence) and Peeta (Josh Hutcherson) have become wildly popular figures for the nation’s beleaguered underclass. Fearing that revolution is nigh, President Snow (Donald Sutherland) contrives a plan: the two young champions will have to compete against an all-star lineup of past Hunger Games victors. The pundits say the Certified Fresh The Hunger Games: Catching Fire is energetic, thoughtful, and tense, and at its center is Lawrence, whose commanding performance solidifies her status as one of Hollywood’s brightest young stars. (Watch our video interviews with the stars of Catching Fire; click through our gallery of movies based on young adult novels; and read this week’s Total Recall, in which we count down Sutherland’s best-reviewed movies.)Delivery Man 40%Vince Vaughn has made a career out of playing charming, mischievous bros, and critics say he’s in fine form in Delivery Man. Unfortunately, they also note that the rest of the film is a bit uneven, as its wacky premise and sentimental execution result in an uneasy mix. Vaughn stars as a committed slacker whose life spins out of control when he discovers that as a result of decades-old sperm donations, he’s the father of more than 500 children. Does our hero have what it takes to man up and be a father figure to his biological offspring? The pundits say Delivery Man is sweet and affable, but it’s only occasionally as funny and heart-tugging as it’s trying to be.

What do the critics have to say?The Counselor 33%On paper, The Counselor‘s pedigree is impeccable: its credits include a top-notch director (Ridley Scott), an A-list cast (Michael Fassbender, Penelope Cruz, Brad Pitt, Javier Bardem, Cameron Diaz), and a screenplay from a Pulitzer Prize-winning novelist (Cormac McCarthy). However, critics say the result is a bit of a jumble, a collection of eccentric performances and interesting scenes that never fully coheres into a strong narrative. Fassbender stars as a financially strapped lawyer who invests in a risky drug deal; when the transaction is inevitably botched, our hero plunges into a demimonde of sketchy characters and increasingly desperate straits. The pundits say The Counselor is never less than watchable, but its dour tone and occasionally confusing storyline keeps the story from being fully absorbing. (Flip through this week’s 24 Frames for a gallery of the best and worst movie lawyers.)Jackass Presents: Bad Grandpa 61%It appears that Johnny Knoxville has taken the words of Dylan Thomas to heart; playing a misanthropic old man in Jackass Presents: Bad Grandpa, he does not go gentle into that good night. And critics say that’s mostly a good thing, for while this Borat-esque hidden camera comedy is pretty hit-and-miss, it still offers plenty of rude, ribald fun. There’s a loose storyline this time — Knoxville stars as Irving Zisman, a mischievous 86-year-old on a road trip with his grandson Billy (Jackson Nicoll) — but it’s mostly an excuse to string together a series of outrageous gags that shock unsuspecting onlookers. The pundits say Jackass Presents: Bad Grandpa rises and falls on the strength of its jokes, but some of them are gleefully, shockingly crude, and Nicoll nearly steals the show with his pitch-perfect comedic chops.

What do the critics have to say?Carrie 50%The original Carrie holds a special place in the hearts of horror buffs, so a remake is inherently fraught with peril. And critics say that while director Kimberly Peirce turns in a respectable effort, there’s little in this new Carrie that feels necessary. Chloe Grace Moretz stars as the title character, a teenage outcast with a demanding mom and telekinetic powers. Will the snobby kids at Carrie’s school learn not to mess with her? The pundits say Carrie is competently made, but does little to distinguish itself from Brian De Palma’s beloved original film. (Check out this week’s Total Recall, in which we run down some memorable horror movie remakes.)Escape Plan 50%God bless Sly and Arnie; it’s pretty inspiring to see the 1980s’ two biggest action stars still slugging it out well into their sixties. That said, critics feel Escape Plan isn’t the best vehicle for their talents; despite a few decent thrills, it’s a middling action flick with a flimsy plot and an overall lack of panache. Stallone stars as a security expert who’s been wrongly imprisoned, so he teams up with a fellow inmate (Schwarzenegger) and devises a plan to bust out. The pundits say the stars keep Escape Plan watchable, but they’re ultimately defeated by inert pacing and a by-the-numbers script.The Fifth Estate 35%Like The Social Network, The Fifth Estate is a ripped-from-the-headlines drama about how new technology is impacting our lives. Unfortunately, critics say that despite an impressive performance from Benedict Cumberbatch, this dramatic retelling of the WikiLeaks story is ill-prepared to tackle the issues it raises. Julian Assange (Cumberbatch) and hacker Daniel Domscheit-Berg (Daniel Brühl) create a site to publish clandestine information. However, when WikiLeaks scores a series of big scoops that infuriate the powerful, the site’s founders become divided on their mission and motives. The pundits say The Fifth Estate is a mostly skin-deep examination of the ethical questions that Assange raised, one that fails to bring its characters to life, despite the best efforts of a strong cast.Also opening this week in limited release:Steve McQueen‘s 12 Years a Slave, starring Chiwetel Ejiofor and Michael Fassbender in a drama about a free man who is kidnapped and sold into slavery, is Certified Fresh at 97 percent.All Is Lost, starring Robert Redford as a man whose boat is lost at sea, is Certified Fresh at 94 percent.An American Promise, a documentary about a pair of African American students in an exclusive and predominantly white private school, is at 89 percent.Big Ass Spider!, a creature feature about two guys trying to stop a huge arachnid from destroying Los Angeles, is at 80 percent.Kill Your Darlings, starring Daniel Radcliffe and Dane DeHaan in a drama about a murder within the circle of associates that would become the Beat Generation, is at 76 percent.Camille Claudel, 1915, starring Juliette Binoche in a biopic of the great sculptor, is at 67 percent.Haunter, starring Abigail Breslin in a ghost story about a teenager forced to relive the same day for eternity, is at 56 percent.2 Jacks, starring Danny Huston and Sienna Miller in a recreation of a Leo Tolstoy short story set in the golden age of Hollywood, is at 44 percent.Paradise, starring Julianne Hough and Octavia L.

What do the critics have to say?Prisoners 81%A dark, grim police procedural, Prisoners isn’t exactly feel-good cinema. However, critics say it’s a suspenseful, gripping thriller, thanks to an outstanding ensemble cast and a mystery that remains ambiguous to the end. Keller Dover (Hugh Jackman) is the father of a six-year-old girl who goes missing, along with her best friend. A suspect is arrested, but released for lack of evidence; fearing the worst for his child, Dover decides to take the law into his own hands. The pundits say the Certified Fresh Prisoners is haunting, tense, and disturbing, with a weighty sense of moral complexity. (Check out this week’s Total Recall, in which we count down co-star Jake Gyllenhaal’s best-reviewed moviesBattle of the Year 6%Nobody goes to a dance movie expecting high art, but critics say Battle of the Year is flimsy even by the standards of the genre, spending too much time on its hackneyed story and not enough on the dancefloor. With an international dance competition only months away, a down-on-his-luck basketball coach (Josh Holloway) is recruited to coax a squad of 12 street dancers into fighting shape. Will this ragtag band of breakers bring home the title — and will their coach find a measure of personal redemption in the process? The pundits say Battle of the Year delivers a few slick dance moves, but its plot is hopelessly hokey and the dialogue is unintentionally hilarious.Also opening this week in limited release:The Wizard of Oz: An IMAX 3D Experience, starring Judy Garland in a timeless classic about a girl who isn’t in Kansas anymore, is Certified Fresh at 99 percent.Enough Said, starring Julia Louis-Dreyfus and James Gandolfini in a drama about a divorced woman who meets a man who seems perfect until she finds out a little more about him, is Certified Fresh at 93 percent.After Tiller, a documentary that profiles doctors that perform late-term abortions, is at 85 percent.Generation Iron, a doc about the world of professional bodybuilders, is at 80 percent.The Short Game, a doc about the highly competitive world of junior golf, is at 78 percent.C.O.G., a dramedy based on a David Sedaris story about a man who ditches his modern devices and works as an apple picker in Oregon, is at 74 percent.Haute Cuisine, a comedy about a little-known provincial chef who becomes the French president’s personal cook, is at 71 percent.Thanks For Sharing, starring Mark Ruffalo and Gwyneth Paltrow in a dramedy about the lives of an interconnected group of recovering sex addicts, is at 57 percent.Ip Man: The Final Fight, an action drama about the legendary martial arts master in the twilight of his life, is at 58 percent.A Single Shot, starring Sam Rockwell and Jeffrey Wright in a thriller about a hunter who inadvertently kills a woman and tries to cover it up, is at 52 percent.Men at Lunch, a documentary about the famous photograph Lunch atop a Skyscraper, is at 50 percent.Newlyweeds, a comedy about a young couple that smokes an awful lot of marijuana, is at 44 percent.My Lucky Star, starring Zhang Ziyi in a spy spoof about a cartoonist who gets involved in a plot to obtain a valuable diamond, is at 44 percent.Zaytoun, starring Stephen Dorff in a drama about an Israeli pilot who travels with a Palestinian orphan to see the kid’s family’s hometown, is at 39 percent.Weekender, a dramedy about a pair of friends who organize warehouse raves in the early 1990s, is at nine percent.The Colony, starring Laurence Fishburne and Bill Paxton in a sci-fi thriller set in a post-apocalyptic ice age, is at six percent.Jewtopia, starring Jennifer Love Hewitt and Jamie-Lynn Sigler in a romantic comedy about a guy who pretends to be Jewish in order to win the heart of a rabbi’s daughter, is at zero percent.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"Hulu, who","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"critics-consensus-prisoners-is-certified-fresh"},{"id":"47508772029006","title":"Critics Consensus: One Direction: This Is Us is Lightweight But Entertaining","content":"Critics Consensusvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Critics Consensus: One Direction: This Is Us is Lightweight But EntertainingPlus, Getaway crashes and burns, and Closed Circuit is well-acted but not quite suspenseful enough.by Tim Ryan | August 29, 2013 |  CommentsThis week at the movies, we’ve got a popular boy band (the concert documentary One Direction: This Is Us), a desperate ex-racecar driver (Getaway, starring Ethan Hawke and Selena Gomez), and attorneys under surveillance (Closed Circuit, starring Eric Bana and Rebecca Hall). What do the critics have to say?One Direction: This Is Us 63%If you’re a diehard fan of English/Irish pop sensations One Direction, no movie reviewer is likely to dissuade you from seeing One Direction: This Is Us. If, however, you’re a parent or significant other who gets dragged to the theater, critics say there’s a decent chance you’ll find this slick, well-shot, admittedly skin-deep concert documentary to be reasonably entertaining. Directed by Morgan Spurlock (of Super Size Me fame), the film follows the group from its X-Factor beginnings to the big time, capturing the lads on stage in full 3D splendor. The pundits say that while One Direction: This Is Us is hardly muckraking (or even revelatory), it’s a well-assembled and visually striking look at one of pop’s hottest contemporary acts. (Take a look at this week’s 24 Frames for a gallery of music documentaries.)Getaway 3%Rarely does a film’s title serve as an inadvertent warning, but critics say that’s pretty much the deal with Getaway –audiences should get away from this borderline incompetent chase thriller at all costs. Ethan Hawke stars as an ex racecar driver whose wife has been abducted; to save her, he must follow the orders of the kidnapper (Jon Voight) and drive around Sofia, Bulgaria with a would-be carjacker (Selena Gomez) in tow. The pundits say Getaway is an implausible, suspense-free mess, and its chase sequences are ineptly staged and photographed. (Check out this week’s Total Recall, in which we count down Voight’s best-reviewed movies.)Closed Circuit 43%The time would seem ripe for a smart thriller about government surveillance; unfortunately, critics say Closed Circuit, while well-acted, is smart without being particularly thrilling. Eric Bana and Rebecca Hall star as attorneys and former sweethearts who find their loyalties tried and their lives in danger when they join the defense team of an accused terrorist; as they investigate the case, they find themselves under constant scrutiny. The pundits say Closed Circuit raises some interesting issues, but its plot is alternately predictable and far-fetched.

What do the critics have to say?The Best Man Holiday 70%Sometimes it feels good to see familiar faces from the past, even if you don’t have anything new to talk about. Critics say that’s essentially the case with The Best Man Holiday, a predictable comedy that benefits immeasurably from its outstanding ensemble cast and an overall sense of goodwill. Holiday reunites the stars from 1999’s The Best Man (Taye Diggs, Nia Long, Morris Chestnut, Terrence Howard, Sanaa Lathan, and more) for a yuletide get-together during which once-supressed passions are reignited and long-simmering grievances bubble over. The pundits say that while much of The Best Man Holiday is syrupy and conventional, the end result is likeable and satisfying, thanks to warm-hearted performances and a few big laughs.

What do the critics have to say?Gravity 95%It’s too soon to tell whether Gravity will join 2001 and Apollo 13 in the pantheon of classic films featuring astronauts in peril. What we can say for certain, however, is that critics are over the moon for Alfonso Cuarón’s outer space thriller, calling it a marvel of technical wizardry, white-knuckle tension, and emotional resonance. Sandra Bullock and George Clooney star as a pair of astronauts who become stranded in the atmosphere when an unexpected debris shower destroys their shuttle and leaves them without a way to return to Earth. The pundits say the Certified Fresh Gravity is a singular movie achievement: it’s bold, immersive, formally trailblazing, and achingly moving. (Check out our interviews with Bullock and Cuarón, as well as our gallery of memorable movie astronauts.)Runner Runner 7%A great cast and an intriguing premise do not a successful thriller make. Critics say Runner Runner is a surprisingly dull, by-the-numbers crime film that is made only slightly more watchable by virtue of its tropical setting and its overqualified acting ensemble. Justin Timberlake stars as Richie, an Ivy Leaguer whose online poker winnings are financing his education. But when Richie gets scammed, he travels to Costa Rica to confront Ivan (Ben Affleck), the site’s CEO; soon enough, Richie is drawn into Ivan’s high-roller lifestyle. The pundits say Runner Runner is predictable, short on suspense, and unconvincing in its depiction of the gambling demimonde. (Check out this week’s Total Recall, in which we count down Affleck’s best-reviewed films.)Metallica Through the Never 79%After a week in limited release, the Certified Fresh Metallica Through the Never goes wide this weekend; critics say it’s one of the most inventively filmed, viscerally powerful concert documentaries to come along in quite some time — though they also note that its fictional narrative, which features Dane DeHaan as a young roadie who encounters a variety of strange situations and people while on a mission for the band, is slightly less assured. Still, the pundits say that even non-metalheads are likely to be impressed by the sheer power of Metalica’s live set, which is captured in eye-popping 3D.Also opening this week in limited release:A.K.A.

What do the critics have to say?2 Guns 65%It’s an old truism that audiences are generally willing to forgive even the most absurd plot developments if they enjoy spending time with the stars. Such is the case with 2 Guns, which critics say is a largely mindless, ridiculously convoluted action flick that benefits immeasurably from the chemistry between Denzel Washington and Mark Wahlberg. An undercover DEA agent (Washington) robs a bank with the help of a man (Wahlberg) who’s also undercover. But neither of them knows the other’s real identity, leading to a series of double-crosses and perilous scrapes for our heroes. The pundits say 2 Guns is hardly the most original or cohesive crime picture in the world, but thanks to the tough wisecracks that Washington and Wahlberg fire at one another, you’re likely to give the story a pass. (Check out this week’s Total Recall, in which we count down co-star Bill Paxton’s best-reviewed movies.)The Smurfs 2 14%Given that the reviews for the first Smurfs adventure were less than smurfy, it’s little wonder that the critics feel essentially the same about The Smurfs 2; namely, that this blend of cheesy one-liners, slapstick gags, and general tomfoolery may delight small children but holds limited appeal to anyone else. This time out, Smurfette is kidnapped by Gargamel’s newly-minted minions called Naughties, and Papa Smurf and the gang team up with human pal Patrick (Neil Patrick Harris) to save her. The pundits say The Smurfs 2 strands its talented cast in an indifferently animated and plotted sequel that’s even less inspired than its critically-derided predecessor. (Check out our video interviews with Smurfs 2 stars Harris and Hank Azaria.)Also opening this week in limited release:The Spectacular Now, starring Miles Teller and Shailene Woodley in a coming-of-age dramedy about a hard-partying high schooler who reconsiders his ways when he meets a more grounded classmate, is Certified Fresh at 93 percent.The Belgian import Our Children, a drama about a woman who cracks under the strain of her familial responsibilities, is at 93 percent.Smash &amp; Grab: The Story of the Pink Panthers, a documentary about a daring and prolific band of jewel thieves, is at 75 percent.Europa Report, starring Michael Nyqvist and Embeth Davidtz in a found-footage sci-fi thriller about a group of astronauts in search of life on one of Jupiter’s moons, is at 73 percent.When Comedy Went to School, a doc about the 1950s heyday of such comedians as Jerry Stiller, Jerry Lewis, and Sid Caesar, is at 69 percent.Cockneys vs Zombies, starring Harry Treadaway and Honor Blackman in a horror/comedy about a motley crew of working-class Brits working together to stave off a zombie attack, is at 68 percent.Rising From Ashes, a doc about a group of Rwandan cyclists and their strenuous preparations to qualify for the London Olympics, is at 67 percent.The Artist and the Model, starring Jean Rochefort and Claudia Cardinale in a World War II-era period drama about an aging sculptor who finds artistic inspiration from a young runaway, is at 50 percent.Drift, starring Sam Worthington in a drama about a family of Australian surfing pioneers, is at 29 percent.The Canyons, starring Lindsay Lohan and James Deen in a thriller about a movie producer who becomes jealous and possessive of his would-be actress girlfriend, is at 23 percent.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"Apple, prank, Set, witnail, Logo, miniseries, The, FOX, cars, science, Awards, awards, Kaling","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Critics-Consensus-2-Guns-Shoots-Wildly-But-Its-Stars-Connect"},{"id":"47508772054616","title":"Critics Consensus: Monsters University is Certified Fresh","content":"Critics Consensusvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Critics Consensus: Monsters University is Certified FreshPlus, World War Z is smart and tense, and The Bling Ring is stylish and lurid.by Tim Ryan | June 21, 2013 |  CommentsThis week at the movies, we’ve got collegiate creatures (Monsters University, with voice performances from Billy Crystal and John Goodman), worldwide walking dead (World War Z, starring Brad Pitt and Mireille Enos), and juvenile jewel thieves (The Bling Ring, starring Emma Watson and Leslie Mann). What do the critics have to say?Monsters University 80%It’s not unfair to say that Pixar isn’t quite what it used to be; the animation studio that dazzled audiences and critics hasn’t reached the dizzying creative heights of its 2000s heyday since 2010’s Toy Story 3. Still, a decent Pixar movie still beats practically everybody else in the multiplex, and critics say Monsters University is pleasant, funny, and visually resplendent, though it’s less imaginative than its predecessor. This prequel to Monsters Inc. shows how diminutive, one-eyed Mike (Billy Crystal) and imposing, blue-furred Sulley (John Goodman) became friends while studying how to frighten children in college. The pundits say the Certified Fresh Monsters University lacks the inventiveness of past triumphs, but it’s still warm, witty, and beautifully animated. (Check out this week’s Total Recall for a countdown of Goodman’s best-reviewed movies, as well as our interviews with the Monsters University cast and crew.)World War Z 66%Not every film with a tortured production history is a disaster waiting to happen. Take World War Z, for example: despite extensive reshoots and rescheduled release dates, critics say this is largely a smart horror adventure with several white-knuckle action scenes and a terrific performance from Brad Pitt that helps to offset its patchy narrative. When mankind is threatened by a global zombie outbreak, it’s up to ex-United Nations operative Gerry Lane (Pitt) to scour the planet to find the source of the pandemic. The pundits say World War Z sometimes feels overstuffed and under-developed, but for the most part, it’s brainy and visceral, with a palpable sense of dread. (Check out this week’s 24 Frames for a gallery of memorable zombie movies.)The Bling Ring 60%If Sofia Coppola is in the director’s chair, you can safely assume her characters will be young, rich, ennui-laden, or some combination thereof. Thus, the heist-happy teens featured in The Bling Ring would seemingly be the perfect Coppola characters, but critics are split; some find the film to be stylish and subversive, while others feel it’s shallow and tawdry. Based on a true story, The Bling Ring is the story of a group of teenagers who steal millions in cash and valuables from the homes of folks like including Paris Hilton, Lindsay Lohan, and Orlando Bloom. The pundits say there’s a tabloid fascination to this material that keeps things watchable, but the film’s moral detachment keeps the audience at arm’s length.Also opening this week in limited release:A Hijacking, a thriller about a Danish cargo ship commandeered by a group of Somali pirates, is Certified Fresh at 100 percent.The Attack, a drama about a prominent Israeli Palestinian whose wife is posthumously accused of being a suicide bomber, is at 92 percent.Unfinished Song, starring Gemma Arterton and Terence Stamp in a dramedy about a grumpy older guy who comes out of his shell when he joins a local choir, is at 64 percent.Maniac, starring Elijah Wood in a thriller about a withdrawn shop owner whose dark side is unleashed, is at 54 percent.The French import Three Worlds, a drama about disparate people who reconnect after a hit-and-run accident, is at 43 percent.Somm, a documentary about a group of wine experts working to pass the demanding Master Sommelier test, is at 33 percent.Rushlights, a thriller about a pair of teens who get into big trouble when they attempt to claim an inheritance under false pretenses, is at zero percent.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"Photos, the, caribbean, archives, AMC, BET, Stephen, Universal, travel, cinemax, FOX","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"critics-consensus-monsters-university-is-certified-fresh"},{"id":"47508772057689","title":"Critics Consensus: Man of Steel Is Up, Up, and Okay","content":"Critics Consensusvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Critics Consensus: Man of Steel Is Up, Up, and OkayPlus, This Is the End and Before Midnight are Certified Fresh.by Tim Ryan | June 14, 2013 |  CommentsThis week at the movies, we’ve got the return of Superman (Man of Steel, starring Henry Cavill and Amy Adams), an apocalyptic laugh-riot (This Is the End, starring James Franco and Seth Rogen), and a one-of-a-kind love affair (Before Midnight, starring Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy). What do the critics have to say?Man of Steel 56%Superman is arguably the definitive comic book hero, but few would argue that he’s had the kind of unqualified big-screen success as his DC buddy Batman. With Man of Steel, Zack Snyder attempts to update Supe for the 21st Century, but critics say he’s only moderately successful; the action scenes are often rousing and Henry Cavill brings an undeniable charisma to the character, but the film is weighted down by an overabundance of spectacle and a disappointing lack of wit. A child from the planet Krypton is sent to Earth, where he’s raised by the Kent family. He learns to utilize his incredible abilities for good, and becomes Superman in the process, but eventually, the nefarious General Zod goes looking for him. The pundits say Man of Steel delivers plenty of muscular action, but it’s overlong and unfortunately short on character development. (Check out this week’s Total Recall for a rundown of Superman movies, as well as our interviews with the Man of Steel cast and crew.)This Is the End 83%Take a bunch of well-known comic actors, stick them in the midst of the apocalypse, and mix liberally. That’s the basic recipe for This Is the End, which critics say is a rapid-fire, absurdist meta-comedy that’s raunchy and surprisingly heartfelt in equal measure. Playing themselves, James Franco, Seth Rogen, Jonah Hill, Craig Robinson and a few other famous pals are partying together when the Rapture hits Los Angeles. Our heroes embark on a cameo-laden quest for salvation, and learn the true meaning of friendship along the way. The pundits say the Certified Fresh This Is the End has so many gags that a few inevitably miss the mark, but for the most part, this is a smart, boundary-pushing comedy from an ensemble that seems to be enjoying every minute of it. (Check out this week’s 24 Frames for a gallery of actors playing themselves, as well as our interview with stars Rogen, Robinson, and Jay Baruchel.)Before Midnight 98%In Before Sunrise, Jesse (Ethan Hawke) and Celine (Julie Delpy) were two young travelers who formed a bond after a chance meeting in Vienna. In Before Sunset, they were older, wiser, but no less enamored with one another. Now, in Before Midnight, they’re married and hoping to recapture the spark that first brought them together. The third installment in Richard Linklater‘s enduring love story goes wide this weekend, and critics say the Certified Fresh Before Midnight is as funny, insightful, and achingly poignant as its predecessors.Also opening this week in limited release:More Than Honey, a doc about the relationship between people and bees, is at 100 percent.Call Me Kuchu, a documentary about an openly gay man fighting persecution in Uganda, is at 95 percent.20 Feet From Stardom, a documentary tribute to some of rock’s finest backup singers, is at 94 percent.In the Fog, a World War II drama about a Russian village that suspects one of its citizens is collaborating with the Nazis, is at 86 percent.Far Out Isn’t Far Enough: The Tomi Ungerer Story, a documentary portrait of the influential illustrator, is at 80 percent.Berberian Sound Studio, a psychological thriller about a sound technician who becomes unnerved while working on a gruesome horror movie, is at 78 percent.Sofia Coppola‘s The Bling Ring, starring Emma Watson and Leslie Mann in the ripped-from-the-headlines tale of a group of teens who robbed various Hollywood stars, is at 63 percent.Pandora’s Promise, a doc about the potential environmental benefits of nuclear power, is at 58 percent.Hatchet III, the latest installment in the slasher series about a swamp-dwelling psycho, is at 56 percent.Vehicle 19, starring Paul Walker in a thriller about an ex-con who becomes a target when he takes the wrong rental car is at 33 percent.The Guillotines, a period action epic about a clandestine group of assassins who employ deadly metal blades, is at zero percent.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"dramedy, tv, TV+, latino","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Critics-Consensus-Man-of-Steel-Is-Up-Up-and-Okay"},{"id":"47508773444189","title":"Critics Consensus: Star Trek Into Darkness is Certified Fresh","content":"Critics Consensusvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Critics Consensus: Star Trek Into Darkness is Certified FreshPlus, Frances Ha is energetic and funny.by Tim Ryan | May 16, 2013 |  CommentsThis week at movies, we’ve got just one wide release: J.J. Abrams‘ Star Trek Into Darkness, starring Chris Pine and Zachary Quinto as Captain Kirk and Mister Spock, respectively. What do the critics have to say?Star Trek Into Darkness 84%As the 2009 Star Trek reboot demonstrated, this is not your father’s Enterprise — director J.J. Abrams has largely ditched the allegorical deepthink of the TV series for more visceral sci-fi thrills. And critics say that strategy pays off again with Star Trek Into Darkness, a sequel that delivers in excitement and spectacle what it lacks in depth. This time out, it’s up to the crew of the Enterprise to hunt down a mysterious adversary who has perpetrated an act of intergalactic terrorism — and who has ambitions to destroy the Starfleet. The pundits say the Certified Fresh Star Trek Into Darkness isn’t quite as thrilling as its predecessor, but it’s still an action-packed popcorn flick with witty dialogue and enough references to Trek lore to (mostly) placate diehards. (Check out this week’s Total Recall for a rundown of all the Star Trek movies, as well as a gallery of the stars of Into Darkness.)Also opening this week in limited release:The Fruit Hunters, a documentary about people who travel the globe in search of rare and delicious fruits, is at 100 percent.Noah Baumbach‘s Frances Ha, starring Greta Gerwig in a dramedy about an aspiring dancer in the midst of various personal tribulations, is at 90 percent.Augustine, a period drama about a kitchen maid suffering from seizures who attracts the interest of an influential neurologist, is at 86 percent.Becoming Traviata, a doc about an adventurous staging of Giuseppe Verdi’s opera, is at 75 percent.The South Korean import Pieta, a drama about a loan shark who’s visited by a mysterious woman claiming to be his mother, is at 71 percent.Black Rock, starring Kate Bosworth and Lake Bell in a thriller about a trio of friends on a camping trip who are pursued by vicious killers, is at 38 percent (check out our interview with the cast here).The English Teacher, starring Julianne Moore and Greg Kinnear in a drama about a reserved teacher who helps a gifted student to become a playwright, is at 30 percent.33 Postcards, starring Guy Pearce in a drama about a Chinese orphan who develops a friendship with her Australian sponsor and is pulled into his criminal schemes, is at 25 percent.Erased, starring Aaron Eckhart and Olga Kurylenko in a thriller about an ex-CIA agent caught up in an international conspiracy, is at 21 percent.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"Fantasy, Go, TLC, Musical, BET, America, elm, Winners, adaptation, Quiz, casting, Crackle, Drama","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"critics-consensus-star-trek-into-darkness-is-certified-fresh"},{"id":"47508772062811","title":"Critics Consensus: After Earth is Lost in Space","content":"Critics Consensusvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Critics Consensus: After Earth is Lost in SpacePlus, Now You See Me is slick but short on tension.by Tim Ryan | May 31, 2013 |  CommentsThis week at the movies, we’ve got a father and son on an interplanetary mission (After Earth, starring Will and Jaden Smith) and a group of bank-robbing magicians (Now You See Me, starring Jesse Eisenberg and Mark Ruffalo). What do the critics have to say?After Earth 11%It’s been more than a decade since Signs, the last M. Night Shyamalan-directed film to receive positive notices from critics. One would hope that his collaboration with Will Smith would stem the tide of negative reviews. No such luck; critics say After Earth is largely a morose, disjointed, numbingly-paced sci-fi trip that fails to make the most of its real-life father-son leads. Legendary space ranger Cypher (Will) and his son Kitai (Jaden) are on a mission when their ship crash lands on an abandoned Earth; together, they must navigate a perilous post-apocalyptic wasteland to signal for help. The pundits say that the elder Smith is compelling as always, but he’s largely wasted on a story that’s mostly dull and predictable. (Check out our interview with the Smiths, as well as this week’s 24 Frames for a gallery of Certified Fresh father-son movies.)Now You See Me 50%Now You See Me seems like a can’t-miss proposition. It’s a heist thriller with a terrific cast (including Jesse Eisenberg, Mark Ruffalo, Woody Harrelson, Isla Fisher, Morgan Freeman, and Michael Caine) and an intriguing twist (the thieves are illusionists!). Unfortunately, critics say that while Now You See Me is slick and frequently amusing, it’s also mostly superficial and tension-free. The plot: the FBI is on the trail of a crack team of bank robbers, who perform magic shows as a diversion to raid the coffers of corrupt businessmen. The pundits say Now You See Me is never less than watchable thanks to its fine ensemble players, but it’s also light as a feather and occasionally preposterous. (Check out this week’s Total Recall for a countdown of co-star Morgan Freeman’s best-reviewed movies, as well as our interviews with the stars.)Also opening this week in limited release:Hannah Arendt, a biopic of the legendary philosopher and her coverage of Eichmann trial, is at 100 percent.The History Of Future Folk, a comedy about the intergalactic adventures of a bluegrass band, is at 90 percent.Shadow Dancer, starring Clive Owen and Andrea Riseborough in a thriller about a woman forced to spy on her IRA-affiliated family members, is at Certified Fresh at 86 percent.The Kings of Summer, a comedy about a group of teenagers who decide to spend their summer living in isolation in the woods, is at 79 percent (check out co-stars Megan Mullally and Nick Offerman‘s Five Favorite Films).The East, starring Ellen Page and Alexander Skarsgård in a thriller about a private security spy who infiltrates an anarchist collective, is at 79 percent.The Wall, a psychological sci-fi film about a woman who becomes trapped by a force field while visiting a remote valley, is at 63 percent.American Mary, a horror film about a disenchanted medical student who performs black-market surgeries, is at 62 percent.Student, a drama about a Kazak student whose rudderless existence leads him to a life of crime, is at 57 percent.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"movie, Syfy, romance, 4/20, TV, Channel, SXSW, war, fast","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Critics-Consensus-After-Earth-is-Lost-in-Space"},{"id":"47508772037201","title":"Critics Consensus: Elysium Soars; Planes is Grounded","content":"Critics Consensusvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Critics Consensus: Elysium Soars; Planes is GroundedPlus, We're the Millers and Percy Jackson: Sea of Monsters are uneven, and The Spectacular Now is Certified Fresh.by Tim Ryan | August 7, 2013 |  CommentsThis week at the movies, we’ve got a futuristic factory worker (Elysium, starring Matt Damon and Jodie Foster); anthropomorphic aircraft (Planes, with voice performances from Dane Cook and Julia Louis-Dreyfus); a drug-smuggling “family” (We’re the Millers, starring Jennifer Aniston and Jason Sudeikis); a high school demigod (Percy Jackson: Sea of Monsters, starring Logan Lerman and Brandon T. Jackson); and an unlikely teenage couple (The Spectacular Now, starring Miles Teller and Shailene Woodley). What do the critics have to say?Elysium 65%Director Neill Blomkamp has a thing for allegorical sci-fi action. His debut, District 9, was a thinly-veiled tract on xenophobia featuring bug-like aliens, and his latest, Elysium, utilizes its stunningly realized setting in the year 2154 to expound on income inequity. Critics say it’s a potent mix of visceral thrills and social commentary, though its message isn’t delivered with much subtlety. Matt Damon stars as a factory worker who learns he’ll die within days without medical help. So he makes a risky journey from Earth to Elysium, a space station where the wealthy live in luxury and perfect health — and don’t take well to outsiders. The pundits say Elysium sometimes falls short of its intriguing premise, but it still delivers kinetic action and plenty of futuristic eye candy. (Check out this week’s Total Recall, in which we count down Damon’s best-reviewed movies, and watch our video interviews with Damon, Blomkamp, and more.)Planes 25%The output of Pixar and Walt Disney Animation Studios is usually greeted with glowing reviews — too bad neither of them were involved with Planes, the DisneyToons Studios film critics say is surprisingly lightweight and frivolous, with dull characters and only fleeting moments of visual invention. Dusty (voiced by Dane Cook) is a crop-dusting plane with a fear of heights and a big dream: to compete in an around-the-world race against the fastest, highest-flying aircraft. The pundits say Planes will probably serve as a decent audiovisual babysitter, but parents are likely to find its generic plot and cardboard characters make for a bumpy flight. (Check out our video interviews with the Planes cast and crew.)We’re The Millers 48%Take Jennifer Aniston, Jason Sudeikis, Ed Helms, and Emma Roberts, toss them into a stoner road trip comedy, and what do you get? An unfortunate shortage of laughs, apparently; critics say We’re the Millers has some stray chuckles, but its talented cast is mired in an undisciplined, overly vulgar plot. Jason Sudeikis stars as a small-time weed dealer who becomes indebted to his supplier when his stash is stolen. He contrives a plan to smuggle major weight in an RV, traveling with a ragtag group of neighbors pretending to be a family on vacation. The pundits say We’re the Millers might have benefited from letting the actors cut loose from the script; as it stands, this would-be satire lacks the discipline to generate consistent hilarity.Percy Jackson: Sea of Monsters 42%Of the young adult novels to be adapted the big screen in the wake of Harry Potter and Twilight, Percy Jackson &amp; the Olympians: The Lightning Thief garnered decent, if hardly spectacular, reviews. Unfortunately, critics say its sequel, Percy Jackson: Sea of Monsters, is a step down; it’s an occasionally diverting fantasy adventure that’s decidedly short on enchantment. This time out, Percy (Logan Lerman) must protect the realm of his demigod brethren, so he embarks on a voyage to find the fabled Golden Fleece that will restore the tree spirit and ward off evil. The pundits say Sea of Monsters is reasonably brisk and visually sharp, but there’s a shortage of energy and character development that makes for a less-than-fantastical time.The Spectacular Now 91%The Spectacular Now, which critics have praised as a touching, uncommonly perceptive coming-of-age tale with an outstanding young cast, goes into wide release this week. Miles Teller stars as Sutter, a party-hearty high school senior who has a chance meeting with Aimee (Shailene Woodley), an eccentric, thoughtful classmate; as the two develop a romantic bond, Sutter begins to reflect on his impulsive ways. The pundits say this Certified Fresh dramedy benefits from sympathetic direction and a cast of characters with a lot more complexity than your average teen flick. (Check out our video interviews with Teller and Woodley.)Also opening this week in limited release:Jug Face, a horror film about a pregnant teenager who fears she’ll be sacrificed by the citizenry of her rural community, is at 92 percent.In a World…, starring Lake Bell in a romantic comedy about a movie trailer voiceover artist, is at 85 percent.The Machine Which Makes Everything Disappear, a documentary in which young people in post-Soviet Georgia discuss their lives while auditioning for a film, is at 80 percent.David Gordon Green‘s Prince Avalanche, starring Paul Rudd and Emile Hirsch in a comedy about two men who bond while doing maintenance on a country road ravaged by wildfire, is at 78 percent.Kid-Thing, a drama about the adventures of an under-supervised 11-year-old, is at 73 percent.I Give It a Year, starring Rose Byrne and Rafe Spall in a romantic comedy about the trials and tribulations of a couple in its first year of marriage, is at 57 percent.Off Label, a doc that examines the dark side of prescription drugs, is at 57 percent.Blood, starring Paul Bettany and Stephen Graham in a drama about a pair of siblings who work as small-town British detectives and use unscrupulous means to incriminate a murder suspect, is at 55 percent.Lovelace, starring Amanda Seyfried and Peter Sarsgaard in a biopic of the Deep Throat star, is at 50 percent.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"facebook, DirecTV, One, spinoff, of, halloween, Amazon, HBO, CW, kong, Holiday, Trivia","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Critics-Consensus-Elysium-Soars-Planes-is-Grounded"},{"id":"47508772049494","title":"Critics Consensus: Despicable Me 2 is Certified Fresh","content":"Critics Consensusvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Critics Consensus: Despicable Me 2 is Certified FreshPlus, a strong cast can't mask The Lone Ranger's faults.by Tim Ryan | July 3, 2013 |  CommentsThis week at the movies, we’ve got an army of minions (Despicable Me 2, with voice work by Steve Carell and Kristen Wiig) and a legendary masked man (The Lone Ranger, starring Johnny Depp and Armie Hammer). What do the critics have to say?Despicable Me 2 75%Those jovial, irrepressible minions are back. Critics say Despicable Me 2 isn’t as fresh as its predecessor, but it’s goofy, colorful, and often very funny. This time out, erstwhile bad guy Gru (voiced by Steve Carell) is recruited by the Anti-Villain League agent Lucy Wilde (Kristen Wiig) to stop a criminal mastermind. Gru takes a shine to Lucy, and the minions make plenty of mischief. The pundits say the Certified Fresh Despicable Me 2 should delight the kiddies, and though it isn’t particularly deep, it’s sweet, silly, and energetic.The Lone Ranger 30%Bad news, Kemosabe: critics say Gore Verbinski‘s big-budget adaptation of The Lone Ranger is bombastic, overlong, and altogether misguided, stranding its strong cast in a plot that succumbs to jarring tonal shifts. Tonto (Johnny Depp) narrates the tale of the Lone Ranger (Arnie Hammer), a lawyer-cum-masked vigilante who vows revenge after a murderous psychopath kills his brother; what follows is a series of shootouts and chases against the picturesque backdrop of the old West. The pundits say Depp and Hammer are charming leads, but they’re surrounded by a film that can never decide whether it’s an action flick, a comedy, or a revisionist drama.Also opening this week in limited release:Big Star: Nothing Can Hurt Me, a documentary about the influential and under-heralded power pop band, is at 100 percent.The Way, Way Back, starring Sam Rockwell and Steve Carell in a dramedy about a lonely teenager who befriends the manager of a water park, is at 85 percent.The Look of Love, starring Steve Coogan and Anna Friel in a biopic of British porn mogul Paul Raymond, is at 67 percent.Stuck in Love, starring Greg Kinnear and Jennifer Connelly in a dramedy about a once-celebrated writer who still pines for his ex-wife, is at 56 percent.Kevin Hart: Let Me Explain, a concert doc featuring footage from the comedian’s sold-out Madison Square Garden show, is at 50 percent.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"Guild, Columbia, breaking, Cannes, Disney, TV, mockumentary, mission:, in, Emmys, movies","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"critics-consensus-despicable-me-2-is-certified-fresh"},{"id":"47508773467751","title":"Critics Consensus: Oz the Great and Powerful Looks Good But Lacks Magic","content":"Critics Consensusvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Critics Consensus: Oz the Great and Powerful Looks Good But Lacks MagicPlus, Dead Man Down's great cast struggles to rise above the film's absurd plot.by Tim Ryan | March 8, 2013 |  CommentsThis week at the movies, we’ve got a wonderful wizard (Oz the Great and Powerful, starring James Franco and Mila Kunis) and a pair of avengers (Dead Man Down, starring Noomi Rapace and Colin Farrell). What do the critics have to say?Oz the Great and Powerful 57%Few films could hope to match the influence and popularity of The Wizard of Oz, so it was probably a wise move for director Sam Raimi to forge a different path down the Yellow Brick Road with Oz the Great and Powerful, a prequel to the 1939 classic. Whether he was successful is a different matter; some critics find this Oz to be a witty visual phantasmagoria, while others say it suffers from so-so storytelling and inconsistent performances. James Franco stars as a roguish carnival magician who finds himself transported to a magical world. There, he meets a trio of witches and is treated like a king. Can our hero summon the courage and smarts to bring peace to the land of Oz? The pundits say that while Oz the Great and Powerful is often entertaining and always fun to look at, its plot is relatively bland and surprisingly short on magic. (Check out our interviews with Raimi and the stars of Oz, as well as this week’s Total Recall, in which we count down star Michelle Williams’s best-reviewed movies.)Dead Man Down 41%Buoyed by the success of the Swedish version of The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, director Niels Arden Oplev and star Noomi Rapace re-team for the neo-noirish crime thriller Dead Man Down. Unfortunately, critics say it’s a cut blow their previous collaboration; while the fine cast keeps the movie watchable throughout, it’s is weighted down by absurd plot twists and a slack pace. Seeking revenge for the murder of his wife and child, Victor (Colin Farrell) infiltrates a criminal organization with the intention of killing the boss. However, Victor’s also being blackmailed by a mysterious woman (Rapace), who needs his help to settle a score of her own. The pundits say Rapace and Farrell are compelling, but Dead Man Down is too ponderous and clichéd to work as a whole.(Check out Rapace’s Five Favorite Films here.)Also opening this week in limited release:The Silence, a thriller about a pair of eerily similar crimes that haunt the residents of a small German town, is at 100 percent.Electrick Children, a coming-of-age drama about a sheltered teenager who flees her family for the big city, is at 83 percent.The Romanian drama Beyond The Hills, about a young woman who attempts to convince a childhood friend to leave her orthodox religious community, is at 81 percent.Michel Gondry‘s The We and the I, a comedy about a diverse group of high school students on a bus home from the last day of school, is at 80 percent.Greedy Lying Bastards, a documentary about corporate and political resistance to climate change legislation, is at 80 percent.Don’t Stop Believin’: Everyman’s Journey, a concert doc about the venerable hard rock group and its new singer, is at 68 percent.The Monk, starring Vincent Cassel in a gothic fantasy about a friar who gives in to temptation after meeting a newcomer to the monastery, is at 67 percent.The ABCs of Death, a horror anthology featuring a scary short for each letter of the alphabet, is at 48 percent.Emperor, starring Tommy Lee Jones and Matthew Fox in a period drama about the United States’ post-World War II Occupation of Japan, is at 41 percent.Gut Renovation, a documentary about the gentrification of Brooklyn, is at 29 percent.Finally, props to Matthew Reimer for coming the closest to guessing The Last Exorcism Part II‘s 14 percent Tomatometer.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"Character","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Critics-Consensus-Oz-the-Great-and-Powerful-Looks-Good-But-Lacks-Magic"},{"id":"47508773473898","title":"Critics Consensus: A Bad Day for A Good Day to Die Hard","content":"Critics Consensusvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Critics Consensus: A Bad Day for A Good Day to Die HardPlus, Safe Haven is schmaltzy, Beautiful Creatures is uneven, and Escape from Planet Earth wasn't screened, so guess the Tomatometer!by Tim Ryan | February 14, 2013 |  CommentsThis week at the movies, we’ve got the return of John McClane (A Good Day to Die Hard, starring Bruce Willis and Jai Courtney); a tentative love affair (Safe Haven, starring Julianne Hough and Josh Duhamel); teenage witchcraft (Beautiful Creatures, starring Alden Ehrenreich and Alice Englert); and alien astronauts (Escape From Planet Earth 3D, with voice work by Brendan Fraser and Rob Corddry). What do the critics have to say?A Good Day to Die Hard 14%Macho, wisecracking John McClane (Bruce Willis) holds a distinct place in the hearts of movie fans, so it’s painful to hear that the latest installment of his venerable franchise, A Good Day to Die Hard, is unequivocally the weakest. This time out, McClane travels to Russia to help his estranged son (Jai Courtney), a CIA agent in the midst of an undercover operation. Father and son team up, and subsequently, stuff gets blowed up real good. The pundits say that even Bruce Willis’ smirking demeanor can barely enliven A Good Day to Die Hard‘s clichéd, uninspired script, which emphasizes noisy, senseless action over characterization and humor. (Check out this week’s 24 Frames for a gallery of Willis’ most memorable movies.)Safe Haven 14%Safe Haven is the latest movie adaptation of a Nicholas Sparks novel, and critics say it’s got the same problems that have bedeviled previous Sparks outings like The Last Song and The Lucky One: in other words, it’s schmaltzy, predictable, and melodramatic. Katie (Julianne Hough) arrives in town haunted by traumatic events from her past. Eventually, she falls for widowed single dad Alex (Josh Duhamel). But will the aforementioned dark secret intrude on her new life? The pundits say Safe Haven is a soapy thriller that’s distinguished only by an egregiously ludicrous plot twist toward the end.Beautiful Creatures 47%Sure, Beautiful Creatures shares some similarities with Twilight, but critics say it’s witty and well-acted – good enough, in fact, to make one wish it wasn’t so tonally uneven. Ethan (Alden Ehrenreich) is instantly smitten by Lena (Alice Englert), who’s just moved to his small southern town. But their budding love affair is endangered by Lena’s supernatural powers. The pundits say the cast is likeable, but the plot is predictable, and on the whole Beautiful Creatures can’t quite pull off its tricky mix of romance, comedy, and the supernatural.Escape From Planet Earth 3D 35%It looks like critics won’t need to beat a hasty retreat from Escape From Planet Earth 3D, since it wasn’t screened prior to its release in theaters. Alien astronaut Scorch Supernova (Brendan Fraser) is tricked into landing on earth and subsequently held captive at Area 51, so it’s up to his nerdy brother Gary (Rob Corddry) to rescue him — and their home planet.

What do the critics have to say?The Croods 72%Picking up where The Flintstones left off, The Croods is a comedy adventure about a Stone Age family. And critics say that while the storytelling in this animated feature isn’t highly evolved, it’s sweet, funny, and visually inventive. After the cave they call home is destroyed, a stone-age family journeys across its pre-historic environs, encountering wild beasts and learning to love and trust each other along the way. The pundits say The Croods lacks sharply-drawn characters, but it’s charming and exciting enough to delight both kids and their parents. (Check out this week’s 24 Frames for a look at the history of DreamWorks animation, as well as this week’s Total Recall, in which we count down Nicolas Cage’s best-reviewed movies.)Olympus Has Fallen 49%Is Olympus Has Fallen an enjoyable, over-the-top action flick or a jingoistic Die Hard ripoff? Well, it depends on which critic you ask. Gerard Butler stars as a disgraced secret service agent who’s called into action when the president (Aaron Eckhart) is held hostage in the White House by a group of ruthless terrorists. The pundits are pretty split on Olympus Has Fallen: some say it’s action-packed escapist fun, while others find it to be an excessively violent, by-the-numbers thriller. (Check out director Antoine Fuqua’s Five Favorite Films.)Admission 39%Tina Fey and Paul Rudd in a romantic comedy? Sounds like a sure thing. Unfortunately, critics say the likable leads can only do so much with Admission‘s meandering script. Fey stars as a Princeton admissions officer burdened by the stresses of her romantic and professional life. She takes a road trip to see an old college classmate (Rudd) who’s now an unconventional teacher with a gifted but eccentric student who could use some help getting into college. The pundits say Admission is slight stuff, and though the fine cast keeps things watchable, the film veers unevenly between drama and comedy without finding a consistent tone.Spring Breakers 67%Director Harmony Korine (Gummo) is known for pushing boundaries, but with Spring Breakers, he’s made something approximating a mainstream movie. Critics say it’s a pretty good fit; Spring Breakers is often debauched and trashy, but it’s also visceral and hypnotic. Selena Gomez and Vanessa Hudgens play members of a group of college girls who head to Florida to party but quickly get into trouble after meeting a rapper/criminal (James Franco). The pundits say Spring Breakers is undeniably lurid and occasionally monotonous, but it’s also thrilling and wildly unconventional. (Check out our interview with Korine here.)Also opening this week in limited release:Gimme The Loot, a drama about a pair of graffiti artists looking to raise funds for a bold act of tagging, is at 100 percent.My Brother The Devil, a drama about a pair of siblings who each find themselves drawn into the world of London’s street gangs, is at 100 percent.108 (Cuchillo de palo), a documentary about gay rights in Paraguay, is at 100 percent.The Sapphires, a musical dramedy about a Australian Aboriginal soul group, is Certified Fresh at 92 percent.Eden, starring Jamie Chung in a drama about a woman abducted into a human trafficking ring, is at 85 percent.Starbuck, a comedy about a fourtysomething slacker who discovers he’s fathered hundreds of children through sperm back donations, is at 63 percent.Hunky Dory, starring Minnie Driver in a comedy about a high school drama teacher who attempts to stage a glam rock version of The Tempest, is at 58 percent.Come Out And Play, starring Vinessa Shaw in a horror film about a young couple on vacation who discover a band of possessed children, is at 50 percent.Everybody Has a Plan, starring Viggo Mortensen in a drama about a man who assumes the identity of his dead brother and finds himself in the midst of criminality, is at 20 percent.Love And Honor, starring Liam Hemsworth and Teresa Palmer in a drama about a soldier who goes AWOL to win back the girl who dumped him, is at 14 percent.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"movie, Ice, binge, spy, anime, History, Captain, Century, cancelled, GIFs, 2018, 20th","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Critics-Consensus-The-Croods-is-Charming-and-Funny"},{"id":"47508773469800","title":"Critics Consensus: Jack the Giant Slayer is Fee-Fie-Fokay","content":"Critics Consensusvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Critics Consensus: Jack the Giant Slayer is Fee-Fie-FokayPlus, Phantom is out to sea, 21 and Over is short on laugs, and The Last Exorcism Part II wasn't screened for critics.by Tim Ryan | March 1, 2013 |  CommentsThis week at the movies, we’ve got fairy tale swashbuckling (Jack the Giant Slayer, starring Nicholas Hoult and Ewan McGregor), submarine suspense (Phantom, starring Ed Harris and David Duchovny), excessive partying (21 and Over, starring Miles Teller and Skylar Astin), and devilish doings (The Last Exorcism Part II, starring Ashley Bell and Spencer Treat Clark). What do the critics have to say?Jack the Giant Slayer 52%With all the fairy tale adaptations Hollywood’s been cranking out lately, Jack and the Beanstalk seems particularly ripe for a big-budget adaptation. And critics say that while Jack the Giant Slayer is briskly paced and occasionally thrilling, it’s often more stylish than substantial. After unintentionally opening a portal to another world, Jack (Nicholas Hoult) fights to defend the earth from a group of giants who are attempting to reclaim their former realm. The pundits say Jack the Giant Slayer looks terrific, and it has some exciting set pieces, but it doesn’t do much to distinguish itself from other fantasy adventures of its ilk. (Check out this week’s Total Recall, in which we count down star Ewan McGregor’s best-reviewed movies.)Phantom 25%Das Boot. The Hunt for Red October. Crimson Tide. There are plenty of good thrillers set on board submarines, but unfortunately, critics say the well-acted but poorly-scripted Phantom is unlikely to join their ranks. Ed Harris stars as the captain of a Soviet sub on a secret mission. However, several of the crew members, led by Bruni (David Duchovny), are planning to take over the ship and escalate conflict with the U.S. The pundits say Phantom is unfortunately short on tension, leaving its talented cast out to sea. (Watch our video interview with Harris and Duchovny.)21 and Over 27%If the premise of 21 and Over — three dudes party and go on wild adventures unill somebody blacks out — sounds a lot like The Hangover, well, that’s because it shares screenwriters. What they don’t share, say critics, is a steady stream of laughs. Jeff (Justin Chon) is turning 21, but has an important interview the next day. His two buddies (Miles Teller and Skylar Astin) demand they hit the town; intoxication and hilarity ensue. The pundits say 21 and Over has a couple of solid gags, but they’re separated by long passages that are raunchy and politically incorrect rather than funny. (Check out this week’s 24 Frames for a gallery of memorable movie benders.)The Last Exorcism Part II 15%Perhaps the studio behind The Last Exorcism Part II were afraid their film was less than bewitching, since it wasn’t screened prior to its release. Following the events of the previous film, Nell Sweetzer (Ashley Bell) is found alive with no recollection of what became of her family. Soon, she’s once again possessed by a demonic spirit. Time to play guess the Tomatometer again!Also opening this week in limited release:Oscar-nominated War Witch, a drama about a Congolese girl who is kidnapped and forced to be a child soldier, is at 89 percent.A Place at the Table, a documentary about the effect of hunger on poor Americans, is at 88 percent.Hava Nagila: The Movie, a doc about the history of the celebratory song, is at 75 percent.Leviathan, a meditative documentary about commercial fishing boats and their environs, is at 73 percent.Stoker, starring Mia Wasikowska and Matthew Goode in a thriller about a teenager recovering from her father’s death who becomes close with her mysterious uncle, is at 68 percent.Ginger &amp; Rosa, starring Elle Fanning and Christina Hendricks in a drama about a pair of teenage friends with anxieties about their home lives and the threat of nuclear war, is at 55 percent.The End of Love, starring Mark Webber and Shannyn Sossamon in a drama about a young father dealing with the death of his wife, is at 55 percent.The Sweeney, starring Ray Winstone in an action thriller about a group of tough cops investigating a murder, is at 52 percent (check out Winstone’s Five Favorite Films here).Finally, props to Donald Whitman Jr. for guessing Dark Skies‘s 30 percent Tomatometer.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"YA, Witch, demand, ITV, Prime","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Critics-Consensus-Jack-the-Giant-Slayer-is-Fee-Fie-Fokay"},{"id":"47508773449312","title":"Critics Consensus: Pain &amp; Gain is Visceral But Uneven","content":"Critics Consensusvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Critics Consensus: Pain &amp; Gain is Visceral But UnevenPlus, The Big Wedding is a big misfire.by Tim Ryan | April 25, 2013 |  CommentsThis week at the movies, we’ve got bodybuilding bad guys (Pain &amp; Gain, starring Mark Wahlberg and Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson) and matrimonial mishaps (The Big Wedding, starring Robert De Niro and Diane Keaton). What do the critics have to say?Pain &amp; Gain 50%Michael Bay is not the kind of guy to tone things down just because he’s working with a smaller budget. However, critics say the auteur behind Armageddon and the Transformers franchise has tempered the visceral impact of Pain &amp; Gain with a fair amount of black comedy, and the result is uneven but often queasily compelling. Based on a bizarre true story, Pain &amp; Gain is the tale of three bodybuilders who concoct a scheme to kidnap a wealthy businessman and wrest control of his riches. However, the plan quickly goes awry, with violent repercussions. The pundits say Pain &amp; Gain‘s pitch-black sense of humor and charismatic leads can’t quite make up for the movie’s stylistic excess and lack of nuance. (Check out this week’s 24 Frames for a gallery of films based on magazine and newspaper articles.)The Big Wedding 7%Critics say The Big Wedding is a comedy that audiences should decline with regrets; its all-star cast is stranded in a contrived, strained plot that features broad stabs at humor but few laughs. Robert De Niro and Diane Keaton star as a divorced couple who reunite for their son’s wedding and pretend to be happily married for the sake of his bride-to-be’s conservative mother; hilarity allegedly ensues. The pundits say The Big Wedding is a big misfire, with shopworn slapstick gags and stereotypical characters.Check out this week’s Total Recall for a countdown of Keaton’s best-reviewed movies.)Also opening this week in limited release:Mud, starring Matthew McConaughey and Reese Witherspoon in a drama about a pair of teenagers who befriend a reclusive criminal, is Certified Fresh at 97 percent.Sun Don’t Shine, a drama about a young couple on the run with a mysterious body in the trunk of their car, is at 92 percent.Best Foreign Language Film nominee Kon Tiki, which recounts ethnographer Thor Heyerdahl’s epic journey from South America to Polynesia on a raft, is at 79 percent.Graceland, a thriller about a politician’s chauffeur who becomes ensnared in a kidnapping plot, is at 78 percent.An Oversimplification Of Her Beauty, a live-action/animation hybrid that ruminates on unrequited love, is at 75 percent.Paradise: Love, a drama about a middle aged woman who travels to a Kenyan resort that caters to sex tourists, is at 65 percent.At Any Price, starring Dennis Quaid and Zac Efron in a drama about the tense relationship between a farmer and his aspiring racecar driver son, is at 63 percent.The Reluctant Fundamentalist, starring Kate Hudson and Liev Schreiber in a drama about a Pakistani-American professor suspected of having ties to radicalism, is at 53 percent.Midnight’s Children, a drama about a two people who experience remarkably different lives after being switched at birth on the eve of India’s independence from Britain, is at 46 percentArthur Newman, starring Colin Firth and Emily Blunt in a romantic dramedy about a pair of disenchanted souls who find each other after assuming false identities, is at 22 percent (watch our interviews with the stars here.)The Numbers Station, starring John Cusack and Malin Akerman in a thriller about a CIA agent tasked with protection a code specialist, is at 14 percent.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"Swim, new, FXX, jamie, Talk, Seed, Fantasy, documentaries, and","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Critics-Consensus-Pain-and-Gain-is-Visceral-But-Uneven"},{"id":"47508773458532","title":"Critics Consensus: G.I.

Joe: Retaliation Hits a RoadblockPlus, The Host lacks soul, and Temptation wasn't screened -- guess the Tomatometer!by Tim Ryan | March 29, 2013 |  CommentsThis week at the movies, we’ve got real American heroes (G.I. Joe: Retaliation, starring Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson and Channing Tatum); body snatchers (The Host, starring Saoirse Ronan and Diane Kruger); and a passionate marriage counselor (Temptation, starring Jurnee Smollett-Bell and Lance Gross). What do critics have to say?G.I. Joe: Retaliation 28%The Joes are back, but not necessarily better than ever, in G.I. Joe: Retaliation, which critics say boasts a couple strong action set pieces but mostly traffics in frenetic, logic-free plotting and mayhem. This time out, Cobra shape-shifter Zartan has occupied the White House, and Cobra Commander has escaped from prison, so it’s up to Roadblock (Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson) and the rest of the Joes to save the world from chaos. The pundits say G.I. Joe: Retaliation is essentially a loud, over-the-top cartoon that might get your adrenaline pumping but is unlikely to stimulate your intellect. (Check out this week’s Total Recall, in which we run down memorable movies based on toys and games.)The Host 10%Now that The Twilight Saga has concluded, Hollywood needs new Stephenie Meyer works to bring to the big screen. Unfortunately, critics say The Host does not make a good first impression, squandering a strong cast on a dull, poorly-paced sci-fi rehash. Aliens inhabit the bodies of earthlings, but a headstrong teenager named Melanie (Saoirse Ronan) refuses to let her mental faculties be overpowered before she locates and helps her loved ones. The pundits say The Host lacks even the goony passion of the Twilight movies, and the result is a supernatural bore. (Check out this week’s 24 Frames for a gallery of films about alien possession, as well as our video interviews with members of The Host‘s cast.)Temptation 17%Tyler Perry‘s films are rarely screened prior to their release in theaters, and Temptation is no exception. Jurnee Smollett-Bell stars as a marriage counselor whose dissatisfaction with her own marriage pushes her into an affair with a tech mogul; ethical and emotional complications ensue. Time to guess the Tomatometer!Also opening this week in limited release:Room 237, a documentary that presents a number of fascinating interpretations of Stanley Kubrick‘s The Shining, is Certified Fresh at 95 percent.Blancanieves, a silent take on Snow White set in 1920s Spain, is at 88 percent.Violeta Went to Heaven, a biopic of Chilean folk singer Violeta Parra, is at 83 percent.Renoir, a historical drama about the relationship between painter Pierre-Auguste Renoir and his son, director Jean Renoir, is at 79 percent.Wrong, a dramedy about a man whose life takes a number of strange turns as he looks for his missing dog, is at 77 percent.The Place Beyond The Pines, starring Ryan Gosling and Bradley Cooper in a drama with three interconnected stories about the fates of two families over the course of 15 years, is at 76 percent (check out director Derek Cianfrance’s Five Favorite Films here).Welcome to the Punch, starring James McAvoy and Mark Strong in a thriller about a detective who uncovers a conspiracy while trailing a master criminal, is at 55 percent.Mental, starring Toni Collette and Liev Schreiber in a comedy about a woman tasked with taking care of five children when their mother is institutionalized, is at 44 percent.Family Weekend, starring Kristin Chenoweth and Matthew Modine in a comedy about a a high-achieving teenager who takes her parents hostage to protest their indifference to her life, is at 25 percent (check out Chenoweth’s Five Favorite Films here).","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"YouTube, breaking, Cartoon, crime, Captain","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Critics-Consensus-GI-Joe-Retaliation-Hits-a-Roadblock"},{"id":"47508773456483","title":"Critics Consensus: Evil Dead Is a Solid, Gory Update","content":"Critics Consensusvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Critics Consensus: Evil Dead Is a Solid, Gory UpdatePlus, Jurassic Park is Certified Fresh.by Tim Ryan | April 5, 2013 |  CommentsThis week at the movies, we’ve got an army of darkness (Evil Dead, starring Jane Levy and Shiloh Fernandez) and an island of dinosaurs (Jurassic Park, starring Sam Neill and Laura Dern). What do the critics have to say?Evil Dead 63%With Evil Dead and Evil Dead 2: Dead By Dawn, Sam Raimi pulled off a heady mix of over-the-top gore and subversive humor. Critics say this new Evil Dead doesn’t come close to matching its classic predecessors, but it’s a visceral, smarter-than-average frightfest that will impress gorehounds (and churn the stomachs of more sensitive types). When a group of teenagers in a remote cabin inadvertently summon demonic forces, they’re left to fend off all sorts of unimaginable evils — including each other. The pundits say Evil Dead lacks the sick wit that made the originals so compelling, but it’s an efficient, merciless piece of work that manages to carve out a style all its own. (Check out our interviews with the Evil Dead cast, as well as our gallery of particularly intense horror movies.)Jurassic Park: An IMAX 3D Experience 91%Upon its release in 1993, Jurassic Park smashed box office records and set a new standard for special effects. Now it’s getting a deluxe 3D theatrical rerelease, giving audiences another chance to witness Steven Spielberg’s deft mix of monster movie scares and beautifully lifelike dinosaurs on the big screen. Critics found Jurassic Park to be more spectacle than substance, but also were quick to note that it’s spectacle of a very high order, and the special effects hold up remarkably well 20 years later. (Check out this week’s Total Recall, in which we run down some of cinema’s most memorable dinosaurs.)Also opening this week in limited release:Shane Carruth‘s Upstream Color, a drama about a man and a woman who are drawn to one another without knowing they’re each part of a mind-altering experiment, is at 86 percent.Free Angela &amp; All Political Prisoners, a documentary about the activist Angela Davis, is at 86 percent.André Gregory: Before and After Dinner, a doc about the acclaimed theater actor and director, is at 78 percent.Simon Killer, a thriller about a sociopath who ensnares a Parisian escort into his web of intrigue, is at 75 percent.Eddie the Sleepwalking Cannibal, a horror comedy about an artist who finds inspiration in a man with a bizarre (and deadly) sleep condition, is at 71 percent.Danny Boyle‘s Trance, starring James McAvoy and Vincent Cassell in a thriller about a man who gets mixed up in an art heist and forgets where he stashed a priceless painting, is at 71 percent.No Place on Earth, a documentary about a pair of families who escaped the Nazi occupation of Ukraine by hiding in a cave, is at 67 percent.The Company You Keep, starring Robert Redford and Shia Labeouf in a thriller about a former radical who goes on the run after his identity is exposed, is at 56 percent.Down the Shore, starring James Gandolfini and Famke Janssen in a drama about a group of friends since childhood who discover a shocking secret, is at 50 percent.Bert Stern: Original Madman, a doc about the legendary fashion photographer, is at 40 percent.The Brass Teapot, starring Juno Temple in a comedy about a financially strapped couple that finds a solution to their woes in the form of a magic teapot, is at 25 percent.Lotus Eaters, a drama about the lives and loves of a group of well-off London youngsters, is at zero percent.6 Souls, starring Julianne Moore and Jonathan Rhys Meyers in a horror film about a psychiatrist whose patient has a potentially murderous case of multiple personality disorder, is at zero percent.Finally, props to Justin D. for coming the closest to guessing Temptation‘s 15 percent Tomatometer.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"The, on, Disney, Month, game-of-thrones, zombies, Country, Signature, on","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Critics-Consensus-Evil-Dead-Is-a-Solid-Gory-Update"},{"id":"47508774904434","title":"Critics Consensus: Jack Reacher Features Tom Cruise in Control","content":"Critics Consensusvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Critics Consensus: Jack Reacher Features Tom Cruise in ControlPlus, This is 40 is long but funny, The Guilt Trip squanders its cast, Cirque Du Soleil: Worlds Away can?t match the live show, and Monsters, Inc. 3D is Certified Fresh.by Tim Ryan | December 20, 2012 |  CommentsThis week at the movies, we’ve got a cool cop (Jack Reacher, starring Tom Cruise and Rosamund Pike); harried marrieds (This is 40, starring Paul Rudd and Leslie Mann); mother-son bonding (The Guilt Trip, starring Barbra Streisand and Seth Rogen); and a fanciful circus (the performance film Cirque Du Soleil: Worlds Away 3D). What do the critics have to say?Jack Reacher 64%Sometimes a relatively generic story can be redeemed by a confident central performance. Case in point: Jack Reacher, which critics say is a solid crime thriller that greatly benefits from Tom Cruise’s movie star charisma. Cruise stars as the title character, a former Army M.P. who’s called in to investigate a mass shooting, and soon discovers that he’s up against a dangerous foe. The pundits say Jack Reacher doesn’t lack for clichés, it’s a competent and tense piece of work, and Cruise is cool and compelling. (Check out this week’s 24 Frames for a pictorial overview of Cruise’s career.)This Is 40 51%Judd Apatow‘s films frequently balance laughs and pathos with a deft hand, and while critics say This Is 40 is uneven, it’s thought-provoking and occasionally hilarious. Paul Rudd and Leslie Mann reprise their roles from Knocked Up, playing an affluent married couple dealing with the stresses of parenthood, financial insecurity, familial relations, and hard-to-break habits. The pundits say This Is 40 is overlong and sometimes aimless, but it’s buoyed by a terrific cast, a perceptive script, and some very funny moments.The Guilt Trip 37%Barbra Streisand is so rarely in films these days that her starring role in The Guilt Trip should be cause for excitement. Unfortunately, the critics say that while she and Seth Rogen share an easy chemistry, it’s largely wasted in a formulaic plot. Rogen stars as an inventor who plans to drive cross-country to pitch his newest product. He invites his overbearing mom along in an attempt to fix her up with an old boyfriend in San Francisco. The pundits say The Guilt Trip is undeniably sweet, and the leads are in fine form, but there are absolutely no surprises to be found in the script.Cirque Du Soleil: Worlds Away 3D 45%If those whimsical acrobats from Cirque Du Soleil aren’t making a tour stop in your town, Cirque Du Soleil: Worlds Away is a decent overview; critics say this 3D extravaganza offers thrilling evidence of the troupe’s skills, even if it doesn’t quite match the experience of seeing them live. Producer James Cameron and director Andrew Adamson utilize a minimal narrative — a girl visits a circus and is transported into Cirque Du Soleil’s dreamworld — as an excuse to create a best-of package of the company’s various stage shows. The pundits say Cirque Du Soleil: Worlds Away features plenty of eye-popping imagery, but it may not win over those who don’t already love the group.Monsters, Inc. 3D 96%With Monsters University hitting theaters next year, now is as good a time as any to revisit the world of Monsters, Inc. which is getting the rerelease treatment this week in glorious 3D. This tale of a pair of monsters who can’t seem to frighten one tenacious little girl is one of Pixar’s classics; like most of the studio’s output, it’s Certified Fresh.Also opening this week in limited release:Kathryn Bigelow‘s Zero Dark Thirty, starring Jessica Chastain in a thriller about the CIA’s hunt for Osama Bin Laden, is Certified Fresh at 94 percent.Barbara, a Cold War thriller about an East German doctor whose escape plan to the West is complicated by a man she doesn’t fully trust, is at 94 percent.Michael Haneke‘s Amour, starring Jean-Louis Trintignant and Emmanuelle Riva in a drama about a man tending to his dying wife, is Certified Fresh at 92 percent.The Impossible, starring Naomi Watts and Ewan McGregor in a thriller about a vacationing family caught in the path of a tsunami, is Certified Fresh at 82 percent.Not Fade Away, a coming-of-age drama about a 1960s teenage garage band from Sopranos creator David Chase, is at 77 percent.On the Road, starring Kristen Stewart and Garrett Hedlund in an adaptation of Jack Kerouc’s classic Beat Generation novel, is at 46 percent (check out our interview with Hedlund here).","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"Kids, Tarantino, drama, dark, game-of-thrones","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Critics-Consensus-Jack-Reacher-Features-Tom-Cruise-in-Control"},{"id":"47508774911606","title":"Critics Consensus: Life of Pi Is Certified Fresh","content":"Critics Consensusvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Critics Consensus: Life of Pi Is Certified FreshPlus, Rise of the Guardians should please kids, Red Dawn strikes out, and Silver Linings Playbook is Certified Fresh.by Tim Ryan | November 20, 2012 |  CommentsHappy Thanksgiving! This week at the movies, we’ve got a furry castaway (Ang Lee‘s Life of Pi starring Suraj Sharma); folkloric fighters (Rise of the Guardians, with voice work from Chris Pine and Alec Baldwin); teen guerillas (Red Dawn, starring Chris Hemsworth and Josh Hutcherson); and unhappy singles (Silver Linings Playbook, starring Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence). What do the critics have to say?Life of Pi 86%On paper, Life of Pi shouldn’t work — it’s a 3D adaptation of a supposedly “unfilmable” magic realist novel. But critics say director Ang Lee’s film achieves the near impossible — it’s a phantasmagoric technical achievement that’s emotionally rewarding as well. Newcomer Suraj Sharma stars as a young man who survives a shipwreck only to be set adrift in a lifeboat — with a Bengal tiger. The pundits say the Certified Fresh Life of Pie is so visually sumptuous, and newcomer Sharma is so strong, that occasional moments of so-so dialogue are easily forgiven. (Check out this week’s Total Recall, in which we count down Lee’s best-reviewed films.)Rise of the Guardians 75%A sort of Avengers for the elementary school set, critics say Rise of the Guardians is stylish and briskly paced, but it’s only so-so in the storytelling department. When a nightmare king named Pitch attempts to spread darkness all over the world, it’s up to such unlikely heroes as Santa Claus, Jack Frost, and the Easter Bunny to save the children from misery and despair. The pundits say Rise of the Guardians should please small children with its whirl colorful action, and adults will find it to be a decent, if not groundbreaking, animated romp.Red Dawn 15%The original Red Dawn may have strained credibility, but at least there was a Communist Bloc to fear in 1984. Critics say a lack of topicality is only one of the problems with this new Red Dawn, which features some decent action sequences but gives a short shrift to character development and general logic. A foreign enemy has invaded a small town in Washington, and a group of teens that includes Chris Hemsworth and Josh Hutcherson wage guerilla warfare in order to save their community — and America itself. The pundits say Red Dawn makes precious little sense most of the time, and a solid cast of up-and-comers can do little with its generic dialogue. (Check out our 24 Frames gallery of the stars of Red Dawn.)Silver Linings Playbook 92%In the movies, characters fall in love all the time, but critics say they’re rarely as interesting as the folks in Silver Linings Playbook, a sharply written, terrifically acted film about fascinating people in dark situations. Bradley Cooper stars as a down-on-his-luck guy living with his parents after his release from a mental institution. He gets an unexpected boost when he meets a mysterious young woman (Jennifer Lawrence) who seems to offer a solution to his troubles. The pundits say the Certified Fresh Silver Linings Playbook represents another triumph for director David O. Russell, who makes difficult material work splendidly with help from strong performances and witty dialogue.Also opening this week in limited release:The Central Park Five, a documentary by Ken Burns about a group of minority teenagers falsely accused of rape, is at 92 percent.Rust and Bone, starring Marion Cotillard in a drama about a romance between a single father and a woman who has recently suffered from a tragic accident, is Certified Fresh at 82 percent.Hitchcock, starring Anthony Hopkins and Scarlett Johansson in a fictionalized account of the making of Psycho, is at 71 percent.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"Studios, spain, Con, scorecard","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"critics-consensus-life-of-pi-is-certified-fresh"},{"id":"47508774918778","title":"Critics Consensus: Cloud Atlas Is a Beautiful Mess","content":"Critics Consensusvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Critics Consensus: Cloud Atlas Is a Beautiful MessPlus, Fun Size is likeable but bland, Chasing Mavericks is a so-so sports flick, and Silent Hill: Revelation 3D wasn't screened -- guess the Tomatometer!by Tim Ryan | October 25, 2012 |  CommentsThis week at the movies, we’ve got time-spanning connectedness (Cloud Atlas, starring Tom Hanks and Halle Berry); a Halloween escapade (Fun Size, starring Victoria Justice and Chelsea Handler); a legendary surfer (Chasing Mavericks, starring Jonny Weston and Gerard Butler); and a demonic town (Silent Hill: Revelation 3D, starring Adelaide Clemens and Sean Bean). What do the critics have to say?Cloud Atlas 66%The Wachowskis have never been short on ambition; they’ve been blowing minds (or trying to) ever since The Matrix put them on the map. Now they’re back with Cloud Atlas, and critics are divided — some say it’s an awe-inspiring work of visual and emotional daring, while others say it’s muddled, pretentious, and overlong. It’s a series of interconnected vignettes that follows a variety of characters (played by, among others, Tom Hanks, Halle Berry, and Jim Broadbent) across centuries, as seemingly small actions and events have monumental repercussions. The pundits agree that Cloud Atlas is a singular film, but while some are thrilled by its monumental scope and big ideas, others say it’s too undisciplined and disjointed to realize its outsized aims. (Check out this week’s Total recall, in which we count down Hanks’ best-reviewed films, as well as our 24 Frames gallery of epic sci-fi movies.)Fun Size 25%Most Halloween releases feature mad slashers and teens in distress, so it’s refreshing that Fun Size offers a more mirthful take on All Hallows Eve. Unfortunately, critics say the movie is a slight, middling romp that’s breezily likable but mostly forgettable. Victoria Justice stars as Wren, a high school senior tasked with watching her little brother Albert on Halloween. However, the little guy gets lost while trick-or-treating, and Wren must round up a posse to track him down; hilarity ensues. The pundits say Fun Size is pleasant but innocuous, decent teen fare with a few laughs and a lot of predictability.Chasing Mavericks 32%Chasing Mavericks doesn’t stray too far from the inspirational sports movie playbook: it’s got a talented kid, a wise mentor, and a big obstacle to overcome. And that’s part of the problem, critics say: while the film features some remarkable images and strong performances, it can’t quite muster the strength to break free from formula. Jonny Weston stars as real-life surfing star Jay Moriarity who discovers that a legendary wave can be found close to his home. In order to gain the skills necessary to ride such a dangerous patch of water, Jay teams up with Frosty (Gerard Butler), an experienced surfer who acts as both a coach and father figure for the wave-riding prodigy. The pundits say Chasing Mavericks‘ surfing scenes feel authentic, and Weston and Butler share an easy chemistry, but the film’s devotion to sports movie cliches and inspirational platitudes sap it of its power.Silent Hill: Revelation 3D 10%It appears the folks behind Silent Hill: Revelation 3D were afraid their film wouldn’t be worth a trip, since it wasn’t screened prior to release. After a series of vivid nightmares, Heather Mason (Adelaide Clemens) finds herself bedeviled across dimensions by the inhabitants of Silent Hill.

What do the critics have to say?Skyfall 92%Director Sam Mendes is best known for his portrayals of suburban malaise (his credits include American Beauty and Revolutionary Road), so at first blush he’d seem to be an odd choice to direct a James Bond movie. However, critics say Skyfall is a nearly perfect balance of drama and action that winks at 007’s storied cinematic past while delving deeper into the psyche of the most iconic of movie characters. Once again, Daniel Craig stars as 007, and this time the whole of MI6 is under attack. The pundits say the Certified Fresh Skyfall delivers what viewers have come to love and expect from a Bond film: terrific chases, tense fights, breathtaking scenery, and witty dialogue. But it’s also an intriguing character study, one that fleshes out the inner life of fiction’s greatest spy. (Check out this week’s Total Recall, in which we run down Daniel Craig’s best-reviewed movies, as well as our gallery of Bond girls.)Also opening this week in limited release:Steven Spielberg‘s Lincoln, starring Daniel Day-Lewis in a biopic of the great president during the Civil War years, is Certified Fresh at 93 percent.Chasing Ice, a documentary that captures time-lapse footage of rapidly melting polar ice caps, is at 100 percent.A Royal Affair, starring Mads Mikkelsen in a period drama about a doctor who seduces the soon-to-be queen of Denmark, is at 87 percent.The Comedy, starring Tim and Eric in a drama about a thirtysomething misanthrope who tries to get a rise out of the people he meets, is at 82 percent.Starlet, a dramedy about the unlikely friendship between an aspiring actress and a widowed octogenarian, is at 82 percent.Citadel, a horror film about an agoraphobic man who battles a band of feral children in an apartment building, is at 54 percent.Dangerous Liaisons, starring Zhang Ziyi in an adaptation of Choderlos de Laclos’ novel set in 1930s Shanghai, is at 50 percent.In Their Skin, starring Selma Blair and James D’Arcy in a thriller about a family whose remote home is threatened by sinister neighbors, is at 50 percent.Nature Calls, starring Patton Oswalt and Johnny Knoxville in a comedy about an obsessive scoutmaster who kidnaps his apathetic troop for a camping trip, is at nine percent.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"Classic, IFC, emmy, ABC, TV","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"critics-consensus-skyfall-is-certified-fresh"},{"id":"47508774899311","title":"Critics Consensus: Gangster Squad Is Style Over Substance","content":"Critics Consensusvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Critics Consensus: Gangster Squad Is Style Over SubstancePlus, Zero Dark Thirty is Certified Fresh, and A Haunted House wasn't screened -- guess the Tomatometer!by Tim Ryan | January 10, 2013 |  CommentsThis week at the movies, we’ve got tough cops (Gangster Squad, starring Sean Penn and Ryan Gosling), a tenacious CIA agent (Zero Dark Thirty, starring Jessica Chastain and Joel Edgerton), and a bedeviled couple (A Haunted House, starring Marlon Wayans and Essence Atkins). What do the critics have to say?Gangster Squad 31%Gangster Squad has a lot of promise: it’s a true crime tale with a star-studded cast bathed in the dark shadows of film noir. Unfortunately, critics say the film is largely a case of style over substance, and beneath its stylish veneer lies a shopworn script and an excessive amount of violence. It’s the late 1940s, and Mickey Cohen (Sean Penn) runs the Los Angeles underworld with help from a cadre of crooked cops. That is, until straight-arrow lawmen John O’Mara (Josh Brolin) and Jerry Wooters (Ryan Gosling) assemble a clandestine crew of LAPD officers to take Cohen down. The pundits say Gangster Squad looks terrific, and its actors inhabit their roles well, but its script apes older gangland classics without bringing much new to the table. (Check out this week’s Total Recall, in which we count down Gosling’s best-reviewed films, as well as our video interviews with the cast.)Zero Dark Thirty 91%The story of the CIA’s hunt for Osama bin Laden was so dramatic — and so fraught with political import — that it required a great filmmaker to bring it to the screen. Critics say Kathryn Bigelow, who won a Best Director Oscar for The Hurt Locker, is up to the task, and Zero Dark Thirty is a pulse-quickening thriller that presents the nuts and bolts of the operation with complexity and smarts. Jessica Chastain stars as Maya, a young CIA operative who relentlessly pursues leads into the whereabouts of the terrorist mastermind, which eventually result in a raid on bin Laden’s secret compound in Pakistan. The pundits say the Certified Fresh Zero Dark Thirty is an urgent piece of moviemaking, one that captures not only the milieu of driven professionals but also the national mood after the traumatic effects of 9/11.(Check out our interviews with stars Chastain and Jason Clarke.)A Haunted House 9%January is often a dumping ground for mediocre movies, and the lack of pre-release screenings for A Haunted House indicates that it’s probably pretty bad. A Haunted House is a cameo-laden parody of found footage horror films like Paranormal Activity. Once again, it’s time to guess the Tomatometer! (And take a look through our gallery of memorable 3D horror movies.)Also opening this week in limited release:In Another Country, a dramedy starring Isabelle Huppert as three different women who visit a beachfront bed-and-breakfast, is at 80 percent.Quartet, starring Maggie Smith and Tom Courtenay in a dramedy about the arrival of a famous opera star at a residence for retired musicians, is at 78 percent.Uprising, a documentary about the pro-democracy protests in Egypt during the Arab Spring, is at 71 percent.Fairhaven, a drama about a former high school football star who returns to his hometown, is at 56 percent.Clandestine Childhood, a coming-of-age drama about the son of revolutionaries working to overthrow the Argentinian government in the late 1970s, is at 50 percent.High Tech, Low Life, a doc about two bloggers that cover underreported news in contemporary China, is at 50 percent.Storage 24, a sci fi/horror hybrid about a group of friends stuck in a storage facility overrun by extraterrestrial critters, is at 44 percent.Struck by Lightning, starring Chris Colfer in a comedy about a recently deceased high school senior looking back on his recent misadventures, is at 32 percent.Let My People Go!, a French farce about a gay man who moves in with his neurotic family after a series of mishaps, is at 29 percent.My Best Enemy, a dramedy about a man who attempts to commandeer priceless artworks in Nazi-occupied Austria, is at 25 percent.The Baytown Outlaws, starring Billy Bob Thornton and Eva Longoria in a comedy about a woman attempting to rescue her son from her violent ex-husband, is at 13 percent.Horrid Henry: The Movie, a kiddie flick about a mischievous rascal whose failure to submit his homework leads to a series of wacky events, is at 10 percent.Finally, props to George Patchell for coming the closest to guessing Texas Chainsaw 3D‘s 21 percent Tomatometer.&gt;","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"Century, justice, high, 2015, Crunchyroll","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Critics-Consensus-Gangster-Squad-Is-Style-Over-Substance"},{"id":"47508776509051","title":"Critics Consensus: Paranormal Activity 4 Offers Up Stale Scares","content":"Critics Consensusvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Critics Consensus: Paranormal Activity 4 Offers Up Stale ScaresPlus, Alex Cross is a generic thriller, and The Sessions and Holy Motors are Certified Fresh.by Tim Ryan | October 19, 2012 |  CommentsThis week at the movies, we’ve got ghostly video recordings (Paranormal Activity 4, starring Katie Featherston and Kathryn Newton) and a killer on the loose (Alex Cross, starring Tyler Perry and Edward Burns). What do the critics have to say?Paranormal Activity 4 23%The first three Paranormal Activity films were able to wring a surprising amount of scares out of purported found footage from stationary cameras. However, all good things must come to an end, and critics say Paranormal Activity 4 finds the franchise repeating itself, offering some decent shocks but mostly recycling the elements that worked better before. Alex (Kathryn Newton) is a teenager who notices a strange new kid in the neighborhood. When the boy’s mother is hospitalized, he moves in with Alex’s family – and seems to bring a strange curse with him. The pundits say Paranormal Activity 4 is pretty creepy, but the sense of surprise is gone — it’s the first entry that feels formulaic.Alex Cross 11%Despite the middling critical response to Kiss the Girls and Along Came a Spider, detective Alex Cross gets another shot at big screen glory. Unfortunately, critics say Alex Cross is a thoroughly generic action thriller, and Tyler Perry lacks the gravitas Morgan Freeman brought to the title role previous installments. Cross is a Detroit cop on the trail of the sadistic serial killer Picasso (Matthew Fox), whose targets are comprised of the city’s elite. Soon, however, the mystery becomes personal as the killer threatens Cross’ loved ones. The pundits say Alex Cross is plagued by underdeveloped characters, big gaps in logic, and an overabundance of clichés.

What do the critics have to say?The Words 24%The Words is an ambitious film with an undeniably intriguing premise: how does someone rationalize reaping the rewards of a big con? Unfortunately, critics say The Words is mostly a missed opportunity – despite the best efforts of its talented cast, the film is elaborately structured but rarely emotionally fulfilling. Bradley Cooper stars as Rory Jansen, a celebrated author with a secret: he passed off someone else’s book as his own. As his star rises, Jansen is intoxicated by fame, but is soon forced to deal with the moral consequences of his deception. The pundits say The Words has enough appealing elements to sustain interest, but it’s undone by its needlessly complex narrative and lack of character development. (Check out this week’s Total Recall, in which we run down some noteworthy films featuring imposters and fabulists.)The Cold Light of Day 4%Not all globetrotting spy thrillers are created equal. Take, for example, The Cold Light of Day, which critics say borrows liberally from the Taken and Bourne playbooks without adding such essential elements as comprehensibility and plausibility. Henry Cavill stars as a young man whose parents are kidnapped while on holiday in Spain. The plot thickens when our hero finds himself on the run from shadowy intelligence agents in pursuit of a mysterious briefcase. The pundits say The Cold Light of Day is largely bereft of surprises or even general coherence, and the stars — including Bruce Willis and Sigourney Weaver — mostly look exhausted.Also opening this week in limited release:Beauty Is Embarrassing, a documentary about cartoonist and Pee-wee’s Playhouse co-creator Wayne White, is at 100 percent.Girl Model, a documentary about the trafficking of underage girls in the modeling industry, is at 89 percent.Keep the Lights On, a drama about two men in an up-and-down long-term relationship, is at 86 percent.Detropia, a doc about the crumbling infrastructure of the Motor City, is at 80 percent.Las Acacias, a drama about an Argentine truck driver who bonds with a mother and her daughter over the course of a long drive, is at 73 percent.The Eye of the Storm, starring Geoffrey Rush and Charlotte Rampling in a drama about a dying rich woman whose adult children are squabbling over their share of her fortune, is at 66 percent.The Inbetweeners, a British comedy about four geeky guys who go on a wild Mediterranean vacation, is at 62 percent.Hello I Must Be Going, a dramedy about a newly-divorced woman who finds romance with a teenager, is at 61 percent.For Ellen, starring Paul Dano and Jena Malone in a drama about an aspiring musician dealing with a painful divorce, is at 54 percent.Bachelorette, starring Kirsten Dunst and Isla Fisher in a comedy about three bridesmaids who share a night of debauchery before their friend’s wedding, is at 53 percent.[REC] 3 Genesis, a horror flick in which zombies rudely crash a wedding, is at 42 percent.Serving Up Richard, horror film about a married couple who attempt to cannibalize a Wall Street banker, is at 17 percent.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"Studios","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Critics-Consensus-The-Words-Doesnt-Know-What-To-Say"},{"id":"47508776539782","title":"Critics Consensus: Total Recall Isn’t An Affair To Remember","content":"Critics Consensusvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Critics Consensus: Total Recall Isn't An Affair To RememberPlus, Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Dog Days is mildly amusing but predictable.by Tim Ryan | August 3, 2012 |  CommentsThis week at the movies, we’ve got artificial memories (Total Recall, starring Colin Farrell and Kate Beckinsale) and summertime blues (Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Dog Days, starring Zachary Gordon and Steve Zahn). What do the critics have to say?Total Recall 31%If you’re going to remake a modern classic, you’d better bring something new to the table. Unfortunately, critics say this new Total Recall is visually impressive, but it swaps out the existential anxiety and eccentric panache of Paul Verhoeven’s 1990 film for an overabundance of action set-pieces. Suffering from disturbing dreams, Douglas Quaid (Colin Farrell) decides to visit Rekall, a company that implants memories of an exciting vacation. When the procedure goes awry, however, Quaid becomes the target of a manhunt, and teams up with a beautiful rebel agent (Jessica Biel) on a mission to destroy the Rekall Corporation. The pundits say Total Recall, while technically sound, could use some of the wit and vulnerability that Arnold Schwarzenegger brought to the original. (Check out this week’s Total Recall, in which we run down noteworthy films about memory loss.)Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Dog Days 52%The Diary of a Wimpy Kid franchise has been nothing if not consistent; each movie chronicles the terrors of middle school with moderate wit and little elegance. Critics say the latest entry, Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Dog Days, offers more of the same: a few decent laughs and an awful lot of predictability. Zachary Gordon stars yet again as Greg Heffley, who finds himself bereft of summer plans. To stave off boredom, our hero pretends to have a job at a country club and embarks on an ill-fated camping trip. The pundits say Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Dog Days is warm and reasonably amusing, but it feels more like a sitcom than a feature film.Also opening this week in limited release:Mosquita Y Mari, a coming-of-age drama about the close friendship between two Los Angeles teens, is at 88 percent.Girlfriend Boyfriend, a romantic comedy about the love lives of three classmates during an era of political upheaval in Taiwan, is at 83 percent.You’ve Been Trumped, a documentary about a group of Scottish homeowners protesting a plan by the Donald to build a golf course on an environmentally sensitive area, is at 79 percent.Celeste and Jesse Forever, starring Rashida Jones and Andy Samberg in a dramedy about a divorced couple that attempts to maintain a close friendship, is at 77 percent.Dreams of a Life, a docudrama about a woman who died in her apartment and wasn’t discovered for three years, is at 74 percent.Sushi: The Global Catch, a doc about the environmental impact of the popular Japanese dish, is at 67 percent.360, starring Jude Law and Rachel Weisz in a drama about disparate characters whose lives intersect through a series of affairs, is at 32 percent.The Babymakers, starring Olivia Munn and Paul Schneider in a comedy about a couple that conspires to rob a sperm bank in a desperate attempt to conceive a child, is at four percent.Assassin’s Bullet, starring Christian Slater and Donald Sutherland in a thriller about an FBI agent on the trail of a terrorist-killing vigilante, is at zero percent.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"Fresh, Black, Cosplay, TV, Comics, dark, Vudu, curtis, El, casting, drama","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Critics-Consensus-Total-Recall-Isnt-An-Affair-To-Remember"},{"id":"47508776533636","title":"Critics Consensus: The Expendables 2 Is (Mostly) Big, Dumb Fun","content":"Critics Consensusvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Incredibles 2 Is Certified FreshPlus, Tag is mildly entertaining and Superfly is more style than substance.by Jeff Giles | June 14, 2018 |  CommentsThis weekend at the movies,&nbsp;we have a belated sequel to a Pixar classic (Incredibles 2, featuring the voices of&nbsp;Holly Hunter&nbsp;and&nbsp;Craig T. Nelson), some of Hollywood’s funniest fellows trying to touch one another without permission (Tag, starring&nbsp;Ed Helms,&nbsp;Jeremy Renner, and Jon Hamm), and a remade blast from the blaxploitation past (Superfly, starring Trevor Jackson&nbsp;and Jason Mitchell).&nbsp;What are the critics saying?Incredibles 2 (2018)  93%If you’re going to try and follow up an acclaimed blockbuster, you might as well take your time getting the sequel right — and in animation, where time can stand still forever, you have the added benefit of not needing to rush your cast back in front of the camera. Still, after waiting nearly 15 years for a second installment of The Incredibles, fans can be forgiven a certain amount of impatience; while the creative teams at formerly franchise-averse Pixar dreamed up new stories for the characters in Toy Story, Cars, Finding Nemo, and Monsters Inc., the ability to return to theaters continued to elude the superpowered Parr family. All that waiting has finally paid off with Incredibles 2, which reunites the original voice cast for a new adventure serving up more of the domestic turmoil, superhero satire, and brilliantly animated action that made the first one such a hit. It’d be tough to improve on the original Incredibles, and critics say that while this sequel doesn’t quite pull off that feat, it comes impressively close, adding yet another acclaimed entry to Pixar’s already estimable filmography. If you were a kid when The Incredibles&nbsp;came out, you might have kids of your own now — and like all the best stuff the studio has put out, the whole family can look forward to enjoying Incredibles 2.Tag (2018)  56%On one hand, it’s easy to believe Hollywood has long since exhausted most of the reasonable possibilities for comedy that exist in movies about grown men acting like boys. On the other, when you’ve got the Wall Street Journal writing about a real-life group of guys who take a month off every year to continue the game of tag they’ve been playing since they were kids, well, it’s awfully hard to resist the temptation to turn that into a film. Enter the descriptively titled Tag, starring Hannibal Buress, Jon Hamm, Ed Helms, Jake Johnson, and Jeremy Renner as the fellows in question — a talented bunch whose commitment to the story was reflected in the set injury Renner sustained, breaking both of his arms and necessitating some last-minute CGI limb replacements in post-production. It would be wonderful to report that Renner’s suffering came in service of one of the year’s best-reviewed action comedies; alas, the truth is that critics are kinda meh on Tag, which reviews describe as funny and engaging in fits and starts, but ultimately not consistent or committed enough to fully deliver on its premise. Still, this is one talented cast, and even the critical pans say the movie isn’t without its moments, so if you’re in the mood for some arrested development laughs, you may want to check your local listings.Superfly (2018)  51%Released in 1972, the original Superfly&nbsp;helped lead the blaxploitation wave with a thoughtful Harlem-set drama about a drug dealer looking for one last big score; the movie’s trappings may look somewhat dated today, but thanks to Ron O’Neal‘s performance as main character Youngblood Priest — not to mention a killer Curtis Mayfield soundtrack — it still feels fresh. It’s easy to understand why music video veteran Director X wanted to take a shot at updating the story, and its themes are just as relevant as they were more than 45 years ago; unfortunately, critics say those themes have mostly been lost in this new version, which is far more focused on style than substance. Starring Trevor Jackson as Priest, the 2018 edition moves the action to Atlanta, but the basic contours of the story remain the same — which is part of why a number of reviews have outlined pundits’ disappointment with the lost social subtext. This Superfly&nbsp;will make its fortune by and by, thanks to Director X’s way with an artfully arranged scene or set piece, but as is so often the case with remakes, the original still reigns supreme.What’s New on TVThe Bold Type: Season 2 (2018)  100%The Bold Type presents an aspirational yet refreshingly realistic portrait of young women’s careers, friendships and love lives in a big city.Strange Angel: Season 1 (2018)  71%A beautiful slow burn, Strange Angel shoots for the stars, but gets a little lost in its own orbit.Also&nbsp;Opening This Week In Limited Release Eating Animals (2018) , a documentary about the commercial factory farming industry and its various impacts, is at 100%.

His Batman trilogy concludes with The Dark Knight Rises, and the critics say the result is a sprawling, ambitious, emotionally satisfying film with a pulse-pounding climax that (mostly) justifies its epic runtime. With Batman (Christian Bale) in self-imposed exile after taking the fall for Harvey Dent’s criminal activity, a couple of costumed criminals have run rampant in Gotham City: the stealthy cat burglar Selina Kyle (Anne Hathaway) and the muscle-bound terrorist Bane (Tom Hardy). Can the Caped Crusader overcome his personal demons and save the day? The pundits say that while the Certified Fresh The Dark Knight Rises doesn’t match its predecessor’s brilliance, it’s visually masterful and breathlessly exciting — a fitting sendoff to a series that brought comic book movies to new heights.

Hit &amp; Run, which critics say is an odd and only occasionally satisfying mix of romance, comedy, and Tarantino -esque plot twists. Real-life partners Kristen Bell and Dax Shepard star as a young couple who decide to hit the road in search of new opportunities. However, along the way they’re pursued by an old friend (Bradley Cooper) and a wacky federal marshal (Tom Arnold). The pundits say Hit &amp; Run is often funny and sweet, but it’s undone by jarring tonal shifts and a general lack of comedic discipline.Premium Rush 74%If you’re in the mood for a good old-fashioned chase movie, critics say you could do a lot worse than Premium Rush, a cat-and-mouse thriller with enough visceral adventure to keep nagging logical questions at bay. Wilee (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) is a New York City bike messenger who picks up a package for delivery. What seems like a routine job is immediately complicated when a crooked cop (Michael Shannon) starts following Wilee, desperate to get his hands on the parcel at all costs. The pundits say Premium Rush doesn’t always adhere to the rules of common sense, but it’s so fast-paced and exciting that you probably won’t care, and Shannon makes for a frightening antagonist. (Check out this week’s Total Recall, in which we run down some noteworthy bicycle movies.)The Apparition 3%It appears the folks behind The Apparition are afraid it will scare up some bad reviews, as it was barely screened for critics prior to release. Ashley Greene and Sebastian Stan star as a young couple who find their house haunted by a malevolent spirit, one that was unleashed by a university paranormal experiment. It’s time to guess the Tomatometer! (And check out 24 Frames for a pictorial history of supernatural horror films.)Also opening this week in limited release:Teddy Bear, a drama about a Danish bodybuilder who goes to Thailand looking for love, is at 89 percent.Samsara, a globetrotting, dialogue-free documentary from the folks who brought you Baraka, is at 86 percent.Sleepwalk With Me, a comedy written, directed by, and starring Mike Birbiglia about a standup comedian who has relationship and sleeping issues, is at 83 percent.Somewhere Between, a documentary about Chinese adoptees in America, is at 83 percent.The Brazilian import Neighbouring Sounds, a drama about a crime wave undermining the security of an affluent seaside community, is at 67 percent.The Revenant, a horror comedy about a newly-minted zombie who searches for blood among society’s dregs, is at 55 percent.Little White Lies, starring Marion Cotillard and Jean Dujardin in a dramedy about a group of old friends who discuss their lives at a vacation house, is at 41 percent.Hermano, a drama about adoptive brothers pulled apart by both neighborhood violence and a soccer rivalry, is at 38 percent.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"fast, Cartoon, green, Teen, demand, scorecard, FX, the, dc, diversity, Channel, Hallmark, Con","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Critics-Consensus-Hit-and-Run-Is-Hit-And-Miss"},{"id":"47508776528514","title":"Critics Consensus: Lawless  Is Violent and Atmospheric","content":"Critics Consensusvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Critics Consensus: Lawless Is Violent and AtmosphericPlus, The Possession is mostly scare-free, and The Oogieloves in The Big Balloon Adventure is more weird than enchanting.by Tim Ryan | August 30, 2012 |  CommentsThis week at the movies, we’ve got bootlegging brothers (Lawless, starring Shia LaBeouf and Tom Hardy), a bedeviled box (The Possession, starring Jeffrey Dean Morgan and Kyra Sedgwick), and some bewitching balloons (The Oogieloves in The Big Balloon Adventure, featuring Toni Braxton and Christopher Lloyd). What do the critics have to say?Lawless 66%Director John Hillcoat (The Road) has carved out a niche as a filmmaker skilled at wringing empathy from bleak and bloody scenarios. Critics say his latest, Lawless, is brilliantly acted and evocatively atmospheric, which helps it to overcome the script’s sometimes slack narrative. Shia LaBeouf and Tom Hardy star as Prohibition-era bootleggers whose business is threatened both by rival hooch-makers and crooked cops who want a cut of their profits. A wave of violence ensues. The pundits say Lawless‘ plot occasionally meanders, but it’s viscerally powerful and features fine performances from a top-notch cast. (Check out this week’s Total Recall, in which we count down co-star Gary Oldman’s best-reviewed movies.)The Possession 39%Plenty of horror flicks have ripped off The Exorcist, so The Possession earns points for injecting a dash of Jewish mysticism into the bedeviled-tot subgenre. Otherwise, critics say, this is a pretty ho-hum frightfest, and despite strong performances and smooth direction, it’s both clichéd and light on scares. Jeffrey Dean Morgan stars as a divorced dad who’s unsettled by his young daughter’s obsession with an antique wooden box purchased at a yard sale, which contains a malevolent spirit from Jewish folklore. The pundits say The Possession is a little better than many of its ilk, but it’s still a pretty by-the-numbers supernatural thriller. (Check out 24 Frames for a pictorial rundown of cursed movie items.)The Oogieloves in The Big Balloon Adventure 30%If you’ve got (really) little kids, there’s a decent chance they’ll enjoy The Oogieloves in The Big Balloon Adventure, a colorful, sweet family musical. However, critics say grown-ups may find this odd slice of juvenilia to be overly saccharine and pretty far from toe-tapping. The plot: the Oogieloves are planning a birthday party for a friend, but complications ensue when their magical balloons fly away. Our heroes embark on a quest to retrieve the balloons, and team up with likes of Toni Braxton, Christopher Lloyd, and Cloris Leachman for some musical numbers along the way. The pundits say The Oogieloves is gentle and well-intentioned, but the songs are forgettable and the whole enterprise is more weird than enchanting.Also opening this week in limited release:The Bullet Vanishes, a period mystery about a murder investigation in 1930s China, is at 100 percent.The Ambassador, a gonzo documentary about a man who impersonates a diplomat with the expressed intention of smuggling blood diamonds out of the Central African Republic, is at 74 percent.For a Good Time, Call…, starring Seth Rogen and Ari Graynor in a comedy about a pair of cash-strapped roommates who work as phone-sex operators, is at 66 percent.The Good Doctor, starring Orlando Bloom as a young resident who becomes obsessed with a beautiful patient, is at 60 percent.Tsui Hark‘s The Flying Swords of Dragon Gate, starring Jet Li as the leader of a group of fighters defending the people from a tyrannical leader, is at 56 percent.Little Birds, starring Juno Temple and Leslie Mann in a drama about two teenage girls who leave their depressed small town for a turbulent big city experience, is at 50 percent.The Tall Man, starring Jessica Biel in a horror film about a woman who searches frantically for her missing son, is at 44 percent.One Day On Earth, a documentary that chronicles a single day from every country on the planet, is at 43 percent.The Day, starring Shawn Ashmore and Ashley Bell in a post-apocalyptic thriller about a group of friends attempting to fend off cannibals, is at 29 percent.Irvine Welsh’s Ecstasy, a drama about a young man who has to decide between clubbing and love, is at six percent.Finally, props to Richard Dempsy for coming the closest to guessing The Apparition‘s two percent Tomatometer.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"Showtime, on, IFC, book, Awards","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Critics-Consensus-Lawless-Is-Violent-and-Atmospheric"},{"id":"47508979778059","title":"Total Recall: Chimp Movies","content":"\n\n                                            Total Recall\n                                        \n                        \n                        \n                            var mps=mps||{}; mps._queue=mps._queue||{}; mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[];\n                            mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function() {\n                                mps.rt.insertlogo('#article_sponsorship_ad', 'ploc=articlesponsorship');\n                            });\n                        \n                    \n                    \n                        Total Recall: Chimp Movies\n                        With Chimpanzee hitting theaters, we run down some of cinema's most memorable banana-lovin' primates.\n                        by Jeff Giles | April 20, 2012                          | \n                          \n                              Comments\n                          \n                     \n\n                     \n\n                     \n                       \n                         \n                           \n                         \n                           \n                         \n                           \n                         \n                           \n                       \n                     \n\n                    \n                                                &nbsp;\n\n\n\nIn what’s becoming an adorable annual Earth Day tradition, Disney will release the latest installment in its series of Disneynature documentaries this weekend: Chimpanzee, which follows the cute and cuddly adventures of an orphaned chimp who finds a new family in the jungle. Critics thus far have expressed the usual annoyance for the de rigueur goofy narration (supplied by Tim Allen), but everyone loves chimps, so we decided this week would be the perfect time to take a look at some other films featuring stars from this particular branch of the simian family. Forget about gorillas, apes, monkeys, and orangutans — this week we’re doing Total Recall chimpanzee style!\n\n\n\n\n\nAnimal Behavior\n 13%\nStarring Karen Allen as a primate researcher who’s so into her work she fails to realize that one of her fellow professors (Armand Assante) is into her, this chimp-assisted romance suffered through a mid-picture change in directors and languished in the studio vault for years before co-star Holly Hunter’s rise to fame finally triggered its brief theatrical run in 1989. Perhaps it was better off in the vaults; as Leonard Maltin sniped, “let us all be thankful that Bonzo didn’t live to see this.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Barefoot Executive\n 83%\nStarring a young Kurt Russell in the role that fortunately didn’t kill his career, 1971’s The Barefoot Executive tells the exceedingly silly tale of a TV network mailroom clerk who discovers that his girlfriend’s pet chimp can predict a show’s rating success — and secretly uses the simian’s guidance to jump-start his career. Like most live-action Disney comedies from this period, Executive is decidedly lightweight, but that’s basically the point; as Rob Thomas of the Madison Capital Times wrote (after jokingly referring to the movie as “a trenchant satire on corporate greed”), it’s nothing more than a “Funny, silly chimp movie.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBedtime for Bonzo\n 67%\nThink of chimps at the movies, and it’s probably Bedtime for Bonzo that comes to mind — a gently silly 1951 comedy about a college professor (Ronald Reagan) who tries to settle the “nature vs. nurture” debate by proving he can teach a primate to live by human morals. Though Reagan was somewhat annoyed by Bonzo‘s popularity — he neglected to even watch the movie for more than 30 years after its release — it was one of his more successful films, and remains worth a watch for critics like Sean Axmaker of Turner Classic Movies, who wrote, “you might be surprised to discover that the modest little comedy is actually an enjoyable piece of light entertainment.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBeing John Malkovich\n 94%\nHow do you add the piece de resistance of weirdness to a movie whose impressive list of bizarre ingredients already includes a magical portal inside John Malkovich’s brain, a puppeteer trapped inside a loveless marriage, and a frumpy Cameron Diaz? By giving Diaz’s character a pet chimp named Elijah, naturally. And not just any pet chimp — this one rescues its owner after she’s locked in a cage by her increasingly frustrated husband. It’s all very strange, but not without cause; as Variety’s David Rooney wrote, it’s “Devilishly inventive and so far out there it’s almost off the scale.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBikini Beach\n \nThe Frankie Avalon/Annette Funicello beach movies aren’t exactly known for being critical favorites, and 1964’s Bikini Beach didn’t break the mold; in fact, the New York Times’ Eugene Archer spared only a single sentence for it in his review, dismissing the film as “A horrible juvenile comedy in which surfers fight cyclists and convert their elders to the pleasures of the bronzed physique.” But we’d be remiss if we didn’t mention it here, given its plot about a cranky old millionaire who wants to prove that his pet chimp is smarter than all the teenagers on the beach (and gets off to a pretty good start, too). Besides, how could we resist writing about the movie that featured Avalon playing a ridiculous British rocker named the Potato Bug?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEd\n 0%\nDirector Bill Couturié won an Academy Award for his documentary Common Threads: Stories from the Quilt and several Emmys for his subsequent effort, Dear America: Letters Home from Vietnam. Then he directed Ed, an ostensible starring vehicle for Matt LeBlanc of Friends, and neither man’s career would ever be the same. Expectations were low for this family-friendly comedy about a struggling pitcher and the baseball-playing chimp who helps him save his career, but critics were still appalled when it loped into theaters in the spring of 1996 — and so were audiences, who ignored it to the tune of a paltry $4 million gross. “Some would say that kids may like it,” argued Brad Laidman of Film Threat, “but kids enjoy eating packets of sugar — that’s no reason to encourage it.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Fifth Monkey\n 20%\nOne of the oddest entries in Sir Ben Kingsley’s filmography, The Fifth Monkey finds him traipsing through the jungle as Cunda, a poor rainforest tribesman who’s trying to save up enough money from his job as a snake capturer to marry a local widow. After being bitten by a snake, Cunda is visited by a quartet of magical chimps, and that’s where things start to get really strange, with gold miners, mercenaries, and other assorted obstacles preventing him from reaching the city so he can sell his simian friends. “The Fifth Monkey is not only simple,” snarked Vincent Canby of the New York Times in his brief, bitingly sarcastic review. “It is also simple-minded.”\n\n\n\n\n\nLt. Robin Crusoe USN\n \nThere might be a clever movie to be made by updating the story of Robinson Crusoe, but Lt. Robin Crusoe, U.S.N. — starring Dick Van Dyke as a Navy pilot who crashes on a seemingly deserted island, makes friends with a genius astronaut chimp named Floyd, and steals the heart of a native girl — isn’t it. Walt Disney picked up a screenwriting credit for this adaptation of the Daniel Defoe novel under a pseudonym, which caused TV Guide to wryly observe, “The story is credited to “Retlaw Yensid,” which is backward for Walter Disney. His name is not the only backward thing here.”\n\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n\nMax, Mon Amour\n 22%\nMovies featuring primates of any kind tend to be on the strange side, but even by the relaxed standards of the genre, Max, Mon Amour is notably bizarre. The tale of a British diplomat (Anthony Higgins) who comes home one day to find his wife (Charlotte Rampling) in bed with a chimpanzee — and then invites her hairy paramour into their home — Max proved difficult for critics to make sense of, but most of them understood enough to know they didn’t like it. Empire’s Kim Newman reacted more violently than most, writing, “Impossible to take seriously or as satire, this film is an embarrassment to humanity and our cousins in the jungle.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMVP: Most Valuable Primate\n 20%\nFlush with the profits from their golden retriever trilogy, the producers of the Air Bud movies figured one adorably precocious animal was as good as another, and kicked off a whole new franchise with MVP: Most Valuable Primate. It uses the same basic “it’s funny when animals play sports” premise — and, somewhat incredibly, the same human star, Kevin Zegers — but the sight of a chimp playing ice hockey was all they needed to attract audiences, who brought in enough box office to spawn a pair of sequels. Though most critics weren’t swayed, Lawrence Van Gelder of the New York Times disagreed with his peers, arguing that while the film “may bear the outline of a cookie cutter… at least the cutter wasn’t wielded by a klutz.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProject X\n 75%\nLong before the Project X starring teenagers acting like monkeys, we had the 1987 version — a sweet dramedy about a wiseacre test pilot (Matthew Broderick) whose goofing around gets him tasked with supervising a chimp project, and ultimately discovers his subjects are being exposed to lethal levels of radiation. His character’s subsequent efforts to save the chimps form the basis of the type of noble, heartwarming tale that filmmakers tend to smother with schmaltz, but director Jonathan Kaplan was careful not to layer the film with false sentiment. As Rita Kempley observed for the Washington Post, “It’s as unabashedly political as Silkwood and unashamedly sentimental as Lassie Come Home. Yet it remains taut and resists the temptation to paint the villains too broadly.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpace Chimps\n 33%\nIt has a pretty terrific voice cast, including Andy Samberg, Patrick Warburton, Stanley Tucci, and Jeff Daniels, but as far as most critics were concerned, 2008’s Space Chimps failed to launch. Despite the promise of a wacky plot outline that sent the descendants of the first astronaut chimps into space in order to fight an alien tyrant named Zartog (voiced by Daniels), Chimps settled for run-of-the-mill animation and stale gags. Sighed USA Today’s Claudia Puig, “Only a truly dreadful story could make 81 minutes seem like an eternity. And Space Chimps is just that leaden experience.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRise of the Planet of the Apes\n 82%\nFrom its beginnings as a bestselling sci-fi novel, the Planet of the Apes series has used apes as a titular catchall — but chimps have figured pretty prominently in the franchise, from the wise Dr. Cornelius to the noble Caesar. And although the original’s many sequels and TV spinoffs were definitely subject to the law of diminishing returns, 2011’s critically and commercially successful reboot restored some simian luster; in fact, TIME’s Richard Corliss said it “deserves to be in the company of the great original Kong.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpymate\n 17%\nSpymate, rhymes with primate — get it? Of course you do. So did director Robert Vince, who so enjoyed working with chimps on MVP: Most Valuable Primate that he went back to the simian well for this family-friendly action comedy about a super-spy chimp who rescues his human partner from Middle Eastern terrorists — and that’s just the movie’s opening sequence. From there, it’s off to the rather convoluted escapades of a teen science prodigy (Emma Roberts) who’s kidnapped by an evil mastermind (Richard Kind) as part of a plot to use her science fair laser drill to cut into the Earth’s core. Toss in a ninja sensei played by Pat Morita, and you’ve got the movie that eFilmCritic’s David Cornelius described as “like having feces thrown at you — in movie form.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTarzan, the Ape Man\n 100%\nJohnny Weismuller probably spent more time with chimps than all the actors on this list put together — after starring in a string of Tarzan films and serials, Weismuller was ready to prove he could act in something other than a loincloth, so naturally he starred in Jungle Jim, the first of 13 movies featuring the character derisively described as “Tarzan with clothes on.” Both adventurers were at home in the jungle, and both passed the time with chimp companions — Tarzan with the confusingly named Cheeta, and Jim with his pal Tamba. 1931’s Tarzan, The Ape Man was as Ken Hanke of the Asheville Mountain XPress put it, “The first Weismuller Tarzan and still one of the best.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\nToby Tyler\n \nUnbelievably, of all the movies on our list, this live-action Disney drama is the only one with what seems like the natural chimp film plot: An adorable little boy (Old Yeller‘s Kevin Corcoran) runs away from his grumpy foster uncle and joins the circus, where he befriends an irascible chimpanzee named Mr. Stubbs. Complete with everything else you’d want or expect from the story, including an evil candy vendor and a pulse-pounding third act in which Mr. Stubbs finds himself on the wrong end of a hunter’s rifle, Toby earned the bemused affection of writers like Howard Thompson of the New York Times, who wrote that it “can boast some of the most engaging, unstrained performers in many a Disney moon.”\n\n\n\n\nTake a look through the rest of our Total Recall archives.

What do the critics have to say?The Amazing Spider-Man 72%The Spider-Man franchise might have set a record for the quickest reboot, though critics say The Amazing Spider-Man is still entertaining, gritty, action-packed stuff — even if we’ve seen it all before. It’s the story of how Peter Parker (Andrew Garfield) gets bitten by a radioactive spider, becomes a superhero, develops a relationship with Gwen Stacy (Emma Stone), and battles a supervillain named the Lizard. The pundits say the Certified Fresh Amazing Spider-Man covers some pretty well-trodden ground, but Garfield and Stone are excellent and the action sequences pack a wallop. (Check out 24 Frames for a pictorial rundown of Marvel characters on the big screen.)Savages 50%Oliver Stone may have mellowed in recent years, but critics say Savages is a return to the disreputable Stone films of old — one that’s messy, but often queasily compelling. A couple of friends (Taylor Kitsch and Aaron Johnson) run a profitable marijuana-dealing business, but a fearsome Mexican drug cartel led by the ruthless Elana (Salma Hayek) insists on a partnership – with severe consequences if they refuse. The pundits say Savages is tonally uneven and a bit overlong, but it’s also exuberantly pulpy and features fine supporting turns from Benicio Del Toro and John Travolta. (Check out this week’s Total Recall, in which we count down Stone’s best-reviewed movies.)Katy Perry: Part of Me 76%At first glance, Katy Perry: Part of Me looks like a tricked-out infomercial, but critics say it’s a rousing and brightly-colored concert documentary that gives some insight into the star’s offstage life. The film follows Perry on her “California Dreams” world tour, capturing her eye-popping stage show as well as archival footage of her younger days and glimpses of backstage drama. The pundits say that even if the Certified Fresh Katy Perry: Part of Me doesn’t delve too deeply, it’s still a revealing portrait of a likeable pop star dealing with the rigors of life on the road.Also opening this week in limited release:The Duplass brothers‘ The Do-Deca-Pentathlon, a comedy about a pair of adult siblings’ fierce rivalry over their homemade Olympics, is at 75 percent (check out Jay Duplass’ Five Favorite Films here).China Heavyweight, a documentary about a boxing coach’s search for talented pugilists in impoverished areas of the Sichuan province, is at 67 percent.The Pact, a horror film about a pair of sisters who discover terrifying family secrets in their childhood home, is at 64 percent.Collaborator, starring Martin Donovan and Olivia Williams in a drama about a famous playwright who has a startling reunion with an old friend, is at 60 percent.Rob Reiner‘s The Magic of Belle Isle, starring Morgan Freeman and Virginia Madsen in a dramedy about an alcoholic novelist looking for inspiration, is at 42 percent.Crazy Eyes, starring Lukas Haas in a drama about a high profile couple in the midst of relationship turmoil, is at 27 percent.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"godzilla, Star, Nat, reviews, 2020, Classic, It","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"critics-consensus-the-amazing-spider-man-is-certified-fresh"},{"id":"47508778144407","title":"Critics Consensus: American Reunion Is A Decent Get-Together","content":"Critics Consensusvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Critics Consensus: American Reunion Is A Decent Get-TogetherPlus, Titanic (in 3D) is (still) Certified Fresh.by Tim Ryan | April 5, 2012 |  CommentsThis week at the movies, we’ve got a ribald get-together (American Reunion, starring Jason Biggs and Alyson Hannigan) and an epic shipwreck (Titanic (in 3D), starring Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet). What do the critics have to say?American Reunion 45%Who would have thought we’d see the American Pie kids grow and mature? Critics say that in American Reunion, our old friends are still good company, but they’re certainly not as shocking as they used to be. The gang from East Great Falls reunites for a high school reunion, and discovers that much has changed since their wild teenage years: most have accepted the responsibilities of adulthood — with the exception of Stiffler, naturally. Still, being a grownup doesn’t ensure that you’ll be free from from lustful thoughts or public embarrassment. The pundits say if you liked the other American Pie movies, you’ll probably like American Reunion as well, but don’t expect too many surprises; while the film has a few good gags, it mostly coasts on the goodwill these characters have earned over the years.Titanic (in 3D) 89%Titanic was pretty much unsinkable upon its release in 1997. This period blockbuster solidified James Cameron‘s status as one of Hollywood’s master technicians, made superstars of Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet, and collected a boatload of Oscars, including Best Picture. It also won approval from the critics, who were (mostly) swept away by Titanic‘s deft blend of romantic melodrama and cutting edge special effects. This week, it’s back on the big screen in 3D, so now’s as good a time as any to revisit the biggest commercial juggernaut of the 1990s — one that’s Certified Fresh to boot. (Check out this week’s Total Recall, in which we run down the history of the the Titanic on film.)Also opening this week in limited release:Guy Maddin‘s Keyhole, starring Jason Patric and Isabella Rossellini in a supernatural drama about a small-time hood who discovers that his house is filled with ghosts, is at 86 percent.Damsels in Distress, starring Greta Gerwig in a comedy about a group of young women at a small college who counsel depressed students, is at 78 percent (check out director Whit Stillman’s Five Favorite Films here.)Surviving Progress, a doc on the potentially negative effects of technological progress on civilization, is at 77 percent.Morgan Spurlock‘s Comic-Con: Episode IV – A Fan’s Hope , a documentary about the obsessive fans who attend the world’s most famous pop culture convention, is at 76 percent.The Hunter, starring Willem Dafoe in a thriller about a mercenary on the trail of an extremely rare Tasmanian tiger, is at 75 percent.Mario Van Peebles‘s We the Party, a coming-of-age comedy about a group of Los Angeles high schoolers trying to find their place in the world, is at 44 percent.We Have a Pope, starring Michel Piccoli in a dramedy about a newly-elected pontiff who doesn’t really want the job, is at 44 percent.The Assault, a thriller based on the true story of a French airline hijacked by terrorists, is at 33 percent.ATM, a thriller about three people trapped in a cash machine kiosk by a mysterious killer, is at 11 percent.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"travel, History, mission:, talk, curtis, Universe, movies, book, Pacific, cancelled, FOX","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Critics-Consensus-American-Reunion-Is-A-Decent-Get-Together"},{"id":"47508779596443","title":"Critics Consensus: John Carter Gets Lost in Space","content":"Critics Consensusvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Critics Consensus: John Carter Gets Lost in SpacePlus, Silent House is spooky but uneven, and A Thousand Words has little to say.by Tim Ryan | March 9, 2012 |  CommentsThis week at the movies, we’ve got a swashbuckler on Mars (John Carter, starring Taylor Kitsch and Lynn Collins), a sinister dwelling (Silent House, starring Elizabeth Olsen and Adam Trese), and a man left speechless (A Thousand Words, starring Eddie Murphy and Kerry Washington). What do the critics have to say?John Carter 52%After earning near-universal acclaim for Finding Nemo and WALL-E, Pixar wiz Andrew Stanton takes a big leap into live action filmmaking with the much-ballyhooed John Carter. The result, critics say, is something of a mixed bag: while John Carter looks terrific and delivers its share of pulpy thrills, it also suffers from uneven pacing and occasionally incomprehensible plotting and characterization. Taylor Kitsch plays the title character, a Civil War vet who finds himself teleported to Mars and in the midst of a conflict between warring tribes. Can he save the Red Planet and get back to Earth? The pundits say John Carter‘s retro-futurist look is cool, and several action set-pieces deliver the goods, but those unfamiliar with Edgar Rice Burroughs’ source novels may have trouble keeping track of everything that’s happening.(Check out this week’s Total Recall, in which we count down co-star Willem Dafoe’s best-reviewed movies.)Silent House 43%Right off the bat, Silent House has two intriguing points in its favor: the whole film is one long unbroken shot, and it stars the excellent Elizabeth Olsen. But while critics say the movie is atmospheric and often quite chilling, its climax is a big letdown. During a weekend stay at her family’s lake house, Sarah (Olsen) becomes trapped by menacing intruders and ominous noises. For the next hour and a half, Sarah tries to uncover the true nature of this malevolent force — and escape with her life. The pundits say Silent House is more technically proficient and ambitious than most fright-fests, but it also suffers from a disappointing payoff. (Check out Olsen’s Five Favorite Films here.)A Thousand Words 0%In last year’s Tower Heist, Eddie Murphy reminded critics that his rapid-fire comedic talent is still very much intact. Unfortunately, critics say those attributes are in short supply in A Thousand Words, an oddly sour, desperate comedy that robs its star of his most valuable asset: his way with words. Murphy plays Jack, a slick, occasionally unscrupulous literary agent who finds a magic tree in his backyard. The tree sheds a leaf every time Jack speaks, and he soon realizes that both he and the tree will die unless he learns to express himself differently. The pundits say A Thousand Words is hyperactive and obvious, with Murphy flailing about in order to wring laughs out of subpar material.Also opening this week in limited release:Jiro Dreams of Sushi, a documentary about the octogenarian that’s considered by many to be the world’s greatest sushi chef, is at 100 percent.The Oscar-nominated Israeli drama Footnote, about a professional conflict between father-and-son Talmudic scholars, is at 88 percent.Shakespeare High, a doc about California high schoolers performing some of the Bard’s greatest works in a prestigious regional competition, is at 88 percent.Sound of Noise, a comedy/thriller about a music-averse cop who must thwart a gang of criminal musicians, is at 88 percent.Attenberg, a coming-of-age dramedy about a young Greek woman dealing with both her father’s impending death and her own romantic awakening, is at 76 percent.The Ballad of Genesis and Lady Jaye, a doc about the literally transformative love affair between the Psychic TV frontman and his bandmate, is at 73 percent.Salmon Fishing in the Yemen, starring Ewan McGregor and Emily Blunt in a dramedy about a fisheries expert tasked with bringing fly fishing to a desert nation, is at 66 percent (check out Blunt’s Five Favorite Films here).Friends With Kids, starring Kristen Wiig and Jon Hamm in a comedy about a group of close friends dealing with the effects of familial responsibility on their love lives, is at 57 percent (check out co-star Megan Fox’s Five Favorite Films here).Good for Nothing, a parody of macho old-school Westerns, is at 40 percent.The Decoy Bride, starring Kelly Macdonald and Alice Eve in a romantic comedy about a movie star who hastily assembles a fake wedding to ward off paparazzi interest in her nuptials, is at 25 percent.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"Crunchyroll, jones, Warner, song, football, dramedy, Paramount, Extras, worst","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Critics-Consensus-John-Carter-Gets-Lost-in-Space"},{"id":"47508778128014","title":"Critics Consensus: Prometheus is Certified Fresh","content":"Critics Consensusvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Critics Consensus: Prometheus is Certified FreshPlus, Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted proves that third time's the charm.by Tim Ryan | June 8, 2012 |  CommentsThis week at the movies, we’ve got an alien resurrection (Prometheus, starring Noomi Rapace and Michael Fassbender) and an incredible journey (Madagascar 3: Europe’s Most Wanted, with voice work from Ben Stiller and Jada Pinkett Smith). What do the critics have to say?Prometheus 73%More than three decades after Alien helped to usher in a new era in sci-fi cinema, Ridley Scott heads back to the cosmos for the ambitious Prometheus. And critics say that while this quasi-prequel to Alien lacks the focus and brutal efficiency of Scott’s 1979 classic, it’s well acted, visually stunning, and filled with big ideas. After unearthing evidence that Earth was visited by an ancient alien race, a group of scientists (led by Noomi Rapace) venture to a distant planet, hoping to discover the origins of mankind. What they find there, however, is far less friendly than they hoped. The pundits say that the Certified Fresh Prometheus often introduces more philosophical concepts than it can deal with, but it possesses a haunting visual grandeur and compelling performances — particularly Michael Fassbender as a fastidious android. (Check out this week’s Total Recall, in which we count down Scott’s best-reviewed movies.)Madagascar 3: Europe’s Most Wanted 78%In spite of the middling critical response to its first installment, the Madagascar franchise has evolved into that rarest of beasts: a film series that improves with each new outing. Critics say Madagascar 3: Europe’s Most Wanted is the best of the bunch, a funny, visually sophisticated animated treat for the whole family. This time, our animal pals depart Africa to return to the Central Park Zoo in New York. However, they get blown off course and end up in Europe, eventually hitching a ride with a traveling circus in order to avoid an obsessive animal control officer. The pundits say Madagascar 3 has a pretty thin plot, but it’s so colorful, briskly paced, and deftly animated that you probably won’t notice.Also opening this week in limited release:Safety Not Guaranteed, a comedy about the search for the man who placed a mysterious classified ad announcing plans for a journey through time, is at 94 percent.Paul Williams Still Alive, a documentary on the post-fame life of the Grammy-winning songwriter, is at 92 percent.The Italian import Corpo Celeste, a drama about a 13-year-old girl who embarks on a spiritual quest prior to her confirmation, is at 85 percent.Todd Solondz‘ Dark Horse, starring Justin Bartha and Selma Blair in a dark comedy about a hostile slacker who awkwardly courts a psychologically damaged woman, is at 75 percent.Lola Versus, starring Greta Gerwig in a comedy about a recently-jilted bride-to-be who attempts to adjust to single life, is at 45 percent.Bel Ami, starring Robert Pattinson and Uma Thurman in a period drama about a man of modest means who climbs Paris’ social ladder by seducing powerful women, is at 31 percent.Peace, Love, &amp; Misunderstanding, starring Jane Fonda and Elizabeth Olsen in a dramedy about a woman in the midst of a personal crisis who takes her teenage childreen to meet their estranged hippy grandmother, is at 26 percent.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"Showtime, color, venice, dramedy, screen, Marvel","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"critics-consensus-prometheus-is-certified-fresh"},{"id":"47508778126989","title":"Critics Consensus: Rock of Ages Hits a Sour Note","content":"Critics Consensusvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Critics Consensus: Rock of Ages Hits a Sour NotePlus, That's My Boy is juvenile.by Tim Ryan | June 15, 2012 |  CommentsThis week at the movies, we’ve got a rock ‘n’ roll romance (Rock of Ages, starring Julianne Hough and Tom Cruise) and some father-son bonding (That’s My Boy, starring Adam Sandler and Andy Samberg). What do the critics have to say?Rock of Ages 43%Given the runaway success of Glee, it’s no surprise that the hit jukebox musical Rock of Ages — featuring songs by Journey, Bon Jovi, Poison, and the like — made the transition from the stage to the screen. Unfortunately, critics say this headbanger’s ball is unlikely to rock you like a hurricane; though it provides some campy thrills, the film is overstuffed with underdeveloped characters and plot strands. Rock of Ages stars Julianne Hough as Sherrie, a small town girl with dreams of rock stardom. She works at a struggling club on the Sunset Strip, where high-maintenance rock god Stacee Jaxx (Tom Cruise) rules the scene. The pundits say Rock of Ages‘ talented cast (especially Cruise) is clearly having a lot of fun, but the plot is wafer thin and the antics surprisingly tame, given the excess of the period it’s supposedly celebrating. (Check out this week’s Total Recall, in which we count down Cruise’s best-reviewed movies.)That’s My Boy 20%Adam Sandler has never exactly been a critical darling, but his most recent starring vehicles (Jack and Jill, Just Go with It, Grown Ups) have been rated lower than usual. The trend continues with That’s My Boy, which critics say is more juvenile than most Happy Madison Productions. The Sandman stars as Donny, who fathered a son named Todd (played by Andy Samberg as a grownup) while in middle school; when Todd turned 18, Donny disappeared from his son’s life. Now strapped for cash, Donny attempts to end their estrangement in order to persuade Todd to take part in a reality TV show; hilarity, in the form of familial discord, ensues. The pundits say That’s My Boy has a few decent lowbrow yuks, but it’s relentlessly sophomoric and tasteless. (Check out 24 Frames for a pictorial rundown of Sandler’s most memorable roles.)Also opening this week in limited release:Tahrir: Liberation Square, a documentary about last year’s Egyptian democracy protests, is at 100 percent.Your Sister’s Sister, starring Emily Blunt and Mark Duplass in a dramedy about a liaison between a pair of grieving friends, is at 93 percent (check out Duplass’ Five Favorite Films here).Marina Abramovic: The Artist Is Present, a documentary about the boundary-pushing performance artist, is at 88 percent.Extraterrestrial, a sci-fi comedy about a group of young people holed up in an apartment as a UFO lurks overhead, is at 69 percent.The Woman in the Fifth, starring Ethan Hawke and Kristin Scott Thomas in a psychological thriller about an expat American writer in Paris who is drawn to an enigmatic woman, is at 69 percent.Americano, starring Salma Hayek in a drama about a French real estate agent who must travel to America to settle his deceased mother’s estate, is at 55 percent.Patang, a drama set in the midst of India’s biggest kite festival, is at 33 percent.The Tortured, a horror film about a pair of suburban parents who take justice into their own hands after their son is murdered, is at eight percent.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"films","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Critics-Consensus-Rock-of-Ages-Hits-a-Sour-Note"},{"id":"47508778133137","title":"Critics Consensus: Battleship Is All Wet","content":"Critics Consensusvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Critics Consensus: Battleship Is All WetPlus, What to Expect When You're Expecting does the expected, and The Dictator generates vicious laughs.by Tim Ryan | May 17, 2012 |  CommentsThis week at the movies, we’ve got nautical combat (Battleship, starring Taylor Kitsch and Rihanna), pregnancy tribulations (What to Expect When You’re Expecting, starring Jennifer Lopez and Cameron Diaz), and a displaced despot (The Dictator, starring Sacha Baron Cohen and Anna Faris). What do the critics have to say?Battleship 34%A big-budget blockbuster based upon a board game, Battleship all but promises empty-headed thrills. On that count, critics say, it succeeds, though they also note that a few mindlessly awesome set pieces can’t totally compensate for the film’s thuddingly silly script. Years after NASA has sent a message to a nearby planet, a group of alien ships visit earth — and they do not come in peace. A group of naval officers leads the charge against the invading armada, and explosions ensue. The pundits say Battleship is about as absurd as it sounds, and although some of the battles are pretty cool, the fun to be had here is of the guilty pleasure variety. (Check out this week’s Total Recall, in which we run down memorable examples of cinematic naval triumphs..)What to Expect When You’re Expecting 23%Since it was first published in 1984, the popular self-help book What to Expect When You’re Expecting has helped to guide women through the turbulent months of pregnancy. Unfortunately, the big screen version lacks the unpredictability of real life, stranding its talented cast in a sitcommy plot. Starring Jennifer Lopez, Cameron Diaz, Elizabeth Banks, Anna Kendrick, Dennis Quaid, and Chris Rock, What to Expect When You’re Expecting is the story of five interconnected couples dealing with a variety of pregnancy and childbirth-related issues, and it features plenty of spirited discussions from both male and female perspectives. The pundits say What to Expect contains occasional laughs fleeting moments of insight, but mostly, this all-star ensemble piece is strictly by-the-book.The Dictator 57%With the gonzo documentaries Borat and Bruno, Sacha Baron Cohen established himself as one of contemporary cinema’s most merciless satirists. Now he’s graduated to scripted comedy, and critics say that while The Dictator isn’t as outrageous or as teeth-clenchingly funny as Borat, it’s just funny and un-P.C. enough to prove that Cohen hasn’t gone soft. This loose remake of Charlie Chaplin’s The Great Dictator is the tale of an oppressive, buffoonish North African despot who survives a coup attempt that leaves him wandering the streets of New York City until a kindly hippie grocer (Anna Faris) takes a shine to him. The pundits say that not every joke in The Dictator works (and a few fall flat), but overall, the film provides enough gleeful tastelessness and sharp political observations to satisfy Cohen’s fans.Also opening this week in limited release:Elena, a Russian thriller about an estranged family plotting to take control of a large inheritance, is at 100 percent.Indie Game: The Movie, a documentary about the development process behind independent video games, is at 100 percent.Polisse, a drama about the professional and personal trials of Paris’ Child Protection Unit, is at 90 percent.Beyond The Black Rainbow, a sci-fi/horror hybrid about a mute girl with psychic powers, is at 88 percent.American Animal, a dramedy about two roommates whose friendship is tested when one decides to get a job, is at 83 percent.Quill: The Life of a Guide Dog, a drama that follows a Labrador retriever from puppyhood to his days as a blind man’s companion, is at 77 percent.Lovely Molly, a horror film about a recently married woman who discovers malevolent forces in her childhood home, is at 57 percent.The Color Wheel, a road trip comedy about a pair of feuding siblings, is at 50 percent.Hysteria, starring Hugh Dancy and Maggie Gyllenhaal in a period piece about the invention of the vibrator during the prudish Victorian era, is at 45 percent.The Samaritan, starring Samuel L.

What do the critics have to say?The Hunger Games 84%The Hunger Games is one of the most eagerly anticipated literary adaptations since Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone. And critics say the movie delivers — director Gary Ross maintains the brisk, tense pace that made the books so tough to put down, and Jennifer Lawrence gives an intense, commanding performance in the lead role. In a dystopian North America, a tyrannical government stages an annual televised gladiatorial competition, in which young people are selected to fight to the death. When Katniss Everdeen (Lawrence) and her old friend Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson) enter the fray, they team up to survive, and their alliance poses a threat to the established order. The pundits say the Certified Fresh Hunger Games is muscular, exciting filmmaking, with an excelling cast and enough weighty ideas to please both newcomers and fans of the books.

What do the critics have to say?Men in Black III 68%In the world of franchise moviemaking, the third time is rarely, if ever, the charm. So it’s something of a surprise to report that the critics say Men in Black III is unexpectedly solid, a fun popcorn flick with excellent special effects and enough laughs to overcome its sporadic moments of mediocrity. This time out, Agent J (Will Smith) learns that his old partner Agent K (Tommy Lee Jones) is in grave danger. In order to rescue K — and save the future of humanity — J must travel back in time and team up with K’s younger self (Josh Brolin). The pundits say Men in Black III doesn’t approach the giddy heights of the first MIB, but it’s a generally agreeable piece of multiplex fare, and Smith is charismatic as always. (Check out this week’s Total Recall, in which we count down Smith’s best-reviewed movies.)Chernobyl Diaries 19%It’s never a good sign when a movie is released before being screened for critics, and unfortunately that’s the case with Chernobyl Diaries. Produced by Paranormal Activity director Oren Peli, it’s the story of a group of American tourists who decide to spice up their European vacation by heading to the site of history’s worst nuclear disaster. When they arrive, however, our heroes discover that they’re stranded — and they’re not alone. Guess the Tomatometer!

What do the critics have to say?Marvel’s The Avengers 91%Over the past decade, Marvel Comics heroes like the Hulk, Iron Man, Thor, and Captain America have each starred in their own films. And each individual installment offered tantalizing hints of a monumental big screen superhero gathering. Well, comic book fans, the wait is over, and it was worth it: critics say Marvel’s The Avengers is terrific entertainment, a giant-sized helping of thrilling action set pieces with enough humor and character development to please non-Marvel fanatics. When Thor’s brother Loki steals the tesseract (the mysterious power source used by Red Skull in Captain America) espionage ace Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) assembles a team of superheroes to retrieve it. Dubbed the Avengers, the newly-formed group — comprised of Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), Captain America (Chris Evans), the Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), Thor (Chris Hemsworth ), and Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson ) — must battle a mysterious extraterrestrial force in order to save humanity. The pundits say the Certified Fresh Avengers does a commendable job of letting all the characters share the spotlight, delivering on its promise of spectacular action, and whetting the appetite for the inevitable sequels.Also opening this week in limited release:Death of a Superhero, a drama about a teenage artist who delves deep into fantastical realms after being diagnosed with a life-threatening illness, is at 100 percent.First Position, a documentary about a prestigious youth ballet competition, is at 88 percent.The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel, starring Judi Dench and Maggie Smith in a dramedy about a group of British retirees who decamp to a run-down hotel in India, is at 76 percent.Last Call at the Oasis, a doc about global water shortages, is at 73 percent.The Perfect Family, starring Kathleen Turner and Emily Deschanel in a comedy about a devout Catholic woman whose less pios family members may prevent her from winning an award for her charitable works, is at 47 percent (check out Turner’s Five Favorite Films here).Mother’s Day, starring Jaime King and Rebecca De Mornay in a horror film about a pair of bank-robbing brothers who terrorize the new residents of their childhood home, is at 47 percent.Jesus Henry Christ, starring Toni Collette and Michael Sheen in a comedy about a two families drawn together because of their precocious children, is at 36 percent.A Little Bit Of Heaven, starring Kate Hudson and Gael García Bernal in a romantic dramedy about a woman who finds love in the midst of a health crisis, is at five percent.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"Shudder, Sundance, prank, independent, universal, Swim, medical, streaming, Hulu, Emmy","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"critics-consensus-marvels-the-avengers-is-certified-fresh"},{"id":"47508778137236","title":"Critics Consensus: The Pirates!

Band of Misfits Is Certified FreshPlus, The Five-Year Engagement is overlong but sweet, Safe is predictable but exciting, and The Raven is spooky but dull.by Tim Ryan | April 27, 2012 |  Comments&nbsp;This week at the movies, we’ve got silly seafarers (The Pirates! Band of Misfits, with voice work from Hugh Grant and Brendan Gleeson); longtime companions (The Five-Year Engagement, starring Jason Segel and Emily Blunt); mafia targets (Safe, starring Jason Statham and Catherine Chan); and a literary gumshoe (The Raven, starring John Cusack and Alice Eve). What do the critics have to say?The Pirates! Band of Misfits 86%Aardman Animations, the folks behind Chicken Run and Wallace &amp; Gromit films, make animated features the old-fashioned way: using stop-motion claymation. And critics say they’ve got another winner with The Pirates! Band of Misfits, a bright, breezy, gleefully eccentric nautical adventure/comedy. A pirate captain named Pirate Captain (Hugh Grant) is on a quest to win the prestigious Pirate of the Year Award; along the way, buckles are swashed, planks are walked, and ships are plundered (ineffectively, but still). The pundits say the Certified Fresh Pirates! Band of Misfits stands as another triumph for Aardman — it’s filled with witty sight gags and inventive visual touches, and it’s likely to amuse both children and their parents.The Five-Year Engagement 64%With their patented mix of heart and raunch, Judd Apatow‘s productions — including, but not limited to, Superbad and Bridesmaids — have scored big with audiences and reviewers. Critics say The Five-Year Engagement doesn’t quite measure up to those standards, but despite some slack pacing, it’s still a pretty warm and honest look at modern love. Jason Segel and Emily Blunt star as Tom and Violet, whose matrimonial happiness is perpetually delayed by everything from bad luck to professional complications. The pundits say The Five-Year Engagement is way too long, and not every gag is a winner, but it’s redeemed by some big laughs and the sweet, believable chemistry between its leads. (Check out our countdown of the best-reviewed wedding movies here.)Safe 59%Jason Statham is equally adept at roundhouse kicks and existential brooding. And while not every Statham vehicle is created equal, critics say Safe is better than most; though it’s formulaic to the bone, the film is gritty and exciting thanks in large part to its star’s charisma and acrobatics. Statham stars as Luke Wright, an ultimate fighter who botches a fixed fight, drawing the ire of the mafia. However, when he rescues and protects a 12-year-old girl with valuable information in her head, the two are pursued by both mobsters and corrupt government officials. The pundits say Safe is really predictable, but it’s an efficient, tough yarn that should satisfy adrenaline junkies. (Check out this week’s Total Recall, in which we run down memorable movies with matching titles.)The Raven 22%The Raven is an odd (if intriguing) bird: it’s a period thriller in which Edgar Allen Poe helps to track a serial killer inspired by the author’s most macabre works. But, to paraphraseth the titular poem, critics say the result has made them weak and weary, as it vainly tries to borrow from fantastic terrors we’ve seen before. After a series of brutal slayings, a young detective calls upon Poe (John Cusack) to help ensure that the writer’s most homicidal fan will kill nevermore. The pundits say The Raven has a spooky gothic look, but it’s mostly a gloomy procedural that offers few thrills — or insights into Poe’s life and works. (Check out Cusack’s Five Favorite Films here.).)Also opening this week in limited release:The Norwegian import Headhunters, a thriller about a corporate con man who undertakes a daring art theft, is at 93 percent.Sound of My Voice, starring Brit Marling in a thriller about two documentarians who attempt to infiltrate a cult and get in over their heads, is at 90 percent.Payback, an abstract documentary that explores the idea of debt through disparate conflicting forces, is at 80 percent.Inventing Our Life: The Kibbutz Experiment, a doc about the history of collective communities in Israel, is at 78 percent.Whores’ Glory, a doc about global prostitution through the eyes of three working girls, is at 78 percent.Richard Linklater‘s Bernie, starring Jack Black and Shirley MacLaine in a comedy about a small town funeral director and his odd friendship with a rich widow, is at 75 percent (check out our interview with Black here).The Giant Mechanical Man, a comedy starring Jenna Fischer as a down-on-her-luck woman who falls for a street performer, is at 73 percent.Warriors of the Rainbow: Seediq Bale, an epic war film about the Japanese occupation of Taiwan in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, is at 67 percent.Citizen Gangster, starring Scott Speedman in a biopic of Toronto’s most famous gangster, is at 50 percent.96 Minutes, a multi-stranded thriller about four kids whose lives intersect during a carjacking, is at 38 percent.Broken Tower, starring James Franco and Michael Shannon in a biopic of the influential poet Hart Crane, is at 33 percent.Elles, starring Juliette Binoche in a drama about a reporter who is unsettled while working on an article about prostitution, is at 31 percent.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"2020, BBC, America, jurassic, mutant, Amazon, cinematic, Max, E!, children's, cars, movies, Chilling, Bowl","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"critics-consensus-the-pirates-band-of-misfits-is-certified-fresh"},{"id":"47508779603615","title":"Critics Consensus: Journey 2 Isn’t Quite Worth the Trip","content":"Critics Consensusvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Critics Consensus: Journey 2 Isn't Quite Worth the TripPlus, Safe House and The Vow play things too safe.by Tim Ryan | February 10, 2012 |  CommentsThis week at the movies, we’ve got a jungle quest (Journey 2: The Mysterious Island, starring Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson and Josh Hutcherson), rogue CIA agents (Safe House, starring Denzel Washington and Ryan Reynolds), an odd boy-meets-girl story (The Vow, starring Rachel McAdams and Channing Tatum), and nascent Jedi in 3D (Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace, starring Ewan McGregor and Liam Neeson). What do the critics have to say?Journey 2: The Mysterious Island 45%Journey 2: The Mysterious Island promises a family friendly adventure in eye-popping 3D; unfortunately, the critics say the film’s goofy charm and solid special effects are undermined by its middling script. A sequel to 2008’s Journey to the Center of the Earth, The Mysterious Island finds Sean Anderson (Josh Hutcherson) in the midst of a fantastic quest: upon receiving a cryptic message from an uncharted island, he joins forces with his stepfather Hank (Dwayne “the Rock” Johnson) to search for treasure and rescue the island’s sole occupant. The pundits say Journey 2 is pleasantly acted and inventively picturesque, but it’s short on excitement and good dialogue. (Check out this week’s Total Recall, in which we count down co-star Luis Guzman’s best-reviewed movies.)Safe House 53%An unoriginal action movie isn’t inherently a bad action movie, though critics say Safe House has enough kinetic thrills to make them wish its plot were a little fresher. Denzel Washington stars as Tobin Frost, a rogue former CIA agent who is being held in a South African safe house. But when mercenaries attack, Frost and rookie agent Matt Weston (Ryan Reynolds) go on the run to find out who ordered the hit. The pundits say Safe House is action-packed and briskly paced, but it’s also pretty predictable and short on suspense. (Check out our list of the best and worst movie CIA agents.)The Vow 31%What if the love of your life forgot who you were? It’s a premise ripe with dramatic possibilities, but critics say The Vow too often sticks to its boy-meets-girl (again) formula at the expense of strong performances from its appealing leads. Based upon true events, The Vow is the story of Paige (Rachel McAdams) and Leo (Channing Tatum), a young couple whose relationship is tested when Paige suffers from severe memory loss after a devastating auto accident. Can she learn to love her husband all over again? The pundits say The Vow is sincere and often moving, but it avoids most messy real-life complications in favor of melodrama.Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace (in 3D) 52%When Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace was released in 1999, there was a disturbance in the Force: critics and audiences were divided over whether it was a bold new chapter in the Star Wars saga or a legacy-tarnishing travesty. The debate is sure to continue with the rerelease of The Phantom Menace in 3D, in which we meet young Anakin Skywalker (Jake Lloyd) and Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) in the days before their paths diverge. The pundits were dazzled by the movie’s visuals but felt the heart and substance of the originals was missing; still, now’s your chance to see Episode I with fresh eyes and make up your own mind.Also opening this week in limited release:The Miners’ Hymns, a documentary portrait of a down-on-its- luck English mining community, is at 100 percent.Chico &amp; Rita, an Oscar-nominated animated musical about a longtime affair between two Cuban musicians, is at 93 percent.Best Foreign Language Film nominee In Darkness, a drama about a sewer worker who hides a group of Jews from Nazi authorities, is at 86 percent.Hungarian auteur Bela Tarr‘s The Turin Horse, a spare drama about peasants preparing for a brutal storm, is at 83 percent.Oscar Nominated Live Action Shorts and Oscar Nominated Animation Shorts are at 82 and 80 percent, respectively.Rampart, starring Woody Harrelson in a drama about a crooked cop with a very messy home life, is at 73 percent (check out our interview with director Oren Moverman here.).Return, starring Linda Cardellini and Michael Shannon in a drama about a soldier struggling to readapt to life in her small town, is at 67 percent.The Dish &amp; The Spoon, starring Greta Gerwig in a dramedy about a woman who meets a teenager while looking for her husband’s mistress, is at 44 percent.Private Romeo, a modern take on Romeo and Juliet set in a military high school, is at 33 percent.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"classics, Wars, TV","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Critics-Consensus-Journey-2-Isnt-Quite-Worth-the-Trip"},{"id":"47508779606689","title":"Critics Consensus: The Grey is Certified Fresh","content":"Critics Consensusvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Critics Consensus: The Grey is Certified FreshPlus, Man on a Ledge is too contrived, and guess One For the Money's Tomatometer.by Tim Ryan | January 27, 2012 |  CommentsThis week at the movies, we’ve got icy survival (The Grey, starring Liam Neeson and Dermot Mulroney), a tense negotiation (Man on a Ledge, starring Sam Worthington and Elizabeth Banks), and a bounty hunter (One For the Money, starring Katherine Heigl and Jason O’Mara). What do the critics have to say?The Grey 79%Liam Neeson is carving out a nice little niche as a middle-aged action hero, and critics say the smart and suspenseful The Grey offers further testament to his authoritative presence as a man locked in combat with nature. When a plane carrying a group of oil-drillers crashes in the unforgiving Alaska wild, Ottway (Neeson) must lead the survivors to safety through a stretch of wilderness that’s home to a particularly aggressive and bloodthirsty pack of wolves. The pundits say The Grey (which is Certified Fresh) is a visceral, sometimes unbearably tense survival tale with a surprising amount of emotional heft and existential angst, and even if it’s occasionally too talky, Neeson is typically awesome. (Check out our feature on Certified Fresh survival movies.)Man on a Ledge 32%Many thrillers require audiences to suspend their disbelief, but critics say the trouble with Man on a Ledge is that its plot is too convoluted and implausible to generate suspense. Sam Worthington stars as Nick Cassidy, a disgraced ex-cop who climbs out on a hotel ledge with the expressed purpose of jumping. However, as police psychologist Lydia Mercer (Elizabeth Banks) tries to talk him down, she suspects he may be part of a larger undertaking. The pundits say Man on a Ledge features some decent performances and plenty of twists, but it’s also overly busy and contrived. (Check out this week’s Total Recall, in which we count down co-star Ed Harris’s best-reviewed movies.)One for the Money 2%It appears the folks behind One For the Money are afraid it isn’t one for the ages, since it wasn’t screened for critics prior to release. Based upon Janet Evanovich’s bestselling novel, the movie stars Katherine Heigl as a Jersey girl who takes a job as a recovery agent for a bail bondsman; soon, she’s tasked with bringing in a murder suspect who happens to be her ex-boyfriend. Kids, it’s time to guess the Tomatometer!Also opening this week in limited release:Declaration of War, a based-on-true-events dramedy about a young couple whose child is suffering from brain cancer, is at 85 percent.How Much Does Your Building Weigh, Mr. Foster?, a documentary about unconventional British architect Norman Foster, is at 47 percent.After Fall, Winter, a drama about a pair of damaged souls who find love in Paris, is at 20 percent.And finally, mad props to RedTuna for coming the closest to guessing Underworld Awakening‘s 30 percent Tomatometer.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"play, critics, miniseries, christmas, Comic-Con, docudrama, pirates, motion, It, 2018","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"critics-consensus-the-grey-is-certified-fresh"},{"id":"47508779612836","title":"Critics Consensus: Guess The Devil Inside‘s Tomatometer","content":"Critics Consensusvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Critics Consensus: Guess The Devil Inside's TomatometerPlus, Once Upon a Time in Anatolia is a complex, evocative crime drama.by Tim Ryan | January 6, 2012 |  CommentsHappy New Year! This week at the movies, we’ve got just one new wide release — The Devil Inside, a tale of demonic possession starring Fernanda Andrade and Simon Quarterman. What do the critics have to say?The Devil Inside 6%It appears the folks behind The Devil Inside feared their film would be exorcised by critics, since it wasn’t screened prior to release. It’s the tale of a young woman who brings a film crew to Rome, hoping to rescue her mother from demonic possession – and avoid the same fate herself. Kids, put down those pitchforks and guess the Tomatometer!

What do the critics have to say?The Woman in Black 67%Daniel Radcliffe tackles his first major post-Harry Potter role in The Woman in Black, and critics say this spooky, atmospheric ghost story conjures up some terrific old-fashioned thrills. Radcliffe stars as Arthur Kipps, a young lawyer who journeys to a small town to settle the estate of a recently-deceased, reclusive widow. However, the locals are reluctant to discuss the matter, and for good reason — a spectral presence casts a dark shadow over the community. The pundits say The Woman in Black sometimes relies too heavily on jump scares, but mostly it does the resurrected Hammer Films imprint proud by harkening back to the company’s Gothic glory days, and Radcliffe is rock-solid in the lead role. (Check out Radcliffe’s Five Favorite Films here.)Chronicle 85%A found-footage mockumentary about teenagers with superpowers, Chronicle is also terrifically acted and endlessly imaginative, critics say. Andrew (Dane DeHaan) is a kid who’s being bullied at home and at school when he starts videotaping his daily activities. His footage gets exponentially more interesting when he and two of his friends develop telekinetic powers after visiting a mysterious gulch. The pundits say the Certified Fresh Chronicle is an action-packed sci-fi yarn that doesn’t skimp on character development, and the result is an exciting, emotionally resonant feature debut for director Josh Trank. (Check out this week’s Total Recall, in which we run down some of cinema’s most unconventional superheroes.)Big Miracle 75%Big Miracle is a mix of romance, realpolitik, and animal rescue that critics say makes for a surprisingly satisfying blend, thanks to excellent performances and an intelligent script. John Krasinski and Drew Barrymore star as a small town news reporter and a Greenpeace volunteer who campaign to save a trio of gray whales trapped by ice at the Arctic Circle; their efforts attract global attention and governmental response, and romance soon follows. The pundits say Big Miracle is smarter and more complex than its synopsis suggests, and if its plotting is occasionally uneven, the film earns its feel-good climax.Also opening this week in limited release:Splinters, a documentary about indigenous surfing in Papua New Guinea, is at 83 percent.The Innkeepers, a horror film about ghost hunters searching for spirits in a haunted hotel, is Certified Fresh at 76 percent.Kill List, a thriller about a mentally damaged hitman who undertakes a particularly disturbing assignment, is Certified Fresh at 76 percent.Windfall, a documentary about the impact of a wind farm on an economically depressed small town, is at 58 percent.W.E., starring Abbie Cornish and James D’Arcy in Madonna‘s biopic of American Duchess of Windsor Wallis Simpson, is at 18 percent.And finally, mad props to Brian C for coming the closest to guessing One for the Money‘s three percent Tomatometer.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"technology, First, The, worst, target, Star, mockumentary, monster, Awards, News","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Critics-Consensus-The-Woman-in-Black-is-a-Solid-Ghost-Story"},{"id":"47508779616934","title":"Critics Consensus: Tintin, Dragon Tattoo Are Certified Fresh","content":"Critics Consensusvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Critics Consensus: Tintin, Dragon Tattoo Are Certified FreshPlus, We Bought a Zoo and War Horse are sweet and warm, and The Darkest Hour wasn't screened.by Tim Ryan | December 22, 2011 |  CommentsHappy Holidays! This week at the movies, we’ve got a junior adventurer (The Adventures of Tintin, starring Jamie Bell and Andy Serkis); a punk hacker (The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo, starring Daniel Craig and Rooney Mara); an animal house (We Bought a Zoo, starring Matt Damon and Scarlett Johansson); a trusted steed (War Horse, starring Jeremy Irvine and Emily Watson); and an alien invasion (The Darkest Hour, starring Emile Hirsch and Olivia Thirlby). What do critics have to say?The Adventures of Tintin 74%Belgian comic book hero Tintin has a lot in common with Indiana Jones, so it’s no surprise that Steven Spielberg has brought the young reporter/adventurer to the big screen. And critics say The Adventures of Tintin is an action-packed, technically resplendent escapade that’s light on plot and character development but heavy on fun. This motion-captured adaptation of Herge’s red-headed hero finds Tintin (Jamie Bell), his faithful dog Snowy, and the slovenly Captain Haddock (Andy Serkis) on a globe-trotting mission to find ancient treasure, all the while tailed by the evil Ivanovich Sakharine (Daniel Craig). The pundits say the Certified Fresh Adventures of Tintin is a beautifully crafted, gleefully escapist affair that should please the whole family.The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo 87%After being adapted in its native Swedish, Stieg Larsson’s international bestseller The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo gets a Hollywood reboot courtesy of David Fincher, and critics say it’s thrilling and stylishly sleek, with a star-making performance from Rooney Mara. Daniel Craig stars as Mikael Blomkvis, a disgraced journalist who’s asked by a wealthy industrialist to investigate an unsolved murder. With the help of the brilliant but troubled computer hacker Lisbeth Salander (Mara), Mikael soon finds that this cold case is full of dangerous secrets. The pundits say the Certified Fresh Girl With the Dragon Tattoo is riveting — it’s briskly paced and darkly atmospheric, and Mara nails Lisbeth, one of recent fiction’s most memorable characters.We Bought a Zoo 65%Cameron Crowe makes movies about nice people, and critics say his latest, We Bought a Zoo, radiates good-natured charm. Based on a true story, it’s the tale of Benjamin (Matt Damon), a widower who moves his two children to a dilapidated zoological park. There, Benjamin works to restore the zoo to its former glory, and finds the cure for his soul sickness in the process. The pundits say that while We Bought a Zoo is clichéd and sappy, it’s also a lot of fun, with a warmhearted spirit that’s tough to resist. (Check out this week’s Total Recall, in which we count down Scarlett Johansson’s best-reviewed movies.War Horse 74%Spielberg’s busy this holiday season; critics say his other new movie, War Horse, is an old-fashioned movie, with all the good and bad that comes with such a characterization; in other words, it’s heartfelt and rousing, but also sometimes sentimental and schmaltzy. Jeremy Irvine stars as Albert, who trains and bonds with a horse named Joey; when World War I breaks out, Joey is taken off to battle, and as he moves across the war zone, he touches lives on both sides of the conflict. The pundits say War Horse is sometimes corny and melodramatic, but it’s also sweet, stirring, and beautifully photographed.The Darkest Hour 12%It looks like the folks behind The Darkest Hour have taken a cue from Ebenezer Scrooge — they’ve been miserly with critics’ screenings of The Darkest Hour. The movie follows a group of youngsters stranded in Moscow who must fight off an alien invasion. Kids, take time out from last minute shopping and guess the Tomatometer! (Also, check out star Emile Hirsch’s Five Favorite Films here).Also opening this week in limited release:Wim Wenders‘ Pina, a 3D documentary about the work of modern dance guru Pina Bausch, is at 93 percent.Extremely Loud &amp; Incredibly Close, starring Thomas Horn and Tom Hanks in a drama about a boy who goes searching for a hidden message from his recently deceased father, is at 63 percent.Angelina Jolie‘s In the Land of Blood and Honey, a drama about a relationship between two people on different sides of former Yugoslavia’s ethnic conflict, is at 50 percent.Albert Nobbs, starring Glenn Close and Mia Wasikowska in a drama about a woman who dresses as a man to stave off unemployment, is at 48 percent.And don’t forget — the Certified Fresh Mission: Impossible Ghost Protocol expands into wide release this weekend.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"song, dark, Fox, Rom-Com","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"critics-consensus-tintin-dragon-tattoo-are-certified-fresh"},{"id":"47508779608738","title":"Critics Consensus: Haywire is Certified Fresh","content":"Critics Consensusvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Critics Consensus: Haywire is Certified FreshPlus, Red Tails fails to take off, and guess Underworld: Awakening's Tomatometer.by Ryan Fujitani | January 19, 2012 |  CommentsThis week at the movies, we’ve got a ferocious femme fatale (Haywire, starring Gina Carano and Ewan McGregor), fearless flyboys (Red Tails, starring Terrence Howard and Cuba Gooding Jr.), and a vengeful vampire (Underworld: Awakening, starring Kate Beckinsale and Stephen Rea). What do the critics have to say?Haywire 80%First-time actress Gina Carano was plucked straight from the mixed martial arts world by director Steven Soderbergh, who happened upon one of Carano’s fights while channel surfing and was so impressed that he decided to build a film around her. The result is Haywire, a spy thriller that critics say is another fine piece of entertainment from Soderbergh. The film stars Carano as Mallory Kane, a high level covert operative who is betrayed and left for dead by someone in her own organization. With several assassins on her trail, Mallory must survive long enough to discover the truth and exact her revenge. The pundits say the Certified Fresh Haywire benefits from quick pacing, immersive action sequences, and a game cast, including a surprisingly comfortable Carano. (Also, check out this week’s Total Recall, in which we count down Steven Soderbergh’s Best Movies, and our Five Favorite Films interview with star Gina Carano.)Red Tails 40%A passion project for producer George Lucas, who began development on the film over 20 years ago, Red Tails dramatizes the heroic efforts of the Tuskegee Airmen, the first all African American aerial unit in the United States armed forces. As World War II rages overseas, the Pentagon calls upon the aviators of its experimental Tuskegee training program, led by Col. A.J. Bullard (Terrence Howard) and Major Emanuelle Stance (Cuba Gooding Jr.), to help turn the tide. Having spent most of the war on the ground and fighting segregation, the young airmen are finally given the opportunity to defend their honor in battle. The pundits say Red Tails displays a genuine admiration for its subject matter and soars when the action takes to the skies, but it’s weighed down by hokey storytelling that diminishes its impact.Underworld: Awakening 26%After skipping the third film of the Underworld franchise, Kate Beckinsale returns to reprise her role as werewolf-hunting vampire Selene in Underworld: Awakening. Set after the events of Underwrold: Evolution, Awakening finds Selene captured by humans and imprisoned in a cryogenic facility for twelve years, during which time the public has discovered the existence of both vampires and lycans (werewolves). Upon escaping from the facility, Selene faces an unfamiliar world where humans now hunt the immortals, and with a vampire-lycan hybrid on the loose, she begins the fight for her own survival. The makers of Underworld:Awakening have decided not to screen the film for critics, who they apparently believe all wield wooden stakes and silver bullets, so it’s about that time to guess the Tomatometer!Also opening this week in limited release:Coriolanus, starring (and directed by) Ralph Fiennes and Vanessa Redgrave in a modernized adaptation of the eponymous Shakespearean tragedy, is Certified Fresh at 92 percent.Miss Bala, a Mexican drama about beauty queen who falls into the hands of a gang, is at 91 percent.Carol Channing: Larger than Life, a biographical documentary about the life of the legendary American entertainer, is at 89 percent.Crazy Horse, a documentary about the famous Parisian cabaret club, is at 77 percent.Fullmetal Alchemist: The Sacred Star of Milos, an animated feature-length companion film to the popular Japanese anime, is at 67 percent.Ultrasuede: In Search of Halson, a documentary about the 1970s clothing designer to the stars, is at 54 percent.Zhang Yimou‘s The Flowers of War, starring Christian Bale in a Chinese film about a group of civilians taking refuge in a Western monastery during the Japanese occupation, is at 39 percent.And finally, the multiple award-winning French film The Artist and Extremely Loud &amp; Incredibly Close both expand to wide release this week.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"Biopics, on, kong, Fox, Spring, japanese, king","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"critics-consensus-haywire-is-certified-fresh"},{"id":"47508781030058","title":"Critics Consensus: The Muppets is Certified Fresh","content":"Critics Consensusvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Critics Consensus: The Muppets is Certified FreshPlus, Arthur Christmas, Hugo, and three others also Certified Fresh -- a new record!by Tim Ryan | November 22, 2011 |  CommentsThis week at the movies, we’ve got a record six Certified Fresh movies, including a Muppet caper (The Muppets, starring Jason Segel and Amy Adams), a special delivery (Arthur Christmas, with voice work from James McAvoy and Hugh Laurie), and a cinematic fantasia (Hugo, starring Asa Butterfield and Chloe Moretz). What do the critics have to say?The Muppets 95%It’s been more than a decade since the Muppets were in multiplexes, but critics say it was worth the wait: they find The Muppets to be a joyous musical comedy that preserves the sunny spirit of Jim Henson’s creations while managing to bring the gang into the 21st Century. Kermit, Miss Piggy, Fozzie, and the rest of the Muppets are coaxed out of retirement by Walter (as well as non-Muppets Gary (Jason Segel) and Mary (Amy Adams), a huge fan who’s afraid their old theater is about to be destroyed by shady developers. The pundits say the Certified Fresh Muppets was clearly a labor of love for writer and star Segel, and his respect for the Muppets combined with smartly self-reflexive storytelling results in a movie that should please old fans and young viewers alike. (Check out this week’s Total Recall, in which we run down all of Jim Henson’s movies, and find out Kermit and Miss Piggy’s Five Favorite Films.)Arthur Christmas 92%The good folks at Aardman have made plenty of delightfully offbeat animated films, and critics say the trend continues with Arthur Christmas, a sweet and eccentric dose of yuletide cheer. It’s the story of Santa Claus’ son Arthur (James McAvoy), who must deliver a present to a sad little girl after Papa Noel neglects to visit her house. Along the way, we learn about Santa’s state-of-the-art headquarters up at the North Pole. The pundits say the Certified Fresh Arthur Christmas is endlessly inventive, filled with witty sight gags, wonderful vocal performances, and an unconventional but undeniable sense of holiday cheer.Hugo 93%Martin Scorsese made a family movie? In 3D? He sure did, and critics say Hugo is a dazzling affair, visually rich and emotionally heartfelt in equal measure. Hugo (Asa Butterfield), and orphan living in a Paris train station, teams up with some new friends on a quest to find a secret left to him by his father. The pundits say the Certified Fresh Hugo is an extravagant, elegant fantasy with an innocence lacking in many modern kids’ movies, but it’s also an intensely personal film for Scorsese, one that emanates an unabashed love for the magic of cinema.Also opening this week in limited release:The French import The Artist, a crowd-pleasing homage to the last days of the silent film era, is Certified Fresh at 97 percent.My Week with Marilyn, starring Michelle Williams as the legendary bombshell during a week away from the spotlight, is Certified Fresh at 86 percent.David Cronenberg‘s A Dangerous Method, starring Viggo Mortensen and Michael Fassbender as pioneering psychotherapists under the spell of a troubled woman, is Certified Fresh at 81 percent.House of Pleasures, drama about the last days of an elegant Parisian brothel, is at 80 percent.Rampart, starring Woody Harrelson in a drama about a crooked cop with a very messy home life, is at 79 percent.Romantics Anonymous, a comedy about a pair of incredibly shy people who share a passion for chocolate, is at 75 percent.Crazy Wisdom, a documentary on famed Tibetan Buddhist leader Chogyam Trungpa, is at 60 percent.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"Super, Rom-Com, screen, psychological, movies, Critics, Fire, Musical, stop, marvel, dark, movie, Awards, nbcuniversal","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"critics-consensus-the-muppets-is-certified-fresh"},{"id":"47508781031083","title":"Critics Consensus: Breaking Dawn Part 1 Doesn’t Shine","content":"Critics Consensusvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Critics Consensus: Breaking Dawn Part 1 Doesn't ShinePlus, Happy Feet Two looks nice but lacks a solid script.by Tim Ryan | November 17, 2011 |  CommentsThis week at the movies, we’ve got a vampire wedding (The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn Part 1, starring Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson), and dancing penguins (Happy Feet Two, with voice work by Elijah Wood and Robin Williams). What do the critics have to say?The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn Part 1 25%As the Twilight Saga comes into the home stretch, it looks to go out with a whimper rather than a bang, say critics, who find Breaking Dawn Part 1 to be full of limp pacing and unintentional laughs. In Breaking Dawn Part 1, Bella (Kristen Stewart) and Edward (Robert Pattinson) have gotten hitched, and soon Bella is preggers with a lil’ bloodsucker, a development that fills old flame Jacob (Taylor Lautner) with apprehension. The pundits say Breaking Dawn Part 1 is even more melodramatic than previous installments, with cringe-worthy dialogue and a weird puritanical streak that robs the movie of any sense of swoony fun.Happy Feet Two 45%Those jovial aquatic birds are back with Happy Feet Two, though critics say the sequel lacks the easy charm of Happy Feet; instead, it’s nicely animated but also thinly plotted and way too busy. This time out, Mumbles (Elijah Wood) and his two-left-footed son must rescue a group of emperor penguins trapped in an ice floe. The pundits say Happy Feet Two looks terrific, but it’s hampered by a lackluster script and an overabundance of supporting characters.

What do the critics have to say?50/50 93%In a comedy, no subject is completely off limits if the jokes make us laugh – and have the ring of truth. Such is the case with 50/50, starring Joseph Gordon-Levitt as a young man whose cancer diagnosis forces him to reevaluate his life. Along the way, he leans on his friends for support, and finds that often he’s helping others work through their feelings as much as he’s tending to his own. The critics say you’ll laugh and you’ll cry through this Certified Fresh comedy, which is touching, heartfelt, occasionally naughty, and often very funny. (Check out Gordon-Levitt’s best-reviewed movies here.)What’s Your Number? 23%Anna Farris is a very funny woman, but critics have long hoped she’d get the lead in a comedy worthy of her talents. The wait continues with What’s Your Number?, the story of a single gal who decides to reunite with all her exes to see if any of them are marriage material. The pundits say the film has moments of comic inspiration and some decent performances, but mostly, its script is a middling grab bag of romantic comedy clichés and raunchiness that squanders the offbeat charm of its star.Dream House 6%We can’t tell you whether Dream House is a prime piece of real estate or a fixer-upper, since it wasn’t screened for critics. Daniel Craig and Rachel Weisz star as a couple who have just moved into a charming new home; little do they know it was once the site of a harrowing murder, and soon they’re bedeviled by spooky goings-on. Put down that copy of Architectural Digest and guess the Tomatometer! (And check out our list of Certified Fresh psychological thrillers here.)Courageous 36%Director Alex Kendrick, who also made Fireproof, has a thing for stories about spiritual awakenings among public servants. His latest, Courageous, tells the tale of four police officers who struggle with faith and fatherhood while trying to clean up the streets. Unfortunately, only a few critics have seen it, so you can feel free to guess the Tomatometer for this one too.Also opening this week in limited release:Take Shelter, starring Michael Shannon and Jessica Chastain in a drama about a small town family man who has terrifying visions of a deadly storm, is at 97 percent.Benda Bilili!, a documentary about a remarkable band of street musicians from Kinshasa in the Democratic Republic of Congo, is at 89 percent.My Joy, a surreal drama about a Russian truck driver who finds himself in a dark netherworld comprised of people representative of the country’s history, is at 89 percent.You Don’t Like the Truth: 4 Days Inside Guantanamo, a doc about a Canadian citizen who was methodically interrogated after being accused of terrorism, is at 88 percent.Tucker &amp; Dale vs Evil, a horror/comedy about a pair of hillbillies who are mistaken for psycho killers, is Certified Fresh at 86 percent (check out star Alan Tudyk’s Five Favorite Films here).Margaret, starring Anna Paquin and Matt Damon in a drama about a high school student who guiltily believes she caused a fatal bus crash, is at 50 percent.American Teacher, a doc that follows four teachers who work in economically depressed areas, is at 50 percent.Sarah Palin: You Betcha!, Nick Broomfield‘s gotcha doc about the 2008 vice presidential candidate, is at 35 percent.Bunraku, starring Josh Hartnett and Woody Harrelson in a stylized period action flick about a drifter and a warrior who team up to take down an evil warlord, is at 21 percent.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"dark, San, TV, Film, based, Writers, spinoff, Turner, political, 4/20","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"critics-consensus-5050-is-certified-fresh"},{"id":"47508781043376","title":"Critics Consensus: Footloose is Toe-Tapping Fun","content":"Critics Consensusvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Critics Consensus: Footloose is Toe-Tapping FunPlus, The Thing doesn't have enough scares, and The Big Year is a slow but aimiable comedy.by Tim Ryan | October 14, 2011 |  CommentsThis week at the movies, we’ve got Sunday shoe removal (Footloose, starring Kenny Wormald and Julianne Hough), an Antarctic abomination (The Thing, starring Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Joel Edgerton), and a bird watching competition (The Big Year, starring Jack Black and Owen Wilson). What do the critics have to say?Footloose 68%Did the world really need a new Footloose? Apparently yes, say critics, who find this update of the 1984 musical smash an energetic, toe-tapping good time. Kenny Wormald stars as the new kid in a town that has banned loud music and dancing. Can our hero melt the cold hard of Rev. Moore – and woo his daughter (Julianne Hough) in the process? The pundits say the plot is as silly as ever, but the exuberant cast and the high-energy production numbers make for a giddy night at the movies. (Check out Quaid’s best-reviewed movies, as well as director Craig Brewer’s Five Favorite Films.)The Thing 34%Remake fever has spread to even the most desolate corners of the globe; unfortunately, critics say the all-new The Thing ODs on CGI mayhem, eschewing the chilling atmospherics that made its 1951 and 1982 predecessors so memorable. Mary Elizabeth Winstead stars as a paleontologist who joins a research team that has discovered an alien craft buried in Antarctica — and soon, the base camp is bedeviled by a terrifying life form. The pundits say The Thing is slicker and more effects heavy than past versions, but it lacks a strong sense of storytelling.The Big Year 42%A languidly-paced comedy with a terrific cast, The Big Year isn’t always laugh-out-loud funny, critics say, but patient viewers may find it amusing in fits and starts. Jack Black, Owen Wilson, and Steve Martin star as a trio of rival birders who set out on a mission to observe the rarest feathered creatures in the wild – and deal with their personal issues in the process. The pundits say The Big Year is amiable and appealing, but its slow pace and lack of momentum makes it only occasionally funny.Also opening this week in limited release:Pedro Almodóvar‘s The Skin I Live In, starring Antonio Banderas in a thriller about a plastic surgeon who tests an experimental form of skin on a kidnapped woman, is Certified Fresh at 82 percent.To Be Heard, a documentary about high school poetry writers in New York City, is at 80 percent.Chalet Girl, a comedy about an ex-skateboarder who gets a job at a posh ski resort, is at 79 percent.The Woman, a horror film about a man who discovers a feral woman living in isolation in the woods near his house, is at 77 percent.Bombay Beach, a surrealistic documentary about the eccentric residents of the Salton Sea, is at 57 percent.Texas Killing Fields, starring Sam Worthington and Chloe Moretz in a thriller about a detective on the trail of a serial killer, is at 50 percent.Fireflies in the Garden, starring Julia Roberts and Ryan Reynolds in a generation-spanning drama about a family dealing with tragedy, is at 24 percent (check out co-star Hayden Panettiere’s Five Favorite Films here).Trespass, starring Nicolas Cage and Nicole Kidman as an upper-crust couple besieged by home invaders, is at 19 percent (check out director Joel Schumacher’s Five Favorite Films here).Father of Invention, starring Kevin Spacey and Heather Graham in a dramedy about an infomercial guru who’s fallen on hard times, is at zero percent.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"chucky, book, blaxploitation, war, travel, Brie, Ovation, ghosts, documentary, Certified, nbcuniversal, Larson, batman, york, YouTube","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Critics-Consensus-Footloose-is-Toe-Tapping-Fun"},{"id":"47508782769848","title":"Critics Consensus: Conan the Barbarian is a Bloody Mess","content":"Critics Consensusvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Critics Consensus: Conan the Barbarian is a Bloody MessPlus, Fright Night scares up some laughs and chills, but Spy Kids and One Day strike out.by Tim Ryan | August 19, 2011 |  CommentsThis week at the movies, we’ve got a heroic strongman (Conan the Barbarian, starring Jason Momoa and Rachel Nichols), pint-sized agents (Spy Kids: All the Time in the World in 4D, starring Jessica Alba and Joel McHale), scary neighbors (Fright Night, starring Anton Yelchin and Colin Farrell), and part-time lovers (One Day, starring Anne Hathaway and Jim Sturgess). What do the critics have to say?Conan the Barbarian 25%The 1982 Conan the Barbarian became a seminal entry in the sword-and-sorcery subgenre, maiking Arnold Schwarzenegger a star in the process. And although critics say Jason Momoa does his best with the title role, this new Conan the Barbarian eschews pulpy swashbuckling for non-stop action, and the result is a numbing barrage of blood, guts, and noise. The titular warrior is out for vengeance against the warlord who killed his family. On the trail of his foe, he encounters the beautiful Tamara (Rachel Nichols), and together, they leave a mountain of dead bodies strewn about the countryside. The pundits say Conan the Barbarian has a decent look and some thrills, but it’s mostly just a brutal, hyperactively-edited gore-fest that barely pauses to develop the characters or the plot. (Check out co-star Rose McGowan’s Five Favorite Films here.)Spy Kids: All the Time in the World in 4D 22%Throughout his career, director Robert Rodriguez has led a seemingly incongruous double life: when he’s not making stylistically bold neo-grindhouse films, he’s helming impish adventure tales for the kiddies. Unfortunately, critics say the fourth installment of his venerable Spy Kids franchise, All the Time in the World in 4D, is tired, juvenile stuff that isn’t improved by gimmicky 3D and scratch ‘n’ sniff cards. Jessica Alba stars as retired spy who’s lured back into action when a maniacal super villain threatens the free world. She’s joined in her mission by some newly recruited spy kids. The pundits say Spy Kids 4 is almost entirely bereft of the charm and excitement of the series’ first two entries, with mediocre special effects and an overabundance of sophomoric humor. (Check out this week’s Total Recall, in which we count down Rodriguez’s best-reviewed movies.)Fright Night 72%On paper, a remake of Fright Night sounds like an opportunistic attempt to cash in on the current vampire craze — especially since the original, a minor genre classic that deftly (and self-referentially) mixed laughs and scares, still holds up pretty well. However, critics say this new Fright Night is surprisingly effective, thanks to some terrific performances and a solid script that captures — and occasionally expands upon — what worked the first time around. Anton Yelchin stars as Charley, a too-cool-for-school teen who notices that something’s not quite right about Jerry (Colin Farrell), the guy who moved in next door. As it turns out, Jerry’s a vampire who’s preying on the neighborhood, and it’s up to Charley to stop him. The pundits say that while Fright Night doesn’t always match the mischievous appeal of its source material, the script is sharp and clever, and the cast — particularly Farrell, who oozes sly menace — is uniformly excellent.One Day 36%The premise of One Day is undeniably intriguing: it’s a romantic dramedy featuring two mismatched would-be lovers whose tentative relationship stretches for decades. Unfortunately, critics say the execution is a bit off; we’re never quite convinced our heroes are meant to be together, and the annual check-in conceit alluded to in the title seems contrived after a while. Anne Hathaway and Jim Sturgess are the couple, who meet at the end of college and are attracted to one another despite class and personality differences. Every subsequent June 15, we get glimpses of their lives, loves, and careers, as the pair maintains a friendship that might someday become something more. The pundits say One Day deserves credit for attempting to upend the traditional structure of the movie romance, and the stars’ repartee is fitfully amusing, but the characters are too ill-defined to make much of an impression.Also opening this week in limited release:Summer Pasture, a documentary about the harsh lives of Tibetan nomads, is at 100 percent.The Last Circus, a dramedy about a clown whose life is upended by the rise of Fascism in Spain, is at 92 percent.The Hedgehog, a drama about a morose 12-year-old who befriends the grumpy concierge in her apartment building, is at 83 percent.Mozart’s Sister, a historical drama about the great composer’s talented older sibling, is at 80 percent.Griff the Invisible, a comedy/romance about a shy working stiff who moonlights as a superhero, is at 78 percent.Atrocious, a lo-fi horror film about a family that films its investigation into a terrifying urban legend, is at 67 percent.The Journals Of Musan, a drama about a North Korean defector awkwardly adjusting to his new life in South Korea, is at 60 percent.John Sayles‘s Amigo, a drama about a village torn apart by the Philippine-American War, is at 59 percent.5 Days Of War, starring Rupert Friend and Emmanuelle Chriqui in a drama about an American reporter caught in the crossfire of the 2008 Georgian conflict with Russia, is at 55 percent.A Horrible Way to Die, an indie thriller about an escaped serial killer who’s looking for his ex-girlfriend, is at 40 percent.Flypaper, starring Patrick Dempsey and Ashley Judd in a crime comedy about a would-be bank robber who develops a bond with a teller, is at 22 percent.Programming The Nation?, a documentary about subliminal messages in politics and advertising, is at 14 percent.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"asian-american, renewals, Podcast, Photos, Disney, Movies, Adult, Biopics, TV, die, Channel","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Critics-Consensus-Conan-the-Barbarian-is-a-Bloody-Mess"},{"id":"47508782764727","title":"Critics Consensus: Colombiana Goes Way Over The Top","content":"Critics Consensusvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Critics Consensus: Colombiana Goes Way Over The TopPlus, Don't Be Afraid Of The Dark is creepy but thin, and Our Idiot Brother is sweetly funny.by Tim Ryan | August 25, 2011 |  CommentsThis week at the movies, we’ve got a vengeful assassin (Colombiana, starring Zoe Saldana and Jordi Molla), a haunted mansion (Don’t Be Afraid Of The Dark, starring Guy Pearce and Katie Holmes), and a senseless sibling (Our Idiot Brother, starring Paul Rudd and Elizabeth Banks). What do the critics have to say?Colombiana 27%Ain’t nothing wrong with babes brandishing weapons and dispensing justice, right? Well, if you’re in the mood for an over-the-top explosion-fest, critics say Colombiana might be the picture for you, if you’re willing to look past the non-existent plotting and unintentional hilarity. As a young girl, Cataleya (Zoe Saldana) witnesses the brutal murder of her parents by a mobster. She spends the rest of her formative years training to be a stone-cold killer in order to enact revenge. The pundits say Colombiana won’t win any points for subtlety or narrative cohesiveness, but if you’re in the mood for some high-octane thrills, you could do much worse than this stylish thriller.Don’t Be Afraid Of The Dark 60%He’s the director of Pan’s Labyrinth and the producer of The Orphanage, so it’s safe to assume Guillermo del Toro loves creepy old houses. But while critics say his latest production, Don’t Be Afraid of the Dark (directed by newcomer Troy Nixey), has plenty of spooky atmosphere, its scares are too intermittent to be fully satisfying. Guy Pearce stars as an architect who’s fixing up an old mansion, giving his daughter (Bailee Madison) an opportunity to explore the house’s dark corners. What she finds, unfortunately, is the portal to a nightmarish underworld. The pundits say Don’t Be Afraid of the Dark is well crafted and should appeal to fans of old-school haunted house flicks, but its characters are never fully fleshed out, and the movie runs out of steam as it goes along. (Check out this week’s Total Recall, in which we count down Pearce’s best-reviewed movies.)Our Idiot Brother 70%Paul Rudd has played confused characters before, but never someone as blissfully oblivious as the protagonist in Our Idiot Brother. And critics say he and his charming co-stars enliven this uneven but undeniably sweet and breezily amusing comedy. Paul Rudd stars as Ned, an utterly guileless organic famer who moves in with his three sisters (played by Elizabeth Banks, Zooey Deschanel, and Emily Mortimer) after his girlfriend gives him the boot. Soon, however, Ned’s eternal optimism and unfailing honesty is wreaking havoc on his siblings’ personal lives. The pundits say My Idiot Brother is pleasant and gently funny, and the ensemble cast helps to make the most of a simple premise.Also opening this week in limited release:Tales from the Golden Age, a comedy about the propaganda machine in the waning days of Romanian communism, is at 92 percent.Shut Up Little Man! An Audio Misadventure, a documentary about a pair of guys whose discreet recordings of their neighbors’ unhinged arguments developed a cult following, is at 83 percent.Higher Ground, directed by and starring Vera Farmiga in a drama about an evangelical woman who struggles with her faith, is at 81 percent.Circumstance, a drama about a love affair between two teenage girls in conservative Tehran, is at 69 percent.Chasing Madoff, a doc about the team of investigators that brought down the fugitive financier, is at 57 percent.Brighton Rock, starring Sam Riley and Helen Mirren in a crime drama about a low-level hood who’s trying to make a name for himself, is at 48 percent.Special Treatment, starring Isabelle Huppert in a drama about a high priced call girl who teams up with a psychotherapist, is at 33 percent.The Family Tree, starring Dermot Mulroney and Hope Davis in a dramedy about a dysfunctional suburban family that gets a new lease on life with the help of amnesia, is at 20 percent.Swinging With The Finkels, starring Mandy Moore and Martin Freeman as young marrieds who try to shake things up by swapping partners with another couple, is at zero percent.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"political, Nominations, on, Golden, TV, Legendary, 2018, Emmys, Swim, movies, richard, versus, Winners, Plus","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Critics-Consensus-Colombiana-Goes-Way-Over-The-Top"},{"id":"47508782774970","title":"Critics Consensus: Rise of the Planet of the Apes  is Certified Fresh","content":"Critics Consensusvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Critics Consensus: Rise of the Planet of the Apes is Certified FreshPlus, The Change-Up could use some more laughs.by Tim Ryan | August 4, 2011 |  CommentsThis week at the movies, we’ve got intelligent primates (Rise of the Planet of the Apes, starring James Franco and Freida Pinto) and a body swap (The Change-Up, starring Ryan Reynolds and Jason Bateman). What do the critics have to say?Rise of the Planet of the Apes 82%It seems we will never exhaust our collective need for Planet of the Apes movies. The 1968 sci-fi classic spawned four sequels, a remake, and now a prequel, Rise of the Planet of the Apes. And guess what? The critics say Rise is one of the best of the bunch, with dazzling effects, thought-provoking ideas, and plenty of action. While working on a cure for Alzheimer’s, a brilliant scientist (James Franco) unintentionally gives a chimp named Caesar extraordinary intelligence; soon, the simian is questioning his place in the world, while passing on his superior brain power to his fellow apes. The pundits say the Certified Fresh Rise of the Planet of the Apes is a swingin’ good time — it’s briskly paced, emotionally satisfying, and much smarter than your average blockbuster.The Change-Up 25%That staple of late-1980s cinema — the body switching comedy — is back full force with The Change-Up. However, some things should be left dormant, and critics say the subgenre that sired 18 Again and Dream a Little Dream is one of them — they find The Change-Up to be an oddly sour, gimmicky comedy that never establishes a consistent tone. Two old friends — one a married, overworked lawyer (Jason Bateman), the other a single softcore actor — relieve themselves in a magic fountain and find that they have switched bodies. At first, they each enjoy a change of scenery, but isn’t the grass always greener on the other side? The pundits say that although Reynolds and Bateman each do a good job of playing the other, they’re stuck in a sophomoric comedy that veers between gross-out gags and schmaltz. (Check out this week’s Total Recall, in which we run down some of cinema’s most memorable body swaps.)Also opening this week in limited release:Bellflower, an indie action flick about a pair of weapon-manufacturing friends preparing for the Apocalypse, is at 89 percent.Cold Fish, a horror/black comedy about a seafood vending-couple who are also brutal serial killers, is at 71 percent.Mysteries of Lisbon, an operatic Portuguese drama about an orphan who goes looking for the truth of his origins, is at 71 percent.The Whistleblower, starring Rachel Weisz and Monica Bellucci in a drama about a peacekeeper in post-war Bosnia who uncovers a human trafficking ring, is at 62 percent.Magic Trip, a documentary about Ken Kesey and the Merry Pranksters’ acid-fueled 1964 cross country trek, is at 62 percent.Gun Hill Road, a drama about a man just released from prison who finds his family has gone through some dramatic changes, is at 54 percent.The Perfect Age of Rock ‘n’ Roll, about a troubled rock star and his guitar-wiz buddy rekindling their friendship, is at zero percent.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"Rom-Com, latino, french, BET, batman, game, 2021, York, Music, jones, jurassic, Paramount","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"critics-consensus-rise-of-the-planet-of-the-apes-is-certified-fresh"},{"id":"47508781060790","title":"Critics Consensus: The Debt is Certified Fresh","content":"Critics Consensusvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Critics Consensus: The Debt is Certified FreshPlus, guess the Tomatometers for Apollo 18 and Shark Night 3D.by Tim Ryan | September 1, 2011 |  CommentsThis week at the movies, we’ve got spy suspense (The Debt, starring Helen Mirren and Sam Worthington), lunar scares (Apollo 18, starring Lloyd Owen and Warren Christie), and marine mayhem (Shark Night 3D, starring Sara Paxton and Sinqua Walls). What do the critics have to say?The Debt 77%The Debt promises a return to the twisty, morally ambiguous intrigue of Cold War-era spy movies. And critics say it mostly delivers; the film boasts an outstanding cast and scenes of white-knuckle tension that help to alleviate its occasional lapses. Helen Mirren stars as a retired member of an elite Mossad unit that tracked down a fugitive Nazi war criminal years before. However, it turns out the case wasn’t quite as closed as they thought, and revelations from the past reverberate in the present. The critics say The Debt is clunky in spots, but its outstanding cast and smarter-than-average script keep things on track.Apollo 18 23%It appears the folks behind Apollo 18 were afraid that critics wouldn’t be over the moon for their film, and so it heads to theaters without being screened. Two astronauts are sent to the moon on a secret mission, only to discover that Earth’s only satellite is overrun with deadly parasites. Hey, everyone, stop playing Dead Space for a minute and guess that Tomatometer!Shark Night 3D 18%There’s something fishy going on with Shark Night 3D, since it wasn’t screened for critics prior to its release. Sara Paxton stars as a party-hearty young woman whose trip to her family’s lake house is ruined when a school of sharks are discovered to be prowling the waters.

What do the critics have to say?Puss in Boots 86%The Shrek franchise keeps rolling along, this time ogre-free, with Puss in Boots, which critics find to be a witty, action-packed romp in its own right. In this prequel, ever-daring Puss (voiced by Antonio Banderas) teams up with the tough, alluring Kitty Softpaws (Salma Hayek) to protect the world from a pair of villains named Jack and Jill. The pundits say Puss in Boots is smart and funny, a clever send-up of fairy tale conventions with vibrant animation and inspired vocal performances. (Check out this week’s Total Recall, in which we count down Banderas’ best-reviewed films.)The Rum Diary 51%Johnny Depp steps back into Hunter S. Thompson’s shoes for The Rum Diary, but critics say that, like its predecessor Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, its sporadic moments of colorful madness are undercut by an uneven script. The Run Diary chronicles one of the gonzo reporter’s memorable early assignments: a wild trek to Puerto Rico in which our hero uncovers a shady business plot and drinks a ton of booze. The pundits say the film is a mostly agreeable mix of picturesque settings and eccentric characters, but it lacks the focus needed to be a truly cohesive head trip. (Check out director Bruce Robinson’s Five Favorite Films.)In Time 36%It’s a high concept cross between Logan’s Run and Occupy Wall Street, but critics say gaping plot holes and excessive action sequences keep In Time from measuring up to its intriguing premise. Set in a world where everyone is genetically engineered to die shortly after they turn 25 (except for the rich folks, who can purchase more time), Justin Timberlake stars as a man of modest means on the run from the cops after he’s been gifted a life-extension. The pundits say In Time has a sleek look and some interesting ideas, but it runs out of steam pretty quickly.Also opening this week in limited release:Urbanized, a documentary about the many facets of city planning, is at 100 percent.Ra.

What do the critics have to say?Paranormal Activity 3 66%You probably know what to expect with the Paranormal Activity franchise at this point, but that doesn’t mean that part three doesn’t have a few tricks up its sleeve: critics say this installment is as spooky and shriek-inducing as the first one – perhaps even more so. This time out, we discover the origins of Katie’s mysterious bedeviling, revealed through some serendipitously recorded VHS tapes. The pundits say the series’ conceit may not be fresh, but the Certified Fresh Paranormal Activity 3 has plenty of effective scares and creepy atmospherics to satisfy anyone in the market for a good ghost story.The Three Musketeers 26%All for one and one for all? Well, the critics certainly don’t have a feeling of esprit de corps when it comes to The Three Musketeers, calling it an overblown special effects extravaganza that’s largely bereft of coherence or wit. Logan Lerman stars as the hot-headed young D’Artagnan, who teams up with the legendary trio of swashbucklers to prevent the megalomaniacal Cardinal Richelieu (Christoph Waltz) from plunging Europe into chaos. The pundits say The Three Musketeers has moments of mad, manic energy, but too often it’s just loud, busy, and lacking a sense of ribald fun.Johnny English Reborn 38%Rubber-faced Rowan Atkinson’s brand of goofy, good-natured comedy didn’t win over the critics in the first Johnny English, and the same can be said of Johnny English Reborn. Atkinson is back as the titular “intelligence” agent who bumbles his way around the globe on a mission to save the Chinese premier from an assassination attempt. The pundits say Atkinson’s proclivity for physical comedy generates some laughs, but mostly, Johnny English Reborn is poorly paced and overrun with weather-beaten gags. (Check out this week’s Total Recall, in which we run down some of cinema’s most memorable spy spoofs.)The Mighty Macs 47%Hoosiers at a Catholic school doesn’t sound bad on paper, but critics say The Mighty Macs feels awfully familiar in execution, failing to add much girl-power spice to the inspirational sports movie playbook. Carla Gugino stars as Cathy Rush, a college basketball star who takes a coaching gig at a tiny women’s religious college. Can she lead her team to victory while striking a modest blow for feminism in the process? The pundits say The Mighty Macs is sweet, well-meaning, and really, really predictable, featuring better-than-averages performances and no surprises whatsoever.Also opening this week in limited release:Aki Kaurismaeki‘s Le Havre, a dramedy about a shoeshiner who befriends a young African refugee, is at 100 percent.Paul Goodman Changed My Life, a documentary about the famed countercultural writer and psychologist, is at 100 percent.Martha Marcy May Marlene, starring Elizabeth Olsen and John Hawkes in a psychological thriller about a woman who tries to return to normal after leaving a cult, is Certified Fresh at 91 percent.Being Elmo: A Puppeteer’s Journey, a doc about the man behind the ubiquitous Sesame Street star, is at 87 percent.Margin Call, starring Kevin Spacey and Zachary Quinto in a drama about an investment bank on the verge of collapse, is Certified Fresh at 83 percent (check out co-star Paul Bettany’s Five Favorite Films here).Klitschko, a doc about the champion Russian boxing brothers, is at 83 percent.You All Are Captains, a documentary/fiction hybrid about a director who tries to teach filmmaking to Moroccan youngsters, is at 83 percent.Oranges And Sunshine, starring Emily Watson and Hugo Weaving in a drama about a social worker who discovers a mass deportation of children, is Certified Fresh at 75 percent.Revenge of the Electric Car, a doc about the increase in popularity of electric vehicles, is at 70 percent.Norman, a dramedy about a teenager who’s dealing with both the death of his mother and the illness of his father, is at 50 percent.The Catechism Cataclysm, a comedy about an unorthodox priest and his high school buddy on a camping trip, is at 40 percent.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"of, boxoffice, godzilla, York, prank, Marvel, Holiday, on, spy, Go, Reality, TV+","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"critics-consensus-paranormal-activity-3-is-certified-fresh"},{"id":"47508782789311","title":"Critics Consensus: Transformers: Dark of the Moon is Less Than Meets the Eye","content":"Critics Consensusvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Critics Consensus: Transformers: Dark of the Moon is Less Than Meets the EyePlus, Larry Crowne and Monte Carlo succumb to predictability.by Tim Ryan | June 30, 2011 |  CommentsThis week at the movies, we’ve got robots in disguise (Transformers: Dark of the Moon, starring Shia LaBeouf and Rosie Huntington-Whiteley), a recession romance (Larry Crowne, starring Tom Hanks and Julia Roberts), and a royal mix-up (Monte Carlo, starring Selena Gomez and Leighton Meester). What do the critics have to say?Transformers: Dark of the Moon 35%Three films into the franchise, we pretty much know what we’re getting with a Transformers movie: tons of hyperkinetic robot action, with little in the way of character development or coherent plotting. So it is with Transformers: Dark of the Moon; critics say this latest installment is a marked improvement over Revenge of the Fallen, but it’s still an exercise in sensory overload that favors special effects over storytelling. This time out, the Autobots and Decepticons are both gunning for the remains of Sentinel Prime, which were discovered on the moon and contain important secrets; as usual, the Autobots’ buddy Sam (Shia LaBeouf) finds himself in the line of fire. The pundits say Transformers: Dark of the Moon has admittedly impressive special effects and a few solid action sequences, but the whole thing becomes numbing after a while – it’s just spectacle, with few (if any) compelling characters, a manufactured product that impresses with sheer bombast but stretches its thin plot way past the breaking point.Larry Crowne 37%Tom Hanks and Julia Roberts are two of the biggest movie stars we have, so it’s fair to assume that any film with both of them is going to be pretty good, right? Well, not necessarily. Critics say despite the stars’ relaxed, easy chemistry, Larry Crowne is surprisingly bland and conventional. Hanks stars as a middle-aged Navy vet who loses his job and decides to enroll in community college. There he becomes a motor scooter enthusiast and starts a relationship with one of the school’s professors. Hanks and Roberts were terrific together in Charlie Wilson’s War (and Hanks won high praise for his previous directorial outing, That Thing You Do!), but the pundits say Larry Crowne is remarkably generic and inauthentic, a pleasant trifle that brings smiles from time to time but never hums with dramatic urgency or l’amour fou. (Check out this week’s Total Recall, in which we count down Hanks’s best-reviewed movies.)Monte Carlo 40%There’s nothing wrong with movies about wish fulfillment — heck, that’s one of the main things that draws us to the theater. But you have to do more than just surround your protagonists with riches, and critics say Monte Carlo misses plenty of opportunities to explore beyond its premise, though it’s got its charms, thanks to some decent performances and overall good spirits. Selena Gomez and Leighton Meester star as vacationers who get mistaken for royalty, and soon, their dull European vacation becomes a luxurious, whirlwind tour of the continent. But what will happen when our heroines get found out? The pundits say Monte Carlo is decent tween fare, but it’s silly, predictable stuff that never pushes the boundaries of its formula.Also opening this week in limited release:Crime After Crime, a documentary about a woman’s long legal battle after a murder sentence many felt was unjust, is at 100 percent.Delhi Belly, a Bollywood comedy about three average dudes who find themselves in the crosshairs of a crime boss, is at 80 percent.Terri, starring John C. Reilly in a comedy about a teen misfit who befriends his school’s vice principal, is at 73 percent.The Romanian import Aurora, a murder mystery that painstakingly examines a killer’s psyche, is at 71 percent.The Perfect Host, starring David Hyde Pierce in a psychological thriller about a wanted bank robber who crashes a dinner party, is at 41 percent.Love Etc., a doc about five New York couples and the complexities of their romantic relationships, is at 38 percent.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"history, 78th, Purge, drama, Max","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Critics-Consensus-Transformers-Dark-of-the-Moon-is-Less-Than-Meets-the-Eye"},{"id":"47508782803651","title":"Critics Consensus: X-Men: First Class is Certified Fresh","content":"Critics Consensusvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Critics Consensus: X-Men: First Class is Certified FreshPlus, the Brit indie Submarine, in limited release, is also Certified Fresh.by Tim Ryan | June 2, 2011 |  CommentsThis week at the movies, we’ve only got one wide release: the hotly-anticipated origin story of everyone’s favorite mutants (X-Men: First Class, starring James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender). What do the critics have to say?X-Men: First Class 86%Sometimes, when a franchise starts drifting toward mediocrity, it’s best to start again from the top. That certainly seems to be the case with X-Men: First Class; critics call this origin story a visually stunning, action-packed popcorn flick with excellent performances and a smarter-than-average script. A prequel to Bryan Singer’s X-Men (2000), First Class takes us back to the Cold War-era beginnings of the organization; the CIA turns to Charles Xavier (James McAvoy) for help in recruiting a band of mutants to help defend the United States against the Soviets. In the process, he befriends Erik Lensherr (Michael Fassbender), who is haunted by unspeakable events in his past. The pundits say the Certified Fresh X-men: First Class liberally borrows from the 1960s aesthetic of the early James Bond pictures, and also shares that franchise’s sense of pop-movie fun with its electrifying action set-pieces, handsome production values, and full-bodied characters. (Check out this week’s Total Recall, in which we count down McAvoy’s best movies, as well as Marvel Movie Madness, our continuing look at every movie based on Marvel characters.)Also opening this week in limited release:Submarine, a coming-of-age dramedy about a young man trying to save his parents’ marriage and find love for himself is Certified Fresh at 90 percent (check out director Richard Ayoade’s Five Favorite Films here).!Women Art Revolution, a documentary about the Feminist Art Movement of the 1960s and 1970s, is at 83 percent.Beginners, starring Ewan McGregor and Christopher Plummer in a dramedy about a man who starts a new relationship in the aftermath of his father’s death, is at 78 percentBeautiful Boy, starring Michael Sheen and Maria Bello in a drama about two parents coming to grips with the horrific actions of their son, is at 76 percent.The Last Mountain, a doc about the environmental damage cause by coal mining on communities in West Virginia, is at 75 percent.Rejoice &amp; Shout, a doc about the history of gospel music featuring footage of such luminaries as Mahalia Jackson and the Rev.

What do the critics have to say?Green Lantern 26%With the towering exceptions of Batman and Superman, DC’s stable of superheroes haven’t fared as well on the big screen as Marvel’s. And critics say the publisher’s latest adaptation, Green Lantern won’t reverse the trend – it’s a generic, special effects-heavy effort that lacks interesting characters and a compelling script. Ryan Reynolds plays Hal Jordan, a brash test pilot who’s recruited by the Green Lantern Corps to join their crusade against evil in the universe. With the help of a power ring, Jordan is granted a number of superpowers – but can he overcome his fears in time to defeat a marauding army of evil? The pundits say Green Lantern has a few decent set pieces and moments of loony humor, but mostly, it gets bogged down in a too-complicated backstory and never exhibits enough of a singular personality to be truly compelling.Mr. Popper’s Penguins 47%It’s summer, so spending time in an air-conditioned theater in the company of some Antarctic residents seems like a decent idea, right? Unfortunately, critics say Mr. Popper’s Penguins is mostly lukewarm stuff; it’s got a committed performance from Jim Carrey that’s undone by a lot of mediocre physical comedy. Based upon the Newbury Award-winning children’s classic, Mr Popper’s Penguins stars Carrey as a divorced businessman who inherits six penguins; soon after turning his apartment into a polar playground, he comes to learn a thing or two about responsibility and family. The pundits say Carrey gives it his all, and the birds are cute, but Mr. Popper’s Penguins is mostly a formulaic family comedy with some so-so slapstick and an overdone message.Also opening this week in limited release:Buck, a documentary portrait of real-life horse whisperer Buck Brannaman, is a 90 percent.My Afternoons with Marguerite, starring Gérard Depardieu in a drama about a friendship between a simple man and a frail old lady, is at 85 percent.R, a drama about a man serving time in Denmark’s toughest prison, is at 80 percent.Page One: Inside the New York Times, a doc about a year in the life of the nation’s paper of record, is at 78 percent.Jig, a doc that follows many of the participants in the Irish Dancing World Championships, is at 65 percent.Angel of Evil, a biopic of one of Italy’s most notorious criminals, is at 61 percent.Kidnapped, a drama about a family held captive by a trio of robbers, is at 36 percent.The Art of Getting By, starring Freddie Highmore and Emma Roberts as a pair of troubled teens who find common ground, is at 20 percent.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"who, Reviews, kong, GIFs, thriller, Movies, Kids, Mary, TCA, boxing, Unbreakable, Rocky","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Critics-Consensus-Its-Not-Easy-Being-Green-Lantern"},{"id":"47508784685766","title":"Critics Consensus: Priest is Without a Prayer","content":"Critics Consensusvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Critics Consensus: Priest is Without a PrayerPlus, Bridesmaids is Certified Fresh.by Tim Ryan | May 12, 2011 |  CommentsThis week at the movies, we’ve got a vampire slayer (Priest, starring Paul Bettany and Karl Urban) and nuptial nuttiness (Bridesmaids, starring Kristen Wiig and Maya Rudolph). What do the critics have to say?Priest 15%When the armies of evil are on the march, who you gonna call? A priest should do the trick, especially if his name is Priest, and is more adept at dishing out pain than serving communion. Too bad the critics find Priest to be less than heavenly; instead, they say it’s a middling assemblage of elements from better comic book adaptations that’s visually interesting but never delves any deeper than its slick surface. Paul Bettany stars as the title character, who gained fame as a fearless vampire killer and now lives a monastic existence. He springs into action, however, when his niece is kidnapped by a group of bloodsuckers. The pundits say Priest is a little too grim to be fun, and despite a game performance by Bettany, the actors are given little to do in this genre mashup. (Check out this week’s Total Recall, in which we count down Bettany’s best-reviewed movies.)Bridesmaids 90%Kristen Wiig is a funny lady. Unfortunately for moviegoers, the Saturday Night Live star has largely been limited to a series of sharp cameos on the big screen. Well, now she’s got a vehicle for her comedic chops with Bridesmaids, and the critics say the result is one of the funniest, wildest movies of the year. Wiig stars as Annie, a single woman whose best friend Lillian (Maya Rudolph) has asked her to be the maid of honor at her forthcoming wedding. Unfortunately for Annie, she and her fellow bridesmaids must brave a series of colorful adventures before Lillian’s big day, and as a result, Annie’s life starts to spin out of control. The pundits say the Certified Fresh Bridesmaids is not just an inventive, raunchy laugh-fest, but also a smart look at the bonds of friendship, and definitive proof that Wiig is the real deal.Also opening this week in limited release:City of Life and Death, a period drama about the Japanese massacre of Chinese citizens in Nanking in 1937, is at 91 percent.Cameraman: The Life And Work Of Jack Cardiff, a documentary about the legendary and influential cinematographer, is at 91 percent.The Topp Twins: Untouchable Girls, a documentary portrait of the musical comedy duo who are also gay rights activists, is at 88 percent.Yves Saint Laurent – L’amour fou, a documentary about the famously private fashion icon, is at 78 percent.Everything Must Go, starring Will Ferrell and Rebecca Hall in a dramedy about a car salesman whose life is on the rocks, is Certified Fresh at 76 percent.True Legend, a martial arts film about a man who learns a previously unknown move to defeat his vengeful brother, is at 69 percent.How to Live Forever, a doc about the possibility of eternal life that includes testimonials from a number of spry nonagenarians, is at 60 percent.Hesher, starring Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Natalie Portman in a drama about a metalhead who squats in the house of a grieving man, is at 53 percent.Skateland, an indie coming-of-age drama about a group of friends facing adulthood in 1980s small-town Texas, is at 50 percent.The First Grader, a drama about an elderly Kenyan man who yearns to get the formal schooling he always lacked, is at 47 percent.The High Cost of Living, starring Zach Braff in a drama about a woman who forges a connection with her hit-and-run assailant, is at 38 percent.The Big Bang, starring Antonio Banderas and James Van Der Beek in a mystery about a private eye on the trail of a missing woman and a stash of diamonds, is at zero percent.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"service, impossible","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Critics-Consensus-Priest-is-Without-a-Prayer"},{"id":"47508782785214","title":"Critics Consensus: Horrible Bosses is Certified Fresh","content":"Critics Consensusvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Critics Consensus: Horrible Bosses is Certified FreshPlus, Zookeeper spends too much time monkeying around.by Tim Ryan | July 7, 2011 |  CommentsThis week at the movies, we’ve got scheming employees (Horrible Bosses, starring Jason Bateman and Jennifer Aniston) and talking animals (Zookeeper, starring Kevin James and Rosario Dawson). What do the critics have to say?Horrible Bosses 69%Plenty of folks slog through dead-end jobs with contempt for their employers. Fortunately, few of us would ever entertain the possibility of murdering our boss, but that’s the setup for Horrible Bosses, which critics are calling a gleeful, cheerfully silly and dirty comedy that’s perfect for our troubled economic times. Jason Bateman stars as a middle manager who’s been emotionally tortured by his malevolent boss, a situation he shares with two of his after-work drinking buddies. All three conspire to kill their bosses, using Hitchcock’s Strangers on a Train as the model for their plan, but soon our heroes find themselves in way over their heads. The pundits say the Certified Fresh Horrible Bosses doesn’t quite push its wicked premise to the limit, but it’s consistently funny and boasts a terrific cast (including Kevin Spacey, Colin Farrell, and Jamie Foxx in sharp supporting roles) making the most of sharply-written roles. (Check out this week’s Total Recall, in which we run down some of cinema’s most memorable workplaces.)Zookeeper 14%Remember Dr. Doolittle? Charlotte’s Web? Babe? There are plenty of solid family movies that feature talking animals. Unfortunately, critics say Zookeeper is unlikely to join that group, since it does so little with its premise and instead relies on shopworn physical humor and bland plotting. Kevin James stars as a beleaguered zookeeper who wants to move on from his job. But the animals, desperate for him to stay, reveal a long-suppressed secret: they can talk. Hilarity ensues. The pundits say Zookeeper is well-meaning, but it’s not particularly disciplined, resulting in a comedy that features a bunch of gags but few genuine laughs.Also opening this week in limited release:Sholem Aleichem: Laughing in the Darkness, a doc about the great Yiddish author and playwright, is at 100 percent.Project Nim, a doc about the groundbreaking scientific experiment to raise a chimp as a human child, is at 97 percent.Beats, Rhymes and Life: The Travels of A Tribe Called Quest, a documentary about the rise and fall of the legendary Native Tongues hip hop crew, is at 92 percent.The French import Rapt, a thriller about a businessman whose kidnapping is just the beginning of his problems, is at 89 percent.Catherine Breillat‘s The Sleeping Beauty, a feminist retelling of the classic fairytale, is at 71 percent.Septien, a dramedy about a trio of Tennessee brothers with issues and secrets, is at 58 percent.Ironclad, starring Paul Giamatti and Brian Cox in a bloody historical drama about a group of Knights Templar defending a fort, is at 39 percent.The Ward, starring Amber Heard in a horror film about a mental patient haunted by a phantom, is at 40 percent (check out director John Carpenter‘s Five Favorite Flms here).The Ledge, starring Terrence Howard and Liv Tyler in a thriller with a theological twist, is at seven percent.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"CBS","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"critics-consensus-horrible-bosses-is-certified-fresh"},{"id":"47508784688839","title":"Critics Consensus: Thor is Certified Fresh","content":"Critics Consensusvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Critics Consensus: Thor is Certified FreshPlus, Something Borrowed and Jumping the Broom are both marital mishaps.by Tim Ryan | May 6, 2011 |  CommentsThis week at the movies, we’ve got a mighty Norse god (Thor, starring Chris Hemsworth and Natalie Portman), a love triangle (Something Borrowed, starring Kate Hudson and Ginnifer Goodwin), and wedding bell blues (Jumping the Broom, starring Angela Bassett and Loretta Devine). What do the critics have to say?Thor 77%Blockbuster time! Now that summer’s here, all we need is a good superhero movie to kick things off in grand style. And critics say we’ve got one with Thor, a robust, thrilling adventure with smarts and sly laughs. Chris Hemsworth stars as the God of Thunder, who’s been exiled from Asgard after heedlessly starting a war. Bannished to Earth (and sans his superpowers), this legendary Norseman must learn humility – and defend humanity against the evildoers from his realm. The pundits say the Certified Fresh Thor may not occupy the first tier of Marvel movies, but Hemsworth makes for a compelling hero, and director Kenneth Branagh brings both panache and a sense of fun to the proceedings. (Check out this week’s Total Recall, in which we run down memorable Viking movies.)Something Borrowed 15%For a romantic comedy to succeed, one needs to truly care about the characters. It sounds simple, but it’s harder to pull off, and critics say Something Borrowed falters because it can’t get at the humanity beneath its farcical premise. The movie stars Ginnifer Goodwin as a sweet young woman who’s just started an affair with the guy she’s had a crush on since forever. One problem: he’s engaged to her best friend (Kate Hudson). Can our heroine save her friendship and keep the object of her affection without ruffling feathers? The pundits say Something Borrowed never delves into the moral dilemma its setup promises, and instead focuses on bland characterizations and predictable genre elements at the expense of relatable human behavior.Jumping the Broom 58%We’re in the midst of wedding season, so it’s no surprise to see a wedding comedy hitting theaters. But while critics say Jumping the Broom has some strong performances and moments of sweetness, it’s unfortunately bogged down in clichés and an overabundance of subplots. The plot: two families gather in Martha’s Vineyard for a wedding — the bride is from an affluent clan, while the groom’s family is blue collar — and friction quickly becomes the order of the day. Can everyone agree to put conflict on the back burner for the sake of our couple? The pundits say Broom benefits from strong performances (particularly Angela Bassett and Loretta Devine as the family matriarchs) and some vigorous laughs, but unfortunately it’s too long – and its plot is too overstuffed — to work as a breezy comedy of manners.Also opening this week in limited release:Caterpillar, a drama about a soldier’s psychological descent after returning home from the second Sino-Japanese War, is at 100 percent.Hobo With a Shotgun, starring starring Rutger Hauer as a hobo with a shotgun, is at 83 percent (check out Hauer’s Five Favorite Films here).Forks Over Knives, a documentary that asks whether a diet free of processed and meat based-foods is healthier, is at 83 percent.Harvest, a naturalistic portrait of a family that’s dealing with health problems and personal issues, is at 80 percent.Octubre, a dark comedy about an emotionally distant man who finds himself caring for a baby, is at 67 percent.The Beaver, starring Mel Gibson and Jodie Foster in the tale of a troubled man who finds solace by communicating with a beaver puppet, is at 69 percent.Last Night, starring Keira Knightley and Sam Worthington as a married couple whose relationship may give way to temptation, is at 47 percent.Daydream Nation, starring Kat Dennings and Josh Lucas in a dramedy about a girl who moves to a new school and falls for her youthful teacher, is at 44 percent.There Be Dragons, a historical drama about the founding of Opus Dei, is at 20 percent.An Invisible Sign, starring Jessica Alba as a socially awkward young woman who becomes a math teacher to connect with the outside world, is at zero percent.Passion Play, starring Mickey Rourke and Megan Fox in a neo noir about a jazz musician who gets in over his head with both a beautiful woman and the mob, is at zero percent.Finally, props to Adam P. for coming the closest guessing Dylan Dog: Dead of Night‘s five percent Tomatometer.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"NYCC, Box, Go, rt, Ellie, Guild, casting, ITV, dceu, dc, awards, book, thriller, Warner","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"critics-consensus-thor-is-certified-fresh"},{"id":"47508784716499","title":"Critics Consensus: Justin Bieber: Never Say Never Strikes A Chord","content":"Critics Consensusvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Critics Consensus: Justin Bieber: Never Say Never Strikes A ChordPlus, the critics say nay to Just Go With It, meh to Gnomeo and Juliet and the Eagle.by Tim Ryan | February 11, 2011 |  CommentsThis week at the movies, we’ve got Bieber fever (the concert documentary Justin Bieber: Never Say Never); romantic deception (Just Go With It, starring Adam Sandler and Jennifer Aniston); Shakespearean lawn ornaments (Gnomeo and Juliet, with voice work by James McAvoy and Emily Blunt); and an epic journey (The Eagle, starring Channing Tatum and Jamie Bell). What do the critics have to say?Justin Bieber: Never Say Never 65%If you’re a 12-year-old girl with a severe case of Bieber fever, you’ll probably love Justin Bieber: Never Say Never.

Never Say Never chronicles Bieber’s rise to stardom, culminating in a blowout show in Madison Square Garden with such pop luminaries as Usher, Miley Cyrus, and Ludacris; along the way, we learn about the star’s prodigious talent and hard work. The pundits say the film sometimes has the feel of an infomercial, and is a little overlong, but it’s also an occasionally fascinating peek into the star-making process, and Bieber comes off as a likeable, remarkably polished performer throughout.Just Go with It 19%One often needs to suspend disbelief with the unlikely plot mechanics of romantic comedies. However, critics say that’s a tall order with Just Go With It, which requires its talented cast to act foolishly at nearly every turn. Adam Sandler stars as a plastic surgeon who lures women by pretending he’s married; when he meets the girl of his dreams, he asks his long-suffering assistant (Jennifer Aniston) to pretend to be his ex in order to keep up the façade. The pundits say Just Go with It is an implausible, largely laugh-free affair that lacks the energy and comic rhythm required to pull off this kind of farce.Gnomeo and Juliet 55%Shakespeare’s works are so universal that they’ve survived innumerable offbeat adaptations. Still, the idea of Gnomeo and Juliet — the Bard’s greatest romantic tragedy set in a world of anthropomorphic garden gnomes – is more idiosyncratic than most, and critics say this animated musical comedy has moments of inspiration but is a little thin over the long haul. Gnomeo (James McAvoy) and Juliet (Emily Blunt) are gnomes that find love despite being from opposite sides of a fence. Can these crazy kids make it work — and keep their fellow lawn ornaments from all-out war? Some pundits are charmed by Gnomeo‘s wit and imagination, but others find it a little too self-referential for its own good (Check out Five Favorite Films with executive producer/composer Sir Elton John.)The Eagle 39%An old-school sword-and-sandal epic that gets by without overdosing on CGI is a tasty proposition. Unfortunately, critics say The Eagle doesn’t quite soar — it looks terrific, but its sluggish pacing and so-so central performance from Channing Tatum keep it from standing alongside antiquity flicks of yore. Tatum stars as a Roman centurion on a quest to restore his family’s honor; along with a slave (Jamie Bell), his dangerous journey takes him beyond the borders of the Roman Empire. The pundits say The Eagle has a nice eye for period detail and scenic vistas, but Tatum lacks the authority to pull off the central role, and the battle sequences are hard to follow.(Check out this week’s Total Recall, in which we present a list of memorable Romans in the movies.)Also opening this week in limited release:Poetry, about a sixtysomething woman who enrolls in a poetry class to stave off personal demons, is at 100 percent.The Sky Turns, a documentary chronicling a young woman’s return to her isolated, sparsely populated village, is at 100 percent.Orgasm, Inc., a doc about the development of pharmaceuticals to treat female sexual dysfunction, is at 88 percent.Cedar Rapids, starring Ed Helms and John C.

What do the critics have to say?Sanctum 30%James Cameron loves high drama under the sea; his directorial credits include Piranha 2: The Spawning, The Abyss, and that little movie about an ocean liner that sank after hitting an iceberg. Cameron is the executive producer on Sanctum, and critics say the film maintains his flair for arresting visuals, but unfortunately the characters and plot are nothing particularly special. Sanctum is the story of a group of cave divers who become trapped after a tropical storm. They’re lost in a vast undersea cavern, short on supplies, and desperate to find a way out. The pundits say Sanctum has moments of tension and visual wonder, but it’s undercut by one-dimensional characters and remarkably middling dialogue. (Check out Five Favorite Films with Cameron, director Alister Grierson and writer Andrew Wight.)The Roommate 3%It looks like the folks behind The Roommate forgot to list a “critics wanted” ad, since it wasn’t screened prior to release.

What do the critics have to say?[tomatometer]MovieID=770671153[/tomatometer]The Chronicles of Narnia: The Voyage of the Dawn TreaderThus far, the Chronicles of Narnia movies have generated respectful enthusiasm from audiences and critics – in contrast to the rabid culthood surrounding the Lord of the Rings or Harry Potter movies. And critics say that’s not likely to change with the franchise’s latest outing, (The Voyage of the Dawn Treader, which they say is visually striking but lacks both excitement and a sense of wonder. Once again, the Pevensie children are back in Narnia, and this time they must journey across the sea and collect seven swords in order to save Narnia from certain destruction. The pundits sayDawn Treader isn’t bad, and some of the creature designs are remarkable, but it’s short on urgency, wide-eyed marvel, and a sense of fun.[tomatometer]MovieID=771035591[/tomatometer]The TouristEverybody loves a caper picture, the kind in which beautiful people get in and out amidst picturesque locales. Right? Not necessarily in the case of The Tourist; critics say the seemingly can’t-miss proposition of Johnny Depp and Angelina Jolie trying to escape danger amidst the splendor of Europe’s most iconic cities is a serious letdown, a slow-moving bagatelle with minimal chemistry between its superstar leads. Depp stars as a lovelorn American who meets the mysterious, beautiful Jolie on a train. It turns out she’s caught up in an international game of cat-and-mouse, and Depp is caught in the crossfire. A certain level of absurdity is inherent in this sort of thing, but the pundits say The Tourist is too slackly paced to keep audiences from suspending disbelief, and the romance between Depp and Jolie is a nonstarter.

What do the critics have to say?[tomatometer]MovieID=770816170[/tomatometer]Season of the WitchSay what you will about Nicolas Cage, but give the man credit: at a time when too many movie stars studiously protect their images, he’s unafraid to look ridiculous. Sometimes, his devil-may-care attitude pays off (see Bad Lieutenant: Port of Call New Orleans), and sometimes, well, we get stuff like Season of the Witch, a Medieval action flick that critics say is too dull to qualify as so-bad-it’s-good kitsch. Cage and Ron Perlman star as former Crusaders who are tasked with protecting and transporting a woman accused of being witch to a remote monastery; on their arduous journey, they must contend with wolves, zombies, and the black plague. The pundits say Season of the Witch is bottom-of-the barrel fantasy fare, with cheesy dialogue, so-so special effects, and a general air of silliness. (Check out Cage’s Five Favorite Films, as well as this week’s Total Recall, in which we count down Perlman’s best-reviewed movies.)[tomatometer]MovieID=771203530[/tomatometer]Country StrongA lot of country songs are great not for their originality, but because they’re infused with passion and craftsmanship. The same holds true for plenty of movies, but unfortunately for Country Strong, it can’t transcend its clichés, devolving into a showbiz melodrama despite good performances and heart-on-its-sleeve sincerity. Gwyneth Paltrow stars as Kelly Canter, a country superstar fresh from rehab; still shaky, she embarks on a tour, with hot young singer Beau Hutton (Garrett Hedlund), overseen by her manager/ex-husband James (Tim McGraw). Can our heroine overcome romantic entanglements and the bottle to reclaim her place atop the charts? The pundits say the leads give it their all, and the music is toe-tapping, but Country Strong is undone by meandering pacing and a slavish adherence to soapy formula.Also opening this week in limited release:Phil Ochs: There But For Fortune, a documentary about the life and times of the overlooked 1960s folk singer, is at 100 percent.The Time That Remains, a generation-spanning dramedy about a Palestinian family, is at 77 percent.If I Want To Whistle, I Whistle, Romanian drama about a young man about to be released from prison, is at 57 percent.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"Dead, HBO, aliens, Moore, supernatural, drama, 71st, Endgame, LGBT, Globe","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Critics-Consensus-Season-of-the-Witch-Doesnt-Cast-a-Spell"},{"id":"47508785824469","title":"Critics Consensus: The Mechanic Could Use A Tune-Up","content":"Critics Consensusvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Critics Consensus: The Mechanic Could Use A Tune-UpPlus, The Rite is far from heavenly.by Tim Ryan | January 28, 2011 |  CommentsThis week at the movies, we’ve got a vengeful assassin (The Mechanic, starring Jason Statham and Ben Foster), and an exorcism education (The Rite, starring Anthony Hopkins and Rutger Hauer). What do the critics have to say?The Mechanic 53%If you’re looking for an action star that can simultaneously seem both tough-as-nails and emotionally vulnerable, Jason Statham is your man. Critics say the star brings a level of emotional heft and gritty brawn to The Mechanic, which is otherwise a so-so action flick with some decent thrills but little originality. Based upon a 1972 Charles Bronson vehicle (pun intended), Statham stars as an existential hit man who seeks vengeance after a close friend is killed. He teams up with his friend’s son (Ben Foster) to get the bad guys, but soon our heroes are on the run themselves. The pundits say The Mechanic is pretty standard stuff, with little to distinguish it beyond Statham, who’s efficient and cool as always. (Check out Foster’s Five Favorite Films here.)The Rite 21%Given the number of horror flicks who turn demonic possession into schlock, The Rite gets points for taking the battle between good and evil seriously. However, critics say there’s a difference between being serious and being dull, and despite a typically classy performance from Anthony Hopkins, The Rite is too much of a slog to deliver much in the way of thrills. Colin O’Donoghue stars as a seminary student of shaky faith who travels to the Vatican to learn how to perform exorcisms. Under the tutelage of Father Lucas (Hopkins), the young man soon finds that the powers of evil are very strong indeed, and he must conjure the strength to fight for good. The pundits say The Rite has its moments, but Hopkins can’t elevate a script that takes way to long to get moving.

What do the critics have to say?Sucker Punch 22%Smoking-hot babes with swords! A daring escape from a creepy asylum! Samurais and dragons! Is there any way Sucker Punch could possibly go wrong? Well, yes, say critics, who find Zack Snyder’s latest to be a compendium of geeky obsessions in search of a story (or indeed, general coherence). Emily Browning stars as Babydoll, a young woman whose mother has recently died, leaving her in the care of her evil stepfather, who ships her off to a mental hospital. Babydoll retreats into a dreamworld, teaming up with a bevy of gals who plan a treacherous escape from the facility. The pundits say Sucker Punch is admirably ambitious, but it fails to add up to much; it’s an assault on the senses that suffers from jarring tonal shifts and a shortage of narrative logic. (Check out this week’s Total Recall, in which we present a rundown of memorable prison break movies.)Diary of a Wimpy Kid 2: Rodrick Rules 47%The first Diary of a Wimpy Kid, which hit theaters last year, got decidedly mixed reviews; a number of scribes found it sweet and perceptive, while others called it clichéd and over reliant on gross-out jokes. It appears Diary of a Wimpy Kid 2: Rodrick Rules won’t set the critical world on fire either — some critics say its life lessons and good humor are more pronounced this time out, but others feel it’s a little shopworn and occasionally cynical. Our hero Greg (Zachary Gordon) is starting seventh grade, and optimistically hopes that he will get in with the cool crowd. Unfortunately, his older brother Rodrick continues to torment him. Will these two ever get along? The pundits say Diary benefits from strong performances from its young actors and a couple of insightful laughs, but it also gets bogged down in scenes of public humiliation and bullying that don’t add much to the equation.Also opening this week in limited release:Honey, a drama about a boy’s spiritual awakening in a remote town in Turkey, is at 100 percent.My Perestroika, a documentary about the lives of young people growing up in the waning days of communism, is at 83 percent.Potiche, starring Catherine Deneuve and Gérard Depardieu in a comedy about a romance between an umbrella factory owner’s wife and a labor leader, is at 77 percent.White Irish Drinkers, a coming-of-age drama about a group of petty crooks in 1970s Brooklyn, is at 46 percent.Peep World, starring Michael C.

What do the critics have to say?[tomatometer]MovieID=770678817[/tomatometer]The Green HornetThe Green Hornet, who began life as the star of a 1930s radio serial, is a little late to the gritty superhero reboot club. And the critics say despite the direction of the oft-whimsical Michel Gondry and the presence of likeable everyman Seth Rogen in the title role, The Green Hornet doesn’t quite succeed as a superhero flick or as a subversive send-up of the genre. Rogen plays the famed vigilante, who teams up with Kato (Jay Chou) to take on the mob after the death of a friend. The pundits say The Green Hornet has moments of inspiration, and that Chou is excellent, but that Gondry’s typical good humor is mostly missing here, resulting in a strange mix of wisecracking and ultra-violence that never quite gels.[tomatometer]MovieID=771041141[/tomatometer]The DilemmaThere’s nothing wrong with a comedy that explores the dark side of modern romance – as long as it can make us laugh. Critics say that’s the main problem with Ron Howard’s The Dilemma: it’s not particularly insightful or funny, mucking around in dispiriting territory before bailing out with shopworn slapstick. Vince Vaughn and Kevin James star as a pair of old buds and business partners whose friendship is about to be tested by a big business deal — and the fact that Vaughn has inadvertently learned that James’s wife (played by Winona Ryder) may be having an affair. The pundits say it’s a decent setup, and the cast (particularly Vaughn) is game, but what transpires is more sour than satisfying; The Dilemma‘s pacing problems and tonal shifts undermine both the comedic and dramatic elements of the script.

What do the critics have to say?Hall Pass 33%In the past, the Farrelly brothers’ deft mix of raunch and heart made for a potent comedic combination. However, with their latest, Hall Pass, critics say the brothers’ aim is off; though the movie has some very funny moments, it’s bogged down by a little too much gross stuff and a little too much sentimentality. Owen Wilson and Jason Sudeikis star as a pair of fortysomething buddies whose wives hope to stave off their marital problems by letting the guys live the single life for a week. Soon, however, the boys discover that untamed freedom is a little more than they bargained for. The pundits say Hall Pass is good for a couple gleefully crude gags, but the film is trying too hard to mix comedy with uplift, and has a few too many subplots.Drive Angry 48%With a title like Drive Angry, you pretty much know what to expect — lots of action, and Nicolas Cage doing his unhinged thing, with subtlety and nuance left in the dust. Nothing wrong with that, necessarily, though critics say Drive Angry only partially delivers on its pedal-to-the-metal premise, offering some cheap thrills to compensate for its so-so script. Cage stars as a dead felon who escapes from Hell (not metaphorically) to rescue his daughter from a cult; hot on his trail is one of Satan’s minions (William Fichtner). The pundits say that those looking for some grindhouse fun will be pleased with Drive Angry‘s goofy energy, but don’t expect disciplined storytelling or much depth beyond the dramatic action set pieces.

The first installment of the series’ two part finale, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, is here, and the critics say that despite occasional lags in pacing and a (perhaps necessarily) abrupt conclusion, the movie mostly delivers, thanks largely to the now-full-grown trio of lead actors. This time out, Harry (Radcliffe), Hermione (Emma Watson), and Ron (Rupert Grint) must find the magical Horcruxes in order to defeat the evil Lord Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes). Like every Potter movie before it, Deathly Hallows is Certified Fresh, and although the pundits say this is a more workmanlike, foreboding entry, it benefits greatly from typically dazzling production design and excellent performances from Radcliffe, Grint, and especially Watson.

Critics say The Next Three Days benefits from strong work from Russell Crowe, but sags under the weight of its general unbelievability. Crowe stars as a man whose wife (Elizabeth Banks) has been imprisoned for a murder; convinced of her innocence, he launches a desperate plot to spring her from the joint. The pundits say Crowe’s gritty performance keeps things grounded in reality, but implausible events and drags in the action keep The Next Three Days from being anything more than a competent thriller.Also opening this week in limited release:Claire Denis’s White Material, starring Isabelle Huppert as a woman trying to run a coffee plantation in the midst of a violent conflict, is at 89 percent.Made in Dagenham, starring Sally Hawkins and Bob Hoskins in the based-on-true-events tale of a group of female Ford employees who went on strike for equality, is at 88 percent.Today’s Special, starring Aasif Mandvi in a comedy about a sous chef who must save his restaurant and reconcile with his parents, is at 83 percent.Heartless, a psychological thriller about a photographer who stumbles upon a band of scary folks, is at 69 percent.Nothing Personal, a dramedy about a woman who leaves the Netherlands to lead a solitary existence in Ireland, is at 67 percent.Finally, props to dudemeister for coming the closest to guessing Skyline‘s 15 percent Tomatometer.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"News, Spring, television, drama, Diego, crime, Infographic, comic","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"critics-consensus-deathly-hallows-is-certified-fresh"},{"id":"47508785848033","title":"Critics Consensus: Unstoppable Is Certified Fresh","content":"Critics Consensusvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Critics Consensus: Unstoppable Is Certified FreshPlus, Morning Glory is occasionally sharp, and guess Skyline's Tomatometer!by Tim Ryan | November 12, 2010 |  CommentsThis week at the movies, we’ve got a runaway train (Unstoppable, starring Denzel Washington and Chris Pine), chat show intrigue (Morning Glory, starring Rachel McAdams and Harrison Ford), and an alien invasion (Skyline, starring Donald Faison and Eric Balfour).

She’s brought charm and spunk to a lot of roles before, but critics say Morning Glory offers definitive proof she’s the real deal. Unfortunately, they also note the rest of the movie doesn’t rise to the quality of its leading lady; it’s a relatively toothless satire of television that offers a few big laughs but ultimately feels like something of a missed opportunity. McAdams stars as a young go-getter on a failing network morning show who hopes to improve ratings by adding a legendary news anchor (Harrison Ford) to the cast; unfortunately, her new charge is grumpy about working on such a news-lite program. Can our heroine make the show a ratings winner – and find love in the process? The pundits say Morning Glory is mostly affable, with a few moments of inspiration, but that despite strong work from McAdams, it’s not quite as substantial as it could have been (Find out what star Jeff Goldblum’s Five Favorite Films are here.)[tomatometer]MovieID=771203481[/tomatometer]SkylineIt appears the folks behind Skyline were afraid that movie critics would act like a bunch of Chicken Littles, since the film wasn’t screened in the U.S. prior to release.

What do the critics have to say?[tomatometer]MovieID=770678818[/tomatometer]TangledDisney has always had a knack for taking classic fairy tales and making them fresh. And while the critics say Tangled, a reimagining of Rapunzel, may not have the depth of the studio’s animated classics, it’s a visually stunning, emotionally resonant piece of family entertainment. The charming rogue Flynn Rider (voiced by Zachary Levi) takes refuge in a tower, where he’s held against his will by Rapunzel (Mandy Moore), a spunky gal who’s looking to escape her isolated existence. The pundits say Tangled blends old-school storytelling with state-of-the-art animation, and the result is a film that’s funny, romantic, and exciting.[tomatometer]MovieID=770857928[/tomatometer]BurlesqueIt’s no sin for a movie musical to have a predictable plot, and Burlesque‘s tale of a small-town girl trying to make it in the big city is as old as the hills. However, critics say the movie doesn’t quite go over-the-top enough to make it all worthwhile. Christina Aguilera stars as Ali, whose showbiz ambitions take her to the Burlesque Lounge. After a few stumbles, she’s taken under the tutelage of the club’s proprietor (Cher). Will she achieve her dreams? The pundits say X-Tina and Cher acquit themselves well, and the musical numbers have their moments, but ultimately Burlesque lacks the grit and plotting of such showbiz classics as Cabaret.[tomatometer]MovieID=770816173[/tomatometer]FasterAfter a detour into family-friendly territory, Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson veers back into action with the revenge thriller Faster. Unfortunately, critics say this is only a decent genre picture, one with some solid thrills that succumbs to skin-deep characters and some pacing issues. Johnson stars as a fresh-out-the-joint ex-con on a mission to avenge the death of his brother, who was murdered during the job that sent him to prison. However, a veteran cop (Billy Bob Thornton) is on his trail, and it turns out there’s more to Johnson’s plot than there appears. The pundits say Faster is more ambitious than your average action flick, but ultimately the characters don’t resound as they should, and the plot twists are a bit too pat.[tomatometer]MovieID=770856056[/tomatometer]Love and Other DrugsIt’s a terrific premise for a romantic comedy: can a philandering pharmaceutical rep pitching a male enhancement pill actually find love? Too bad, then, that critics say Love and Other Drugs is something of a misfire, with attractive, charismatic leads but an inconsistent comic tone. Jake Gyllenhaal stars as a swingin’ Viagra pitchman who finds himself under the spell of a free-spirited woman (Anne Hathaway); romance and raciness ensue. The problem, pundits say, is that Love and Other Drugs squanders its stars on a script that can’t decide if it wants to be heartfelt or raunchy, and the result is a movie that has its moments but can’t totally cohere.Also opening this week in limited release:The King’s Speech, starring Colin Firth and Helena Bonham Carter in the tale of King George VI’s struggle to overcome a speech impediment during tumultuous times, is at 85 percent.Undertow, a ghost story about a Peruvian fisherman’s forbidden love, is at 85 percent.Nutcracker in 3D, a star-studded, darkly political take on Tchaikovsky’s holiday classic, is at zero percent.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"movies, Biopics, Opinion, Awards, &, ID, Arts, worst, Marvel, Competition","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Critics-Consensus-Tangled-Weaves-A-Fun-Web"},{"id":"47508787473130","title":"Critics Consensus: Guess Resident Evil: Afterlife‘s Tomatometer!","content":"Critics Consensusvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Critics Consensus: Guess Resident Evil: Afterlife's Tomatometer!The week's only wide release wasn't screened for critics.by Tim Ryan | September 9, 2010 |  CommentsThis week at the movies brings only one wide release: The fourth installment of the zombie-infested sci-fi/action Resident Evil franchise (Resident Evil: Afterlife, starring Milla Jovovich and Ali Larter).

What do the critics have to say?[tomatometer]MovieID=770819741[/tomatometer]SecretariatAh, the inspirational sports movie: it’s a subgenre we never seem to tire of, no matter what the athletic pursuit or how conventional the script. And critics say Secretariat, a biopic (horsey-pic?) of the 1973 Triple Crown winner, is a pretty solid wager, with strong performances and thrilling race sequences largely offsetting the fact that little of the story will come as a surprise – even if you don’t have a sports almanac on your shelf. Diane Lane stars as the inheritor of a stable and, with the help of a skilled trainer (John Malkovich), literally bets the farm that the movie’s titular Thoroughbred will win the Derby, the Preakness, and the Belmont Stakes. No points for guessing the outcome, though the pundits say Secretariat is rousing, effectively-acted family fare, and further proof that standard material can be overcome by a sense of panache. (Check out this week’s Total Recall, in which we count down Malkovich’s complete filmography.)[tomatometer]MovieID=770858011[/tomatometer]Life as We Know ItFirst comes love, then comes marriage, then comes a baby in a baby carriage, right? Not in Life as We Know It, a romantic comedy about an unlikely family unit that critics say otherwise adheres slavishly to formula. Katherine Heigl and Josh Duhamel star as friends of a couple that dies in a car crash, and are forced to care for the dead couple’s baby — despite their mutual acrimony. Will the two of them come together to raise the child — and find love in the process? No spoilers will be revealed here, but suffice to say the pundits find the whole thing to be remarkably predictable – though they also note that the cast does its best to inject some energy into the proceedings.[tomatometer]MovieID=770874914[/tomatometer]My Soul to TakeRather than praying for good reviews, the folks behind My Soul to Take decided to keep critics away prior to the film’s release.

But for now we have Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part I, which marks the seventh film of J.K. Rowling’s publishing phenomenon, and the beginning of the end of one of history’s most successful movie franchises.To date, every chapter of the series has earned a solid “fresh” on the Tomatometer; despite a general preference for some films over others, the lowest score has been 78 per cent — for both 2001’s fledgling Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone and 2007’s Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (curiously, the two highest-grossing movies in the series). Alfonso Cuarón’s Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (2004) remains the best-loved among critics at 90 per cent, while last year’s Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince conjured up a healthy 83 per cent.How do the critics see the latest Potter? Reaction thus far seems predicated on the knowledge that this is the opening half of a much larger film, and that perhaps the bigger picture will emerge with Part II‘s release.IGN UK says “it’s by no means a bad Harry Potter movie,” but adds that “the overriding feeling is that it’s an incomplete one”; Variety suggests it’s “suffused with a profound sense of solitude and loss”; while the UK’s Independent offers, “your appetite will be whetted for what promises to be an almighty showdown.”Still, questions over the validity of splitting the film in two linger. Empire is eager to move ahead, calling to “bring on part 2”, and Total Film are more direct, arguing that “there’s absolutely no artistic justification for a two-movie split.” And then, for those who never liked the series anyway, there’s The Guardian: “It’s hard to mourn the demise of a franchise that was never more than half-alive to begin with.” Ouch.So, what’s you guess for Deathly Hallows‘ T-meter? Can it top the best of the series, or will it lower the bar?As reviews continue to roll in all week, be sure to check back here and on Harry Potter‘s page to keep up on the latest reviews and Tomatometer scores.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"Premium","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Tomatometer-Watch-Will-Harry-Be-Deathly-Or-Hallowed"},{"id":"47508785852131","title":"Critics Consensus: Guess Saw 3D‘s Tomatometer!","content":"Critics Consensusvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Critics Consensus: Guess Saw 3D's Tomatometer!Plus,Conviction benefits from strong performances.by Tim Ryan | October 29, 2010 |  CommentsThis week at the movies, Jigsaw’s comin’ at ya in three dimensions in Saw 3D, starring Tobin Bell and Cary Elwes, and we’ve also got a real-life legal drama (Conviction, starring Hilary Swank and Sam Rockwell).

Taking place 2 years after the events of the first film, Sex and the City 2 focuses on the troubles the foursome face when life has settled down, and critics say this sequel is one they could have done without.

Unfortunately, it seems no one has yet been able to crack the secret to creating an effective yet faithful adaptation, and critics say that Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time, while sitting in the upper echelon of the genre, ultimately fails to break the cycle. Jake Gyllenhaal stars as the titular hero, who teams up with an exotic princess (Gemma Arterton) to retrieve a magical dagger from an evil nobleman.

Critics say that’s one of the many reasons to love Despicable Me, which they call a witty, delightfully weird film that should appeal to kids and adults. In his quiet suburban neighborhood, Gru (Steve Carell) is plotting one of the most diabolical heists in history, and he might get away with it if not for a group of meddling kids. The pundits say the Certified Fresh Despicable Me is both a visual treat and a gleefully silly romp with strong voice performances. 64%PredatorsFuturistic, brutal, and counting two future governors among its alumni, Predator was among the most memorable action/horror films of the 1980s.

On a distant planet, a group of criminals are hunted mercilessly by the titular baddies, until a strong-willed soldier (Adrien Brody) rounds up a posse to fight back.

Leonardo DiCaprio stars as Cobb, an American expat skilled in stealing ideas from people’s dreams. He’s offered an opportunity to return to the States if he can pull off one last big job — and, naturally, metaphysical complications ensue. The pundits say Inception is a visual marvel and a brainy head trip — in fact, you’ll probably have to see it multiple times to get everything that’s going on.

More attention to story and character, they say, might have helped the film’s drama service its spectacular dancing.Also opening this week in limited release:Eccentricities of a Blonde-haired Girl, a tale of romantic obsession from centenarian Portuguese director Manoel de Oliveira, is at 100 percent.Lebanon, based on the true story of an Israeli mission gone awry in the 1982 Lebanon War, is at 73 percent.The Disappearance of Alice Creed, a thriller about a woman who turns the tables on her kidnappers, is at 77 percent.The Wildest Dream, a documentary about one of the earliest attempts to climb Mt.

What do the critics have to say?[tomatometer]MuzeID=1210749[/tomatometer]The Twilight Saga: EclipseHey, Twihards — you’re probably going to see Eclipse anyway, so feel free to ignore the reviews. However, for the uninitiated who find themselves dragged to the theater, the critics say Eclipse is a big step up from New Moon — even if it still suffers from slack pacing and portentous dialogue. Kristen Stewart, Robert Pattinson, and Taylor Lautner are all back as the principals in every tween’s favorite supernatural love triangle; this time, all three are threatened by an army of newborn vampires assembled for the purpose of killing Bella to indirectly enact revenge upon the Cullens. The pundits say new director David Slade does well with the material, underscoring the emotional developments with some reasonably stirring action. However, they also note Eclipse is still too often a slog, with so-so acting, middling special effects, and lots of dead passages.

Night Shyamalan? In the decade since The Sixth Sense, his reputation as a wunderkind has taken a steep dive, one that won’t be revived with The Last Airbender, which critics are calling an incomprehensible, ugly mess. Based upon the popular Nickelodeon cartoon, Airbender tells the story of Aang (Noah Ringer), who utilizes his rare element-manipulation skills to bring peace to a war-torn fantasy world. The pundits say Airbender‘s baffling exposition and retrofitted 3-D effects make for a viewing experience that’s hopelessly muddled in both plot and visuals.Also opening this week in limited release:Only When I Dance, a documentary about a pair of ambitious Brazilian dancers, is at 100 percent.The Agony and the Ecstasy of Phil Spector, a doc about the legendary record producer cum convicted murderer, is at 77 percent.Great Directors, a doc featuring interviews with filmmakers like Bernardo Bertolucci, David Lynch, and Agnes Varda, is at 69 percent.Love Ranch, starring Helen Mirren and Joe Pesci as a married couple running a Nevada brothel, is at 15 percent.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"true, Acorn, Tumblr, TV, indie","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Critics-Consensus-Eclipse-Is-Brighter-Than-New-Moon"},{"id":"47508787487473","title":"Critics Consensus: Dinner for Schmucks Serves Up An OK Time","content":"Critics Consensusvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Critics Consensus: Dinner for Schmucks Serves Up An OK TimePlus, Charlie St. Cloud and Cats and Dogs fail to wow the critics.by Tim Ryan | July 30, 2010 |  CommentsThis week at the movies, we’ve got a dinner party disaster (Dinner for Schmucks, starring Steve Carell and Paul Rudd), some after-death bonding (Charlie St. Cloud, starring Zac Efron and Kim Basinger), and a joint canine-feline mission (Cats &amp; Dogs: The Revenge of Kitty Galore, starring Chris O’Donnell and Jack McBrayer). What do the critics have to say?[tomatometer]MovieID=770807431[/tomatometer]Dinner for SchmucksIt’s not unusual for a remake to lose something in transition, and that’s the case with Dinner for Schmucks, an American take on the acid French farce The Dinner Game. Still, critics say even if this isn’t the most biting comedy, the inventiveness of Steve Carell and Paul Rudd make it consistently watchable and occasionally hilarious. Rudd stars as a guy struggling to get ahead at his company, until his boss invites him to a dinner party. One problem: the dinner is a competition, and he has to bring the biggest idiot he can find. So he brings Barry (Carell), a world class fool who also has a core of decency and some interesting talents. The pundits say Schmucks lacks the bite of the original, and often devolves into empte slapstick. However, it’s also got goofiness and absurdity to spare, and its performers are on top of their games. (Check out this week’s Total Recall, in which we run down Rudd’s best-reviewed movies.)[tomatometer]MovieID=770859139[/tomatometer]Charlie St. CloudSlowly but surely, Zac Efron is moving away from the teenybop material that made him a star. However, if his turn in last year’s Me and Orson Welles signaled a new maturity, the critics say the generic weepy Charlie St. Cloud is a big step backward. Efron stars as a young man overcome with grief at the death of his younger brother; soon however, he’s communicating with his sibling from the beyond. Will he stay true to the little guy even after meeting the girl of his dreams? The pundits say Charlie St. Cloud is a melodramatic mess, uneasily mixing romantic and supernatural elements with a bit too much schmaltz to resonate.[tomatometer]MovieID=770805223[/tomatometer]Cats &amp; Dogs: The Revenge of Kitty GaloreNine years ago, Cats and Dogs was a surprise box office hit that generated some tepid but decent reviews. Not this time: critics say the sequel, subtitled The Revenge of Kitty Galore, is a dull satire of James Bond movies that’s unlikely to generate much enthusiasm among the kiddies in the audience. This time out, the cats and dogs join forces to defeat an evil plan by Kitty Galore, a rogue housecat bent on world domination. The pundits say this one’s a dog, with mediocre CGI effects, little storytelling to speak of, and an utter lack of originality.Also opening this week in limited release:Get Low, starring Robert Duvall and Bill Murray in the Depression-era tale of an eccentric who stages his own funeral while he’s still alive, is at 91 percent.Smash His Camera, a documentary about pioneering paparazzo Ron Galella, is at 86 percent.Enemies of the People, an in-depth look at he brutalities of the Khmer Rouge, is at 83 percent.The Dry Land, starring Ryan O’Nan and America Ferrera in a drama about a war vet dealing with PTSD, is at 57 percent.The Concert, a comedy about an orchestra getting the band — I mean, symphony — back together, is at 57 percent.Hugh Hefner: Playboy, Activist and Rebel, a doc about Hef’s political beliefs and battles, is at 50 percent.The Extra Man, starring Robert Duvall and Paul Dano in a comedy about a young man who rents a room from a wild New York eccentric, is at 41 percent.Who Killed Nancy?, a doc about the circumstances surrounding the death of Sid Vicious’ girlfriend, is at 21 percent.Helen, starring Ashley Judd in a drama about a professor’s struggle with clinical depression, is at 20 percent.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"camera, Comedy, Mary, popular, mockumentary, Hallmark, Arts","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Critics-Consensus-Dinner-for-Schmucks-Serves-Up-An-OK-Time"},{"id":"47508787491570","title":"Critics Consensus: Salt Is Moderately Tasty","content":"Critics Consensusvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Critics Consensus: Salt Is Moderately TastyPlus, Ramona and Beezus is sweet but dull.by Tim Ryan | July 23, 2010 |  CommentsThis week at the movies, we’ve got a spy on the run (Salt, starring Angelina Jolie and Liev Schreiber) and some feuding sisters (Ramona and Beezus, starring Selena Gomez and John Corbett). What do the critics have to say?[tomatometer]MuzeID=1213717[/tomatometer]SaltNow that the Cold War is long over, they don’t make thrillers like they used to. Oh, wait, maybe they do. The critics say Salt is a solid, meat-and-potatoes spy flick with a standout performance from Angelina Jolie — and, unfortunately, a completely preposterous plot. Jolie is Evelyn Salt, a CIA agent who goes on the run after being accused of spying for the Russians. Will she be able to prove her innocence? The pundits say Salt is an effective popcorn movie that firmly establishes Jolie in the upper echelon of action stars, bar gender. However, many also note that even popcorn movies need cohesiveness and believability, and that Salt is often tripped up by its gaping plot holes.(Check out this week’s Total Recall, in which we run down Jolie’s best-reviewed movies.)[tomatometer]MuzeID=1212688[/tomatometer]Ramona and BeezusFilled with true-to-life vignettes and mischievous humor, the works of Beverly Cleary have long been staples of the pre-teen reading diet. Now, Ramona and Beezus is finally getting the big screen treatment, and the result, say critics, is pleasant but generic. Newcomer Joey King stars as Ramona, the irrepressible scamp that drives her big sister Beezus (Selena Gomez) up a wall with her wild imagination and penchant for making a mess. Will sisterhood ultimately win the day? The pundits say this is sweet, innocuous fare that’s well-acted and mildly amusing, but also ultimately kind of dull and sitcommy.Also opening this week in limited release:Mugabe and the White African, a muckraking documentary about the Zimbabwean dictator’s land reform policies, is at 100 percent.Jean-Michel Basquiat: The Radiant Child, a doc about the art star’s short and fascinating life, is at 90 percent.Farewell, a low-key Cold War spy thriller, is at 81 percent.Life During Wartime, Todd Solondz’s darkly comic quasi-sequel to Happiness, is at 70 percent.Countdown to Zero, a doc about the current state of nuclear weapons arsenals, is at 67 percent.Tirador, a verité portrait of life in the slums of Manila, is at 67 percent.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"kong, nfl, Christmas, Winners, Returns, Worst, Toys, TV, talk, Arts, live, Lifetime, Nominations","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Critics-Consensus-Salt-Is-Moderately-Tasty"},{"id":"47508790786822","title":"Critics Consensus: Alice Looks Great, Lacks Wonder","content":"Critics Consensusvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Critics Consensus: Alice Looks Great, Lacks WonderPlus, Brooklyn's Finest isn't quite arresting.by Tim Ryan | March 5, 2010 |  CommentsThis week at the movies, we’ve got a trip down the rabbit hole (Alice in Wonderland, starring Johnny Depp and Mia Wasilkowska) and a ride-along with the boys in blue (Brooklyn’s Finest, starring Richard Gere and Don Cheadle). What do the critics have to say?[tomatometer]MuzeID=1211803[/tomatometer]Alice in WonderlandAt first glace, a Tim Burton adaptation of Alice in Wonderland seems perfectly serendipitous: Hollywood’s most playfully macabre filmmaker would be the obvious choice to reinterpret Lewis Carroll’s darkly whimsical tale. However, critics say the result is curiouser – a film of remarkable visual invention that lacks strong plotting or a sense of wonder. Mia Wasilkowska stars as the titular heroine who heads down the rabbit hole, where she encounters such eccentrics as the goofy-but-somewhat-sinister Mad Hatter (Johnny Depp) and the tyrannical Red Queen (Helena Bonham Carter). The pundits say Burton’s taste for phantasmagoric images is intact, but he loses track of the narrative, and the film misses the book’s good humor and sense of wide-eyed awe. (Check out this week’s Total Recall, in which we count down Burton’s best-reviewed films, as well as our feature on composer Danny Elfman’s Five Favorite Films.)[tomatometer]MuzeID=1197801[/tomatometer]Brooklyn’s FinestWith Training Day, Antoine Fuqua brought fresh, gritty energy to the cop drama. Now he’s back on the mean streets with Brooklyn’s Finest and critics say this one is far less — ahem — arresting. Finest follows three cops (Richard Gere, Don Cheadle, and Ethan Hawke) who, over the course of a particularly hectic week, find their personal and professional lives at wit’s end; will they sacrifice their ethics in the line of duty? The pundits say the movie features fine performances in the service of a shopworn script that borrows liberally from dozens of law enforcement flicks without bringing much new to the table.Also opening this week in limited release:Harlan: In the Shadow of Jew Suss, a documentary about the making of a notorious Nazi propaganda film, is at 100 percent.Harlem Aria, starring Damon Wayans in the tale of a mentally challenged youth who wants to be an opera singer, is at zero percent.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"telelvision, Black, guild, foreign, a, VOD, directors","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Critics-Consensus-Alice-Looks-Great-Lacks-Wonder"},{"id":"47508789293821","title":"Critics Consensus: Iron Man 2 Is Certified Fresh","content":"Critics Consensusvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Critics Consensus: Iron Man 2 Is Certified FreshPlus, Babies is cute, and Mother and Child is powerful.by Tim Ryan | May 7, 2010 |  CommentsThis week at the movies brings just one wide release: Iron Man 2, the hotly-anticipated superhero sequel starring Robert Downey Jr., Don Cheadle, and Scarlett Johansson. What do the critics have to say?[tomatometer]MuzeID=1197264[/tomatometer]Iron Man 2As with many blockbuster sequels, Iron Man 2 is bigger, louder, and filled with more characters than its predecessor. Critics say that doesn’t mean it’s better, but it’s still got enough firepower to kick off the summer in fine style — and the always-delightful presence of Robert Downey Jr. ensures that Iron Man 2 stays on track. Downey is back as Tony Stark, the multimillionaire and professional adventurer who dons the high-tech Iron Man getup and is reluctant to turn his creation over to the military. However, he’s got other problems on his hands — most notably Ivan Vanko (Mickey Rourke), who’s got an old score to settle with Stark. The pundits say the Certified Fresh Iron Man 2 features strong work from its fine ensemble cast, and the action scenes are top-notch, but overall, it doesn’t quite have the heft of the first film. (Check out this week’s Total Recall, in which we count down Cheadle’s best-reviewed movies.)Also opening this week in limited release:Casino Jack and the United State of Money, a documentary about disgraced lobbyist Jack Abramoff, is at 92 percent.Welcome, a drama about a Kurdish refugee’s attempts to reunite with his girlfriend in England, is at 88 percent.Mother and Child, starring Naomi Watts and Samuel L.

What do the critics have to say?[tomatometer]MuzeID=10012029[/tomatometer]Cop OutThe 1980s cop-buddy action/comedy is a subgenre that continues to delight movie buffs. Unfortunately, the critics say a strong cast and director Kevin Smith‘s obvious affection for the likes of 48 Hrs. and Beverly Hills Cop can’t elevate Cop Out above blandness. Bruce Willis and Tracy Morgan star as a pair of down-on-their-luck, wisecracking cops who don’t play by the rules and have family troubles. Can they crack the big case? Will hilarity ensue? The answer to the second question is no, say the scribes, who grumble that Cop Out is too thinly plotted and too slackly paced to make much of some familiar elements.[tomatometer]MuzeID=1205380[/tomatometer]The CraziesLike an unassisted triple play or a giant squid sighting, a critically acclaimed horror remake is exceedingly rare. However, such is the case with The Crazies, a revamp of George Romero’s 1973 chiller that’s tense, nicely shot, and uncommonly intelligent. Timothy Olyphant stars as the sheriff of a small town with a contaminated water supply that’s turning its citizens into murderous, 28 Days Later-style barbarians. Soon the government has quarantined the community in an attempt to control the situation, but not before a dark secret is revealed. The pundits say The Crazies benefits greatly from its assured craftsmanship, and the result is a smart, politically-charged film with oodles of scares and gore.

What do the critics have to say?[tomatometer]MuzeID=1210770[/tomatometer]Edge of DarknessIt’s been nearly a decade since Mel Gibson has played a leading role onscreen. And critics say the reason Edge of Darkness works as well as it does is Gibson’s presence, which elevates the film above a run-of-the-mill revenge thriller. Based upon the 1980s British TV series of the same name (also directed by Martin Campbell, who helms here), Edge stars Gibson as a Boston detective filled with grief after the murder of his daughter. However, as he investigates, he learns her death is part of a larger conspiracy. The pundits say Gibson is in fine form, delivering a world-weary, compelling performance that mostly makes up for the film’s contrivances. (Check out this week’s Total Recall, in which we count down Gibsons’s best-reviewed films.)[tomatometer]MuzeID=1207964[/tomatometer]When in RomeWhen in Rome attempts to meld romantic comedy and fairy tale tropes into a picturesque travelogue. However, critics say this long-delayed would-be confection is hardly worth the trip — it’s a forced and unconvincing attempt at whimsy that falls flat. Kristen Bell stars as Beth, a single gal who finds herself in a sticky situation: after removing coins from a “fountain of love” in the Eternal City, she’s followed back to New York by a string of obsessed suitors. The pundits say When in Rome is leaden, generic, and occasionally creepy, wasting an excellent cast (including Will Arnett, Anjelica Huston, and Danny DeVito) on a largely laugh-free script.Also opening this week in limited release:North Face, a historical drama about a pair of climbers attempting to conquer a perilous peak in the Swiss Alps, is at 89 percent.Off and Running, documentary about a college track prospect grappling with her unconventional family life, is at 80 percent.The Israeli import For My Father, a drama about a suicide bomber who finds himself living among his purported targets, is at 50 percent.Saint John of Las Vegas, starring Steve Buscemi in a dramedy about a recovering compulsive gambler drawn back to Vegas, is at seven percent.Finally, we’d like to send a big “EEYEAHH” to King Crunk (WHAT?!) for successfully guessing Legion‘s 17 percent Tomatometer.

One that explores modern romance and features a staggering array of stars? Well, tough luck: critics say Valentine’s Day may have an army of familiar faces, but they’re left stranded in an episodic, unfunny, clichéd mess of a romantic comedy. Directed by Garry Marshall, it’s a series of interconnected vignettes about Los Angeles residents finding and losing love. Valentine’s Day has a role for virtually everyone in Hollywood, from Julia Roberts to Jamie Foxx to the Taylors; what it lacks is a decent script that gives them much of anything to do — funny, insightful, heartfelt, or otherwise.[tomatometer]MuzeID=1214096[/tomatometer]Percy Jackson &amp; the Olympians: The Lightning ThiefPercy Jackson &amp; the Olympians: The Lightning Thief is unabashedly attempting to become a teen fantasy franchise along the lines of Harry Potter.

Logan Lerman stars as the title character, a troubled high schooler who discovers his dad is Poseidon; soon, he’s making a cross-country trek in an attempt to intervene in a potential war among the gods. The pundits say Percy isn’t the most original flick in the world, but the cast is strong, and the result is an often inspired action romp.[tomatometer]MuzeID=1194949[/tomatometer]The WolfmanThe Wolfman is one of horror cinema’s most iconic — and tortured — anti-heroes. Unfortunately, The Wolfman is a mostly tepid update of the famed lycanthrope, one that doesn’t hold a candle to the Lon Chaney Jr. chillers of old. Benicio Del Toro stars as Lawrence Talbot, a troubled blue-blood who returns to his family’s estate after his brother’s disappearance — and soon finds he has been afflicted by a horrible curse, one that manifests itself during a full moon.

What do the critics have to say?[tomatometer]MuzeID=1217700[/tomatometer]Kick-AssGiven the recent glut of superheroes on the big screen, it was inevitable that we’d get a film that both relishes and satirizes the genre (sorry, Superhero Movie, you don’t count). Critics say Matthew Vaughn’s hotly-anticipated Kick-Ass largely lives up to its name, even if some find its ambitious approach a bit scattershot. Aaron Johnson stars as the title character, a blundering would-be crime-fighter who finds himself outmatched by the bad guys. Soon, however, he joins forces with the likes of Hit Girl (a scene-stealing Chloe Moretz) and her pop Big Daddy (Nicolas Cage) in a war against some violent mobsters. The pundits say the Certified Fresh Kick-Ass has its share of questionable elements — including excessive violence and blue language from the mouths of babes — but it’s also an audacious blend of action, oddball comedy, and subversion.[tomatometer]MuzeID=10012010[/tomatometer]Death at a FuneralThree years ago, Frank Oz had a modest hit with Death at a Funeral, which revolved around a series of wacky misadventures in the wake of a Brit family patriarch’s death. Now Neil LaBute tries his hand at the same story with a mostly African American cast, and critics say the result is generally uninspired, despite the best efforts of a talented cast. Chris Rock stars as the eldest son of the recently deceased, and attempts to keep things together while crazy revelations threaten to turn the funeral upside down.

What do the critics have to say?[tomatometer]MuzeID=1212698[/tomatometer]Clash of the TitansThe original Clash of the Titans was campy, goofy, and plenty of fun — partly because of the charmingly lo-fi special effects. However, critics say the big-budget remake lacks the joie de vivre of the original, and it makes poor use of its strong cast and its post-production 3D. Sam Worthington stars as Perseus, a demi-god who embarks on a journey to stop Hades (Ralph Fiennes) from conquering Zeus (Liam Neeson). Along the way, demons are slain and Krakens are released. The pundits say this is an unfortunately somber affair, in which great actors are given the silliest dialogue in many a moon and the CGI effects overwhelm the storytelling. (Check out this week’s Total Recall, in which we count down star Liam Neeson’s best-reviewed movies.)[tomatometer]MuzeID=1226674[/tomatometer]The Last SongMiley Cyrus can’t play Hannah Montana forever, so what better way to take baby steps toward an adult film career is there than starring in a Nicholas Sparks movie? Unfortunately, critics say Cyrus’ showcase, The Last Song, is a bland, bloodless weepie that overdoses on melodrama and musical montages. Cyrus stars as a teenager spending the summer with her estranged father (Greg Kinnear). Will she learn to love her father? Will she meet a hunky guy? Will tragedy strike? The pundits say The Last Song hits all the typical marks of a Sparks yarn, but its drama is perfunctory and Cyrus brings little to the table beyond likeability.[tomatometer]MuzeID=1210444[/tomatometer]Tyler Perry’s Why Did I Get Married TooAt this point, we know the drill: a new Tyler Perry movie gets released without being screened for critics beforehand and goes on to make truckloads of money despite mixed-to-negative reviews.

What do the critics have to say?[tomatometer]MuzeID=1202804[/tomatometer]Green ZoneAt their best, the Bourne movies were models of mainstream filmmaking — intelligent, suspenseful, and timely. However, critics say that if you got a little queasy with those films’ use of the shaky-cam, you’ll need a suitcase full of Dramamine for Green Zone, Matt Damon and Paul Greengrass‘ latest collaboration. Damon stars as an Army inspector in Bagdad in the early days of the Iraq War, on the trail of those pesky weapons of mass destruction. What he finds instead is a hotbed of intrigue, with various officials spinning the truth. The pundits say Green Zone is smarter than average, and features typically assured work from Damon. However, others say it feels a bit stale and simplistic, and its overdone technique does the material few favors. (Check out this week’s Total Recall, in which we count down Damon’s best-reviewed films.)[tomatometer]MuzeID=1208134[/tomatometer]She’s Out of My LeagueCan a dorky guy and a smoking-hot girl find love? This central conceit has been the basis for a number of comedies. She’s Out of My League, critics say, is periodically funnier and more insightful than most — until it gets bogged down in excessive vulgarity and buffoonish behavior. Kirk (Jay Baruchel) is an average Joe who, after a meet-cute, finds himself dating the stunning Molly (Alice Eve), much to the incredulity of Kirk’s friends and family. Is love truly blind? Maybe so, pundits say, but She’s Out of My League is often (tone-) deaf, squandering its smarter-than-average moments by taking the low road once too often.[tomatometer]MuzeID=1211619[/tomatometer]Remember MeNobody can blame Robert Pattinson for trying to stretch beyond the sparkly confines of Twilight-land. However, critics say he’s going to have to find better vehicles than Remember Me, a so-so romantic drama with a tasteless final twist. Random happenstance unites Tyler (Pattinson) and Ally (Emilie de Ravin), two young New Yorkers with family issues — and more baggage than LaGuardia. Can these crazy kids make it work? Unfortunately, pundits say Remember Me isn’t elevated by its likable leads — it’s mannered and sluggish, and the film’s finale is just… wrong.[tomatometer]MuzeID=10012193[/tomatometer]Our Family WeddingWeddings are usually joyous occasions, but they can also bring out the worst in people. Our Family Wedding attempts to mine this territory for laughs, but critics say it’s mostly an implausible, laugh-free affair. Mexican-American Lucia (America Ferrera) and African-American Marcus (Lance Gross) are deeply in love, but their families aren’t as smitten with one another, tossing bitter insults in lieu of rice. The pundits say whatever humor could be derived from this promising scenario — and the film’s stellar players — is strenuously avoided, with crassness and broad contrivance carrying the day.Also opening this week in limited release:Bong Joon-ho’s Mother, a drama about a woman fighting for her mentally impaired son, is at 87 percent.Children of Invention, about a single mother who gets mixed up in some financial crimes, is at 83 percent.The Exploding Girl, starring Zoe Kazan as a young woman in the midst of a romantic breakdown, is at 67 percent.The Romanian import Delta, about a complex relationship between a long-lost pair of siblings, is at 67 percent.Tales from the Script, a doc in which a group of distinguished screenwriters talk about their trade, is at 63 percent.Stolen, starring Josh Lucas and Jon Hamm as two men looking for their missing sons, is at zero percent.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"laika, doctor, actors, awards","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Critics-Consensus-Green-Zone-Feels-Stale"},{"id":"47508790799118","title":"Critics Consensus: Daybreakers Has Bite","content":"Critics Consensusvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Critics Consensus: Daybreakers Has BitePlus, scratch Leap Year from you calendar, and Youth in Revolt is a clever lark.by Tim Ryan | January 7, 2010 |  CommentsThis week at the movies, we’ve got a vampire virus (Daybreakers, starring Ethan Hawke and Willem Dafoe); a romantic road trip (Leap Year, starring Amy Adams and Matthew Goode); and a teenage wasteland (Youth in Revolt, starring Michael Cera and Portia Doubleday). What do the critics have to say?[tomatometer]MuzeID=1188656[/tomatometer]DaybreakersGiven the recent glut of vampire flicks, Daybreakers needs a little something extra to stand out — a healthy dose of dystopia, maybe? Well, critics say the result is a skillful B-movie that should please both horror and action fans. Ethan Hawke stars as a scientist who’s desperately working on a substitute for blood — which is essential, since the world’s human population is dying off and being replaced by O positive-thirsty vampires. He soon joins a group of humans who are forming an underground resistance to the bloodsucking majority. The pundits say Daybreakers is smart, atmospheric, and energetic, and if it doesn’t fully live up to its strong premise, it’s still a better-than-average horror/action picture.[tomatometer]MuzeID=10011994[/tomatometer]Leap YearAmy Adams is darned likable. However, critics say her winsome screen presence can only go so far in redeeming the predictable, laugh-deficient romantic comedy Leap Year. Adams stars as Anna, who decides to travel to Dublin to pop the question to her dithering long-term boyfriend. However, after travel problems, she’s forced to make the trek with good-looking but combative Declan (Matthew Goode). Will these crazy kids find love along the way? The pundits say Leap Year wastes the charm of its leads on a bland, unfunny, utterly generic story. Check out this week’s Total Recall, in which we count down Adams’ best-reviewed films.)[tomatometer]MuzeID=1200671[/tomatometer]Youth in RevoltNobody plays a sensitive nebbish quite like Michael Cera. But can he play cool? Smooth? The critics say Youth in Revolt benefits greatly from a strong dual performance from Cera, and the result is a funny, charming comic lark. Cera stars as Nick Twisp, a precocious teenager who becomes enamored with dreamgirl Sheeni (Portia Doubleday). However, she’s more into bad boys, so Twisp concocts a roguish, devil-may-care alter ego, Francois Dillinger, in order to win her. The pundits say Cera shows interesting range, and Doubleday has the potential to be a big star, even if Youth in Revolt occasionally lapses into predictability.Also opening this week in limited release:Sweetgrass, a picturesque documentary about modern-day cowboys in Montana, is at 92 percent.Bitch Slap, an exploitation film homage/parody about three bad girls who’ve run afoul of a criminal syndicate, is at 40 percent.Wonderful World, starring Matthew Broderick in a dramedy about a washed-up children’s entertainer who learns to lighten up, is at 30 percent.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"natural, doctor, American, stoner, saw, Guide, composers, Rocketman","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Critics-Consensus-Daybreakers-Has-Bite"},{"id":"47508792315675","title":"Critics Consensus: Retreat From Couples Retreat","content":"Critics Consensusvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Critics Consensus: Retreat From Couples RetreatPlus, The Damned United, Good Hair, and An Education earn high marks.by Tim Ryan | October 8, 2009 |  CommentsThis week at the movies brings only one wide release: Couples Retreat, starring Vince Vaughn and Kristen Bell in a comedy about a group of friends in marriage counseling in a tropical locale. What do the critics have to say?[tomatometer]MuzeID=10010502[/tomatometer]Couples RetreatCouples Retreat contains some of the funniest actors in the business, and is set in a lush island paradise. Sounds like the recipe for a good time, right? Unfortunately, the critics say Couples Retreat is essentially a series of gags sorely in need of some over-arching comic discipline. Jason Bateman and Kristen Bell star as a couple whose relationship is in trouble, so they invite a group of married friends (including Vince Vaughn, Jon Farveau, Kristen Davis, and Malin Ackerman) to a resort for their counseling sessions — and it turns out the whole gang is required to undergo treatment as well. Hilarity ensues. Or, as the pundits say, it doesn’t; the script doesn’t give its talented actors much to do, and so despite the occasionally funny line, the characters are too underdeveloped for much comedic momentum to build. (Check out this week’s Total Recall, in which we count down Vaughn’s best-reviewed films, as well as director Peter Billingsley‘s Five Favorite Films).Also opening this week in limited release:The Damned United, starring Michael Sheen as Brian Clough, the legendary manager of the English soccer team Leeds United, is at 91 percent.Good Hair, a documentary in which Chris Rock explores complex relationship between African Americans and their hair, is at 88 percent.An Education, starring Peter Sarsgaard and Carey Mulligan in a Nick Hornby-scripted drama about an ambitious young woman whose life changes when she falls for an older man, is at 83 percent.The Yes Men Fix the World, a gonzo documentary starring the titular political pranksters, is at 81 percent.Araya, a rediscovered 1959 drama about menial laborers in Venezuela, is at 80 percent.Bronson, a dark comedy about the famous jailbird of the same name, is at 74 percent.Peter and Vandy, a dramedy that follows a young couple in various stages of their relationship, is at 64 percent.Adventures of Power, starring Ari Gold and Michael McKean in an indie comedy about a wannabe air-drummer, is at 17 percent.Free Style, starring High School Musical‘s Corbin Bleu as an aspiring motocross racer, is at 11 percent.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"Quiz, versus, RT21, jones","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Critics-Consensus-Retreat-From-Couples-Retreat"},{"id":"47508792310552","title":"Critics Consensus: This Is It Is Certified Fresh","content":"Critics Consensusvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Critics Consensus: This Is It Is Certified FreshPlus, Boondock Saints sins, and The House of the Devil chills.by Tim Ryan | October 29, 2009 |  CommentsThis week at the movies brings only one wide release: the hotly-anticipated performance documentary Michael Jackson’s This Is It, which captures the King of Pop in rehearsals for what was to be a comeback tour. What do the critics have to say?[tomatometer]MuzeID=1218058[/tomatometer]Michael Jackson’s This Is ItBefore its release, it was difficult to escape the notion that Michael Jackson’s This Is It was little more than a cynical cash-grab — an attempt to strike at the wallets of the great star’s fans after his death precluded a potentially lucrative concert tour. Such concerns may have been unwarranted, however; now that the film’s actually here, the critics say it’s an intriguing portrait of the artist at work, and a reminder of Jackson‘s protean talents, as well as a farewell gift to fans. High School Musical helmer Kenny Ortega crafted this feature from more than 100 hours of rehearsal footage for Jackson’s comeback tour. The pundits say that if the Certified Fresh This Is It is short on revelations, it’s got plenty of electrifying performances, and it provides an interesting look at the King of Pop’s working methods.Also opening this week in limited release:Skin, starring Sophie Okonedo and Sam Neill in the based-on-a-true-story of a black woman raised by white parents in Apartheid-era South Africa, is at 89 percent.The House of the Devil, a throwback to 1980s-style horror flicks about a coed babysitter who gets in over her head, is at 84 percent.Boondock Saints II: All Saints Day, Troy Duffy‘s follow-up to the 2000 cult hit starring Sean Patrick Flanery and Norman Reedus, is at 25 percent.Jared Hess‘ Gentlemen Broncos, about a creative writing novice whose story is ripped off by a famous sci-fi author, is at 13 percent.Finally, props to Chris89 for coming the closest to guessing Saw IV‘s 45 percent Tomatometer.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"DGA, service, Games, ESPN, deadpool, BET, WGN, Hallmark, richard","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"critics-consensus-this-is-it-is-certified-fresh"},{"id":"47508792304404","title":"Critics Consensus: Flee From Ninja Assassin","content":"Critics Consensusvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Critics Consensus: Flee From Ninja AssassinPlus, Old Dogs is in need of new tricks, and The Road is a trip worth taking.by Tim Ryan | November 24, 2009 |  CommentsThis week at the movies, we’ve got martial arts mayhem (Ninja Assassin, starring Rain and Naomie Harris); family-friendly hi jinks (Old Dogs, starring John Travolta and Robin Williams); and a post-apocalyptic trek (The Road, starring Viggo Mortensen and Charlize Theron). What do the critics have to say?[tomatometer]MuzeID=1198524[/tomatometer]Ninja AssassinWhat we want from a movie called Ninja Assassin is simple: amazing stunts and killer fight scenes. That isn’t too much to ask, is it? Unfortunately, the answer is yes, say critics, who feel that Ninja Assassin‘s thrills aren’t just cheap – they’re low-grade. South Korean pop star Rain is Raizo, an efficient assassin who’s betrayed by his clan, and teams up with an international cop named Mika (Naomie Harris) to bring them down. The pundits say the plot and characters are forgettable, but the big problem is that director James McTeigue edits the fight scenes down to the bone, so it’s often difficult to tell what’s happening.[tomatometer]MuzeID=1207970[/tomatometer]Old DogsSlapstick is one of the hardest of comedic techniques to pull off, and when it fails, it can be brutal. Such is the issue with Old Dogs, critics say; the talented cast is game, but everyone’s trying so hard to generate laughs where there are none to be found that things go south in a hurry. John Travolta and Robin Williams star as a pair of old buddies who find themselves doing the unthinkable – caring for a set of twins just as a big business deal is about to happen. Life lessons and pratfalls ensue. The pundits say Old Dogs is predictable, overly broad, and tonally inconsistent to the point of tedium. (Check out this week’s Total Recall, in which we run down Travolta’s best-reviewed films.)[tomatometer]MuzeID=1200886[/tomatometer]The RoadOnce No Country for Old Men won Best Picture, it was only a matter of time before Cormac McCarthy’s other works would be adapted for the screen. And critics say that The Road, though unrelentingly grim and literal-minded, is still a very good movie version of McCarthy’s prose. Viggo Mortensen stars as a man who’s struggling for survival as he and his son trek across a post-apocalyptic American wasteland, populated only with cannibals and the desperate. The pundits say this is by no means a good time at the movies, but it’s beautifully shot, often moving, and features a fine performance from Mortensen.Also opening this week in limited release:The Swiss import Home, starring Isabelle Huppert in a drama about a family that’s profoundly disturbed when a highway is built near its property, is at 94 percent.The Princess and the Frog, based on the fairy tale and marking Disney’s return to hand-drawn animation, is at 83 percent.The Private Lives of Pippa Lee, starring Robin Wright Penn and Alan Arkin in a drama about a woman whose outward perfection contains hidden struggles, is at 78 percent.Richard Linklater’s Me and Orson Welles, starring Zac Efron and Claire Danes in a backstage drama about the great director’s staging of Julius Caesar, is at 74 percent.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"new, prank, documentaries, dark, FX, Summer, Drama, Annual, The, camera, Action, dramedy, Walt, harry, Us","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Critics-Consensus-Flee-From-Ninja-Assassin"},{"id":"47508792305429","title":"Critics Consensus: New Moon Wanes","content":"Critics Consensusvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Critics Consensus: New Moon WanesPlus, The Blind Side has its moments, and Planet 51 is lost in space.by Tim Ryan | November 19, 2009 |  CommentsThis week at the movies, we’ve got hot teen vampires (The Twilight Saga: New Moon, starring Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson); a football family (The Blind Side, starring Sandra Bullock and Quinton Aaron); and some interplanetary mishaps (Planet 51, with voice work by Dwayne Johnson and Jessica Biel). What do the critics have to say?[tomatometer]MuzeID=1206167[/tomatometer]The Twilight Saga: New MoonOk, Twihards, we all know you’ve already bought your tickets to New Moon, so you don’t care about what the critics have to say. However, for the uninitiated, the scribes offer few saving graces to this second installment of the teenage vampire chronicle. Kristen Stewart is back as Bella Swan, but this time she’s on the outs with blood-sucking Edward Cullen (Robert Pattinson). She falls into the arms of Jacob Black (Taylor Lautner), who, needless to say, has some secrets of his own. The pundits say that diehards will swoon, but everyone else will be mystified, since New Moon is turgidly paced, unevenly acted, often unintentionally hilarious. (Check out all our New Moon-related features at RT’sTwilight Corner.)[tomatometer]MuzeID=1212694[/tomatometer]The Blind SideJust when you think every last inspirational based-on-true-events sports story has been adapted for the screen, along comes The Blind Side. And though critics say it has plenty of problems, they also say it’s well-crafted and sharply acted. Quinton Aaron stars as a troubled high school football star who’s taken in by an affluent suburban family; naturally, lessons are learned on and off the field. Some pundits say Sandra Bullock is excellent as the family matriarch, and Aaron shines as well – both infuse a formulaic plot with plenty of humanity. However, others feel the film is overly schmaltzy and doesn’t fully address the tricky racial issues at the heart of the story.[tomatometer]MuzeID=1200415[/tomatometer]Planet 51It seems obvious, but we’ll say it again: animated features need more than great visuals to work – they also need strong stories. Unfortunately, critics say Planet 51 is mighty short on plot, along with a whole lot of other virtues. Dwayne Johnson stars as an astronaut who lands on a faraway planet and soon discovers he’s not alone: this strange world looks like 1950s America, only with little green men. The pundits say Planet 51 apes classic sci-fi flicks without adding much in the way of wit or satire; in addition, it’s flatly-paced and has a strange, off-putting preoccupation with bodily functions.Also opening this week in limited release:Defamation, a documentary about anti-Semitism in the present day, is at 100 percent.Bad Lieutenant: Port of Call New Orleans, starring Nicolas Cage and Eva Mendes in a darkly funny tale of a cop on the brink, is at 89 percent (check out director Werner Herzog’s Five Favorite Films here).The Sun, a drama about the Japanese Emperor Hirohito in the last days of World War II, is at 90 percent.John Woo‘s Red Cliff, starring Tony Leung in an epic drama about the last days of the Han Dynasty, is at 88 percent.Pedro Almodóvar‘s Broken Embraces, starring Penelope Cruz in the story of a filmmaker who lives a dual existence, is at 78 percent.Mammoth, starring Michelle Williams and Gael Garcia Bernal as a successful couple who get caught up in the dark side of globalization, is at 56 percent.The Missing Person, starring Michael Shannon and Amy Ryan in a neo-noir about a private detective on the trail of a man with a strange identity, is at 38 percent.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"war, sequels, harry, Election, television, on, romantic, Christmas, Disney, elevated, 2021","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Critics-Consensus-New-Moon-Wanes"},{"id":"47508792309527","title":"Critics Consensus: A Christmas Carol Dazzles But Disappoints","content":"Critics Consensusvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Critics Consensus: A Christmas Carol Dazzles But DisappointsPlus, The Box is a mixed bag, The Fourth Kind is lost in space, and Goats is worth a look.by Tim Ryan | November 5, 2009 |  CommentsThis week at the movies, we’ve got some modern-day Dickens (Disney’s A Christmas Carol, starring Jim Carrey and Gary Oldman); a button-pushing thriller (The Box, starring Cameron Diaz and James Marsden); vanishing Alaskans (The Fourth Kind, starring Milla Jovovich and Elias Koteas); and some psychic soldiers (The Men Who Stare at Goats, starring George Clooney and Jeff Bridges). What do the critics have to say?[tomatometer]MuzeID=1203102[/tomatometer]Disney’s A Christmas CarolCharles Dickens’ A Christmas Carol is one of literature’s most haunting morality tales — and one of the most adapted. Critics are largely split on two key aspects of Robert Zemeckis’ motion-capture version starring Jim Carrey: whether it honors the, ahem, spirit of Dickens’ classic, and whether the motion-capture technology is aesthetically appealing. No need to rehash the plot; if you’ve never heard the tale of mean ol’ Ebenezer Scrooge (Carrey) and his long-suffering employee Bob Cratchit (Gary Oldman), get thee to a library immediately. While some find Zemeckis’ live action/animation hybrid an echanting way of updating a seasonal classic, others feel the visuals bog down the classic tale with an overabundance of empty action.[tomatometer]MuzeID=1189532[/tomatometer]The BoxRichard Kelly has only made three films, but he’s had a roller-coaster of a career. His debut was the cult-fave Donnie Darko, which was followed by the ambitious but roundly-panned Southland Tales. Now comes his latest mind twister The Box, which is splitting critics; some say it’s an intriguing head trip, while others say it’s preposterous and inconsistent. Cameron Diaz and James Marsden play a married couple presented with a mysterious proposition from a stranger: there’s a button in a box, and if they push it, they will receive a million dollars, but someone will die. Some pundits say The Box is tense, edgy, and original, while others deride its plot holes and lack of overall cohesion. (Check out Kelly’s Five Favorite Films here.)[tomatometer]MuzeID=1209302[/tomatometer]The Fourth KindWith its combination of a government conspiracy, extraterrestrial visitors, and the foreboding climes of Alaska, The Fourth Kind seemingly has all the elements in place for a gripping horror flick. Too bad the execution’s so clumsy, critics say. Milla Jovovich stars as a shrink whose patients all tell her similar tales of nighttime frights; could aliens be to blame? The pundits say The Fourth Kind has some decent shocks, but its gimmicky presentation — a split screen technique in which patients describe their experiences alongside pseudo-documentary footage of the events — doesn’t quite come off, and the performances are uneven.[tomatometer]MuzeID=1217605[/tomatometer]The Men Who Stare at GoatsFor the most part, the recent wave of Iraq war films has brought downbeat dramas, so the satirical aim of The Men Who Stare at Goats is certainly welcome. And critics say that the film, though scattershot, has moments of brilliant absurdist humor. Hinting that its story is not terribly far from the truth, Goats is the tale of a secret military program that involves the use of psychics who attempt to use their mind power to defeat the enemy. The pundits say the film is elevated by the deadpan comic presence of George Clooney, and if the film never fully comes together, many of its scenes are sharp and funny.

What do the critics have to say?[tomatometer]MuzeID=1207968[/tomatometer]SurrogatesSurrogates was barely screened for critics prior to its release, which is usually a bad sign. However, those who have seen the film say it’s a decent dystopian sci-fi flick, filled with enough fast-paced action to distract audiences from its cliches. Bruce Willis and Radha Mitchell star as FBI agents who, in the course of solving a murder, stumble upon a vast clone-manufacturing operation. The pundits say Surrogates is visually sleek and exciting, as long as you don’t think too hard about the leaps in logic. (And don’t forget to check out this week’s Total Recall, in which we count down Bruce Willis’ best-reviewed films.)[tomatometer]MuzeID=10011235[/tomatometer]FameGiven the massive popularity of the High School Musical franchise, it was probably inevitable that Fame would get dusted off and remade. However, critics mostly wish it could be reworked with more passion and inspiration than this tepid, chaste treatment. As with the original, Fame follows the trials and tribulations of students at the New York City High School of Performing Arts. Lessons are learned, self-doubts are faced, songs are sung. The pundits say that while the original attempted to deal with important social issues while delivering show-stopping numbers, this new version is far less ambitious, featuring tepid set pieces and skin-deep characterization.[tomatometer]MuzeID=10010595[/tomatometer]PandorumIt appears that the folks behind Pandorum feared that allowing the critics to see their film would open a Pandora’s box, since it wasn’t screened prior to release.

Guess the Tomatometer![tomatometer]MuzeID=1205488[/tomatometer]Taking WoodstockDepending on who you ask, the Woodstock Music &amp; Art Fair was either a beautiful, generation-defining cultural touchstone or an overrated, muddy bummer — or perhaps a bit of both. One thing’s for sure: the mother of all rock fests has been amply documented (most notably by Michael Wadleigh in his acclaimed documentary Woodstock), and critics say the versatile Ang Lee deserves credit for his approach in Taking Woodstock; he focuses on the attendees and eschews the musical performances. However, most say this gentle, amiable film is too mired in nostalgia. The film stars Demetri Martin as Elliot Tiber, whose family hotel provided a base of operations for the fest’s organizers; soon, Tiber finds himself in the midst of free thinking hippies and changing times. The pundits say Taking Woodstock captures the good vibes of the era, but misses the bigger picture, and relies too heavily on clichés to be anything more than likeable.Also opening this week in limited release:Hirokazu Kore-eda‘s Still Walking, a gentle drama about a recently married middle aged man and his interactions with his parents, is at 100 percent.At the Edge of the World, a documentary about attempts by activists to stop a whaling fleet near the South Pole, is at 100 percent.Motherland, a doc about a group of grieving women who volunteer at a school in South Africa, is at 100 percent.We Live in Public, a doc about Internet pioneer Josh Harris, is at 89 percent.Big Fan, starring Patton Oswalt as a die-hard New York Giants fanatic whose life takes a dark turn, is at 87 percent.The September Issue, a behind the scenes look at Vogue’s editorial process, is at 86 percent.This Beautiful City, in which the lives of a disparate cross-section of Toronto residents intersect, is at 20 percent.Play the Game, starring Andy Griffith as a retirement home Casanova, is at 11 percent.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"El, streaming, Lionsgate, sports, Biopics, comedy, Showtime, historical","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Critics-Consensus-Guess-Halloween-2s-Tomatometer"},{"id":"47508793842474","title":"Critics Consensus: Transformers 2 Is Less Than Meets The Eye","content":"Critics Consensusvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Critics Consensus: Transformers 2 Is Less Than Meets The EyePlus, My Sister's Keeper is well-acted but manipulative, and The Hurt Locker is powerful and vital.by Tim Ryan | June 25, 2009 |  CommentsThis week at the movies, we’ve got robots in disguise (Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen, starring Megan Fox and Shia LaBeouf) and an engagement of convenience (My Sister’s Keeper, starring Cameron Diaz and Abigail Breslin). What do the critics have to say? 20%Transformers: Revenge of the FallenMost folks like their blockbusters big, loud, and loaded with spectacle. However, the masses also tend to enjoy good characters and some semblance of a plot, two things the pundits say are sorely missing from Michael Bay‘s Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen. This follow up to 2007’s Transformers finds the Autobots waging a battle to destroy the evil forces of the Decepticons (with help from Megan Fox and Shia LaBeouf), since they have designs on obliterating Earth. Critics say Revenge has a lot of problems: it’s loud, it’s bombastic, it’s way to long, it contains few recognizable human emotions, and its plot is borderline incomprehensible. Worst of all, they say, it’s not particularly fun. (Check out this week’s Total Recall, in which we count down the top 50 movie robots of all time, and our primer on Revenge of the Fallen‘s bots.) 48%My Sister’s KeeperA lot of movies walk a fine line between being emotionally involving and seeming merely manipulative, and critics are essentially split on which side My Sister’s Keeper falls. Cameron Diaz stars as a woman whose daughter Anna (Abigail Breslin) is born as a genetic match with her leukemia-afflicted older sister Kate (Sofia Vassilieva). When, at 11, Anna is called upon to provide a kidney for Kate, she sues her parents for medical independence. Some critics say My Sister’s Keeper is bolstered by outstanding performances and a sense of moral complexity. However, others say this three-hankie weepie doesn’t fully earn its tears, resorting to unconvincing plot machinations..)Also opening this week in limited release:Afghan Star, a documentary about an American Idol-esque singing competition with a bit more at stake, is at 100 percent.The Hurt Locker, Kathryn Bigelow‘s Iraq War drama about three explosives experts, is at 97 percent (check out some exclusive clips from the movie).Quiet Chaos, a subtle drama about a grieving Italian widower, is at 86 percent.Jennifer Lynch‘s Surveillance, starring Bill Pullman and Julia Ormond as a pair of feds who must solve a string of vicious murders, is at 77 percent.Stephen Frears‘s Cheri, starring Michelle Pfeiffer iin a period melodrama based on a Colette novel, is at 55 percent.The Stoning of Soraya M., a drama about an Iranian village’s punishment of an innocent woman, is at 47 percent.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"Cinematographers, History, DirecTV","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Critics-Consensus-Transformers-2-Is-Less-Than-Meets-The-Eye"},{"id":"47508793824032","title":"Critics Consensus: Despite Laughs, Extract Isn’t Quite Potent Enough","content":"Critics Consensusvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Critics Consensus: Despite Laughs, Extract Isn't Quite Potent EnoughPlus, All About Steve is floundering, while Gamer has yet to receive a review.by Tim Ryan | September 3, 2009 |  CommentsThis week at the movies, we’ve got a wacky workplace (Extract, starring Jason Bateman and Ben Affleck), crazy love (All About Steve, starring Sandra Bullock and Bradley Cooper), and video game violence (Gamer, starring Gerard Butler and Ludacris). What do the critics have to say?[tomatometer]MuzeID=1211183[/tomatometer]ExtractMike Judge is one of contemporary cinema’s finest chroniclers of the working life — and what a madhouse it can be. His first feature, Office Space, was a riotous exercise in workplace absurdity, but critics say his latest, Extract, isn’t quite as funny — or as insightful. Jason Bateman stars as the owner of a flavoring factory with plenty on his mind: his wife’s affections are waning, one of his employees has suffered a cringe-worthy injury, and his best pay gives him questionable advice, usually while under the influence. The pundits say Extract has some very funny moments and several fine performances, but overall, the film feels slighter and more uneven than Judge’s previous work.[tomatometer]MuzeID=1202106[/tomatometer]All About SteveSandra Bullock’s pure likability has elevated plenty of so-so romantic comedies, but she can’t always overcome the deficiencies of a terrible script. Case in point: All About Steve, which critics describe as one of the worst in the actress’ solid career. Bullock stars as a woman who falls head-over-heals for a TV cameraman (Bradley Cooper) after a single blind date and proceeds to follow him around the country. The pundits say All About Steve is an oddly creepy, sour film, featuring a heroine so desperate and peculiar that audiences may be more likely to pity than root for her. (Also, be sure to check out our rundown of the Best Stalker Movies in this week’s Total Recall.)[tomatometer]MuzeID=1194212[/tomatometer]GamerIt appears the folks behind Gamer are afraid that it’s the cinematic equivalent to the N-Gage, since it wasn’t screened for critics prior to release.

What do the critics have to say?[tomatometer]MuzeID=1190668[/tomatometer]District 9The summer movie season may be winding down, but it still has some thrills in store. Exhibit A: District 9, a sci-fi/action flick that critics say is uncommonly thoughtful – and intense. Set in an alternate-reality South Africa, District 9 is the story of a group of aliens who have been quarantined and victimized by prejudice and hatred from human oppressors. But why? It turns out the aliens have something the humans want to get their hands on – weapons of war. The pundits say District 9 is both a potent allegory and an exhilarating action film, with outstanding performances and an uneasy sense of reality. District 9 isn’t just Certified Fresh, it’s also one of the best-reviewed wide releases of the year.[tomatometer]MuzeID=1195105[/tomatometer]BandslamBandslam is a Disney film about awkward teens who find themselves through the transformative power of music. Sound familiar? Well, critics say this high school musical is a surprise, with more wit and bite than one would expect. Gaelan Connell stars as a David Bowie-obsessed kid who’s asked to manage the band of a would-be singer-songwriter (Alyson Michalka). Will falls for one of the band’s new members (Vanessa Hudgens), and finds he must navigate the minefield of his emotions while preparing his charges for a battle of the bands. The pundits say Bandslam isn’t the most original film on the block, but the performances are uniformly strong, and the movie manages to be emotionally true while slightly tweaking teen movie tropes.[tomatometer]MuzeID=1202312[/tomatometer]PonyoHayao Miyazaki is already one of the most celebrated filmmakers in Japan, and the legendary animation director has achieved some success outside his home country with films like Princess Mononoke and Spirited Away, which won the 2002 Oscar for Best Animated Feature. This weekend, with Disney’s enthusiastic support, Miyazaki introduces American audiences to his latest, Ponyo, and critics have so far embraced the film. Ponyo is a loose adaptation of Hans Christian Andersen’s The Little Mermaid and centers on a young goldfish who embarks on a quest to become human. Miyazaki’s trademark stunning artwork and animation are on full display here, say critics, and the film delights in its sense of wonderment and sweet energy. Ponyo is Certified Fresh. (Check out our Tomatometer retrospective of Miyazaki’s filmography in this week’s Total Recall.)[tomatometer]MuzeID=1187891[/tomatometer]The Time Traveler’s WifeTime travel is a dicey premise to employ when telling a story, and while some find success in bringing a film to life through this mechanism, others are unable to overcome its inherent obstacles. Unfortunately for The Time Traveler’s Wife, critics are largely classifying the film as the latter. Based on Audrey Niffenegger’s best-selling novel, Wife stars Eric Bana and Rachel McAdams as a star-crossed couple whose love must withstand a genetic anomaly that causes Bana’s character to hop unpredictably through time to different periods of his own life. While sentimental and endearing, critics say the film’s plot contrivances and lack of narrative logic ultimately hamper its effectiveness.[tomatometer]MuzeID=1193000[/tomatometer]The Goods: Live Hard, Sell HardThe Goods: Live Hard, Sell Hard would seem to have everything in place to generate laughs: it’s a raunch-fest about used car salesmen, with an embarrassment of comedic talent in its cast. Unfortunately, critics say The Goods ends up being a hard sell, with an erratic tone and too many gags that fall flat. Jeremy Piven stars as Don Ready, a master salesman who’s called in to save a failing used car dealership. He and his charges prove to be masters at moving clunkers, but Don soon finds there’s more to life than just selling. The pundits say The Goods has its moments, but it’s largely a missed opportunity, succumbing to a juvenile, crass sensibility and a lack of comic focus.Also opening this week in limited release:Yasukuni, a documentary about Japan’s complex relationship with its involvement in World War II, is at 100 percent.The German import Cloud 9, about a passionate affair between a pair of seniors, is at 90 percent.It Might Get Loud, a documentary about the majesty of the electric guitar featuring Jimmy Page, the Edge, and Jack White, is at 79 percent.Taxidermia, a disturbing, visually striking drama about the limits of the human body, is at 76 percent.Earth Days, a doc about the early days of the environmental movement, is at 67 percent.Grace, a horror film about a woman who’s pregnant with a particularly odd child, is at 64 percent.Mein Fuhrer: The Truly Truest Truth About Adolf Hitler, a German spoof of the dictator’s final days, is at 56 percent.Spread, starring Ashton Kutcher and Anne Heche in a dramedy about a shameless lothario who meets his match, is at 33 percent.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"Sundance, Paquin","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"critics-consensus-district-9-is-certified-fresh"},{"id":"47508793835302","title":"Critics Consensus: Orphan Is Mixed Bag","content":"Critics Consensusvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Critics Consensus: Orphan Is Mixed BagPlus, The Ugly Truth ain't pretty, and G-Force doesn't accomplish its mission.by Tim Ryan | July 23, 2009 |  CommentsThis week at the movies, we’ve got an evil adoptee (Orphan, starring Vera Farmiga and Peter Sarsgaard), a battle of the sexes (The Ugly Truth, starring Katherine Heigl and Gerard Butler), and some powerful guinea pigs (G-Force, with voice work by Nicolas Cage and Penelope Cruz). What do the critics have to say?[tomatometer]MuzeID=1207460[/tomatometer]OrphanIt’s been a while since we’ve had a little-kid-is-pure-evil horror flick. And the pundits say that Orphan, while derivative and overly dependent on false scares, is better-crafted and smarter than average. Vera Farmiga and Peter Sarsgaard star as Kate and John, a couple that adopts a little girl named Esther (Isabelle Fuhrman). She’s oddly precocious, but soon, sinister events make Kate question who she is and where she came from. The pundits say The Orphan too often relies on jolts rather than tension, and features too many characters who are blind to the terror around them. But others say it’s a well-made, moody throwback that features fine performances and a forboding sense of doom. (Check out this week’s Total Recall, in which we count down cinema’s most evil children.)[tomatometer]MuzeID=10010453[/tomatometer]The Ugly TruthNews flash: Women are looking for deep, meaningful relationships, while men are cretinous pigs. That’s the premise of The Ugly Truth, which critics say is labored, clichéd, and overly raunchy. Katherine Heigl stars as a TV morning show producer who’s frustrated both professionally and romantically; when her station hires a sexist loudmouth (Gerard Butler) to dish out relationship pointers, she’s appalled at first, but soon finds herself following his advice. The pundits say The Ugly Truth seldom deviates from the romantic comedy playbook, offering forced comic setups and stereotypical characters.[tomatometer]MuzeID=10009462[/tomatometer]G-ForceG-Force is the tale of four super-intelligent special agents who have been tasked with saving the world. Oh, and they happen to be guinea pigs. It’s an inspired setup, but critics say G-Force is merely content to assault the senses, not create memorable characters or an involving plot. The film follows our tiny heroes, who are part of a secret government program that trains animals in the art of espionage; this fearsome foursome must save the planet from an evil industrialist bent on global domination. The pundits say G-Force is mostly uninspired, relying on obvious pop-culture references, spastic action, and so-so CGI effects.Also opening this week in limited release:California Company Town, a documentary about communities in the Golden State that have become abandoned once their primary economic focus dried up, is at 100 percent.In the Loop, an Iraq war farce about a miscommunication that leads to attack by U.S. and British forces, is at 93 percent.The English Surgeon, a documentary about a London neurosurgeon who treats patients in Ukraine with little access to modern healthcare, is at 90 percent.Import/Export, a drama about two European victims of the economic downturn, is at 80 percent.The Answer Man, starring Jeff Daniels and Lauren Graham in a romantic comedy about a self-help author who is himself searching for truth, is at 36 percent.Shrink, starring Kevin Spacey as a Hollywood psychiatrist who’s as troubled as his patients, is at 15 percent.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"Association, America","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Critics-Consensus-Orphan-Is-Mixed-Bag"},{"id":"47508793851694","title":"Critics Consensus: Up And Drag Me to Hell Are Certified Fresh","content":"Critics Consensusvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Critics Consensus: Up And Drag Me to Hell Are Certified FreshAnd they're among the best-reviewed films of the year.by Tim Ryan | May 28, 2009 |  CommentsThis week at the movies, we’ve got a high-flying house (Up, with voice work by Ed Asner and Christopher Plummer) and a demonic curse (Drag Me to Hell, starring Alison Lohman and Justin Long).

Every one of the company’s features is Certified Fresh, and all but one is about 90 percent on the Tomatometer. But there’s a reason for such critical adulation: Pixar continues to expand the boundaries of the animation medium, and the critics say Up is yet another winner. Up is the tale of the curmudgeonly Carl Fredricksen who rigs his house with hundreds of balloons with the intention of floating to South America. Along for the ride is Russell, an irrepressible eight-year old with a jones for exploration, and together they discover strange wildlife and a talking dog. The pundits say Up is whimsical, poignant, mature, and hilarious; better still, it puts Pixar’s deft storytelling and technical skills on full display. At 97 percent on the Tomatometer, Up isn’t just Certified Fresh, it’s also one of the best-reviewed films of the year.

With Drag Me to Hell, the pundits say he’s back and in outstanding B-movie form. Alison Lohman stars as a loan officer who becomes the victim of a curse, with evil spirits on her trail and certain damnation in her future — unless she can break the spell. The critics say Drag Me to Hell is a wicked good time: blood-curdlingly scary and ghoulishly funny, it’s also taut and timely. Drag Me to Hell is Certified Fresh, and it’s the best-reviewed horror film in years.Also opening this week in limited release:Munyurangabo, a drama about two boys bridging cultural divides in post-civil war Rwanda, is at 100 percent.Pressure Cooker, a documentary about a group of culinary students at a Philadelphia high school, is at 89 percent.Pontypool, a horror film about a strange virus outbreak that spreads through language, is at 74 percent.The Academy Award winner for Best Foreign Film, Departures, about a professional cellist who becomes a funeral professional, is at 65 percent.What Goes Up, starring Steve Coogan and Hilary Duff in a drama about a journalist who visits a New Hampshire town in the wake of the space shuttle Challenger disaster, is at zero percent.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"movies, Paramount, BBC, natural, adventure, Superheroe, Creative, comic, Prime, BBC, FOX, Carpet, MTV","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"critics-consensus-up-and-drag-me-to-hell-are-certified-fresh"},{"id":"47508795339574","title":"Critics Consensus: Fast &amp; Furious Is Running On Empty","content":"Critics Consensusvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Critics Consensus: Fast &amp; Furious Is Running On EmptyAnd Adventureland proves to be a great ride.by Tim Ryan | April 2, 2009 |  CommentsThis week at the movies, we’ve got speedy cars (Fast &amp; Furious, starring Vin Diesel and Paul Walker) and a languid summer (Adventureland, starring Jesse Eisenberg and Kristen Stewart).

The principals from the first film, The Fast and the Furious — including Vin Diesel, Paul Walker, Michelle Rodriguez, and Jordana Brewster — are back, and they pick up where they left off. Diesel plays Dom, an ex-con who’s still bitter at undercover cop Brian (Paul Walker), but soon, the pair join forces to investigate the death of a mutual associate. The pundits say this franchise is running on fumes; though Fast &amp; Furious features some decent stunts, its groan-worthy dialogue, indifferent performances, and lack of dramatic momentum make for a pretty middling — albeit shiny — package. (Check out this week’s Total Recall, in which we compile Vin Diesel’s best-reviewed films.)[tomatometer]MuzeID=1196389[/tomatometer]AdventurelandGreg Mottola is building a solid rep as an astute chronicler of coming-of-age joys and pains. Hot on the heels of Superbad is Adventureland, a dramedy that critics say dishes laughs and sentiment with a deft hand. Jesse Eisenberg stars as James, a college grad who gets a job at an amusement park. With the help of Em, a cute co-worker (Kristen Stewart), his wacky bosses (Bill Hader and Kristen Wiig), and his slacker co-workers (Martin Starr, Ryan Reynolds, and others) he learns a thing or two about life.

What do the critics have to say?[tomatometer]MuzeID=1201402[/tomatometer]17 AgainIf you’ve seen Big, Back to the Future, and Peggy Sue Got Married, you’ll have a pretty good idea what’s in store with 17 Again. The good news? The critics say the film may be derivative, but it’s also clever, entertaining, and poignant, largely thanks to an impressive post-High School Musical turn from Zac Efron. He stars as Mike O’Donnell, a big man on campus circa 1989 who, 20 years later, finds his life and his marriage to high school sweetie Scarlett (Leslie Mann) on the rocks. He gets a second chance to correct his mistakes when he’s magically transformed into his 17-year-old self — albeit with his late-30s personality intact — and discovers a thing or two about life. While some critics find the film’s premise a bit unseemly (a 30-year-old bro-ing down with minors?), most say 17 Again is mostly sweet, funny, and perceptive, and that Efron has a bright future as a leading man.[tomatometer]MuzeID=1193230[/tomatometer]State of PlayThe newspaper industry is in bad shape these days, so it almost seems quaint to release a thriller about a principled investigative journalist in the midst of a vast conspiracy. But here’s a news flash: critics say State of Play is engrossing, smart, unnerving, and surprisingly timely, a tribute to the hardworking reporters that shed light on our political system. Russell Crowe stars as old-school Washington beat reporter Cal McAffrey, who’s had a solid professional rapport with up-and-coming congressman Stephen Collins (Ben Affleck) — that is, until some of Collins’ associates turn up dead. McAffrey uneasily joins forces with Della (Rachel McAdams), a blogger at the paper, to untangle a sinister web of secrets and lies. The pundits say State of Play may offer a few too many twists and turns, but its ensemble, which also includes Helen Mirren as McAffrey’s exacting editor, is unimpeachable, as is the immediacy and authenticity of the newsroom setting. State of Play is Certified Fresh.[tomatometer]MuzeID=1197533[/tomatometer]Crank High VoltageIt appears the folks behind Crank High Voltage were concerned it would make critics, ahem, cranky, because it wasn’t screened prior to release (strange, since its predecessor notched a perfectly respectable 60 percent on the Tomatometer). Jason Statham once again stars as Chev Chelios (apparently no relation to the Red Wings defenseman) whose heart is removed; he must do everything in his power to keep his battery-powered ticker going while finding his missing organ. Kids, guess that Tomatometer!

What do the critics have to say?[tomatometer]MuzeID=1205373[/tomatometer]FightingLook, you pretty much know what you’re getting into with a movie called Fighting: lots of tough-as-nails dudes beating the stuffing out of each other. And the pundits say that while director Dito Montiel does his best to infuse interesting characterization and a sense of place, Fighting is still a shopworn underdog sports movie. Channing Tatum stars as a kid who’s just arrived in New York City from Alabama; after attempting to make a living on the streets, he falls in with a sketchy character (Terrence Howard) who realizes he may be a natural fit for the world of underground bare-knuckle brawls. The pundits say Fighting is a bit better than its setup would suggest, with a good deal of energy and a dash of gritty authenticity. However, others say the performances are a mixed bag and the script is ultimately weighted down by clichés. (Check out Terrence Howard’s Five Favorite Films.)[tomatometer]MuzeID=1197228[/tomatometer]EarthThe popular award-winning BBC series Planet Earth offered some staggeringly beautiful images of life around the globe. If the small screen version was too limited to contain such visual majesty, now comes its multiplex companion: Earth, which critics say is a remarkable document with a timely message. Narrated by (who else?) James Earl Jones, Earth focuses on three mother/child relationships in the animal kingdom, following the exploits of polar bears, humpback whales, and African elephants. The pundits say Earth doesn’t offer a ton of insight, but the images on display are so gorgeous that viewers are unlikely to quibble too much. Plus, it invites audiences to reflect upon our place in the larger ecosystem. Earth is Certified Fresh.[tomatometer]MuzeID=1200804[/tomatometer]The SoloistThe Soloist tells an inspiring true story, and its stars and director are Oscar nominees. But distinguished pedigree does not a movie make, and critics say The Soloist is too uneven to fully resonate. Robert Downey Jr. stars as Steve Lopez, an LA Times reporter who befriends, and writes movingly about, a homeless, profoundly mentally ill man named Nathaniel Ayers, who was once a virtuoso cellist. The pundits say all the elements are here for a moving tale, and Downey and Foxx give it everything they’ve got; unfortunately, that’s not enough to overcome the film’s lack of focus and maudlin stretches. (Check out this week’s Total Recall, in which we count down Downey’s best-reviewed films, and find out director Joe Wright’s Five Favorite Films).[tomatometer]MuzeID=1207523[/tomatometer]ObsessedIt appears the folks behind Obsessed were dubious that critics would be, ahem, obsessed with their film. Hence, it wasn’t screened prior to its release.

What do the critics have to say?[tomatometer]MuzeID=1189217[/tomatometer]Angels &amp; DemonsThe Da Vinci Code was a worldwide phenomenon; adapted from Dan Brown’s bestseller, it raked in box office receipts despite widespread critical derision (and the threat of boycotts from Catholic groups). The good news is that critics find the follow-up, Angels &amp; Demons, to be tighter and more exciting; the bad news is that their reaction is still pretty tepid. This time out, Harvard symbologist Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks) isn’t challenging Catholic orthodoxy; he’s trying to protect church officials from attacks by the mysterious Illuminati, with help from Italian scientist Vittoria Vetra (Ayelet Zurer). The pundits say Angels &amp; Demons is briskly paced, avoiding the speechifying of the previous film while offering a picturesque tour of Rome. However, others say it’s still bogged down in absurd plotting at the expense of characterization.

What do the critics have to say?[tomatometer]MuzeID=1189045[/tomatometer]X-Men Origins: WolverineForced to choose, most X fans would select Wolverine as their favorite. Well, he’s got his very own feature film, and unfortunately, the critics say it’s a few cuts below the previous X-Men movies. In this prequel, Hugh Jackman reprises his role as the clawed, quick-healing mutant. The film follows our hero through his turbulent past, from his tours of duty in several wars to his complex, volatile relationship with his brother, Victor/Sabretooth (Liev Schreiber). The pundits say X-Men Origins: Wolverine is a step down from even X-Men: The Last Stand, with a middling story and overblown action sequences crowding out psychological nuance. (Check out our Wolverine character guide, as well as this week’s Total Recall, in which we count down every movie based on Marvel Comics characters.)[tomatometer]MuzeID=1193906[/tomatometer]Ghosts of Girlfriends PastGhosts of Girlfriends Past has a mildly intriguing premise: what if an unrepentant rake was shown the consequences of his philandering, no-strings-attached ways? (Heck, it made for a great scene in Fellini’s 8 ½). Alas, the critics say cribbing from Charles Dickens’ A Christmas Carol is about the only thing that distinguishes this thoroughly mediocre romantic comedy. Matthew McConaughey stars as Connor, a hotshot fashion photographer who’s contemptuous of his brother’s desire to settle down. He’s visited by the spirit of his Uncle Wayne (Michael Douglas), who gives him a guided tour of his failed relationships; could Jenny (Jennifer Garner), the one that got away, help him see the light? The pundits say this is a broad, unfunny romp with indifferent performances and an overall air of immaturity.[tomatometer]MuzeID=1209828[/tomatometer]Battle for TerraIf you’re looking for a kiddie sci-fi romp that will keep you involved as well, you’re in luck. Critics say Battle for Terra isn’t particularly subtle, but its heart is in the right place and it looks great. Escaping civil war and eco-disaster, the last inhabitants of Earth discover the Utopian planet of Terra. However, soon the Earthlings and Terrians, filled with mistrust, are on the verge of war; can a friendship between a Terrian girl and a human help to foster understanding? The pundits say Battle for Terra occasionally suffers from over earnestness, but its message is heartfelt, and some of the battle sequences are visually stunning.Also opening this week in limited release:Revanche, an Oscar-nominated thriller about the intersecting lives of several Vienna residents, is at 88 percent.The Merry Gentleman, a crime drama with a love triangle directed by and starring Michael Keaton, is at 75 percent.Newcastle, an Australian coming-of-age story about a group of surfing friends, is at 64 percent.A Wink and a Smile, a documentary about burlesque dancing, is at 33 percent.Jim Jarmusch‘s The Limits of Control, starring Isaach de Bankole and Bill Murray in an existentialist gangster flick set in Spain, is at 22 percent.Finally, props to Sulaco2k for correctly guessing Obsessed‘s 20 percent Tomatometer.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"Toys, canceled, Seed, Searchlight, in, Sundance, and, Critics, crime, DC, international","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Critics-Consensus-Wolverine-Isnt-Looking-Too-Sharp"},{"id":"47508795346745","title":"Critics Consensus: Race to Witch Mountain Doesn’t Cast A Spell","content":"Critics Consensusvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Critics Consensus: Race to Witch Mountain Doesn't Cast A SpellPlus, Last House on the Left falls short of the original, and Miss March is largely laugh-free.by Tim Ryan | March 12, 2009 |  CommentsThis week at the movies, we’ve got a supernatural quest (Race to Witch Mountain, starring Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson and AnnaSophia Robb), a vengeance thriller ( Last House on the Left, starring Sara Paxton and Garret Dillahunt), and playmate pratfalls (Miss March starring Zach Cregger and Trevor Moore).

However, critics say the reboot is only sporadically successful, despite the best efforts of a talented cast. Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson stars as an ex-con cabbie who picks up two teens with supernatural powers; together, they attempt to elude government officials and ominous forces. The pundits say the cast is just fine, especially the Rock, who mixes toughness and good humor with panache. But the rest of the film is alternately too noisy and not exciting enough to maintain interest throughout. (Check out star Carla Gugino‘s five favorite films, and our rundown of the finest live-action Disney films.)[tomatometer]MuzeID=1205377[/tomatometer]The Last House on the LeftWes Craven‘s original The Last House on the Left was a horror movie touchstone, a film so violent in its time that even its poster had to reassure audience members that it was only a movie. Critics say the remake (which Craven produced) is stylishly crafted and effective in spots, but it misses the spirit of the original by miles, lacking Craven’s bleak artistry and his sense of social commentary. Sara Paxton stars as a young woman who is brutally attacked by a prison escapee and his flunkies. She flees to the supposed safety of her house, but when her parents discover that they’re harboring the very thugs who attacked their daughter, they exact their own brand of revenge. The pundits say the film is better-made than most, but it’s ultimately pretty generic, substituting the dark subtleties of Craven’s landmark film with oodles of gratuitous gore.[tomatometer]MuzeID=10010760[/tomatometer]Miss MarchUnless your taste runs toward the bottom-of-the-barrel lowest common denominator, the critics say you may want to scratch Miss March off your calendar. The film stars Zach Cregger (who also directed with co-star Trevor Moore, both part of the the Whitest Kids U’ Know comedy troupe) as a young man who awakens from a coma to discover his once-chaste high school significant other is now a Playboy centerfold. The pundits say Miss March is crass, unfunny, and poorly made, a gross-out comedy with little beyond scene-stealer Craig Robinson to recommend it.Also opening this week in limited release:The Turkish import Three Monkeys, a noirish drama about a politician who flees a hit-and-run accident with multifaceted consequences, is at 96 percent.Kiyoshi Kurosawa‘s Tokyo Sonata, a dramedy about a recently fired businessman who loses control of his family, is at 90 percent.Mary Stuart Masterson‘s directorial debut The Cake Eaters, starring Kristen Stewart in a coming-of-age tale about a teenager with a rare neurological disorder, is at 88 percent.Carmen and Geoffrey, a documentary about two of modern dance’s greatest pioneers, is at 80 percent.Sunshine Cleaning, an indie about a pair of sisters in the business of cleaning up crime scenes that stars Amy Adams and Emily Blunt, is at 72 percent.The Edge of Love , starring Keira Knightley and Sienna Miller in a period drama about the loves of Dylan Thomas, is at 59 percent.Severed Ways, about a group of Vikings navigating the treacherous terrain of the New World, is at zero percent.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"GIFs","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Critics-Consensus-Race-to-Witch-Mountain-Doesnt-Cast-A-Spell"},{"id":"47508795316015","title":"Critics Consensus: Terminator, Night Are So-So Sequels","content":"Critics Consensusvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Critics Consensus: Terminator, Night Are So-So SequelsPlus, Dance Flick is rhythmically challenged.by Tim Ryan | May 21, 2009 |  CommentsThis week at the movies, we’ve got deadly machines (Terminator Salvation, starring Christian Bale and Sam Worthington); historical hysterics (Night at the Museum: Battle of the Smithsonian, starring Ben Stiller and Amy Adams); and dance fever (Dance Flick, starring Damon Wayans Jr. and Craig Wayans).

But critics say he’s forgotten the key ingredient that made the originals so compelling (besides Arnold, of course) — the human factor. Christian Bale is John Connor, leading the human resistance against Skynet, which has conquered our dystopian planet with its armies of Terminators. The pundits say the action sequences are well handled, but the performances are middling, and the story inspires little emotional investment. Salvation is the worst-reviewed entry in the Terminator franchise.

And the result, Night at the Museum: Battle of the Smithsonian, is bigger and better than the first, while still overdosing on comic mayhem. Ben Stiller returns as hapless night watchman Larry Daley, whose pals at the Museum of Natural History have been inadvertently shipped to the Smithsonian in Washington, where they’re threatened by such baddies as Al Capone and Napoleon; fortunately, Amelia Earhart (Amy Adams) is on hand to help. The pundits say this Night is funnier and more madcap than its predecessor, but it’s essentially a series of loosely connected gags, with precious little discipline to make it work as a whole, and it squanders a veritable all-star team of comedic talent.[tomatometer]MuzeID=1205827[/tomatometer]Dance FlickDance Flick is yet another spoof of contemporary cinematic tropes, a subgenre that has been critically ravaged in recent years. However, the critics find Dance Flick to be one of the better recent entries – which is hardly a glowing recommendation. Featuring a veritable army of Wayans in front of and behind the camera, Dance Flick aims to score laughs by mining the rich comic vein of such deathless classics as Save the Last Dance, Step Up, and High School Musical. And the pundits say the Wayans’ relentless energy is good for a few chuckles, but overall, Dance Flick is essentially a scattershot collection of gags that only occasionally hit their targets.Also opening this week in limited release:Burma VJ, which compiles footage from video journalists’ chronicles of living conditions in dictatorial Myanmar, is at 92 percent.Kabei: Our Mother, a delicate drama about a woman’s efforts to keep her family together in the midst of World War II, is at 88 percent.O’Horten, an absurdist Norwegian comedy about a retired train engineer, is at 84 percent.The Boys: The Sherman Brothers’ Story, a doc about the acrimonious relationship between the siblings who crafted some of Disney’s most memorable movie music, is at 83 percent.Milton Glaser: To Inform &amp; Delight, a doc about the graphic designer who co-founded New York Magazine and created the iconic “I (heart) New York” logo, is at 83 percent.Steven Soderbergh‘s The Girlfriend Experience, staring Sasha Grey as a high-end call girl who offers her clients a quasi-relationship, is at 72 percent.Easy Virtue, starring Jessica Biel and Colin Firth in an adaptation of a Noel Coward play about the shakeup caused by a posh Brit’s marriage to an American racecar driver, is at 67 percent.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"richard, cartoon","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Critics-Consensus-Terminator-Night-Are-So-So-Sequels"},{"id":"47508796990281","title":"Critics Consensus: Quantum of Solace is Certified Fresh","content":"Critics Consensusvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Critics Consensus: Quantum of Solace is Certified FreshIt may be a cut below Casino Royale, but the latest Bond flick still shines.by Tim Ryan | November 13, 2008 |  CommentsThis week at the movies, we’ve got a brand new dose of Bond… James Bond. Quantum of Solace, directed by Marc Forster and starring Daniel Craig and Olga Kurylenko, is the only wide release hitting theaters; will it leave critics shaken and stirred?First, the bad news: critics say Quantum of Solace doesn’t match the previous Bond outing, Casino Royale, in terms of visceral thrills of emotional depth. The good news? It’s still a pretty excellent action picture. Daniel Craig is back as 007, still devastated by the death of Vesper Lynd, the love of his life. But there’s work to be done: namely, the sinister Quantum organization has hatched a plot to destabilize governments in South America. Along his globetrotting mission, Bond comes across Camilla Montes (Olga Kurylenko), who’s looking for a little revenge of her own. The pundits say that anyone expecting the focused brilliance of Casino Royale will be disappointed; Quantum of Solace is more of a standard action film, with less of the dark psychology and sharp plotting of its predecessor. However, they also note it still delivers some pretty remarkable stunts and set pieces, and Craig fully embodies the role, creating a new kind of Bond in the process.

Unfortunately, critics say his return is only sporadically successful in Yes Man. Carrey plays Carl, a man gripped by depression who enters a self-help program that encourages its devotees to say yes to each and every question. However, Carl finds answering in the affirmative can sometimes have negative consequences. The pundits say the film has its moments, thanks to Carrey’s manic energy, but it’s ultimately little more than a series of comedic set-pieces that don’t build or cohere; worse, we’ve already seen Carrey do a pretty fine variation on this theme in Liar Liar. At 40 percent on the Tomatometer, you may want to say “no” to Yes Man. (Check out this week’s Total Recall, in which we count down Carrey’s best-reviewed films.)“What’s it called? Gallipoli? Sounds hilarious!”It’s unsurprising that Will Smith would want to shed his blockbuster baggage every once in a while and throw himself into a smaller, more dramatically weighty role; unfortunately, critics say his latest, Seven Pounds, is more leaden than anything else. Smith stars as Ben, an IRS agent haunted by past misdeeds. As a way of making amends, he decides to practice random acts of kindness on strangers, a plan that goes in intriguing directions when he falls in love with terminally-ill Emily (Rosario Dawson). Some pundits have given Smith credit for attempting riskier material, but they also say Seven Pounds doesn’t follow the rules of logic very closely, and its tone is somber and portentous. At 35 percent on the Tomatometer, Seven Pounds may not be worth your 10 dollars.“I’m really sorry that I said girls ain’t nothin’ but trouble.”Another week, another so-so animated feature. The Tale of Despereaux is a fantasy tale about a heroic little mouse who becomes an outcast for refusing to conform; he befriends a group of rats, with whom he shares a journey of self-discovery and adventure. The pundits say Despereaux looks pretty good, and is mercifully free of the toilet humor and pop culture references that have become commonplace in animated features. However, it’s also lacking a sense of magic, and doesn’t really take dramatic flight. At 42 percent on the Tomatometer, this mouse is a tail’s-length behind Ratatouille.“Man, it’s taking forever to read this book!””Also opening this week in limited release:Darren Aronofsky‘s The Wrestler, starring an electrifying Mickey Rourke as a former ring king on the comeback trail, is at 97 percent.The Class, the 2008 Palme D’or winner at Cannes, which follows a teacher during a tumultuous year in an inner-city Parisian high school, is at 96 percent.Scott Walker: 30 Century Man, a documentary about the reclusive crooner and cult favorite, is at 88 percent.Nothing But the Truth, starring Kate Beckinsale and Matt Dillon in the story of a journalist who goes to prison to avoid revealing her source on an explosive story, is at 73 percent.Recent Jim Carrey Movies:79% — Dr. Seuss’ Horton Hears a Who!

What do the critics have to say?[tomatometer]MuzeID=1193252[/tomatometer]TakenTaken is an action flick that’s both efficient and absurd, critics say, and so it’s often entertaining — but only up to a point. The film stars Liam Neeson as a retired CIA agent who learns his daughter has been abducted in Paris; upon receiving a frantic phone call from her, he tracks her down — and finds himself on the trail of a massive criminal enterprise. The pundits say Taken is a sprightly piece of work, and Neeson is compelling in the lead role, but the film is weighted down by contrivances and leaps in logic.[tomatometer]MuzeID=1190977[/tomatometer]The UninvitedAnother Asian horror remake getting released in January? While the critics say The Uninvited may not live up to the standard set by its source material (2003’s A Tale of Two Sisters), it’s a reasonably involving thriller– though not an entirely successful one. Emily Browning plays a young woman with a history of mental problems who, upon meeting her father’s new fiancée (Elizabeth Banks), is immediately suspicious; creepy goings-on ensue. The pundits say The Uninvited is moody and well acted, but it also contains plenty of haunted house conventions and telegraphed plot twists.[tomatometer]MuzeID=1196344[/tomatometer]New in TownIt may be cold in Minnesota this time of year, but that’s nothing compared to the chilly reception the critics have given New in Town. In this fish-out-of-water romantic comedy, Renee Zellweger stars as a hotshot executive who’s sent to the Land of 10,000 Lakes to oversee layoffs at one of her company’s factories; there, she falls for the local union rep (Harry Connick Jr.) and learns about the strange customs of small-town Americans. The pundits say New in Town‘s timely premise and winning leads are no match for the film’s weather-beaten, clichéd script, which tries way too hard to be uplifting.Also opening this week in limited release:Medicine for Melancholy, a stylish, nuanced tale of two Bay Area hipsters in love, is at 94 percent.The Filipino import Serbis, a documentary that examines at the root causes of the long-running gang war, is at 90 percent.Shadows, about a young man who survives a car crash only to be confronted by ghostly visions, is at 57 percent.Blessed Is the Match: The Life and Death of Hannah Senesh, a documentary about the famed poet and resistance fighter who attempted to free imprisoned Jews in World War II, is at 50 percent.The Toe Tactic, a live action/animated hybrid about a young woman dealing with the death of her father, is at 43 percent.Finally, props to AnthonyDidge, who came the closest to guessing Underworld: Rise of the Lycans‘ 34 percent Tomatometer.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"Trek, streaming, First, TV","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Critics-Consensus-Taken-Is-A-Near-Miss"},{"id":"47508796993354","title":"Critics Consensus: Positive Role Models, So-So Soul Men","content":"Critics Consensusvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Critics Consensus: Positive Role Models, So-So Soul MenPlus, Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa tops the original.by Tim Ryan | November 6, 2008 |  CommentsThis week at the movies, we’ve got Big Brothers (Role Models, starring Paul Rudd and Seann William Scott), wild animals (Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa, with voice work by Ben Stiller and Chris Rock), and R&amp;B vets (Soul Men, starring Bernie Mac and Samuel L. Jackson). What do the critics have to say?Films that are at once raucously stupid and genuinely funny are a rarity. However, critics say Role Models fits the bill with aplomb. The film stars Paul Rudd and Seann William Scott as a pair of energy drink pitchmen with a proclivity for bad behavior and law-breaking; assigned to community service, they act as Big Brothers to a pair of troublemakers — and learn something in the process. It may sound like pure formula, but the pundits say this is a worthy entry in the Judd Apatow-inspired subgenre of gross-out comedy with heart, featuring well-paced, spectacularly dumb (in a good way) gags and engaging performances. At 75 percent on the Tomatometer, Role Models may be worth following.“I’d like to dedicate this next number to McLovin.”Speaking of rarities, how many sequels top the original? Madagascarmade a ton of money but disappointed critics unimpressed with its string of pop culture references and flatulence jokes. The scribes say Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa is better in almost every regard, with sharper animation, funnier jokes, and a better story. Alex the Lion (Ben Stiller), Gloria the Hippo (Jada Pinkett Smith), Marty the Zebra (Chris Rock) and Melman the Giraffe (David Schwimmer) are relocated from captivity in New York to a savannah in Africa. Once there, they rediscover their roots, but pine for the friendly confines of the zoo. It may not be the edgiest animation out there, but pundits say Madagascar is bright and cheerful, with a good deal of energy and some smart laughs. At 68 percent on the Tomatometer, Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa may be worth a trip.“They call me the Hiphopapotamus, my lyrics are bottomless…..”The script of Soul Men may be coarse and shopworn, but critics say it’s an ok sendoff for the great comic Bernie Mac, who passed away earlier this year. The film stars Mac and Samuel L. Jackson as a pair of R&amp;B backup singers who reluctantly agree to perform at a tribute concert for a soul legend despite mutual acrimony; their cross-country journey to the show is filled with wacky hostility. The critics say Soul Men isn’t particularly original, borrowing from a number of road-buddy flicks, and the jokes are pretty blue. Still, they also note it’s a worthy final performance for Bernie Mac, an actor who stole many scenes in supporting roles and is in fine form as a lead here (and the late soul great Isaac Hayes also turns in a sharp supporting performance). At 54 percent on the Tomatometer, Soul Men hits some decent notes.One of these men is in no hurry to take it to the bridge, to the consternation of the other.Also opening this week in limited release:Captain Abu Raed, a tale of a janitor in Jordan who inspires a goup of children who believe he’s a pilot, is at 100 percent.A revival of Francois Truffaut‘s classic The Wild Child, based on the true story of a boy who survived alone in the wild, is at 100 percent.Pray the Devil Back to Hell, a documentary about a group of Liberian women’s political activism in the midst of civil war, is at 100 percent.JCVD, starring Jean-Claude Van Damme as a version of himself fighting to escape a hostage situation in a bank, is at 85 percent (check out this week’s Total Recall, in which we count down the Muscles from Brussels’ best-reviewed films).The Boy in the Striped Pajamas, a Holocaust drama about the son of a Nazi officer who forms a friendship with a boy in a concentration camp, is at 71 percent.The World Unseen, a drama about two South African women who form a tight bond during the Apartheid era, is at 29 percent.Repo!

Austin); a crazed killer (My Bloody Valentine 3D, starring Jensen Ackles and Jaime King); Brooklyn’s finest (Notorious, starring Jamal Woolard and Angela Bassett); and wartime heroics (Defiance, starring Daniel Craig and Liev Schreiber). What do the critics have to say?Everybody loves a good dumb comedy — as long as it provides ample laughs. However, the critics say Paul Blart: Mall Cop is good for a couple of lowbrow yucks, but it isn’t exactly a model of disciplined storytelling. Kevin James likeably plays the title character, a portly, self-important (and sidearm-free) crime fighter in a suburban New Jersey mall who must utilize every shred of his training when a hostage situation arises. The pundits say Paul Blart contains some funny slapstick pratfalls, but its thin premise doesn’t generate a headlong comic intensity, and a number of gags simply fall flat. At 29 percent on the Tomatometer, you may want to go shopping somewhere else.Kevin James, in a dramatic moment from Chopping Mall 2.Marley and Me, Bolt, Wendy and Lucy, Beverly Hills Chihuahua… dog people must feel like they’re in cinematic heaven these days. Hotel for Dogs is the latest pooch-centric flick to hit multiplexes, but critics say its appeal will be limited to little kids and die-hard canine lovers. The film stars Emma Roberts and Jake T. Austin as a pair of orphans who are so in love with man’s best friends that they convert an abandoned hotel into a four-star doggie resort, providing posh accommodations for as many strays as they can find. Look, few will go to Hotel for Dogs expecting hyper-realism, but the pundits say this occasionally funny slice of whimsy is predictable and contrived, and the four-legged heroes repeatedly outshine their human counterparts. At 48 percent on the Tomatometer, Hotel for Dogs may not be worth a stay.“This is one more reason why we need a bailout.”If you’re the type of filmgoer that really, really enjoys blood and guts, My Bloody Valentine 3D is here to overload your senses. Critics say this extremely grisly slasher flick, which with a sick sense of humor and three-dimensions-worth of wild kills, might just be a gorehound’s nirvana. A loose remake of the 1981 title of the same name, Valentine stars Jensen Ackles as Tom, a coal miner whose mistake costs the lives of some co-workers; now, a decade later, someone donning a miner’s mask and wielding a pickaxe is running amok in town, and Tom looks to be a target. The pundits say this is an expertly crafted, pretension-free genre piece that’s technologically advanced and features plenty of wicked scares. At 83 percent on the Tomatometer, this is one Bloody good time.“I can’t believe it! That guy didn’t even signal!”The Notorious B.I.G. was one of rap’s most compelling figures, with the remarkable ability to spin tales of his wayward past with devastating emotional vulnerability and insight. However, the critics say Notorious, George Tillman Jr.’s biopic of the late hip hop great, succumbs to the kind of clichés that Biggie studiously avoided on his records. First-timer Jamal Woolard stars as the man who would be B.I.G., a small-time Brooklyn hustler who became a huge star before his death in a shooting before his 25th birthday. The critics say Woolard is excellent, capturing the nuances of the character with assurance, but the rest of the film isn’t up to its central performance, clicking off the details of Biggie’s life without the complexity or depth of his rhymes. At 57 percent on the Tomatometer, Notorious isn’t quite “Juicy” enough.“What a drag… Oh well, let’s see if Pizza Hut is open.”Defiance recounts an undeniably important historical tale: that of a group of Eastern European Jews who fought the Nazis in World War II. And although the critics say the film is well-crafted, they also find it lacking in emotional impact. Daniel Craig, Liev Schreiber, and Jamie Bell star as brothers who, on the run from the Germans, establish a community of refugees deep in the Belarusian forest; as food becomes scarce and disease runs rampant, the brothers decide to mount an offensive against the Nazis. The pundits say this is a respectful telling of a fascinating story, but the trouble is, it’s overly solemn and clichéd. Defiance currently stands at 54 percent on the Tomatometer.

What do the critics have to say?If you have fallen under the spell of Stephenie Meyer’s bestselling series about young vampires in love, you may not give a hoot what critics think about Twilight. For what it’s worth, they say if you’ve read the books (or are a teenage girl), you’ll probably dig it, while others will likely be left scratching their heads. Kristen Stewart stars as Bella, a new student at a small-town high school in Washington who finds herself falling for the impossibly handsome, exceptionally smart Edward (Robert Pattinson). But there’s one slight problem: he’s a vampire, which kinda puts the kibosh on any hookups — or does it? The pundits say Twilight isn’t exactly long on plot, and many will find the special effects to be pretty cheesy, more suited to network TV than the big screen. However, they also note that the cast is committed to the material, and if you’re in the right frame of mind (or the target demographic), the film has some swoon-worthy moments. Still, at 44 percent on the Tomatometer, Twilight could use a little more bite. (For a primer on Twilight‘s characters, click here. Also, check out star Pattinson’s five favorite films here. Finally, for our rundown of cinema’s sexiest vampires, click here.)“So you’re too old for me, you don’t go to church, you hate garlic… Any other potential dealbreakers?”Good news, parents: there’s a new animated feature called Bolt in theaters, and critics say it will please the wee ones while giving you some yucks as well. Bolt (voiced by John Travolta) isn’t a superhero, but he plays one on TV, and when he’s accidentally shipped from Hollywood to New York City, he has overcome his delusions of grandeur in order to be reunited with his loving owner Penny (Miley Cyrus). The critics say Bolt may not be the most original animated romp, but it’s funny, exciting, sweet, and smart. At 86 percent on the Tomatometer, Bolt is a blast.“What?

What do the critics have to say?[tomatometer]MuzeID=1190728[/tomatometer]InkheartInkheart is a fantastical tale about the power of the printed word, but critics say this family movie doesn’t bring the appeal of Cornelia Funke’s source novel to compelling life. Inkheart stars Brendan Fraser as Mo Folchart, who’s a “Silvertongue” — when he reads books aloud, the fictional characters spring to life. However, this has the unintended consequence of summoning a villain who takes him hostage, and it’s up to his daughter Meggie (Eliza Hope Bennett) to save him. The pundits say Inkheart lacks the requisite whimsy and magic, and the result is a fantasy adventure in which a lot happens but too little inspires.[tomatometer]MuzeID=1198041[/tomatometer]Slumdog MillionaireDanny Boyle is a director whose films nearly burst with energy, and critics say his latest, Slumdog Millionaire, has a kinetic vitality — and an infectious sweetness – that’s difficult to resist. The Certified Fresh Slumdog (which already won Best Picture at the Golden Globes and is going wide this week) tells the story of a street kid named Jamal Malik (Dev Patel), who makes a splash on an Indian game show, prompting officials to question whether he’s cheating. The pundits say Slumdog is a marvel, a heartfelt film shot with panache and featuring excellent performances. Check out Awards Tour, RT’s one-stop shop for awards season news, here.[tomatometer]MuzeID=1187019[/tomatometer]Frost/NixonIt was one of the strangest episodes in television history: a self-promoting British TV personality was able to arrange a no-holds-barred interview with disgraced former president Richard Nixon. It’s an inherently compelling tale, and critics say Ron Howard’s Certified Fresh Best Picture nominee Frost/Nixon (expanding this week into wide release) is a taut, tense historical drama. Michael Sheen stars as David Frost, who was able to coax Nixon (Frank Langella) to sit down after three years of silence; though Nixon expects softballs, Frost turns out to be a bit more than he bargained for. The pundits say Frost/Nixon is a superbly acted character study, filled with razor-sharp dialogue and a palpable sense of time and place.[tomatometer]MuzeID=1190978[/tomatometer]Revolutionary RoadA decade after Titanic, Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet again find themselves playing characters on a sinking ship; however, in Revolutionary Road the vessel is their marriage. Critics say the movie (expanding this week into wide release) is handsomely crafted by Sam Mendes, but the result is an exquisite downer. DiCaprio and Winslet star as Frank and April, a young couple with dreams of ditching their humdrum suburban existence for the freedom and excitement of Paris; however, circumstance stymies them, and resentment follows. The pundits say Revolutionary Road looks immaculate, and the performances (especially a supporting turn by Oscar-nominated Michael Shannon) are outstanding, but some feel the movie is more tasteful than emotionally resonant.[tomatometer]MuzeID=1194220[/tomatometer]Underworld: Rise of the LycansApparently, the folks behind the Underworld, Rise of the Lycans were expecting that critics would sink their claws into this werewolf/vampire horror/fantasy flick. Rhona Mitra plays Sonja, the daughter of vampire baddie Viktor (Bill Nighy), who has caught the eye of Viktor’s nemesis, the werewolf Lucian (Michael Sheen).

What do the critics have to say?[tomatometer]MuzeID=1189949[/tomatometer]CoralineIf any proof were needed that 3-D movies have entered a bold new era, the critics say Coraline is it; this stylistically bold, emotionally resonant stop-motion flick is a twisted marvel. Directed by Henry Selick (who helmed the bewitchingly macabre The Nightmare Before Christmas) and based upon the best seller by Neil Gaiman, Coraline follows the phantasmagoric exploits of the title character (voiced by Dakota Fanning), a bored 11-year-old who discovers a door in her house that leads to a parallel version of her life — one that at first is enchanting, but soon threatens to entrap our hero. The pundits say Coraline is one of the most visually dazzling pictures to come along in many a moon, and it’s anchored by a delightfully twisted storyline. It’s not only Certified Fresh, it’s also the best-reviewed wide release of the year so far. (Be forewarned, however; the scribes say this film may be too scary for small children.)[tomatometer]MuzeID=1192140[/tomatometer]He’s Just Not That Into YouHe’s Just Not That Into You is the latest in a long line of romantic comedies that attempt to navigate the complexities of modern relationships. The movie’s problem, critics say, is that by juggling so many plot threads it ends up giving a short shrift to characterization and insight. An embarrassment of talented actors (including Jennifer Aniston, Drew Barrymore, Scarlett Johansson, Ben Affleck, and Jennifer Connelly) play Baltimore residents who are attempting to find the perfect match, but are regularly stymied by self-questioning and unreturned phone calls. The pundits say the film is bogged down by the fact that there’s too much going on for the characters to emerge as three-dimensional personalities, thus reducing its talented thespians (despite their best efforts) to playing stereotypes.[tomatometer]MuzeID=1190694[/tomatometer]The Pink Panther 2As the self-important, supremely incompetent, and impenetrably-accented Inspector Clouseau, Peter Sellers created one of the most memorable comic characters of modern times. Steve Martin is a very funny guy too, but critics say that’s not enough to redeem The Pink Panther 2‘s uninspired script and tired gags. In the second installment starring Martin, Clouseau is enlisted into a team of super detectives in order to track down some priceless cultural artifacts that have been purloined by a rogue named the Tornado. The pundits say that like its predecessor, The Pink Panther 2 is a “beumb”; it’s aimlessly plotted and emphasizes lame slapstick gags at the expense of the considerable talents of Martin, John Cleese, Lily Tomlin, Jeremy Irons, and Aishwarya Rai, among others. (Check out this week’s Total Recall, in which we explore Martin’s best-reviewed movies, and click here for co-star Jean Reno‘s five favorite films.)[tomatometer]MuzeID=1195186[/tomatometer]PushEstablishing a credible science fiction world — especially one containing characters with super abilities — is a tall order. Unfortunately, critics say Push isn’t up to it, squandering an intriguing premise with hyperkinetic pacing and a general lack of coherence. Chris Evans plays Nick, who has remarkable paranormal powers and finds himself on the run from unseemly government agents, including the dangerous Henry (Djimon Hounsou), who want to utilize his abilities for their own means. The pundits say that despite director Paul McGuigan‘s visual flair, Push is really hard to follow, with a convoluted script and an excess of style. (Check out our interview with McGuigan, in which he shares his five favorite films with RT.)Also opening this week in limited release:Chocolate, a bizarre Thai martial arts flick about an autistic girl with remarkable fighting skills, is at 71 percent.Our City Dreams, a documentary about a year in the life of five female artists in New York City, is at 67 percent.The road trip comedy Fanboys, which follows several Star Wars fanatics on their quest to see The Phantom Menace before its release, is at 27 percent.Memorial Day, a mockumentary about a group of hard-partying soldiers and their bad behavior on leave and in Iraq, is at 14 percent.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"Larson, Academy, Mary, international, CW, Amazon, dark","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"critics-consensus-coraline-is-certified-fresh"},{"id":"47508795352893","title":"Critics Consensus: Friday the 13th Feels Too Familiar","content":"Critics Consensusvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Critics Consensus: Friday the 13th Feels Too FamiliarPlus, just say no to Confessions of a Shopaholic; The International has its moments.by Tim Ryan | February 12, 2009 |  CommentsThis week at the movies, we’ve got creepy campers (Friday the 13th, starring Jared Padalecki and Danielle Panabaker), conspicuous consumption (Confessions of a Shopaholic, starring Isla Fisher and Hugh Dancy ), and corporate criminality (The International, starring Clive Owen and Naomi Watts). What do the critics have to say?[tomatometer]MuzeID=1200552[/tomatometer]Friday the 13thYou’d think Camp Crystal Lake would be closed by now. Not only does it have a higher per-capita murder rate than most major American cities, but the exploits of its most famous camper — the masked Jason Voorhees — have been pretty well documented at this point. That hasn’t stopped Marcus Nispel from trying to reboot the Friday the 13th franchise, and critics say it isn’t an embarrassment, just a derivative horror flick. A sort of greatest-hits compilation of the first three Friday movies, his installment finds a young man (Jared Padalecki) searching for his sister, who went missing after some woodland partying; he meets a young woman (Danielle Panabaker) who helps him, and soon they’re crossing paths with aspiring goaltender/serial killer Jason Voorhees. The pundits say Friday the 13th is pretty generic stuff, filled with shopworn 1980s slasher tropes and lacking the low-budget panache of the early installments. (RT editor Alex Vo watched all the Friday the 13th movies in preparation for the new film; check out his write-ups here.)[tomatometer]MuzeID=1191984[/tomatometer]Confessions of a ShopaholicGiven the wretched state of the economy, a light romantic comedy about spending beyond one’s means may not be what the doctor ordered for filmgoers looking for an escape. But bad timing isn’t the only thing wrong with Confessions of a Shopaholic, critics say. Isla Fisher stars as a deeply indebted columnist for a financial magazine with a crush on her editor (Hugh Dancy) and a serious jones for designer labels. Will our heroine learn to love the thrift shop? The pundits say Fisher is fine in her first starring vehicle, but director P.J. Hogan, who has a knack for crafting charming chick flicks, is not at the top of his game here. Worse, the screenplay doesn’t explore the darker aspects of its protagonist’s conspicuous consumption. (Check out our interviews with Fisher and producer Jerry Bruckheimer).[tomatometer]MuzeID=1202802[/tomatometer]The InternationalIf you’re both an action fan and an architecture buff, the critics say you could do worse than The International, a conspiracy thriller with some electric scenes and plenty of intriguing locales. However, they also note the film is over-complicated and occasionally absurd. Clive Owen and Naomi Watts star as an Interpol agent and a Manhattan assistant D.A., respectively, on the trail of a rogue banker — a globetrotting mission that puts them in the crosshairs of a vast criminal enterprise. The pundits say The International is good for a couple of exceptional set pieces, but it’s ultimately undone by major gaps in logic and convoluted plotting.Also opening this week in limited release:Great Speeches from a Dying World, a compassionate examination of the lives of nine homeless people in Seattle, is at 100 percent.The IMAX documentary Under the Sea 3-D, which gives a close-up look at the aquatic wildlife of the Pacific, is at 90 percent.The Italian drama Gomorrah, which examines organized crime and corruption in Naples and Caserta, is at 86 percent.Two Lovers, about a complex love triangle and starring Joaquin Phoenix and Gwyneth Paltrow, is at 79 percent.The Caller, starring Frank Langella and Elliott Gould in a tale of international corporate intrigue, is at 10 percent.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"ABC, spain, Columbia, Reality, Mudbound, Lifetime, TV, potter, Comic, Emmys, Election, awards, indiana","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Critics-Consensus-Friday-the-13th-Feels-Too-Familiar"},{"id":"47508798426957","title":"Critics Consensus: W.

Has OK Strategery, Max Is A PaynePlus, Sex Drive is a mixed bag, and The Secret Life of Bees is too sticky sweet.by | October 16, 2008 |  CommentsThis week at the movies, we’ve got presidential redemption (Oliver Stone‘s W., starring Josh Brolin), a lethal cop (Max Payne, starring Mark Walberg), a raunchy road trip (Sex Drive, starring Josh Zuckerman and James Marsden), and Southern sisterhood (The Secret Life of Bees, starring Queen Latifah and Dakota Fanning). What do the critics have to say?In last night’s presidential debate, both John McCain and Barack Obama spent plenty of time explaining how they’d be different from George W. Bush. So while it would seem the time wouldn’t be right for a big-screen biopic of the current president, Oliver Stone isn’t one to worry about such things, and critics say his W. is mostly compelling and sharp. The film, starring Josh Brolin in the title role, follows Bush on his journey from hard-partier to born-again Christian to the Oval Office, offering plenty of pop-psychological insight along the way. The pundits say Stone presents a largely sympathetic portrait of the man, and is ably abetted by his strong cast, particularly Brolin and Richard Dreyfuss as Dick Cheney. Still, others say Stone can’t help but throw in some cheap shots, and the movie works better in parts than as a whole. At 59 percent on the Tomatometer, W. shouldn’t be misunderestimated. (Check out this week’s Total Recall for our rundown of memorable movie presidents.)Oliver Stone assumes his new post as secretary of conspiracy theories.Video game adaptations rarely make for satisfying pictures, and critics say the losing streak continues with Max Payne. Which is a drag, since the game, with its John Woo-esque action, neo-noir atmosphere, and pill-popping antihero is pretty cinematic in its own right. Mark Walberg IS Max Payne, a cop who’s searching for the killer of his wife while investigating several other homicides and trying to rid the streets of a particularly lethal drug. The pundits say Max Payne lacks emotional resonance, the plot is convoluted, and the action scenes are noisy without being kinetic (though there are traces of visual flair throughout). At zero percent on the Tomatometer, the scribes say this one’s mostly a Payne.“This is neither the place nor the time to bring forth the rhythm and the rhyme!”American Pie helped renew interest in raunchy teen comedies almost a decade ago, and a slew of similar movies have bombarded audiences since then. The cheekily-titled Sex Drive is the latest of these wild romps, focusing on a graduating high schooler (Josh Zuckerman) and his quest to shed his virginity before he steps foot on a college campus. He meets a stunning girl on the Internet and sets out on a 500-mile road trip to meet her… in his brother’s vintage Pontiac. At a tenuous 57 percent, critics are so far split on the comedy, with some claiming it’s merely unoriginal and offensive while others saying it manages to rise above the others of its ilk. They do all seem to agree on one thing, however: it’s raunchy, it’s ridiculous, and those who will see it probably already know what they’re in for.“No, no, a lollipop is cool… it’s just that I wanted an inflatable Tigger.”Based on a best-selling novel by Sue Monk Kidd, The Secret Life of Bees chronicles the tale of a young girl (Dakota Fanning) who flees her troubled home with her caretaker (Jennifer Hudson) and takes refuge with a trio of sisters (played by Queen Latifah, Sophie Okonedo, and Alicia Keys). Based on its current 46 percent Tomatometer rating, this may unfortunately be a case where the story works better on paper than it does on film. Though the performances are mostly considered solid, critics are taking issue with the movie’s overt sentimentality, drawing fire for being everything from “maudlin” and “manipulative” to “too pat” and “drenched in sugar.” Bees seems poised to jerk some tears and wrench some hearts, but audiences may find this batch of honey to be a bit too sweet for their tastes.“One reason I’m such an accomplished apiarist is that I have no problem finding the queen.”Also opening this week inlimited release:Frontrunners, a documentary about a campaign for student council president at an exclusive high school, is at 82 percent.Azur and Asmar, an animated parable about two boyhood friends on a quest to rescue a fairy, is at 75 percent.Abel Ferrara‘s unconventional Christ story Mary, starring Juliette Binoche and Forest Whitaker, is at 73 percent.Barry Levinson‘s What Just Happened, an inside-baseball Hollywood comedy starring Robert De Niro, is at 57 percent.Madonna‘s directorial debut, Filth and Wisdom, starring Gogol Bordello‘s Eugene Hutz in a tale of flatmate mischief, is at 43 percent.Finally, props to RE4P3R for coming the closest to guessing Quarantine‘s 61 percent Tomatometer.Recent Oliver Stone Movies:70% — World Trade Center (2006)16% — Alexander(2004)58% — Comandante (2003)49% — Any Given Sunday(1999)56% — U-Turn(1997)","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"Fox, 71st, video, TV, Food, franchise, 93rd, crime, thirty, frames, It, Lucasfilm, 007, HBO","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Critics-Consensus-W-Has-OK-Strategery-Max-Is-A-Payne"},{"id":"47508798440275","title":"Critics Consensus: Bangkok Dangerous Plays Too Safe","content":"\n\n                                            Critics Consensus\n                                        \n                        \n                        \n                            var mps=mps||{}; mps._queue=mps._queue||{}; mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[];\n                            mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function() {\n                                mps.rt.insertlogo('#article_sponsorship_ad', 'ploc=articlesponsorship');\n                            });\n                        \n                    \n                    \n                        Critics Consensus: Bangkok Dangerous Plays Too Safe\n                        Plus, The Pool is refreshing and Mister Foe is dark and magical.\n                        by Tim Ryan | September 4, 2008                          | \n                          \n                              Comments\n                          \n                     \n\n                     \n\n                     \n                       \n                         \n                           \n                         \n                           \n                         \n                           \n                         \n                           \n                       \n                     \n\n                    \n                                                This week at the movies brings only one wide release: the Pang Brothers’ remake of their own Bangkok Dangerous starring Nicolas Cage as a conflicted hitman. What do the critics have to say?\n\nNicolas Cage has been on a critical losing streak, one that looks to be extended with Bangkok Dangerous. Cage stars as a cold-blooded assassin who, tasked with executing rivals of a crime boss, finds himself befriending a young street kid and falling into a tentative romance — ending his self-imposed isolation at a time when his life is in danger. Bangkok Dangerous was barely screened for critics, and those who have seen it say it lacks the grittiness and stylistic flair of the Pangs’ 2001 original (at 58 percent on the Tomatometer); instead, the brothers substitute clichés from other, better crime movies, and the action scenes lack punch. At 25 percent on the Tomatometer, pundits say Bangkok Dangerous plays it too safe.\n\n\nWith Yao Ming and Tracy McGrady sidelined with injuries, this guy singlehandedly kept the Rockets’ playoff hopes alive.\n\n\nFinally, crazy mad props to man in the water, alsanali, hatingvindiesel, luishere, and quietus28 for correctly guessing that Disaster Movie would score a perfect zero on the Tomatometer.

What do the critics have to say?Critics are comparing the third installment of the Mummy series, Tomb of the Dragon Emperor, to an Egyptian burial shrine — not because it contains visual opulence, but because it’s more than a little musty. Brendan Fraser returns as Rick, an intrepid explorer whose latest mission finds him in Asia, where he has to contend with an army of terra cotta warriors led by an ancient emperor (Jet Li). Let’s face it: the appeal of Mummy movies was their B-movie swashbuckling, not emotional heft or serious thematic resonance. But pundits say Tomb fails even at that modest level, featuring soulless CG effects, a notable lack of energy from the cast, and an overall lack of fun. At 11 percent on the Tomatometer, The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor is easily the worst-reviewed entry in a series the critics say is probably ready for embalming. It’s also one of the worst-reviewed films of the year. (Check out this week’s Total Recall, in which we provide an overview of Jet Li’s best-reviewed films.)Turns out Jet Li is the center of the universe.We’ve seen some recent national elections come down to a few hundred votes, but what if the presidency was decided by a single ballot? It’s an inspired premise, one that critics say unfortunately pays only intermittent dividends in Swing Vote. Kevin Costner stars as Bud Johnson, an amiable, slothful average Joe who, through a technical error, becomes the deciding vote in a presidential election; as a result, he’s heavily courted by the candidates while trying to do right by his daughter. The pundits say Swing Vote has moments of gentle charm, but it’s too predictable and lacks the sharp bite required to make it truly successful satire. At 37 percent on the Tomatometer, a recount isn’t going to save Swing Vote.“Don’t ever get drunk and go on eBay again!”Also opening this week in limited release:In Search of a Midnight Kiss, an indie comedy about a lonely guy looking for a smooch on New Year’s Eve, is at 89 percent.America the Beautiful, a documentary about how the fashion industry negatively contributes to Americans’ obsession with their looks, is at 80 percent.Frozen River, an indie drama about how a woman’s desperate search for her husband gets her involved in the trafficking of illegal immigrants, is at 78 percent.Profit Motive and the Whispering Wind, a doc that poetically examines the gravesites of a variety of important historical figures, is at 80 percent.The Helena Bonham-Carter-toplined Sixty Six, a British coming-of-age comedy about a boy who’s torn between attending his Bar Mitzvah and watching the World Cup, is at 60 percent.His attempts at water polo were less successful.Recent Kevin Costner Movies:————————————-56% — Mr. Brooks (2007)37% — The Guardian (2006)19% — Rumor Has It… (2005)50% — Ever Again (2005)74% — The Upside of Anger (2005)","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"screen, on, BAFTA, America, Sundance, godzilla, Channel, Fire, Grammys, Academy, thriller, fresh, killer, news, asian-american","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Critics-Consensus-The-Mummy-Gets-Embalmed"},{"id":"47508798429006","title":"Critics Consensus: Express Scores, Body of Lies Falls Flat","content":"\n\n                                            Critics Consensus\n                                        \n                        \n                        \n                            var mps=mps||{}; mps._queue=mps._queue||{}; mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[];\n                            mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function() {\n                                mps.rt.insertlogo('#article_sponsorship_ad', 'ploc=articlesponsorship');\n                            });\n                        \n                    \n                    \n                        Critics Consensus: Express Scores, Body of Lies Falls Flat\n                        Plus, Ember lacks luster, and guess Quarantine's Tomatometer!\n                        by Tim Ryan | October 9, 2008                          | \n                          \n                              Comments\n                          \n                     \n\n                     \n\n                     \n                       \n                         \n                           \n                         \n                           \n                         \n                           \n                         \n                           \n                       \n                     \n\n                    \n                                                This week at the movies, we’ve got suspicious spies (Body of Lies, starring Leonardo DiCaprio and Russell Crowe), gridiron greats (The Express, starring Rob Brown and Dennis Quaid), underground empires (City of Ember, starring Bill Murray and Tim Robbins), and deadly outbreaks (Quarantine, starring Jennifer Carpenter). What do the critics have to say?\nTroubled times inspire troubled movies, and critics say Ridley Scott‘s espionage thriller Body of Lies is brainier and politically sharper than your typical spy yarn. However, others say it gets too bogged down in action scenes to totally hit its mark. Leonardo DiCaprio stars as Roger Ferris, a CIA operative who has tracked down a terrorist leader in Jordan; however, he must get approval from his boss, Ed Hoffman (Russell Crowe), as well as the head of the Jordanian Intelligence agency. Naturally, machinations and intrigue follow. The pundits say Body of Lies‘ impressive pedigree goes a long way toward redeeming the film; it’s well acted and expertly crafted. However, some critics feel the story is way too labyrinthine and scattershot to be emotionally involving. Body of Lies currently stands at 57 percent on the Tomatometer.\n\n\n  \n\n“Dude, for the last time, you are not the king of the world.”\n\nThe inspirational, tragic life of Ernie Davis was ready-made for cinematic treatment: the first African American player to win college football’s Heisman Trophy, Davis set rushing records — and battled racial prejudice — before succumbing to leukemia on the eve of turning pro. Critics say The Express is a worthy big-screen tribute to one of pigskin’s greatest heroes, overcoming formulaic biopic tropes with sincerity and excellent performance. Rob Brown stars as Davis, an extremely talented but apolitical young man thrust into the harsh glare of history, and Dennis Quaid plays Syracuse coach Ben Schwartzwalder, a man who changes as a result of his charge’s heroic perseverance. The pundits say The Express has plenty of solid gridiron action, and it exceeds typical inspirational sports movie fare with its heart and craft. At 65 percent on the Tomatometer, The Express sails through the uprights.\n \n\n  \n\n“I told you not to use auto-draft for your fantasy team!”\nSet in a crumbling underground city that houses humanity after earth’s surface has become uninhabitable, City of Ember follows the exploits of two youngsters who find a magic box that provides clues on how to escape from the depths. The pundits say City of Ember has whimsy to spare, and should please younger viewers with its phantasmagorical imagery, but the plot is difficult to follow and character development is limited at best. At 46 percent on the Tomatometer, Ember doesn’t quite shine.

Nelson), some of Hollywood’s funniest fellows trying to touch one another without permission (Tag, starring&nbsp;Ed Helms,&nbsp;Jeremy Renner, and Jon Hamm), and a remade blast from the blaxploitation past (Superfly, starring Trevor Jackson&nbsp;and Jason Mitchell).&nbsp;What are the critics saying?Incredibles 2 (2018)  93%If you’re going to try and follow up an acclaimed blockbuster, you might as well take your time getting the sequel right — and in animation, where time can stand still forever, you have the added benefit of not needing to rush your cast back in front of the camera. Still, after waiting nearly 15 years for a second installment of The Incredibles, fans can be forgiven a certain amount of impatience; while the creative teams at formerly franchise-averse Pixar dreamed up new stories for the characters in Toy Story, Cars, Finding Nemo, and Monsters Inc., the ability to return to theaters continued to elude the superpowered Parr family. All that waiting has finally paid off with Incredibles 2, which reunites the original voice cast for a new adventure serving up more of the domestic turmoil, superhero satire, and brilliantly animated action that made the first one such a hit. It’d be tough to improve on the original Incredibles, and critics say that while this sequel doesn’t quite pull off that feat, it comes impressively close, adding yet another acclaimed entry to Pixar’s already estimable filmography. If you were a kid when The Incredibles&nbsp;came out, you might have kids of your own now — and like all the best stuff the studio has put out, the whole family can look forward to enjoying Incredibles 2.Tag (2018)  56%On one hand, it’s easy to believe Hollywood has long since exhausted most of the reasonable possibilities for comedy that exist in movies about grown men acting like boys. On the other, when you’ve got the Wall Street Journal writing about a real-life group of guys who take a month off every year to continue the game of tag they’ve been playing since they were kids, well, it’s awfully hard to resist the temptation to turn that into a film. Enter the descriptively titled Tag, starring Hannibal Buress, Jon Hamm, Ed Helms, Jake Johnson, and Jeremy Renner as the fellows in question — a talented bunch whose commitment to the story was reflected in the set injury Renner sustained, breaking both of his arms and necessitating some last-minute CGI limb replacements in post-production. It would be wonderful to report that Renner’s suffering came in service of one of the year’s best-reviewed action comedies; alas, the truth is that critics are kinda meh on Tag, which reviews describe as funny and engaging in fits and starts, but ultimately not consistent or committed enough to fully deliver on its premise. Still, this is one talented cast, and even the critical pans say the movie isn’t without its moments, so if you’re in the mood for some arrested development laughs, you may want to check your local listings.Superfly (2018)  51%Released in 1972, the original Superfly&nbsp;helped lead the blaxploitation wave with a thoughtful Harlem-set drama about a drug dealer looking for one last big score; the movie’s trappings may look somewhat dated today, but thanks to Ron O’Neal‘s performance as main character Youngblood Priest — not to mention a killer Curtis Mayfield soundtrack — it still feels fresh. It’s easy to understand why music video veteran Director X wanted to take a shot at updating the story, and its themes are just as relevant as they were more than 45 years ago; unfortunately, critics say those themes have mostly been lost in this new version, which is far more focused on style than substance. Starring Trevor Jackson as Priest, the 2018 edition moves the action to Atlanta, but the basic contours of the story remain the same — which is part of why a number of reviews have outlined pundits’ disappointment with the lost social subtext. This Superfly&nbsp;will make its fortune by and by, thanks to Director X’s way with an artfully arranged scene or set piece, but as is so often the case with remakes, the original still reigns supreme.What’s New on TVThe Bold Type: Season 2 (2018)  100%The Bold Type presents an aspirational yet refreshingly realistic portrait of young women’s careers, friendships and love lives in a big city.Strange Angel: Season 1 (2018)  71%A beautiful slow burn, Strange Angel shoots for the stars, but gets a little lost in its own orbit.Also&nbsp;Opening This Week In Limited Release Eating Animals (2018) , a documentary about the commercial factory farming industry and its various impacts, is at 100%.

What do the critics have to say?It seems like a can’t-miss prospect: a moody, conflicted superhero, unloved by the public despite his best efforts, played by Will Smith, aka Mr. Independence Day. However, great ideas are a dime a dozen, and critics say Hancock never fully takes flight. An attempt at a subversive take on caped crusader mythos, Smith has super-strength and a drinking problem; however, he learns to show a softer side after saving the life of a public relations expert. The pundits say Smith is solid as always, but the film quickly abandons its clever premise in favor of typical action sequences. Additionally, its shifts in tone — from wry comedy to sentiment — don’t quite cohere. At 35 percent on the Tomatometer, Hancock is not one of Smith’s signature films.“Hadouken!”With the Fourth of July on the horizon, it seems like an apt time to celebrate the can-do, go-get-’em American spirit. With that in mind, critics say you could do a lot worse than Kit Kittredge: An American Girl, an old-school, family-friendly charmer. Abigail Breslin stars as the title character, a sharp, kind, inquisitive pre-teen whose journalistic aspirations come in handy: she attempts to solve a mystery and, in the process, save her family’s house and exonerate some falsely-accused fellow citizens. The pundits say Kit is a gentle, heartfelt tale that’s both a delivery system for wholesome messages and a surprisingly moving drama. At 79 percent on the Tomatometer, the Certified Fresh Kit Kittredge has Girl power to spare.“From now on, we trust no one but the Newsies.”Also opening this week in limited release:The surreal black comedy Kabluey, starring Lisa Kudrow and Scott Prendergast (who also directs), is at 100 percent.The French thriller Tell No One, starring Kristin Scott Thomas and Francois Cluzet, is at 93 percent.Gonzo: the Life and Work of Dr. Hunter S.

What do the critics have to say?You can guess that a movie may not be worth your money when its director istrashing it, and that’s the case with the post-apocalyptic thriller BabylonA.D. Helmer Mathieu Kassovitz has gone on record as saying this Vin Diesel-starrerisn’t very good, and the critics are inclined to agree with him. Diesel plays amercenary who’s tasked with transporting a valuable package from Eastern Europeto New York and immediately gets more than he bargained for. The pundits say BabylonA.D. has moments of visual invention that are resoundingly negated by anindecipherable storyline, so-so action scenes, and shopworn tropes from otherdystopian sci-fi flicks. At five percent on the Tomatometer, Babylon A.D.is shaping up to be one of the year’s worst-reviewed films.“Put this up your nose and get your heiny to Mars.”Don Cheadle is one of contemporary cinema’s most dynamic performers, and he’sbeen able to inject a healthy dose of thoughtful politics into his roles withoutcompromising any dramatic thrust. However, critics say Traitor is caughtbetween those two impulses, and as a result, doesn’t fully cohere. Cheadle starsas a former Special Ops officer who’s suspected by an FBI agent (Guy Pearce) ofbeing involved with terrorist groups; a high-stakes game of internationalcat-and-mouse-ensues. The scribes say Traitor is smarter than youraverage spy thriller/action flick, with an intriguing take on the post-9/11political landscape. But many also feel the film doesn’t explore its themesdeeply enough, and it features a plot that’s more twisty than suspenseful. At 54percent on the Tomatometer, this Traitor tries to play both sides, butcomes up short.“I’ll tell you one more time: Umbrellas are your friends.”Steve Coogan is a sly devil; alternately calculating and ingratiating, he’s acomic actor of rare craftiness. And critics say he’s the best thing about Hamlet 2, an uneven but often hilarious musical comedy. Coogan stars as a failedthespian turned high school drama teacher whose personal and professional lifeis in disarray — until he decides to mount a controversial musical sequel to Hamletthat includes both time travel and Jesus. The pundits say Hamlet 2doesn’t often make the most of its admittedly great premise, and its satiricalaspirations often miss the mark, but Coogan’s fearless, guileless performancehelps sell it — he’s unafraid to make a fool of himself, and his energy isinfectious. At 61 percent on the Tomatometer, Hamlet 2 is more to be thannot to be.

Written and directedby Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer, Disaster Movie movie spoofs (or,perhaps more accurately, references) such disaster-themed thrillers as Juno,Enchanted, and Sex and the City.

What do the critics have to say?Ten years ago, the mere mention of a film starring Robert De Niro and Al Pacino would have raised expectations sky-high, especially after their classic scene together in Heat. Now? The critics’ reaction to Righteous Kill is little more than an indifferent shrug. The Oscar winners star as a pair of New York City detectives on the trail of a serial killer whose work appears tied to a case they handled years before. The pundits say Righteous Kill is thoroughly mediocre, cribbing tough-guy dialogue and plot twists from every cop TV show known to man, and while De Niro and Pacino are fine, the script gives them precious little to work with. At 23 percent on the Tomatometer, Righteous is no killer.“I guess Keitel was the first one to go.”It would be nearly impossible for the Coen Brothers to top the critical, commercial, and Academy success that was No Country For Old Men. So with Burn After Reading, they scale down with a lark, a stylish crime comedy that critics say is lightweight but mightily enjoyable nonetheless. Brad Pitt and Frances McDormand star as a pair of dim-witted gym employees who stumble across the memoir of a former CIA agent (John Malkovich) and, foolishly, attempt to exploit their find for personal gain; meanwhile, the spy’s wife (Tilda Swinton) is having an affair with a field marshal (George Clooney), and they get tangled up in the plot as well. The pundits say Burn may be minor Coen, but it’s stylishly crafted and features droll comic performances and an almost sublime sense of stupid fun. At 76 percent on the Tomatometer, this Burn isn’t just hot, it’s Certified Fresh. Check out this week’s Total Recall, in which we delve into the Coens’ filmography.)Looks like these two put their Michael Clayton beef behind them.Remaking a great film is a dicey proposition; it’s tough to hold on to the elements that made the original compelling while adding a contemporary, fresh spin. And critics say that The Women, despite boasting an outstanding cast, never justifies its existence. Based upon George Cukor‘s 1939 classic of the same name, The Women stars Meg Ryan as a woman who discovers her husband is cheating on her with a younger woman (Eva Mendes); she turns to her close friend (Annette Bening) for help, and ends up betraying her trust. The film doesn’t lack for acting firepower (Jada Pinket Smith Debra Messing, and Bette Midler, among others, are part of the all-female ensemble), but critics say this is a near-total misfire; it lacks the bite, the wit, and class conflict of the original, and it doesn’t offer the shopoholic pleasures of Sex and the City, making for a tepid, misconceived mess. At zero percent on the Tomatometer, The Women is one of the year’s worst-reviewed films. And in case you were wondering, the original, which starred Joan Crawford, Norma Shearer, and Rosalind Russell, is at 90 percent. (Check out Eva Mendes’ top five favorite movies of all time here.)“The only thing this trip is missing is a case of Old Milwaukee Light.”The critics have warmed (somewhat) to Tyler Perry‘s films as he’s gone along. But that doesn’t mean he’s warmed to them; as with his last couple pictures, Perry’s latest, The Family that Preys, went unseen by the scribes before release. Alfre Woodard and Kathy Bates star as old friends who struggle mightily as their families fall apart around them. Consult you family members (or perhaps even a higher power) for help in guessing that Tomatometer!Kathy Bates and Alfre Woodard in Grand Theft Auto: Middle AgeAlso opening this week in limited release:Flow: For Love of Water, a documentary about the global impact of a lack of fresh water, is at 100 percent.Secrecy, a doc about government classification of documents and programs, is at 100 percent.Moving Midway, a doc about the strange things that happen when film critic Godfrey Cheshire visits his childhood home in North Carolina, is at 80 percent.Alan Ball‘s Towelhead, a pitch-black comedy about a young Arab-American girl’s coming of age starring Aaron Eckhart and Summer Bishil, is at 55 percent.YPF, a wacky Canadian bedroom farce with an unprintable title, is at 46 percent.Recent Robert De Niro Movies:76% — Stardust (2007)20% — Arthur and the Invisibles (2007)56% — The Good Shepherd (2006)12% — Hide and Seek (2005)5% — The Bridge of San Luis Rey (2005)Recent Al Pacino Movies:6% — 88 Minutes (2008)70% — Ocean’s Thirteen (2007)21% — Two for the Money (2005)70% — William Shakespeare’s The Merchant of Venice (2004)82% — Angels in America (2003)","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"natural, 21st, SundanceTV, Broadway, space, impossible, Competition","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Critics-Consensus-Kill-Isnt-Righteous-Burn-Is-Hot"},{"id":"47508798445397","title":"Critics Consensus: Rocker Doesn’t Roll; Death Race Sputters","content":"Critics Consensusvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Critics Consensus: Rocker Doesn't Roll; Death Race SputtersPlus, The House Bunny doesn't hop, and The Longshots fails to convert.by Tim Ryan | August 21, 2008 |  CommentsThis week at the movies, we’ve got rock ‘n’ roll dreams (The Rocker, starring Rainn Wilson and Christina Applegate), a Playboy Mansion exile (The House Bunny, starring Anna Faris), deadly motorsports (Death Race, starring Jason Statham and Tyrese Gibson), and a female Pop Warner star (The Longshots, starring Ice Cube and Keke Palmer). What do the critics have to say?The middle-aged outcast with a burning desire to rock has practically become a genre onto itself, but critics say The Rocker plays more like a B-side than a stadium anthem. Rainn Wilson stars as Robert “Fish” Fishman, a drummer who was booted from a hair metal band just before the group’s big break. Twenty years later, his nephew needs a drummer for his garage band, and Fish eagerly joins — much to the consternation of his teenage band mates. Now, Wilson is a very funny actor, but the scribes say that despite his best efforts, The Rocker feels secondhand — it’s predictable and slight, and doesn’t sing like School of Rock, the film to which it’s been inevitably compared. At 37 percent on the Tomatometer, this Rocker doesn’t go to 11. (Check out this week’s Total Recall, a compendium of cinema’s finest fake bands.)“This bores me. Is anyone up for a game of… basketball?”Anna Faris may be one of the freshest comic actors in Hollywood, but critics say her natural charisma isn’t enough to salvage The House Bunny. Faris stars as a Bunny who gets evicted from the Playboy Mansion and takes refuge in a sorority house, where she teaches the sisters lessons imparted to her from Hef. The pundits say The House Bunny is way too formulaic to hold together — and some have objected to the film’s celebration of bimbos — but Faris does her best, injecting a winning personality into a picture that could use some more laughs. At 41 percent on the Tomatometer, this House isn’t all that sturdy. However, it’s the best-reviewed of director Fred Wolf‘s films, which include this year’s zero-Tomatometer Strange Wilderness.“Big money! Big money! No whammies…”If you like your movies big and noisy, with a minimum of character development, Paul W.S. Anderson is your man. Critics say his latest, Death Race, doesn’t deviate from Anderson’s established themes, nor does it provide enough of the cheap B-movie thrills it promises. Set in a post-apocalyptic wasteland, Death Race stars Jason Statham as a convict, who, along with a group of inmates, is enlisted to participate in a brutal auto race that’s being staged by the prison’s brass. According to critics, the film — a remake of the 1975 Roger Corman B-classic Death Race 2000 — is loaded with histrionic action scenes, so-so performances, and unintentional laughs, and lacks the white-knuckle thrills that a genre piece like this requires to be more than just a guilty pleasure. At 28 percent on the Tomatometer, Death Race could use a tune-up.The car wash of the future.You’re never gonna believe this: Limp Bizkit’s Fred Durst has directed a family film about a girl trying to join a boys’ football team! The sheer incongruity of that fact may be the most distinguishing thing about The Longshots, which critics say is a sweet but mostly forgettable inspirational sports flick. Durst’s fellow “Family Values” tour mate Ice Cube stars as a former football star who teaches his niece (Keke Palmer) how to play quarterback; she becomes the first girl in Pop Warner history, and leads her squad to victory. The scribes say The Longshots means well, and Palmer gives a standout performance, but the film sticks way too close to the sports movie playbook, robbing it of tension and spark. At 32 percent on the Tomatometer, The Longshots is something of a busted play.“This halftime show is strangely riveting.”Also opening this week in limited release:Dare Not Walk Alone, a documentary about the Civil Rights movement in St. Augustine, FL, is at 100 percent.The Czech import I Served the King of England, a darkly comic tale about the ups and downs in the life a likeably naive man, is at 94 percent.Trouble the Water, a doc about the resilient survivors of Hurricane Katrina, is at 93 percent.Momma’s Man, a dramedy about a middle aged man taking a trip down memory lane in his parents’ apartment, is at 88 percent.I.O.U.S.A., a doc about the U.S. government’s fiscal irresponsibility, is at 82 percent.Hamlet 2, starring Steve Coogan as a high school drama teacher who mounts an ambitious musical sequel to the Bard’s classic, is at 67 percent (check out The Play’s the Thing, our countdown of great movies about life in the theater).It’s good to see that Billy Sheehan is getting work these days.Finally, crazy props to Superzone and Rachelle13 for coming the closest to guessing Mirrors‘ 17 percent Tomatometer.Recent Ice Cube Movies:————————————-14% — First Sunday (2008)8% — Are We Done Yet?

What do thecritics have to say?Martial arts fans have long dreamed of the dayJackie Chan andJet Li would teamup.

But they also note that the action scenes are exhilarating, filled withstaggering athleticism and more than a little humor, with Chan and Li in fineform as usual. At 53 percent on the Tomatometer, this Kingdom may not beheavenly, but it’s certainly not forbidding.

Pacino plays a college professor/forensics expert who receives a death threat informing him he has — you guessedit! — 88 minutes to live. As a result, he must use his wits to narrow down thepossible suspects who might want to take his life.

What do the critics have to say?Harold and Kumar Go to White Castle was a delightful surprise — a stoner comedy that made more than a few trenchant points about American race relations. The critics say Harold and Kumar Escape from Guantanamo Bay has plenty of laughs, but is shorter on smarts than its predecessor. In Guantanamo, Harold (John Cho) and Kumar (Kal Penn) attempt to smuggle a bong onto a flight to Amsterdam, and are subsequently accused of a terrorist plot; the pair go on the run from the law, encountering babes, marijuana, and Neil Patrick Harris along the way. The pundits say this lowbrow, un-P.C. comedy has its moments, but the easy charm and originality of the original is missing. It’s currently at 54 percent on the Tomatometer. (Check out RT’s interview with John Cho here.)&nbsp;“I told you I could light it 10 times in a row!”Tina Fey is one of the brightest talents to emerge from Saturday Night Live in recent years; as an actor and writer for Mean Girls and TV’s 30 Rock, she’s proven herself to be a sharp satirist of modern times. Fey and her Baby Mama co-star Amy Poehler go a long way toward making this surrogate pregnancy comedy watchable, critics say. Fey stars as a career woman who can’t conceive a child, so she turns to a working girl (Poehler) to carry her baby; hilarity ensues when Poehler loses her job and moves in with Fey. The pundits say Baby Mama lacks the sharp wit to be a truly subversive comedy about our baby-obsessed culture, and the film too often relies on bathroom humor to generate laughs. However, they also note the cast is outstanding, with Fey and Poehler playing nicely off each other. Baby Mama currently stands at 60 percent on the Tomatometer.“Guess which one of these ladies has volunteered to enter thecontainment unit?”&nbsp;You know exactly what you’re getting with a title like Deception: an expendable potboiler with inexplicably big names attached to it. Ewan McGregor stars as a Wall Street banker who is invited into an ominous sex club by his friend (Hugh Jackman), only to become a suspect in a woman’s (Michelle Williams) disappearance. Critics say this limp thriller’s major flaw is its obsession with piling inane plot twists and turns, most of which can be easily deduced well before they arrive.

What do the critics have to say?Everybody has their off days, even Judd Apatow, whose critical winning streak comes to an end (temporarily, at least) with Drillbit Taylor. This Apatow-produced comedy stars Owen Wilson as the title character, a man who has been hired as a bodyguard for three oft-bullied teens; it turns out Taylor is wilder and crazier than he first appears. Pundits say the problem with Drillbit is that it just isn’t very funny: it doesn’t build on its premise, and offers mediocre gags, despite some decent performances. At 17 percent on the Tomatometer, Drillbit is a little dull. And it’s the worst-reviewed movie Apaptow has ever been involved with. (Apatow discussed his favorite movies with RT; click here to check it out.)Seth, Evan, and McLovin: the early years.The other two wide openers this week, Tyler Perry’s Meet the Browns and Shutter, were either embargoed or not screened for critics.

What dothe critics have to say?Criticsfelt 2005’s The Lion, The Witch, and Wardrobe was a solid,periodically stirring adaptation of C.S. Lewis’ fantasy world — but fell shortof the cinematic riches on display in theLord of the Rings and HarryPotter franchises. The critical reaction to the sequel, The Chronicles ofNarnia: Prince Caspian, is no different. The Pevensie siblings return toNarnia and discover the land is under the reign of an evil monarch; they alsorun across the true heir to the throne, the noble Prince Caspian, who plans todefeat the tyrant. The pundits say the film is handsomely mounted, with plentyof visual splendor. However, they also not the film works more as a triumph ofcraft than a stirring tale.

What do the critics have to say?Like the Grateful Dead or Star Trek, Sex and the City is a particularly polarizing pop culture touchstone. Now that the HBO cult fave has hit the big screen, it’s the critics’ turn to be divided. SATC continues the adventures of four gals in the Big Apple, each of whom is on the lookout for Mr. Right and the finest in Louis Vuitton handbags. Let’s cut to the chase: critics say if you like the show, you’ll like the movie, which expands the ribald talk and shop-till-you-drop mania to feature length. However, for the uninitiated, Sex and the City will be a slog. It currently stands at 62 percent on the Tomatometer.Samantha didn’t expect such a fierce bidding war for Jose Canseco’s World Series ringNo wonder people aren’t vacationing as much these days; they’ve got to worry about high gas prices and anonymous psychos lurking in the woods. Critics say The Strangers is a well-made, if generic, cat-and-mouse thriller. Liv Tyler and Scott Speedman star as a couple whose relationship is on the rocks. A would-be romantic getaway in a remote vacation house goes horribly wrong when a trio of masked intruders put our heroes though a series of physical and emotional torments. The pundits say first-time helmer Bryan Bertino does a solid job of maintaining tension throughout the proceedings, but the film is ultimately without much of a point beyond ticking off various slasher tropes. At 46 percent on the Tomatometer, you may not want to get to know The Strangers.“We wanted to speak with you about this exciting new product.”Also opening this week in limited release:Bigger, Stronger, Faster*, a documentary that takes a personal look at the issue of steroid use, is at 100 percent.The Foot Fist Way, the agonizingly comic tale of a small-town martial arts instructor, is at 59 percent.Stuck, starring Mena Suvari and Stephen Rea in a black comedy about a deadly hit-and-run, is at 86 percent.Wonders are Many, a doc about the staging of an operatic telling of the live of atomic bomb creator J.

What do the critics have to say?The story of a youngster who befriends a mythical beast, TheWater Horse: Legend of the Deep makes for occasionally magical familyentertainment, critics say. Sorta like E.T but with a thicker brogue, TheWater Horse tells the story of Angus (Alex Atel), who stumbles upon amysterious egg that contains a creature that grows up to be the Loch NessMonster. Pundits say that while it feels familiar and doesn’t stray too fromcoming-of-age story conventions, The Water Horse is loaded with charm anda sense of majesty, carried by strong CGI work. At 71 percent on the Tomatometer, this Water is safe to wade in for the whole family.Denzel Washington directs and stars inThe Great Debaters, the based-on-truthaccount of a group of African American college students from Texas thatchallenged the status quo.

At74 percent, Debaters is Great indeed.Teen pregnancy is not generally a topic that lends itself to hilarity.However, critics say Junois a touching, intelligent, and laugh-out-loudexception to the rule. Juno starsEllen Page asa smart, headstrong teenager who finds herself pregnant after a one night standwith her best friend (Michael Cera) and tries to deal with the repercussions. The pundits say Junois full of quirk and heart, featuring fine performances from Page, Cera,Jennifer Garner, andJason Bateman, as well as fine direction fromJason Reitmanand a precociously smart script from first-time writerDiablo Cody. At 94percent on the Tomatometer, Juno is not only Certified Fresh, it’s one of thebest-reviewed films of the year.

What do the critics have to say?Rambois back…. but is he better than ever? The critics say he’s about the same— which is a good thing if you dug Rambo III, but not if you expectedanother First Blood (or Rocky Balboa, which resurrected anothericonic Sylvester Stallone character — and Sly’s career in the process). Rambofinds our hero chillin’ in Thailand, enjoying his peaceful existence — untilthe disappearance of some aid workers draws him into conflict with thegovernment of Myanmar. Pundits say Stallone (who also directs) stages someinvolving action sequences, but overall, Rambo is unevenly paced, waytoo violent, and strangely impersonal. At 25 percent on the Tomatometer, Ramboisn’t cinema-goers’ worst nightmare, nor is it a dream come true. In fact, it’sthe worst reviewed film in the series. (Check out ourlatest Total Recall, in which RT takes a closer look at the Rambofranchise.)Rambo stealing a rebel’s iPhone, much to his agony.Ah, theInternet. It’s a place for finding information, shopping for books, meeting apotential date…. and, if you’re a serial killer, playing cat-and-mouse with theFBI. Such is the plot of Untraceable, starringDianeLane as acyber-agent tasked with tracking down a killer who slays with greater frequencywhen, after posting videos of his brutal deeds, his web traffic increases.Critics say Untraceable has its moments, but it lacks the will to makeany points about our disconnected, voyeuristic society, and instead goes forcheap, grisly shocks. At 17 percent on the Tomatometer, Untraceable maybe where you draw the line.“What should I Netflix tonight?

Critics say thelow-budget How She Move is deeper and more energetic than others of itsilk. Move tells the story of a young woman grieving the death of herolder sister who enters a step dancing competition to earn money for privateschool tuition — and a way out of her grim surroundings. The story may be as oldas the hills, but pundits say How She Move is elevated by a commandingdebut performance byRutinaWesley, as well as some excellent choreography and asense of urgency.

What do thecritics have to say?WillFerrell has made a mini-career for himself yuking it up in wacky sportscomedies. Some, likeTalladega Nights and Bladesof Glory, werewinners with the critics, while others (Kicking and Screaming, anyone?)have fallen below the Mendoza Line. It appears the pundits are putting hislatest, Semi-Pro, in the latter category. Ferrell stars as Jackie Moon,the owner of a struggling American Basketball Association (yep, the league withthe red, white, and blue ball) squad that’s on the verge of folding; worse, theNBA may soon buy the only solvent ABA squads, so the team has to start winningin a hurry. The pundits say that while Semi-Pro offers occasional laughs,its shooting percentage isn’t all that high; it’s never as deliriously funny asit should be, and sags under the weight of too much sentiment.

What do the critics have to say?Theperiod romance/war drama Atonement has been generating some serious Oscarbuzz, and critics say it’s a worthy awards-season entry. Based uponIan McEwan‘swidely praised novel, Atonement tells the story of Brionly (SaoirseRonan), a 13-year-old who (intentionally or not) sabotages a budding romancebetween her posh sister Cecilia (Keira Knightley) and the more blue-collar Robbie (James McAvoy); with World War II on the horizon, all three of their lives willchange forever. Critics say directorJoe Wright‘s adaptation does an outstandingjob of translating the source material’s multilayered complexity to the screenwhile maintaining a riveting sense of irony and romantic longing throughout;strong performances from Knightley, McAvoy, and newcomer Ronan don’thurt, either.

What do thecritics have to say?If you’relooking for subtlety,Roland Emmerich is not your man. That’s not to say he’s abad filmmaker; he’s made some quality big-budget, high-concept yarns (IndependenceDay springs to mind) that deliver thrills aplenty. Unfortunately, critics sayhis latest, 10,000 B.C., is mired in the stone age. B.C. starsSteven Strait andCamilla Belle as a pair of hunting-and-gathering honeys; whenBelle gets kidnapped, Strait and members of their tribe journey into the unknownto save her — and run across saber-toothed tigers, wooly mammoths, and othercivilizations. The pundits say 10,000 B.C. doesn’t lack for compellingvisuals, but it’s weak on plot and characterization and filled withunintentional comedy. At 12 percent on the Tomatometer, 10,000 B.C. is aMesolithic mess. It’s also the worst-reviewed film of Emmerich’s career.“Jiminy Jilickers! Just missed the Red Bull Flugtag!”WithCollege Road Trip,Martin Lawrence joinsIce Cube andRobin Williams in the pantheonof once-edgy performers toplining poorly-reviewed family road trip comedies.Lawrence stars as the overbearing father of Melanie (Raven-Symone), whose plan for a just-the-girls trip to look at schoolsis undermined by her dad’s insistence on going along for the ride; subsequently,laffs are had and lessons are learned, at least in theory. The pundits say RoadTrip features over-the-top gags and a remarkable shortage of comicimagination. At zero percent on the Tomatometer, this is the worst-reviewed filmof Lawrence’s career, edging out the five percent Big Momma’s House 2.Maiden voyage of the Battleship Pigtemkin.Aftertouring the martial arts circuit in movies like The Transporter and War,Jason Statham returns to his grimy thriller roots with The Bank Job.Based on the real-life 1971 robbery of security deposit boxes, he stars as apetty thug in over his head as the job spirals out of control. It’s a throwbackto the heist movies of yore, and according to the critics (to quote The FrenchConnection‘s tagline) the time is right for an out-and-out thriller like this.Director Roger Donaldson never lets the pace flag, forging a movie that’sdramatic, funny, and plain entertaining.

What do the critics have to say?Romantic comedies are often the most difficult films to pull off; you needpalpable chemistry between the leads, inspired jokes, and a delicate sense ofcomic timing. Good luck finding those attributes in Good Luck Chuck,critics say. Dane Cook stars as a guy who’s the victim of a curse, one in whichany woman who dates him finds true love — with someone else. Enter Jessica Albaas a penguin-lover who really digs him. Can she break the curse? Critics say themovie seems to be under a spell of its own, one in which potential laughs aresquandered by means of rude humor, shopworn slapstick, and an ultimately cheesyresolution.

While critics agreeBynes is a talented actress who’s rescued movies in the past, her comic skillsgo largely to waste here on a script that functions completely on stereotypesand does little to plant new twists on the classicfairy tale. In fact, the scribes say the unsubtle references to Snow White lorein the movie are jarring and distracting. At 46 percent Tomatometer, SydneyWhite is one poisoned apple.\"Tomatometers that big gotta be fake.\"With Eastern Promises,David Cronenberg continues to utilize genretrappings for his singular dark, bold vision.

Eight million ways to die (\"Final Destination 3\"). Harrison Ford looking frantic, then looking really, really mad (\"Firewall\"). The Man in the Yellow Hat (\"Curious George\"). It could only be one thing: this week’s wide releases!Steve Martin and Shawn Levy have some pretty big shoes to fill — namely, Peter Sellers‘ and Blake Edwards‘ — with their revival of \"The Pink Panther.\" And critics say that, to quote Inspector Clouseau, they have failed where others have succeeded. The new film is a prequel to the famed series; the French government can’t find a master detective, so Jacques Clouseau is recruited to solve a murder. Critics say the movie isn’t all that bad, but Martin, funny as he is, is not Sellers, who broke the mold for the character. At 31 percent on the Tomatometer, this is one is a \"beumbe.\"\"Final Destination\" fans, you know the drill: A group of kids didn’t get on a plane that exploded, thereby cheating death, so therefore, death, in the form of Rube Goldberg, is out to get them. It’s amazing that they’ve made three movies that began with such a premise. What’s even more amazing is the fact that, according to the scribes, they keep getting better. \"Final Destination 3\" is currently at 52 percent on the Tomatometer (the original: 31 percent; the sequel: 46 percent). Still, the scribes say this one doesn’t quite transcend the genre.Is there anyone in the movies who’s better at looking frantic than Harrison Ford? And is there anyone who’s played more characters defending their families from danger? \"Firewall\" tells the story of a bank security expert who must rescue his wife and child from a ruthless kidnapper. Despite a high-tech update to the formula, critics say this shopworn thriller is more dour and less energetic than similar efforts. At 30 percent on the Tometometer, critics say to block this \"Firewall.\"There’s something we’ve been curious about_: Would animated features ever return to a simpler, gentler tone, jettisoning non-stop antics and pop culture references? The answer is yes, and it comes in the form of everyone’s favorite inquisitive simian, \"Curious George.\" The critics say the sheer joyful modesty of this enterprise is one of its best qualities, and the crisp 2-D animation is bright and colorful.

What do the critics have to say?First, the bad news: critics say Beowulf will inspire English teachersand literary scholars to tear out their hair. The good news? The scribes alsosay it’s a flick that fans of bombastic action and phantasmagoria will want givetheir right arms for. If you didn’t read the epic poem in school, get thee to alibrary; suffice to say the story involves a dude named Beowulf (Ray Winstone)tangling with mead hall-crashing beast Grendel (Crispin Glover) andhis vengeful, seductive mom (Angelina Jolie, much more attractive than her fictionalprogeny would indicate). The pundits say Beowulf‘s amazing visuals arethe biggest draw here, as directorRobert Zemeckis uses dazzling CGI to bringthe classic tale to vivid life. (They also note it’s not for the kiddies,despite its PG-13 rating.) At 79 percent, Beowulf is Certified Fresh, andit’s well above Zemeckis’ previous animation/live-action hybrid, The PolarExpress (57 percent). (Andcheck outour Total Recall feature on Beowulf and animation.)Grendel waiting until somebody invents Jergens.Everyone can use a dose of magic and whimsy from time to time, right? Butfrippery requires a light touch, something critics say Mr. Magorium’s WonderEmporium lacks. Emporium starsDustin Hoffman in the title role asthe proprietor of a magic toy store, a place where baubles can come to life,fueled by imagination;Natalie Portman plays his protégé. The pundits say thebig problem with Mr. Magorium’s Wonder Emporium is that it ODs onzaniness in an effort to make up for a bland storyline. At 24 percent on theTomatometer, business isn’t all that brisk at this Emporium.“Does Mr. Magorium sell cornballers?”Nobel Prize-winnerGabriel Garcia Marquezis widely acknowledged to be one of the world’s great men of letters.Javier Bardem, hot from his performance in NoCountry for Old Men, stars in the adaptation of one of Marquez’ mostcelebrated works, Love in the Time of Cholera. Unfortunately, critics sayit’s more like Love in the Time of Narcolepsy. Bardem stars as a man whois so enraptured by a woman he waits 50 years for her, despite her shiftingaffections. The pundits say Love misses the spirit and passion ofMarquez’ magical realist tale by miles, with fine actors in miscast roles and atoo-literal approach, bogging down material that has a sense of sweep andromanticism on the page.

What do the critics have to say?The highly-anticipated The Golden Compass is the first of PhilipPullman’s novels to hit the screen. It has a veritable Murderer’s Row of actingtalent (Nicole Kidman,Sam Elliott,Eva Green,Daniel Craig,Ian McKellen,TomCourtenay, Derek Jacobi,Ian McShane,Christopher Lee, andnewcomerDakotaBlue Richards). And critics say it’s got visual flash to spare. Unfortunately, theyalso largely feel Compass is a little too cold to work any kind of spell.The film tells the story of a 12-year-old girl attempting to save her friendfrom the strange, malevolent Gobblers, and finds herself in a realm of mysteryand fantastical beings.

What do the critics have to say?For Rhode Islanders, the work ofBobby andPeter Farrelly has long been a sourceof regional pride; their best work (There’s Something About Mary, Dumband Dumber) deftly combined taboo-busting, gross-out yucks with anundeniable sweetness. So it breaks the heart of this Ocean State native toreport that their latest, The Heartbreak Kid, isn’t generating all thatmuch warmth with the critics. Based uponElaine May‘s 1972 semi-classic, Kidstars Ben Stiller as a recently-married guy who quickly learns his new bride hasmuch more baggage than he bargained for; on his honeymoon, he meets Miranda(Michelle Monhagan), who just might be the right gal for him. The pundits saythat while the film does contain a smattering of raunchy laughs, they seemedshoehorned into the film, undercutting character development and any kind ofmessage. At 48 percent on the Tomatometer, this Kid isn’t alright. It’scertainly a cut below the original (at 89 percent).The Village People recruits its seventh member.If a compelling, magical fantasy world is something you’re actively seeking,critics say you may want to avoid The Seeker. Based upon the NewberryAward-winning book series, The Seeker is the story of a 14-year-old whodiscovers he’s the last in a long line of noble fighters dedicated to battlingan evil force called the Dark. (Uh, so was Thomas Edison, like, the greatest ofthose warriors? Just asking.) Critics say The Seeker is several notchesbelow the Harry Potter films in terms of emotional resonance andfilmmaking quality, and underutilizes the talents ofIan McShane andFrancesConroy. At 25 percent on the Tomatometer, The Seeker may not be whatyou’re looking for.They seek him here, they seek him there, his clothes are loud butnever square.If your sensibilities run toward action flicks, you are likely prejudicedagainst light comedies about smart people and their relationship troubles. Inthe case of The Jane Austen Book Club, the critics say you might want toswallow your pride. The film tells the story of a group of six women whose bookclub assignment is for each to read one of Austen’s novels; they soon findevents in their lives eerily paralleling the texts they’re reading. The criticssay that what could have been a bland exercise in chick-flick-dom is elevated byan outstanding cast that includes Maria Bello, Emily Blunt, andKathy Baker;each of the principals plays her part with intelligence and warmth. If you’re soinclined, The Jane Austen Book Club‘s 72 percent Tomatometer should offerample persuasion to check this film out.\"Okay, so you take a left after Northanger Abbey, and a right at Mansfield Park…\"Critics weren’t allowed to come on and Feel the Noise, perhaps becauseit’s either too wild, wild, wild for them to understand, or it isn’t all thatgood.

What do the critics have to say?It’s a crime flick starring Denzel Washington and Russell Crowe that’s directedby Ridley Scott. How could this possibly go wrong? According to critics, itcan’t. American Gangster tells the story of a low-level criminal(Washington) who moves up the ladder when his boss dies; Crowe plays anoutcast cop on his trail. Pundits say Gangster is a remarkable entry intothe crime genre, with excellent performances, a compelling sense of moralambiguity, and an outstanding eye for 1970s period detail. At 80 percent on the Tomatometer, American Gangster is Certified Fresh. (Check outthis week’s Total Recall, where we examine some notable organized crime films from thepast.)\"Pour your salt like this from now on or you’re out of the gang.\"Jerry Seinfeld lends his distinctive brand of observational humor to Bee Movie, a CGI feature about ourpollen-producing pals and their interactions with people. Seinfeld stars as the voice of a recent bee graduatelooking for a purpose in life. Leaving the hive for the first time, he comesinto contact with a human (Renée Zellweger) and becomes concerned overhumanity’s rampant consumption of honey. Critics say Bee Movie iselevated by Seinfeld’s witty humor, but otherwise, this is an amiable butforgettable affair. At 57 percent on the Tomatometer, this is no killer Bee.(Check out RT’s interview with Seinfeldhere.)That’s gold, Jerry, gold!On a good day, John Cusack is one of the most likeable actors in the movies. Unfortunately, he can’t sell a middling script. InThe Martian Child, Cusackstars as a widowed sci-fi writer who forms a bond with a boy who hides in anAmazon.com box and claims to be an extraterrestrial; strange events lendcredence to his claims. Critics say that Cusack and 10-year-oldBobby Coleman are excellent, but they bemoan the film’s story, which takes an intriguing premise and weighs it down with clichés andsappiness.

Starring Lil Wayne and Big Boi). What do the critics have to say?\nThe wait is finally over: The Simpsons have migrated from the confines of television to the silver (or is that yellow?) screen. The result? Well, maybe not the “best…. movie… ever,” but pundits say it’s still pretty exxxxx-cellent. Homer, responsible for an eco-disaster, piles Marge, Bart, Lisa, and Maggie into the car and leaves Springfield for Alaska (you were expecting Capital City?). Ah, but who cares about the plot? The critics say The Simpsons Movie is essentially an extra-long episode of the show, but one that contains plenty of the S-M-R-T jokes, killer slapstick, and poignancy that fans have come to expect. At 84 percent on the Tomatometer, The Simpsons Movie is Certified Fresh. Release the hounds.\n\nMmmmm, Flaming Homer!\n\nNo Reservations joins a list of movies (Eat Drink Man Woman, Like Water for Chocolate, Sideways) about the intersection between the taste buds and the heartstrings; unfortunately, the pundits say this one is bland, under-nourishing, and a bunch of other food metaphors. Catherine Zeta-Jones stares as Kate, a master chef who is at first threatened, then inspired, by the presence of rising culinary star Nick (Aaron Eckhart) in the kitchen of an upscale New York restaurant. Critics say No Reservations is appealingly presented, but its combination of predictability and melancholy make it hard to swallow. At 38 percent on the Tomatometer, critics have some Reservations about this one.\n\n“I told you not to do a Zorro sequel!”\n\nWhen it comes to making movies about the struggle between man and nature, German director Werner Herzog is one of the greats, with such masterpieces as Aguirre, the Wrath of God, Fitzcarraldo, and Grizzly Man to his credit. Add Rescue Dawn to that list. Rescue Dawn stars Christian Bale as Dieter Dengler, a Navy pilot who, after crash-landing in the jungles of Laos, must escape imprisonment and navigate the treacherous depths of the jungle. Critics say Dawn is the closest that Herzog has made to an inspiring popcorn flick, albeit one that challenges viewers’ expectations and doesn’t shortchange the horror or despair of the situation. At 89 percent on the Tomatometer, this is one emotional Rescue. (Check out RT’s take here.)\n\nCrowd surfing on two broken legs is not recommended.\n\nTwo of this week’s wide releases contain mysteries unlikely to be solved before they hit theaters. The makers of I Know Who Killed Me aren’t letting critics in on their little secret. Nor will we learn the identity of your caddy, as Who’s Your Caddy? was also withheld from scribes. Killed features troubled starlet Lindsay Lohan as a college student who escapes abduction and torture. Caddy stars Big Boi and Lil Wayne in a film that features the most golf course antics this side of Dorf.

What do the critics have to say?\nThe third in a series is rarely the best — witness the critical response to the latest Shrek and Spidey installments. However, if you found the thrills and chills of The Bourne Identity and Supremacy too sedate, you’re in luck; critics say The Bourne Ultimatum is one of the most exciting, action-paced movies of the summer, and is easily the best in the series (not too shabby, considering the other two were both Certified Fresh). Yet again, Matt Damon isn’t really sure who he is or how he became such an awesome killing machine, and yet again, he’s on the run from the authorities. But in this episode, pundits say Damon really comes into his own as an action star here, and director Paul Greengrass is well on his way to becoming an auteur of commercial filmmaking. Critics say the dizzying camerawork, rapid-fire editing, and overall craftsmanship make for one wild ride. At 92 percent on the Tomatometer, this may be the ultimate Bourne.\n\nDamon’s still hunting, but not for goodwill.\nCritics are musing: is Bratz much better than Barbie? Since 2001, the ethnically diverse dolls have built an empire based on their unique brand of girl power and lip gloss, including this film adaptation featuring four girls overcoming their differences and joining together in holy BFFness.  But critics deem Bratz: The Movie a vapid and clueless enterprise, with characters who don’t seem to have any discernable characteristics beyond fashion and material wealth.  And it freely employs stereotypes (girls must be skinny, boys must be dreamy, and adults are idiots) while paradoxically arguing stereotypes are bad. At 11 percent Tomatometer, these Bratz need a lesson in filmmaking.\n\n“Picking Bad Movies To Star In For Dummies.” \nYou loved him when he was drinking Mr. Pibb with a Red Vines straw, and you loved him when he was cutting holes in boxes.

Superbad tells thestory of two geeks (Michael Cera and Jonah Hill) on the cusp of graduation whoreally, really want to change their luck with the ladies. The pundits say Superbad is as raunchy and cheerfully vulgar as any comedy you’re likely tosee this summer, but it’s also remarkably wise and poignant regarding theawkwardness of the high school years. At 92 percent, Superbad surpasses Knocked Up‘s Tomatometer score, which means that it’s one of the bestreviewed films of the year. (Check out our interview with the Superbadgang here.)“Those RT critics crack me up.”TheInvasion arrives in theaters with plenty of baggage. The film, helmedby OliverHirschbiegel (Downfall),originally wrapped in 2006, but the studio allegedly balked at what they saw,and it’s rumored that a good portion of the final product is the result of aretooled script by theWachowskibrothers and reshoots byV for VendettadirectorJamesMcTeigue. Such Hollywood intrigue may ultimately prove more interesting thanthe film itself, as critics say The Invasion is a pretty tepid,unsuspenseful remake of an already thrice-adapted story (Invasionof the Body Snatchers). After a space shuttle crash, Nicole Kidman andDaniel Craig discover that an infection is taking over peoples’ bodies in theirsleep, turning them into unemotional quasi-zombies. The pundits say the film isslick but unfocused, lacking psychological complexity and thrills. At 16 percenton the Tomatometer, The Invasion sits far below the precedent set by the 1956 and1978 Body Snatchers, both at 100 percent.They couldn’t hide their horror upon seeing the Wachowski Bros. re-cut.It appears the folks behind The Last Legion are afraid the number ofpundits who wouldn’t dig their movie would be, ahem, legion.

What do the critics have to say?\nIt’s been a good couple years for sophomoric sports comedy; Dodgeball and Blades of Glory each earned cackles by taking the seriousness of athletic competition to absurd heights — and throwing in plenty of raunch. But juvenilia only goes so far; you need a little something more to generate laughs… And critics say laughs are in short supply in Balls of Fury. Randy Daytona (Dan Fogler) is a washed-up pro table tennis player recruited to infiltrate the deadly world of underground extreme ping pong, in which the diabolical Feng (Christopher Walken) oversees a deadly tournament of serve-and-volley. It’s a funny premise, but critics say despite some yucks, Balls runs out of steam pretty quickly, and lacks the sharp comic edge of other sports comedies. At 28 percent on the Tomatometer, Balls of Fury is getting paddled. (Read our interview with Fogler here.)\n\nOne can’t fault James Wan for trying to branch out a little. With Death Sentence, the man behind Saw and Dead Silence moves from straight horror to the realm of the psychological thriller. After his child is brutally murdered, devoted family man Nick Hume (Kevin Bacon) aims for revenge, and goes gunning for a violent gang that committed the crime. It’s not a bad premise; heck, it worked pretty well in Death Wish, and A History of Violence ventured into the darker realms of an everyman’s outwardly placid façade. But critics say as Death Sentence goes along, it slides into the land of unintentional comedy, gruesome violence, and a mixed message about the nature of vigilantism. At nine percent on the Tomatometer, Death Sentence is facing the critical firing squad.

What do the critics have to say?After a slight stumble with \"Cars,\" \"Ratatouille\" marks a semi-return to form for Pixar. This animated flick stars Remy (voiced by Patton Oswalt), a rat whose aspirations to become a chef land him in a struggling restaurant’s kitchen, where he befriends a hapless garbage boy (Lou Romano). While critics are floored by the stunning leap in animation quality that Pixar seems to make with each movie, they’re equally impressed by \"Ratatouille\"’s fast pacing, memorable characters, and overall good humor. And like director Brad Bird‘s previous film, \"The Incredibles,\" \"Ratatouille\" juggles themes of identity and individualism without being heavy-handed. \"At 90 percent Tomatometer, the Certified Fresh \"Ratatouille\" is a movie to savor. (Check out RT’s interview with Patton Oswalt.)\"You like me…you really like me!\"Despite the title, the setting for the latest \"Die Hard\" isn’t New Hampshire; it’s Washington, D.C., where a group of super-hackers (led by Timothy Olyphant) are plotting to attack America’s computer infrastructure and bring the nation to its knees. McClane teams with a cyber geek to stop them; rousing pyrotechnics ensue. Critics say that while the plot is beyond preposterous, it’s of little matter with stunts and action this exhilarating and intense. And they also note that Bruno settles nicely into his iconic role. At 77 percent on the Tomatometer, \"Live Free\" is not only Certified Fresh, it’s the second-best-reviewed \"Die Hard\" after the original. (Check out RT’s interview with Bruce Willis here.)Just another day at the office for McClane.Wherever Michael Moore goes, cameras, and controversy, follow. That’s certainly the case for \"Sicko\"; Moore’s latest doc, which compares and contrasts our privatized health care with other health care systems abroad, has gotten him in hot water with the Bush administration over a potentially embargo-violating Cuban medical trip. But Moore is finding much love among critics, who call it a mature, humanistic film. They praise Moore’s decision to spend much of the time off-screen, allowing the events to convince and anger on their own merits. At 89 percent Tomatometer, \"Sicko\" is Certified Fresh and just what the doctor ordered. (Check out RT’s interview with Michael Moore.)\"Anyone know where I can get some freedom fries?\"Like so many other ambitious, richly layered novels adapted into films, \"Evening\" is what some critics call impossible to translate faithfully to the big screen. Assembling a dazzling cast, \"Evening\" stars Vanessa Redgrave as terminally ill mother who recounts to her children an affair she had as a young woman (played by Claire Danes). Critics call it a melodramatic artsy film, one that tries to go for emotional uplift, but with plot devices and character arcs that are too obvious to be genuinely affecting. At 32 percent Tomatometer, \"Evening\" falls and tumbles.A few actors trying to make a quick getaway.Also opening this week in limited release: \"Ghosts of Cité Soleil,\" a harrowing portrait of the titular Haitian slum, is at 81 percent; \"Over the GW,\" an autobiographical look into rehab, is at 80 percent; \"In Between Days,\" a coming of age story with a Korean twist, is at 77 percent; and \"Vitus,\" a drama about a young musical prodigy, is at 69 percent.Recent Pixar Movies———————————-76% — \"Cars\"97% — \"The Incredibles\"98% — \"Finding Nemo\"95% — \"Monster’s Inc.\"100% — \"Toy Story 2\"","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"rom-coms, Fox, Classic, Winter, nbcuniversal, Trivia, TV, Mary, service, Cannes, Schedule","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Critical-Consensus-Ratatouille-is-Tasty-Die-Hard-is-Solid-Sicko-is-Socko-Evening-Falls"},{"id":"47508803522445","title":"Critical Consensus: Hairspray is Certified Fresh; Chuck And Larry is On The Rocks","content":"Critics Consensusvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Critical Consensus: Hairspray is Certified Fresh; Chuck And Larry is On The RocksHow much cross-dressing and gay innuendo can one Friday handle?by Tim Ryan | July 19, 2007 |  CommentsThis week at the movies, we’ve got straight firemen in a domestic partnership(INow Pronounce You Chuck and Larry, starringAdam Sandler,Kevin James,and Jessica Biel),and John Travolta in drag (Hairspray,also starring Michelle Pfeiffer, Queen Latifah, and Amanda Bynes). What do the critics have to say?On a good day, AdamSandler is one of the funniest people on the planet. And with Punch-DrunkLove and Reign Over Me, he’s proven himself to be a capable dramaticactor as well. Unfortunately, critics say his latest, INow Pronounce You Chuck and Larry, does not represent much of a creativeadvance for New Hampshire’s favorite son. Sandler andKevin Jamesstar as two Brooklyn firefighters who, in a bind, pretend to be a gay couple toqualify for domestic partnership benefits. While the film’s moral is anadmirable one (homophobia isn’t kosher), critics say Chuck and Larrytries to have it both ways by utilizing shopworn gay stereotypes for laughsbefore arriving at a preachy message of tolerance. At 21 percent on theTomatometer, I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry has the wedding bellblues.Jessica Biel in Catwoman 2: The Reckoning.&nbsp;Rowr!With all the goodwill thatJohn Waters’1988 cult classic has inspired, some may have wondered if world need anothermovie version of Hairspray.

What do the critics have to say?For those who dig stargazing, \"Ocean’s Eleven\" must have seemed like a gift from heaven. Featuring George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Matt Damon, Julia Roberts, and Don Cheadle, and directed by the always interesting Steven Soderbergh, it was a heist movie with some good laughs and a sleek design. \"Ocean’s Twelve\" may have been of a trifle, but it got by on the sheer fun of watching a bunch of big name stars having a good time. Now the gang is back with \"Ocean’s Thirteen,\" and critics say it’s loaded with the same stylish, unpretentious charm as the first two. This time, the crew plots to undermine a big-time casino mogul, played by Al Pacino, who swindled one of the gang. \"Ocean’s Thirteen\" may not be the height of cinematic profundity, but pundits say it’s a slick, entertaining piece of mainstream entertainment. At 70 percent, this one is a lucky \"Thirteen.\" However, it’s still a notch below the original (original remake?), which stands at 81 percent.Alternate scene take from \"Garden State.\"With the release of \"Saw\" and \"Hostel,\" critics devised a label for the sub-genre of particularly grisly slasher flicks: torture porn. Within this sub-set, Eli Roth is emerging as an auteur; in addition to his howlingly funny (and completely depraved) fake trailer for \"Thanksgiving\" in \"Grindhouse,\" Roth brings us \"Hostel: Part II.\" Yet again, American college students fall into the clutches of sicko Europeans obsessed with torture. Critics say that while many will be repulsed by what they see (if they see \"Hostel: Part II\" at all), Roth’s filmmaking craftsmanship has markedly improved, with better developed characters and some sly political commentary — in addition to oodles of gore. But other critics say Roth’s work is still in service to brutally disgusting material. \"Hostel: Part II\" is at 64 percent on the Tomatometer.\"I’m trying a new method today. I call it ‘Uwe Boll Marathon.’\"Can’t get enough of cinematic penguins? How about animated penguins? Well, if \"March of the Penguins\" and \"Happy Feet\" didn’t sate your appetite for the antics of those well-dressed, flightless residents of Antarctica, now comes \"Surf’s Up.\" Sort of a \"Waiting for Guffman\" for the kiddie set, the movie goes behind the scenes — mockumentary style — at the Penguin World Surfing Championships, where young upstart Cody Maverick (voiced by Shia LaBeouf) hopes to make a splash. The critics say many of the gags will soar like eagles over the heads of the little ones, but \"Surf’s Up\" is a laid-back, witty frolic.

What do the critics have to say?When director Judd Apatow titles a movie, you always know what to expect. Like, what else could something called \"The 40-Year-Old-Virgin\" possibly have been about? And Apatow’s newest flick, \"Knocked Up,\" is just as bluntly advertised: a perpetually stoned schlub (Seth Rogen) impregnates a woman way out of his league (Katherine Heigl) after a one-night stand, putting the kibosh on his arrested development. But, like \"Virgin,\" \"Knocked\" has a sweetness and depth that extends well beyong most comedies; critics call it a hilarious, poignant, and refreshing look at the rigors of courtship and child-rearing, with a sometimes raunchy, always witty script that is ably acted and directed. At 88 percent on the Tomatometer, \"Knocked Up\" isn’t just Certified Fresh, it even tops \"Virgin\"’s 82 percent.\"Magenta?\"In \"Mr. Brooks,\" Kevin Costner plays a successful businessman and loving father with a big secret: he’s a serial killer on the down low. It’s an admittedly intriguing setup, and critics say \"Mr. Brooks\" gives its talented cast, which includes Demi Moore, William Hurt, and Dane Cook (!) a chance to take on some meaty roles, as well as providing audiences with some amusing, smarter-than-average plot twists and thrills. Unfortunately, the pundits also note that \"Mr. Brooks\" is overstuffed with said twists, making for a film that becomes more preposterous as it goes along. \"Mr. Brooks\" currently stands at 53 percent on the Tomatometer.\"They call me Mister Brooks!\"\"Gracie\" is the latest in a long line of inspirational sports movies that feature a dogged protagonist overcoming prejudice and family trauma. The film, a fictional treatment of star Elisabeth Shue’s high school sports career, tells the story of a 15-year-old (Carly Schroeder) who wants to play soccer at a time when there isn’t a girls’ squad at her school. Couple the sexism Gracie faces with the tragic death of her brother, and you’ve got the stuff that sports movies are made of, right? Well, critics say that \"Gracie\" can be rousing and touching in spots, but it’s ultimately undone by its predictable story arc and a lack of nuance.

And while \"Robinsons\" may not be up to the level of those Disney animated spectacles of old, critics say it’s a fun ride nonetheless. In his quest to find a family that will take him in, Lewis is instead whisked away to the future, where he encounters singing frogs, dinosaurs, and flying cars — all in three dimensions! The critics say the action in \"Meet the Robinsons\" is so frenetic that it makes the antics of Tigger seem positively sedate, but it’s also witty and touching. At 76 percent on the Tomatometer, the pundits are sending a warm coo coo ca-choo to \"Meet the Robinsons.\"Say hello to the American family Robinsons.For those of you who’ve long wondered what the nexus between \"The Cutting Edge\" and \"Elf\" would look like, wait no longer: \"Blades of Glory\" is here. Will Ferrell and Jon Heder star as rival figure skaters who, after an embarrassing throwdown at the World Championships, team up for a shot at redemption. Critics say \"Blades of Glory\" has its share of laughs and an air of transcendental silliness, but it’s not disciplined enough to ensure that those moments translate into a successful whole. At 63 percent on the Tomatometer, \"Blades\" ain’t dull, but it isn’t sharp enough, either.\"This is our assistant. If you think she’s cute now, you should’ve seen her a couple years ago.\"Joseph Gordon-Levitt may not be Robert Mitchum, but with \"Brick\" and, now, \"The Lookout,\" he’s carving out a distinct niche in the world of film noir. Gordon-Levitt plays a brain-damaged janitor who gets roped into a bank-heist scheme, and then attempts to turn the tables. Critics say screenwriter Scott Frank (\"Out of Sight,\" \"Minority Report\"), in his directorial debut, does a terrific job creating believable characters, sharp dialogue, and an engrossing storyline, while Gordon-Levitt continues to prove he’s a talent to watch. At 82 percent on the Tomatometer, you may want to \"Lookout\" for this one.Joseph Gordon-Levitt doing more lookout duty for Jeff Daniels.Also opening this week in limited release: \"U-Carmen,\" a version of Bizet’s opera set in contemporary South Africa, is at 100 percent on the Tomatometer; \"Killer of Sheep,\" Charles Burnett’s seminal, long-lost examination of life in Watts, is at 93 percent; the Oscar nominated Danish import \"After the Wedding\" is at 84 percent; \"Summer in Berlin,\" a tale of two women who are unlucky in love, is at 80 percent; the re-released \"Peaceful Warrior,\" a philosophical gymnastics movie starring Nick Nolte, is at 21 percent; and \"The Hawk is Dying,\" starring Paul Giamatti and Michelle Williams, is at 18 percent.No, it’s not \"American Anthem.\" It ain’t even \"Gymkata.\"And finally, we’d like to give a special shout-out to -eternity- (whose moniker is an obvious reference to the work of Greek director Theo Angelopoulos) for coming closest to guessing \"The Hills have Eyes II\"’s 15 percent Tomatometer.

But when the other one features Tobey Maguire in red spandex (\"Spider-Man 3,\" also starring Kirsten Dunst), what more do you really need? And how do the critics feel about it?After a three year wait, a budget approaching $300 million, and about that many Internet rumors and news postings, the wait is over: \"Spider-Man 3\" is here. The third installment finds Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) wrestling with a bevy of problems: an angry best friend (James Franco), a man made of sand (Thomas Haden Church), a slimy nemesis (Topher Grace), and an unhappy fiancée (Kirsten Dunst). Though critics are still wowed by Sam Raimi’s action sequences and clever mix of comedy and melodrama, some say it’s overstuffed and lacks the emotional punch of the first two Spidey flicks. At 64 percent on the Tomatometer (and a rotten 45 percent among Cream of the Crop critics), this \"Spider-Man\" isn’t totally amazing.\"Do you have any tape? ‘Cuz I am ripped!\"America is currently obsessed with Texas Hold ‘Em, so, with that in mind, Curtis Hanson has anted up the poker drama \"Lucky You.\" Eric Bana stars as professional gambler Huck Cheever, a commitment-challenged goof who’s good at bluffing but terrible at the game of lurve. The pundits say \"Lucky\" is dramatically inert, lacking insight into neither the world of cards nor relationships, and they’re not sure what to make of Drew Barrymore, who doesn’t have much to do with her role. At 41 percent Tomatometer, \"Lucky\" is cursed.\"UNO!\"Also opening in limited release: \"Waitress,\" the final dramedy from the late Adrienne Shelley, is at 91 percent on the Tomatometer; \"Away From Her,\" a love story about Alzheimer’s from actress-cum-director Sarah Polley, is at 89 percent ; \"Paris, Je T’aime,\" an anthology of short films about the City of Lights featuring at least one director you like, is at 73 percent; \"Civic Duty,\" a thriller dealing with timely issues of paranoia and terrorism, is at 77 percent (check out RT’s interview with star Peter Krause); \"The Treatment,\" a rom-com starring Chris Eigeman and Famke Janssen, has 71 percent; and \"The Flying Scotsman,\" a biopic about Scottish cyclist Graeme Obree, is at 38 percent.Paris, living up to its City of Lights moniker.And before we forget any further, props must be given to ManofStee1 and returning member -eternity- for coming closest to guessing \"Kickin’ It Old Skool\"’s percentage in last week’s Guess That Tomatometer game.

Critics loved the first two, how do they feel about this one?Shrek’s third outing finds our green antihero in an unusual predicament: the king has died, and Shrek is next in line to ascend to the throne. Typically, he wants nothing of it and must set off to find a replacement. Hijinks, fart jokes, and ironic postmodern deconstruction ensue. But critics say \"Third\" has gone too far with the \"Shrek\" formula: it relies too heavily on pop culture references and fairy tale spoofs, marginalizing the heart and charm that made the first two classics. Also, the sheer amount of new and returning characters has given the best characters – Shrek, Donkey, and Fiona – the least screen time in any \"Shrek\" yet. \"Shrek the Third\" is at 42 percent, a far cry from \"Shrek\"’s and \"Shrek 2\"’s 89 and 88 percent Tomatometers, respectively.\"I…am not right-handed.\"And opening in limited release: \"Once,\" a crowd-pleasing drama about two street musicians (check out our interview with director John Carney), is at 100 percent; \"Severance,\" a British import of shock horror and droll comedy, is at 74 percent; \"Brooklyn Rules,\" a drama set in the titular borough circa 1985, is at 56 percent; \"Flanders,\" the new art pic from festival fave Bruno Dumont, is at 50 percent; \"The Wendell Baker Story,\" a light-hearted drama featuring possibly more Wilson Brothers than we’re equipped to handle, is at 40 percent; \"Fay Grim,\" the new action/thriller/comedy from quirky auteur Hal Hartley, is at 40 percent; \"Even Money,\" a cautionary tale about the ills of gambling, is at 20 percent; and \"The Last Sin Eater,\" the second release of Fox Faith’s Christian parable, is at 20 percent.In \"Flanders\" field.And medals, commendations, and accolades to unbreakable_samurai and SplendidIsolation who both came closest to guessing \"Delta Farce\"’s three percent Tomatometer last week.

We know who’ll take the box office, but who emerges victorious with the critics?Another week, another money-printing franchise closes its first trilogy. Johnny Depp returns as Jack Sparrow in \"Pirates of the Caribbean: At World’s End,\" along with his army-sized supporting cast, boundless CGI, and about a dozen unresolved plot threads left over from \"Dead Man’s Chest.\" Sound awesomely excessive? The critics think so too. Except for the awesome part. They contend that when it’s not exhausting the viewer with over-the-top action sequences, \"At World’s End\" is boring the viewer with talky scenes of exposition and strained dialogue. At 53 percent, \"At World’s End\" is on par with \"Dead Man’s Chest,\" but a far cry from the original’s Certified Fresh 79 percent.\"Here’s a trick I learned from the Vulcans.\"Ignoring 1990’s obscure \"The Guardian,\" \"Bug\" represents director William Friedkin’s first major foray into horror since \"The Exorcist.\" Ashley Judd stars as Agnes, a depressed waitress who holes up in a seedy motel (is there any other kind?) with an unstable war veteran who sees creepy crawlies everywhere. The critics are calling this a return to form for Friedkin. Though \"Bug\" descends into incomprehensibility at the end, they’re nevertheless impressed by \"Bug\"’s cinéma vérité camerawork and palpable dread.

What do the critics have to say?Written by Nick Hershey and Alex Vo\"Arthur and the Invisibles\" is a partially animated children’s film from director Luc Besson. Ten-year-old Arthur must find a passage to a magical world populated by tiny little beings called Minimoys in order to save his grandfather’s home. Critics say that the story tries to do too much, and the film wastes the big-name voice talent on a predictable script (including Robert De Niro, Madonna, and Snoop Dogg). In addition, they note that while the animation is interesting, it doesn’t hold up to the current CG standard. At 28 percent on the Tomatometer, \"Arthur and the Invisibles\" may not be something to see.\"Look how you’ve grown! You’re as tall as my ex-boyfriend now.\"Two rival fraternities compete for the allegiance of a street dancer from Los Angeles in \"Stomp the Yard.\" \"Stepping\" is the latest dance, and \"Yard\" has plenty of pep, thanks to appealing performers like Columbus Short and Meagan Good. But critics say that while \"Stomp\" contains impressive musical and dance numbers, it loses its momentum during the intervening soap opera-style subplots. At 27 percent on the Tomatometer, \"Stomp\" doesn’t quite go the extra yard.\"Let’s stomp the desert!\"You wouldn’t expect it from a Yimou Zhang movie, but \"The Curse of the Golden Flower\" is something not to be over-thought, but simply watched. Critics say the film goes to great lengths to visually mesmerize the audience, with enormous sets lavished in gold and silk, jade and brocade, and exquisitely bloody swordfights. But they also say the story is melodramatic. Really melodramatic. At 63 percent on the Tomatometer, this one’s both a blessing and a curse.Apparently they had Jell-O shots in the Tang Dynasty.Like a Hollywood remake of a Larry Clark movie, \"Alpha Dog\" is a glossy yet unflinching look into a violent and hedonistic teenage community. Bruce Willis and Sharon Stone play scene-chewing figures of authority, but critics say it’s Justin Timberlake who’s noteworthy, and the relationship his and Anton Yelchin’s character develop is the emotional tether that holds \"Alpha Dog\" together. The scribes say that while some of the techniques director Nick Cassavetes employs are a bit over the top, he’s able to draw good performances out of the cast. At 63 percent on the Tomatometer, this \"Dog\" has bite.\"Step 1: Cut a hole in a box.\"Looks like we’re starting the year off right: we’re just two weeks into 2007, and already we’ve got a movie that wasn’t screened for critics.

What do the critics have to say?In \"Smokin’ Aces,\" Jeremy Piven plays a soon-to-be government snitch, leading a cavalcade of seedy characters who’ve been sent in to kill, or save him. Or maybe just settle with killing each other. This overstuffed movie features a huge list of cool people doing cool action scenes, but fails to give anybody any semblence of identity. It’s one vapid, bloody sequence after another, though critics are distressed over how long the movie takes to set up the convulted plot and action. At 28 percent Tomatometer, \"Aces\" may be smokin’, but it’s not on fire.\"All we need now is the girl and a pizza place.\"Kevin Smith is certainly full of surprises. First the rumor he’ll do a scary flick, and now his apperance in \"Catch and Release\", a gooey romantic dramadey starring Jennifer Garner as a woman coping with a close death. Kevin Smith is the goofy yet lovable lug, the comic relief in a movie where everyone plays some kind of stock character. It’s a shallow, contrived treatment of a serious subject and with 24 percent on the Tomatometer, \"Catch and Release\" isn’t reeling in the critcs.Worst. Survivor. Ever.We’re going to have you work overtime for this week’s Guess That Tomatometer game. \"Epic Movie,\" which somehow confuses Paris Hilton and \"Borat\" as part of the genre, is the latest of those spoof movies and the latest movie to not be critic screened.\"I neither deny nor confirm that the snozberries taste like snozberries.\"Whenever I hear \"Blood and Chocolate\", it makes me think Elvis Costello, not babes and werewolves.

Nelson), some of Hollywood’s funniest fellows trying to touch one another without permission (Tag, starring&nbsp;Ed Helms,&nbsp;Jeremy Renner, and Jon Hamm), and a remade blast from the blaxploitation past (Superfly, starring Trevor Jackson&nbsp;and Jason Mitchell).&nbsp;What are the critics saying?Incredibles 2 (2018)  93%If you’re going to try and follow up an acclaimed blockbuster, you might as well take your time getting the sequel right — and in animation, where time can stand still forever, you have the added benefit of not needing to rush your cast back in front of the camera. Still, after waiting nearly 15 years for a second installment of The Incredibles, fans can be forgiven a certain amount of impatience; while the creative teams at formerly franchise-averse Pixar dreamed up new stories for the characters in Toy Story, Cars, Finding Nemo, and Monsters Inc., the ability to return to theaters continued to elude the superpowered Parr family. All that waiting has finally paid off with Incredibles 2, which reunites the original voice cast for a new adventure serving up more of the domestic turmoil, superhero satire, and brilliantly animated action that made the first one such a hit. It’d be tough to improve on the original Incredibles, and critics say that while this sequel doesn’t quite pull off that feat, it comes impressively close, adding yet another acclaimed entry to Pixar’s already estimable filmography. If you were a kid when The Incredibles&nbsp;came out, you might have kids of your own now — and like all the best stuff the studio has put out, the whole family can look forward to enjoying Incredibles 2.Tag (2018)  56%On one hand, it’s easy to believe Hollywood has long since exhausted most of the reasonable possibilities for comedy that exist in movies about grown men acting like boys. On the other, when you’ve got the Wall Street Journal writing about a real-life group of guys who take a month off every year to continue the game of tag they’ve been playing since they were kids, well, it’s awfully hard to resist the temptation to turn that into a film. Enter the descriptively titled Tag, starring Hannibal Buress, Jon Hamm, Ed Helms, Jake Johnson, and Jeremy Renner as the fellows in question — a talented bunch whose commitment to the story was reflected in the set injury Renner sustained, breaking both of his arms and necessitating some last-minute CGI limb replacements in post-production. It would be wonderful to report that Renner’s suffering came in service of one of the year’s best-reviewed action comedies; alas, the truth is that critics are kinda meh on Tag, which reviews describe as funny and engaging in fits and starts, but ultimately not consistent or committed enough to fully deliver on its premise. Still, this is one talented cast, and even the critical pans say the movie isn’t without its moments, so if you’re in the mood for some arrested development laughs, you may want to check your local listings.Superfly (2018)  51%Released in 1972, the original Superfly&nbsp;helped lead the blaxploitation wave with a thoughtful Harlem-set drama about a drug dealer looking for one last big score; the movie’s trappings may look somewhat dated today, but thanks to Ron O’Neal‘s performance as main character Youngblood Priest — not to mention a killer Curtis Mayfield soundtrack — it still feels fresh. It’s easy to understand why music video veteran Director X wanted to take a shot at updating the story, and its themes are just as relevant as they were more than 45 years ago; unfortunately, critics say those themes have mostly been lost in this new version, which is far more focused on style than substance. Starring Trevor Jackson as Priest, the 2018 edition moves the action to Atlanta, but the basic contours of the story remain the same — which is part of why a number of reviews have outlined pundits’ disappointment with the lost social subtext. This Superfly&nbsp;will make its fortune by and by, thanks to Director X’s way with an artfully arranged scene or set piece, but as is so often the case with remakes, the original still reigns supreme.What’s New on TVThe Bold Type: Season 2 (2018)  100%The Bold Type presents an aspirational yet refreshingly realistic portrait of young women’s careers, friendships and love lives in a big city.Strange Angel: Season 1 (2018)  71%A beautiful slow burn, Strange Angel shoots for the stars, but gets a little lost in its own orbit.Also&nbsp;Opening This Week In Limited Release Eating Animals (2018) , a documentary about the commercial factory farming industry and its various impacts, is at 100%.

All that waiting has finally paid off with Incredibles 2, which reunites the original voice cast for a new adventure serving up more of the domestic turmoil, superhero satire, and brilliantly animated action that made the first one such a hit. It’d be tough to improve on the original Incredibles, and critics say that while this sequel doesn’t quite pull off that feat, it comes impressively close, adding yet another acclaimed entry to Pixar’s already estimable filmography. If you were a kid when The Incredibles&nbsp;came out, you might have kids of your own now — and like all the best stuff the studio has put out, the whole family can look forward to enjoying Incredibles 2.Tag (2018)  56%On one hand, it’s easy to believe Hollywood has long since exhausted most of the reasonable possibilities for comedy that exist in movies about grown men acting like boys. On the other, when you’ve got the Wall Street Journal writing about a real-life group of guys who take a month off every year to continue the game of tag they’ve been playing since they were kids, well, it’s awfully hard to resist the temptation to turn that into a film. Enter the descriptively titled Tag, starring Hannibal Buress, Jon Hamm, Ed Helms, Jake Johnson, and Jeremy Renner as the fellows in question — a talented bunch whose commitment to the story was reflected in the set injury Renner sustained, breaking both of his arms and necessitating some last-minute CGI limb replacements in post-production. It would be wonderful to report that Renner’s suffering came in service of one of the year’s best-reviewed action comedies; alas, the truth is that critics are kinda meh on Tag, which reviews describe as funny and engaging in fits and starts, but ultimately not consistent or committed enough to fully deliver on its premise. Still, this is one talented cast, and even the critical pans say the movie isn’t without its moments, so if you’re in the mood for some arrested development laughs, you may want to check your local listings.Superfly (2018)  51%Released in 1972, the original Superfly&nbsp;helped lead the blaxploitation wave with a thoughtful Harlem-set drama about a drug dealer looking for one last big score; the movie’s trappings may look somewhat dated today, but thanks to Ron O’Neal‘s performance as main character Youngblood Priest — not to mention a killer Curtis Mayfield soundtrack — it still feels fresh. It’s easy to understand why music video veteran Director X wanted to take a shot at updating the story, and its themes are just as relevant as they were more than 45 years ago; unfortunately, critics say those themes have mostly been lost in this new version, which is far more focused on style than substance. Starring Trevor Jackson as Priest, the 2018 edition moves the action to Atlanta, but the basic contours of the story remain the same — which is part of why a number of reviews have outlined pundits’ disappointment with the lost social subtext. This Superfly&nbsp;will make its fortune by and by, thanks to Director X’s way with an artfully arranged scene or set piece, but as is so often the case with remakes, the original still reigns supreme.What’s New on TVThe Bold Type: Season 2 (2018)  100%The Bold Type presents an aspirational yet refreshingly realistic portrait of young women’s careers, friendships and love lives in a big city.Strange Angel: Season 1 (2018)  71%A beautiful slow burn, Strange Angel shoots for the stars, but gets a little lost in its own orbit.Also&nbsp;Opening This Week In Limited Release Eating Animals (2018) , a documentary about the commercial factory farming industry and its various impacts, is at 100%.

What do the critics have to say?Eddie Murphy’s searing, Oscar-nominated performance as a James Brown-esque soul singer in \"Dreamgirls\" may be the venerable star’s best work to date. So, what does he do for an encore? \"Norbit,\" a film that critics say is as lowbrow as the day is long. Murphy plays three roles (a nerdy guy, his incredibly brash and obese significant other, and his Asian-American adoptive father), a strategy that paid off in the \"Nutty Professor\" movies. Does it work this time? Not really, say critics; though Murphy gives it his all, the material is crass and largely unfunny. At 21 percent on the Tomatometer, \"Norbit\" is not phat.Eddie Murphy gets in touch with nature.As Hannibal Lecter, Anthony Hopkins created one of the most iconic villains in the movies, a character so morally repugnant and yet so brilliant that audiences could only imagine what was going on inside his head. \"Hannibal Rising\" is an attempt at explanation. As it turns out, young Dr. Lecter (Gaspard Ulliel) went through a lot: he was orphaned, his sister suffered a horrible fate, and he became hell-bent on revenge. The problem with \"Hannibal Rising,\" say critics, is not the direction, as Peter Webber creates an eerie, sinister mood throughout. The scribes say that explaining Hannibal’s motivations reduces the character to a collection of dime-store psychological traits. At 16 percent on the Tomatometer, \"Hannibal Rising\" isn’t much of a cinematic feast.Underage drinking will lead to other problems in life.Also opening this week in limited release: \"The Lives of Others,\" a thriller set during the paranoid days of the East German regime (and a Best Foreign Film Oscar Nominee), is at 93 percent; \"The Decomposition of the Soul,\" a documentary about the tactics of the East German secret police, is at 67 percent; \"Burning Annie,\" an indie comedy about a college kid obsessed with \"Annie Hall,\" is at 29 percent; and \"The Last Sin Eater,\" the tale of a young girl’s search for absolution, is at 17 percent.Praying for a better Tomatometer.And finally, mad props to bribios for correctly guessing \"The Messengers\"’ Tomatometer of 14 percent.

What do the critics have to say?Once upon a time, in the land of make-believe (better known as Hollywood), there was a brand new formula for making dazzling kiddie movies. It was called CG, and children all over the world rejoiced when such fare as \"Toy Story\" and \"Shrek\" hit the theaters. But then an evil curse plagued the land, as a string of mediocre stories threatened to make CG stale. The latest: \"Happily N’Ever After,\" a postmodern \"Cinderella\" spoof. Critics say this is a pretty charm-free affair, with less-than-dazzling images and a bland storyline. At six percent on the Tomatometer, this is a pretty grim fairy tale. And among CG features, only \"Doogal,\" at five percent, is lower-rated.\"Sure, magic will do the dishes, but can it make my movie funny?\"Cedric the Entertainer is a funny guy, and as a supporting player he’s stolen scenes in everything from \"Lemony Snicket\" to \"Be Cool.\" Sadly, he’s yet to have a starring vehicle that has utilized his comedic talents to the fullest, and it appears \"Code Name: The Cleaner\" is no exception. In this action/comedy, Cedric plays a janitor who stumbles into the middle of a government conspiracy, from which he tries to extricate himself with the help of Lucy Liu. The critics say the weak script does none of the actors any favors, playing up absurd thriller elements to leaden effect. At a big fat zero percent on the Tomatometer, this one’s in dire need of a \"Clean-\" up.\"Yes, I’ve always enjoyed the sophisticated yet robust taste of Xtreme Fruit Skittles.\"Liberal and conservative education experts both have it wrong. What our inner city schools need is neither greater funding nor vouchers. In order to save the impoverished students of America, we need an unconventional, no-nonsense teacher to instruct students in ballroom dance, football, or poetry, preferably in the guise of Antonio Banderas, The Rock, or Michelle Pfeiffer. In \"Freedom Writers,\" Hilary Swank plays a fresh-faced teacher who gets her students in touch with their creative writing side, and — wonder of wonders — it’s getting reasonably good reviews. The critics say the film may be clichéd, but it’s earnest and features strong performances. At 64 percent on the Tomatometer, this may be one to \"Write\" home about.\"Remember, Bagels for Complacency Day is next week.\"Director Alfonso Cuaron may have made his best movie yet with \"Children of Men,\" continuing a hot streak that began with \"Y Tu Mama Tambien\" and \"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban.\" This time, Cuaron has envisioned a world where women have become infertile and every country has become a dystopia or slipped into a fascist state.

What do the critics have to say?If there’s one thing critics can agree on with \"Charlotte’s Web,\" it’s how much they all loved the children’s novel. If there’s another, it’s how much they like the big screen adaptation, about a bunch of talking farm animals and a pig saved by a very literate spider. Though some feared that the simple story would be modernized with the ironic and brash attitudes afflicting recent kid flicks, the pundits are in awe of the quiet, humble replication of E.B. White’s genteel and distinguished prose. Also, they really like Robert Redford doing the voice of Ike the wussy horse. At 89 percent Tomatometer, this is some movie, indeed.\"How about you and I cruise in my Power Wheels sometime?\"Will Smith has been in pursuit of an Oscar for a while, and with \"The Pursuit of Happyness\" the critics think this could be where he catches up with the Academy. Smith, as a homeless single father trying to climb the corporate ladder, is garnering widespread praise for his performance, though said praise isn’t quite being doled out upon the film itself. The critics are calling \"Happyness\" a slick Hallmark card of a movie, a bit too obsessed with the desire to inspire. At 56 percent on the Tomatometer, the critics are split on whether \"Happyness\" is worth it for Smith’s heartfelt presence alone.\"Once upon a time, in the Kingdom of Periodic Stock Dividends…\"Scribes have posited several excuses as to the overwhelming awfulness of \"Eragon\" (the movie’s source books were written by a teenager, it’s being directed by a first-timer, etc.), but few critics are terribly forgiving of the derivative plot. \"Eragon\" spins a tale of a peasant boy (Speleers) who is suddenly entrusted with a dragon and must, with the help of a mentor (Irons), train, grow strong, and defeat an evil emperor. The way the critics describe it, the makers of the \"Star Wars\"-esque\"Eragon\" should soon be expecting an annoyed phone call from George Lucas, though the movie’s current nine percent Tomatometer might be insult enough.

What do the critics have to say?It may be based on The Greatest Story Ever Told, but critics say \"The Nativity Story\" is hardly the greatest movie ever made — or even a particularly good one. In case you need a refresher on the origins of the upcoming holiday that may be the occasion for you to receive a Playstation 3, \"The Nativity Story\" tells the tale of a teenager named Mary (Keisha Castle-Hughes) who is to give birth to the savior of mankind — all the while dealing with political persecution and lousy hotel service. Critics say the film is too safe (strange, given director Catherine Hardwicke‘s previous films about remarkable young people, \"Thirteen\" and \"Lords of Dogtown\"), adding little spark to the most inspirational (and familiar) of sagas. \"The Nativity Story\" currently stands at 26 percent on the Tomatometer.Mary, don’t you weep.\"Turistas\" continues a mini-trend in slasher films that began with \"Hostel\": arrogant Americans getting their comeuppance in foreign locales. In this case, a group of youngsters are terrorized in Brazil after they fall into the clutches of a mad organ harvester. While some critics have praised the film’s political undertones and better-than-average tension, most say \"Turistas\" adds little to a stale genre. At 38 percent on the Tomatometer, this tourist trap may be worth avoiding.\"Turistas\": Return I won’t to old Brazil.\"Van Wilder: The Rise of Taj\" was not screened for critics, which may indicate that it has the potential to sink like a stone with the scribes.

What do the critics say?It’s an election year, so it seems like a pretty good time to satirize our cherished democratic process, right? Perhaps, but the critics don’t believe \"Man of the Year,\" starring Robin Williams and Laura Linney, is the movie to do it. Williams plays a late night talk show host who runs for president as a joke — only to find the electorate is more receptive to his campaign than he thought. Critics say the film benefits from some good performances — including Linney and Christopher Walken as Williams’ manager — but writer-director Barry Levinson‘s script doesn’t know whether it’s a satire, a thriller, or a romantic comedy. Worse, this political send-up lacks bite when it comes to, well, politics. At 21 percent on the Tomatometer, \"Man of the Year\" is dipping in the polls.Watch as sparks fly between Linney and Williams in \"Man of the Year.\"It seems it is a momentous time to be a wide-release movie. This week, not one, not two, but three films were not screened for the scribes!First up, we’ve got \"The Grudge 2,\" starring Amber Tamblyn and Sarah Michelle Gellar in a sequel to director Takashi Shimizu‘s 2004 remake of his own Japanese-language horror flick, \"Ju-On.\" The first \"Grudge\" garnered 40 percent on the Tomatometer; go ahead and guess how the pale-faced little ghost boy and his frighteningly hirsute mother will fare this time around.The Grudge does everything in her power to prevent critics from screening her latest.Next, there’s \"The Marine,\" WWE Films’ fourth release starring pro-wrestler John Cena as an Iraq vet who must rescue his kidnapped wife from bad guys. The last WWE release, \"See No Evil,\" scored a miniscule Tomatometer of 6 percent. If it helps to Guess The Tomatometer for \"The Marine,\" the freestyling Cena was known back in his WWE days as the \"Marky Mark of wrestling.\"Not screened for critics — it’s hard to believe, I know.And finally, completing the trifecta of this week’s releases not screened for critics, we have \"One Night With The King,\" Fox Faith’s second theatrical release geared toward the Christian set. In this retelling of the Book of Esther, a young Jewish girl (newcomer Tiffany DuPont) grows up to save her people; screen greats Omar Sharif, Peter O’Toole and John Rhys-Davies fill out the cast.

We’ve got a school for Coast Guard rescue swimmers (\"The Guardian,\" starring Kevin Coster and Kutcher again). And we’ve got a school…for scoundrels (\"School for Scoundrels,\" starring Billy Bob Thornton and Jon Heder). Which of these flicks will get a passing grade from critics?\"Open Season,\" Sony Pictures Animation’s first picture, features the voices of Martin Lawrence and Ashton Kutcher as a grizzly bear and a deer, respectively, who must team up after getting stranded in the woods at the start of hunting season. Critics say that despite some impressive visuals and funny sequences, \"Open Season\" does little to distinguish itself from the recent glut of CG kiddie films. At 43 percent on the Tomatometer, you should turn, turn, turn away from this middling \"Season.\"Martin Bear: \"Say it, Ashton. Say I was funny on Martin!\"Ashton Deer: \"I’m Ashton Kutcher! I was on That 70’s Show!\"Kevin Costner makes a hopeful return to the action genre in \"The Guardian,\" in which he plays a veteran U.S. Coast Guard officer who must mentor a cocky young upstart played by Ashton Kutcher. The film features intense training sequences, dramatic rescue scenes, and the requisite love story. Sound familiar? Critics seem to think so, calling it a cliched mix of \"An Officer and a Gentleman\" and \"Top Gun,\" with a predictable storyline. At 40 percent on the Tomatometer, \"The Guardian\" needs rescuing.\"Oh, man… Finally, a funny ‘Waterworld‘ joke!\"Director Todd Phillips brings us his latest comedy \"School for Scoundrels,\" about a nerdy meter maid (Jon Heder) who takes confidence building classes from a smarmy instructor (Billy Bob Thornton). When the student gains the confidence to ask out his longtime crush, he discovers he must compete with the teacher for her affections. Most critics are in agreement that the real scoundrels are the screenwriters who couldn’t devise a script worthy of the considerable acting talent involved.

What do the critics have to say?Jagshemash! Here in U.S and A., what do critic say about \"Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan?\" They like! In fact, the scribes are almost universally pleased with the film, and some are going as far as calling it one of the funniest comedies ever. Part satire, part shockumentary, \"Borat\" follows the gleefully sexist, homophobic, and anti-Semitic title character (Cohen) on a cross-country trek to learn more about our strange nation; along the way he dredges up the seamy underbelly of American prejudice and ignorance. At 95 percent on the Tomatometer, \"Borat\" is not only Certified Fresh, it’s the best reviewed wide release of the year, topping such acclaimed movies as \"Dave Chappelle’s Block Party,\" \"The Departed,\" and \"United 93.\" That’s a good thing, since Borat himself has said if the movie doesn’t do well, he will be execute.Borat loves the U.S. and A.It doesn’t sound like the most auspicious subject for a film: mice and rats are flushed down a toilet, where they find a bustling municipality in the sewer. However, in the hands of Aardman Productions, the endlessly imaginative company responsible for \"Chicken Run\" and \"Wallace and Gromit,\" anything is possible. And so it is with \"Flushed Away,\" which tells the upstairs-downstairs tale of a coddled mouse who finds action and adventure after a trip through the plumbing. Critics say that while \"Flushed Away\" may not achieve the dizzying heights of \"Wallace &amp; Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit\" (which scored 95 percent on the Tomatometer), it’s an eccentric, inventive family film with plenty of laughs. At 76 percent on the Tomatometer, \"Flushed Away\" is critically sanitized for your viewing pleasure.Dive in! It’s fresh!\"The Santa Clause 3: The Escape Clause,\" was barely screened for critics, much like star Tim Allen‘s last flick, \"Zoom.\" The big difference is that \"Clause\" at least has a couple good reviews, whereas \"Zoom\" had none. The story of Santa’s duel with Jack Frost for control over Christmas, \"Clause\" hasn’t exactly enchanted the critics who have seen it; they say the movie is labored and mostly mirthless.

What do the critics have to say?The sheer awfulness of South Africa’s apartheid system has been grist for Hollywood’s mill in recent years, but Phillip Noyce’s \"Catch a Fire\" may be one of the subgenre’s strongest entries to date. \"Fire\" tells the true story of Patrick Chamusso (Derek Luke), a dedicated family man falsely accused of terrorism who in turn becomes a radical rebel fighter against the apartheid government. Critics say the film works as both a political thriller and as a potent history lesson, and it features a particularly strong performance from Luke. At 77 percent on the Tomatometer, you may want to \"Catch\" this one. (Check out RT editor Jen Yamato’s review from the Toronto Film Fest here.)\"If you are the big tree/ We are the small axe/ Ready to cut you down (well sharp)/ To cut you down.\"Augusten Burroughs’ memoir \"Running with Scissors\" struck a nerve as a bizarre depiction of dysfunctional families and a culture of therapy among the privileged. Unfortunately, it doesn’t appear the movie adaptation will do the same. The film is a coming-of-age story about a young man whose unstable mother sends him to live with her therapist’s family, at which point his life only gets weirder. The critics say the film features some sharp performances — particularly by Annette Bening — but also note the film is too awash with mannered eccentricity and cartoonish caricatures rather than fully developed characters. At 33 percent on the Tomatometer, this one’s \"Running\" on fumes.\"Listen doc, let me start off by saying I hate your socks.\"They say the first cut is the deepest. And if the fact that it hasn’t been screened for critics is any indication, it appears that in the case of \"Saw III,\" the blade’s gotten pretty dull.

What do the critics have to say?Is America a great country? Yes. Do the soldiers who fought in WWII, the Greatest Generation, deserve our utmost praise for their sacrifices? Without a doubt. Is the truth often more complicated than the myth? Definitely. Clint Eastwood‘s latest, \"Flags of Our Fathers,\" tells the story of that famous photo of the servicemen raising the flag atop Iwo Jima, and the trials and tribulations their celebrity caused. Critics say the film is so rich with historical information and inherent drama that it’s occasionally a little too much, but strong performances and Eastwood’s sure directorial hand keep things on track. At 69 percent on the Tomatometer, \"Flags\" may not reach the heights of Eastwood’s last film, \"Million Dollar Baby\" (92 percent), but it’s still flying pretty high. (Check out our feature on Clint’s filmography here.)Clint Eastwood pays tribute to the Greatest Generation.With \"Memento,\" Christopher Nolan made a name for himself by holding his secrets close to the vest to the bitter end. Now comes \"The Prestige,\" in which the director again serves up a brain-teaser, this time involving a pair of public manipulators in their own right. Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman star as bitterly competitive magicians in turn-of- the-century London who play a deadly game of one-upmanship. While some scribes say the movie is uneven in spots, \"The Prestige\" is winning praise for its remarkable production design, sharp performances, and more than enough cinematic sleight-of-hand to keep audiences interested. At 68 percent, this is Nolan’s worst reviewed film, and it’s still getting its share of prestige.\"Headlines don’t sell papes. Newsies sell papes.\"There is no shortage of stories involving adolescents and their beloved equine friends, from Steinbeck‘s \"The Red Pony\" to \"The Black Stallion\" to last year’s \"Dreamer.\" Critics say \"Flicka,\" itself a remake, is a strong and affecting entry into this sub-genre. The film stars Alison Lohman as a 16-year-old who loves her untamed horse and the freedom of the open range, and Tim McGraw as her father, a man with different ideas about her future. Some critics say \"Flicka\" is an old-fashioned, solid family drama with a notable lack of schmaltz, but others say the material is too well-trodden to really hit home. At 60 percent on the Tomatometer, \"Flicka\" ain’t Secretariat, but it’s not ready for the glue factory, either.\"Flicka\": Full of horsing around!In the song \"Natural’s Not In It,\" the socialist British post-punk band Gang of Four sarcastically lamented \"the problem of leisure / what to do for pleasure,\" words that are especially resonant if you’re a teenage monarch ruling a country you know little about, and your subjects are calling for your head. Sofia Coppola‘s long-awaited (and already controversial) \"Marie Antoinette\" tells the story of the queen (Kirsten Dunst), her inattentive husband, Louis XVI (Jason Schwartzman), her gossipy, silver-tongued court, and all the empty fun she had before she gets her head chopped off. Critics say Coppola’s film offers a wealth of visual riches and makes Marie’s hardships somewhat empathetic, but they’re split over its apparent lack of substance, as well as the anachronistic use of music by the likes of New Order, the Strokes, and Siouxsie and the Banshees. At 64 percent on the Tomatometer, this is definitely a cut (pun intended) below Coppola’s last feature, \"Lost in Translation\" (95 percent), but it’s still a pretty tasty piece of cake.\"A new royal family / A wild nobility / We are the family.\"Also opening this week in limited release: \"51 Birch Street,\" a documentary exploring the hidden lives of the filmmaker Doug Block’s parents, is at 100 percent on the Tomatometer; \"Requiem,\" a German tale of epilepsy/demonic possession, is at 100 percent; Tim Burton‘s stop motion anti-holiday classic \"The Nightmare Before Christmas,\" getting a re-release, is at 96 percent; \"Sweet Land,\" a sweeping tale of the American immigrant experience, is at 93 percent; \"Jonestown: The Life and Death of Peoples Temple,\" a documentary about cult leader Jim Jones and his flock, is at 92 percent; \"Hair High,\" a perverse animated comedy about a strange high school, is at 63 percent; \"Sleeping Dogs Lie,\" Bobcat Goldthwait‘s sweet, taboo-busting rom-com, is at 59 percent; and \"Running with Scissors,\" a tale of therapy and growing pains starring Annette Bening and Gwyneth Paltrow, is at 17 percent.Recent Clint Eastwood-Directed Movies:————————————————-92% — Million Dollar Baby (2004)86% — Mystic River (2003)56% — Blood Work (2002)78% — Space Cowboys (2000)50% — True Crime (1999)Recent Kirsten Dunst Movies:————————————–28% — Elizabethtown (2005)62% — Wimbledon (2004)7% — Kaena: The Prophesy (2004)93% — Spider Man 2 (2004)93% — Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (2004)Recent Christian Bale Movies:————————————59% — The New World (2005)84% — Batman Begins (2005)85% — Howl’s Moving Castle (2005)72% — The Machinist (2004)68% — Laurel Canyon (2003)","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"hard, children's, rotten, aapi, Fox, SundanceTV, stand-up, scorecard, Tumblr, Netflix, technology, indiana, Fox, Geographic, BAFTA","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Critical-Consensus-Flags-Flies-High-The-Prestige-Is-Magic-Flicka-Is-A-Pretty-Good-Ride-Marie-Antoinette-Spared-Critical-Guillotine"},{"id":"47508808030137","title":"Critical Consensus: \"Crank\" Is Well-Ranked;  \"Illusionist\" Is Magic, \"Crossover\" Is An Air-Ball, \"Wicker Man\" Gets Burned","content":"Critics Consensusvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Critical Consensus: \"Crank\" Is Well-Ranked; \"Illusionist\" Is Magic, \"Crossover\" Is An Air-Ball, \"Wicker Man\" Gets Burnedby Tim Ryan | August 31, 2006 |  CommentsThis week at the movies, we’ve got hoopsters with big dreams (\"Crossover,\" starring Anthony Mackie), scary goings-on on remote islands (\"The Wicker Man,\" starring Nicolas Cage), fast, fast vehicles (\"Crank,\" starring Jason Statham and Amy Smart), and magic (\"The Illusionist,\" starring Edward Norton and Jessica Biel). What do the critics say?If you want realism, go rent \"The Bicycle Thief.\" Critics say \"Crank\" is a ludicrously over-the-top action flick with nary a moment of probability. And that’s a good thing. The story involves a hit man (Statham) who must stay awake to complete his mission and get out of the business. The critics say the film makes precious little sense and eschews both the laws of physics and political correctness. They also note that it is a lot of fun, with terrific action sequences and a knowing sense of humor. Why this movie wasn’t shown to critics beforehand is beyond us, since at 75 percent on the Tomatometer it’s the best reviewed unscreened film of the year, beating out \"Snakes on a Plane\" (69 percent).It appears Jason Statham’s alarm isn’t working again.\"The Wicker Man\" wasn’t screened for critics either, and this time, it looks like there was a good reason for that. Critics say Neil LaBute‘s remake of the 1973 cult classic subtracts most of the subtext of the original and replaces it with tons of unintentional laughs. Cage stars as a cop who gets ensnared in sinister rituals on a remote island while searching for his girlfriend’s missing child. Scribes say the film was misconceived from the get-go and contains a startling amount of sexism. At 11 percent on the Tomatometer, this \"Wicker Man\" is getting burned. It’s also well below the original (89 percent).Movie critics tried a bunch of disguises in an attempt to sneak into screanings of \"The Wicker Man.\"One of the reasons streetball is so much fun to watch is its sheer unpredictability. The critics say the opposite is the case with the hoops drama \"Crossover.\" The film tells the story of Noah (Mackie), a talented kid who hopes to get to med school with an assist from his hoops scholarship, but must deal with the full court press of some of his relationships. The critics are treating \"Crossover\" the way Dikembe Mutombo would handle a shot in his direction. They say the film is too by-the-numbers to be dramatic. At zero percent on the Tomatometer, \"Crossover\" is tied with \"Zoom\" (each of which have 46 rotten reviews) for the title of worst reviewed film of the year.\"Run, Anthony Mackie! Run for your life! Get help!\"\"The Illusionist\" goes wide this week, and the critics are largely under the spell of this Sundance-approved period mystery. The film tells the tale of Eisenheim (Norton), a magician who runs afoul with the authorities for his feats of illusion and his romance with the prince’s fiancée (Biel). The scribes are praising \"The Illusionist\" for its remarkable set design, sweeping romance, and its twisty plot. It currently stands at 75 percent on the Tomatometer, good enough for Certified Fresh status.In \"The Illusionist,\" Ed Norton plays a man outstanding in his field — or is it out walking? (Thank you.

What do the critics have to say?“Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl” was a delightful left field surprise: a funny, rollicking, swashbuckling adventure (as well as the greatest film ever based on an amusement park ride). So what does director Gore Verbinski do for an encore? According to critics, more, more, more. And that’s not necessarily a good thing. In “Dead Man’s Chest,” Johnny Depp is back as the scoundrel Jack Sparrow, with Keira Knightley and Orlando Bloom along for the ride, this time aboard a craft containing the cephalopodan Davy Jones and his crew. The scribes say that while there are plenty of interesting effects and exciting set pieces, there’s just too much in this “Chest,” and it lacks the easygoing, organic charm of the original. At 55 percent on the Tomatometer, this “Pirates'” life may or may not be for you. And it’s well below the high watermark set by the original (at 79 percent).“Dead Man’s Chest”: Rated ARRRGH!The writings of Philip K. Dick have inspired a bunch of good-to-great movies (“Blade Runner,” “Total Recall,” “Minority Report“) and it’s easy to see why: Dick spun futuristic, Orwellian sci-fi tales that are chock full of paranoia and multilayered plot points. With “A Scanner Darkly,” Richard Linklater adapts Dick’s novel with the rotoscoping techniques he applied to “Waking Life.” The story involves a cop (Keanu Reeves) who is so far undercover in a drug investigation that it’s unclear he’ll ever find his way out. The critics say this one’s a visually arresting head trip, but some say it’s not quite as compelling as it wants to be. At 63 percent on the Tomatometer, this one may be worth a “Scan.”“You’re sayin’ the FBI’s gonna pay me to learn to surf?”Also in theaters, albeit in limited release: “Once in a Lifetime,” a documentary about the New York Cosmos soccer team of the 1970s, is at 90 percent on the Tomatometer, and “Heading South,” starring Charlotte Rampling, is at 62 percent.Recent Johnny Depp Movies:————————————31% — The Libertine (2005)83% — Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (2005)83% — Corpse Bride (2005)84% — Finding Neverland (2004)47% — Secret Window (2004)Recent Richard Linklater Movies:—————————————-47% — The Bad News Bears (2005)94% — Before Sunset (2004)90% — School of Rock (2003)75% — Tape (2001)79% — Waking Life (2001)","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"It","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"critical-consensus-dead-mans-chest-is-overstuffed-scanner-shines-darkly"},{"id":"47508808037308","title":"Critical Consensus: \"Descent\" and \"Talledega\" Leave \"Listener\" and \"Barnyard\" in the Dust","content":"Critics Consensusvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Critical Consensus: \"Descent\" and \"Talledega\" Leave \"Listener\" and \"Barnyard\" in the Dustby Jen Yamato | August 3, 2006 |  CommentsThis week in movies, we’ve got tough chicks fighting for their lives (\"The Descent\"), a redneck racing saga (\"Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby\"), a psychological thriller starring Mork from Ork (\"The Night Listener\"), and farm animals who just wanna have fun (\"Barnyard: The Original Party Animals\"). Which flicks will get the critical seal of approval?\"The Descent\" — Certified Fresh!Two constants in Hollywood are that (A) foreign flicks generally don’t have widespread appeal and (B) horror flicks don’t get critical praise, like, ever. \"The Descent,\" about six female spelunkers whose weekend cave-diving adventure turns deadly, has defied these tenets — a low-budget import from Scotland, of all places, this female-driven frightener has critics on the edges of their popcorn-strewn seats. The scribes say that director Neil Marshall (\"Dog Soldiers\") has masterfully created a claustrophobe’s nightmare, and has added a compelling meditation on morality, vengeance, and the depths to which we might go for human survival. High marks also go to the cast of relatively unknown actresses, who manage to balance sex appeal and strength as believable adventuresses. At 90 percent, this gory thriller has earned RT’s Certified Fresh stamp — and is on track to becoming the best-reviewed horror film of the year!\"Talladega Nights\" — sponsored by Wonder Bread and Old SpicePerennial jester Will Ferrell stars as hard-driven, bumbling NASCAR ace Ricky Bobby in \"Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby,\" a high-octane comedy set in the all-American world of race car driving. Inescapably drawing comparisons to 2004’s \"Anchorman\" (which, like \"Talladega,\" starred Ferrell and was co-written by director Adam McKay), there’s no doubt that Ferrell is on his comedic game in this sweet-natured send-up of the NASCAR world. Critics also agree on the strength of Ferrell’s supporting cast (including John C. Reilly as Ricky Bobby’s steadfast racing buddy, and British comedian Sacha Baron Cohen (\"Da Ali G Show\") as his scene-stealing gay French rival). But is it funny? While the largely-improvised laughs are occasionally uneven, critics say the highs are indeed hilarious and worth the ride. At 73 percent on the Tomatometer, go ahead and buckle up for \"Talladega.\"Robin Williams in the JT Leroy-ish thriller, \"The Night Listener\"\"The Night Listener\" marks another revisiting of comic genius Robin Williams to that oh-so-foreign milieu — dramatic acting — in a psychological thriller adapted from Armistead Maupin’s story of the same name. Williams plays Gabriel, a lonely nighttime radio host who forges a relationship with a young abuse victim named Pete (Rory Culkin), but begins to question the truth behind Pete’s story; eventually, he wonders if Pete really exists at all. The critics say that, despite a real-life relevancy in light of such fictitious media sensations as J.T. Leroy, any suspensefulness built up by Patrick Stettner‘s creepy, atmospheric direction fizzles out with muddled storytelling; perhaps, too, funnyman Williams has been slightly miscast in a sad-sack role that requires more believable misery. However, many scribes are quick to point out the film’s unusually brief 81-minute runtime, if that gives you any more incentive to buy a ticket, but at 45 percent on the Tomatometer, you probably want to tune out this \"Listener.\"When the farmer’s asleep, the cows cut loose in \"Barnyard\"Are you in the mood for an animated tale of farm animals who party when the humans aren’t looking? How about one with a rebellious boy cow as the hero? \"Barnyard\" offers up such fare with the story of Otis (voiced by Kevin James), a fun-loving cow who would rather carouse about the farm than protect its denizens from ravenous coyotes, a duty that his father (Sam Elliott) tries in vain to impart to him. With a voice cast that includes Wanda Sykes and Courteney Cox, \"Barnyard\" aims for comedic targets in the form of anthropomorphized animal laughs, gross humor, and sight gags (courtesy of \"Ace Ventura: When Nature Calls\" director Steve Oedekirk) — lowbrow humor that, critics moan, appeal only to the senses of children under the age of eight. Unfortunately for the chaperones of the target demographic, aside from some spontaneous musical numbers and a few adult-oriented jokes, there’s not much here to entertain grown-ups. At 33 percent, \"Barnyard\" is only for parents who love their kids enough to sit through it.Also opening this week, albeit in limited release: \"My Country, My Country,\" a political documentary about the Iraq 2005 election, is at 100 percent; French romantic thriller \"The Bridesmaid\" is at 83 percent; the coming-of-age tale (and Sundance fave) \"Quinceanera\" is at 81 percent; retiree rom-com \"The Boynton Beach Club\" is at 55 percent; the prison cell drama \"Jailbait\" is at 14 percent; and gay teen drama \"Vacationland\" is at — gulp — 0 percent.Recent Will Ferrell Movies:—————————————————————————–Curious George – 69%Winter Passing – 41%Melinda &amp; Melinda – 51%Kicking and Screaming – 43%Bewitched – 25%","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"RT21, Cannes, Walking, books, Reality, CBS, nfl","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Critical-Consensus-Descent-and-Talledega-Leave-Listener-and-Barnyard-in-the-Dust"},{"id":"47508808046529","title":"Critical Consensus: \"Superman\" And \"Devil\" Are Certified Fresh","content":"Critics Consensusvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Critical Consensus: \"Superman\" And \"Devil\" Are Certified Freshby Tim Ryan | June 29, 2006 |  CommentsThis week’s wide releases both involve publishing. In \"The Devil Wears Prada,\" the setting is a fashion magazine, and in \"Superman Returns,\" it’s The Daily Planet. So maybe that’s why the critics like both these movies so much…While there has been some debate over the quality of Lauren Weisberger’s novel \"The Devil Wears Prada,\" there’s less divergence over the movie adaptation, particularly because of the presence of Meryl Streep in the titular role. Anne Hathaway plays an earnest small-town girl who hopes to write high-minded stuff for the New Yorker, but is little match for the Cruella De Ville-esque Miranda Priestly (Streep). The scribes say the film ultimately works because of Streep’s excellent performance, but \"The Devil Wears Prada\" is also an incisive examination of workplace politics. At 76 percent on the Tomatometer, this \"Devil\" wears a Certified Fresh badge.After a long, arduous trial, Meryl Streep was acquitted by the fashion police, but convicted by the sunglass police.You may have heard that there’s a new Superman movie out. It’s called \"Superman Returns,\" and it stars a relative unknown as the Man of Steel (Brandon Routh), an actress who was in that Bobby Darin movie (Kate Bosworth), and the guy who played Bobby Darin himself in that same movie, this time playing Lex Luthor (Kevin Spacey). (Dude, he was probably Keyzer Soze as well) The critics say \"Superman Returns\" is able to pull off the neat trick of sticking closely to the age-old particulars of the Superman myth, while making them fresh. \"Superman Returns\" is at 76 percent on the Tomatometer, and it’s Certified Fresh.\"I’ll have a root beer float, hold the kryptonite.\"This is a week of well-reviewed releases in general.

What do the critics have to say?I’m sure I speak for much of humanity when I say that each time I see Jack Black in a wrestling outfit on the posters for \"Nacho Libre,\" I chuckle to myself. Heartily. The critics, who’ve actually seen the movie, have been a little less charitable. Black stars as a man who becomes a wrestler to raise money for orphans who live in the monastery where he grew up. While some critics say the film has its share of laughs, others say the sophomore effort of Jared (\"Napoleon Dynamite\") Hess is the very definition of sophomoric. At 49 percent on the Tomatometer, this \"Nacho\" is only sort of tasty. And it’s nowhere near \"Dynamite\" (71 percent).\"Nacho Libre:\" Let’s get ready to rumble!In the third installment of the \"Fast and the Furious\" franchise, a new collection of thrill seekers head to Japan to engage in \"drifting,\" that exciting brand of motorsport that values oversteering. Let’s be honest: Nobody is going to this one for anything but action, nifty driving, and other assorted cheap thrills (this ain’t \"Two-Lane Blacktop\"). And even utilizing those limited criteria, \"The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift\" only attains a modest amount of success. The critics say that while the driving sequences are reasonably cool, the characters are about as well-crafted as a pinewood-derby cart that ends up in a ditch. It’s currently at 41 percent on the Tomatometer, trailing the original \"F&amp;F\" (at 50 percent).\"Tokyo Drift\": Faster and furious to an even greater degreeThere are a lot of reasons relationships don’t work out. Sometimes couples live too far apart, or have vastly different schedules. But what about a couple communicating across a two-year time difference — can this relationship be saved? Unfortunately for \"The Lake House,\" starring Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock, the answer appears to be no. The critics say the film’s premise (it’s a remake of the 2002 Korean film \"Il Mare\") is not necessarily a bad idea, but the execution is off; the film is neither effective as a romance or as a metaphysical puzzle. At 32 percent on the Tomatometer, this \"House\" looks like a fixer-upper. And how does it compare with \"Speed,\" the last Reeves/Bullock collabo? Do you even need to ask?\"I should probably tell you that I’m taking the bus because I had my driver’s license revoked.\"The scribes’ response to \"Garfield: A Tale of Two Kitties\" has prompted Critical Consensus to paraphrase from Charles Dickens‘ \"A Tale of Two Cities\": \"[The critics] looked at [Garfield] sideways with a stronger concentration of keenness, closeness, and dislike, than was comportable with its wearer’s assumption of indifference.\" The operative words here are \"indifference\" and \"dislike,\" as critics say \"Garfield\" wastes a talented voice cast (Bill Murray, Bob Hoskins, Tim Curry) in a dull, relatively laugh-free plot. At 17 percent on the Tomatometer, the scribes have one thing to say: Bad \"Kitties!\" (By the way, the original was at 13 percent.)\"Garfield:\" Let’s get ready to rumble… again!Also this week, in limited release: \"Wordplay,\" a doc about New York Times crossword puzzle editor Will Shortz, is at 89 percent; G.W.

An average Joe tries to play pro football (\"Invincible,\" starring Mark Wahlberg), the new kid in school tries to ward off bullies by consuming soft-bodied invertebrates (\"How to Eat Fried Worms\"), a ragtag bunch tries to win an international keg-tapping contest (\"Beerfest,\" starring Broken Lizard), and two struggling 1930s musicians try for a big break (\"Idlewild,\" starring Outkast). What do the critics have to say?Pity the poor Philly football fan. Despite some recent success, the Eagles haven’t had a championship season since 1960. I’ll bet a lot of residents of the City of Brotherly Love think they could do better themselves. Well, \"Invincible\" tells the true story of a guy who felt that way… and was right. Mark Wahlberg stars as an over-the-hill substitute teacher and bartender who shows up at an open tryout and wows coach Dick Vermeil (Greg Kinnear) with his speed and skills despite never playing ball in college. The critics say what could have been another clichéd sports drama is elevated by strong performances by Wahlberg and Kinnear, as well as a palpable sense of time and place. \"Invincible\" is at 74 percent on the Tomatometer.\"I am a star. I’m a star, I’m a star, I’m a star. I am a big, bright, shining star.\"Despite a title that conjures images of a pre-teen \"Fear Factor,\" the critics say \"How to Eat Fried Worms\" is actually quite tame — or quaint — compared with much of contemporary family fare. Although its youthful cast contribute solid performances, the critics say \"Worms\" doesn’t quite live up to the standard set by the classic children’s book of the same name. Still, they also say the film is good-natured fun for the kids. At 61 percent on the Tomatometer, \"Worms\" is a reasonably appetizing item on the cinematic menu.Well, in France they eat snails….Those Broken Lizard folks are at it again, with another gleefully juvenile movie that should appeal to their cult audience while confounding the critics. Sort of like \"Dodgeball\" for the pub set, \"Beerfest\" tells the tale of a group of misfits who take on the world in an international beer drinking contest. While critics concede that there are more than a few moments of boozy, tasteless fun, they also say the film, at 111 minutes, is a little too hit and miss to justify its running time. At 51 percent on the Tomatometer, \"Beerfest\" is a little too sudsy. Still, it’s the best reviewed Broken Lizard film, beating \"Super Troopers,\" which scored 36 percent.\"Beerfest\": More subtle, sophisticated humor from Broken LizardAin’t nobody dope as Outkast — in the studio. The silver screen may be a different matter. Big Boi and Andre 3000 bring their Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik to a story set in the Depression era south in \"Idlewild.\" Critics say that with the musical scenes, the cast are the type of people make the club get crunk. But, ah ha, what’s that fuss, then? Well, the scribes say there’s too little of Outkast’s power music electric revival, and the plot gets bogged down in clichés. At 52 percent on the Tomatometer, critics don’t love the way \"Idlewild\" moves — but don’t hate it either.\"Idlewild\": \"Crocodile on my feet/ Fox fur on my back/ Bowtie ’round my neck/ That’s why they call me the gangsta mack/ In the Cadillac.\"Also in theaters this week in limited release: \"Old Joy,\" an exploration of friendship starring indie darling Will Oldham, is at 100 percent; \"LOL,\" a no-budget tale of hipsters and technology, is at 100 percent; \"Princesas,\" a story of friendship between prostitutes in Madrid, is at 70 percent; \"Rolling Family,\" sort of like an Argentine \"Little Miss Sunshine,\" is at 63 percent; the Spanish sex comedy \"Queens\" is at 57 percent; and the Elisha Cuthbert/ Camilla Belle psychological thriller \"The Quiet\" is at 27 percent.Recent Mark Wahlberg Movies:————————————–52% — Four Brothers (2005)60% — I Heart Huckabees (2004)73% — The Italian Job (2003)33% — The Truth about Charlie (2002)52% — Rock Star (2001)Recent Big Boi and Andre 3000 Movies:—————————————————62% — ATL (2006)52% — Four Brothers (2005)29% — Be Cool (2005)","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"bad, york, Reality, Calendar","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Critical-Consensus-Invincible-Worms-Score-Idlewild-Beerfest-Mixed"},{"id":"47508808047554","title":"Critical Consensus: \"Click\" Doesn’t, Ahem, Click; \"Waist\" Isn’t Deep Enough","content":"Critics Consensusvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Critical Consensus: \"Click\" Doesn't, Ahem, Click; \"Waist\" Isn't Deep Enoughby Tim Ryan | June 22, 2006 |  CommentsThis week at the movies, we’ve got a magical remote control (\"Click\") and a father who’s trying to rescue his son (\"Waist Deep\"). Will the critics dig \"Deep?\" Will they pick \"Click?\"Adam Sandler‘s latest, \"Click,\" traffics in a premise that most of us have probably considered at one point or another: Wouldn’t it be cool if we could control everything around us with the push of a button? And would that necessarily be a good thing? But lemme tell you something about Hollywood, kids: good ideas are a dime a dozen. And the critics say \"Click,\" like an aimless round of channel surfing, is pretty inconsistent, veering from yuks early on to goopy sentiment toward the end. It’s at 22 percent on the Tomatometer, but we know that Adam Sandler is pretty critic-proof; his average Tomatometer is 29 percent, and we love him anyway.Adam Sandler \"Clicks\" with the Fonz! Heyyyy!\"Waist Deep\" is an attempt to cross gritty urban action with a story of redemption; unfortunately, according to critics, it’s not terribly successful. The plot involves an ex-con, played by Tyrese Gibson, who must venture outside the law in order to recover his kidnapped son. While a number of critics say the film is well-made and well-meaning, others say it’s too violent and far-fetched to be truly compelling.

We also have lighter fare in \"RV,\" \"Stick It\" and \"Akeelah.\" What do the critics have to say?Is it too soon for the studios to make movies about the terrorist attacks on Sept 11, 2001? Directed by Paul Greengrass (Bloody Sunday) with a cast of unknowns, \"United 93\" re-enacts the hijacking of United Airlines flight 93 and its eventual crash into a field in Pennsylvania, killing everyone on board. Critics say, while difficult to watch, \"United 93\" is made with skill and treats the subject matter with respect, never resorting to the aggrandizement Hollywood is known for. As of this writing, \"United 93\" is Certified Fresh with a Tomatometer reading of 93%, the best-reviewed drama of 2006 for movies with at least 50 reviews.If you’ve been to a Starbucks lately, you’ll notice that you’re seeing more on the walls and chalkboards than art decor and beverage suggestions. It’s hard to miss those \"Akeelah and the Bee\" note cards and stickers. That’s because besides making caffeinated beverages, Starbucks is dabbling in movies as well. The movie centers on Akeelah who, through the tutelage of a mentor played by Laurence Fishburne, rises above the odds to compete in the Scripps National Spelling Bee contest. Despite its predictability, \"Akeelah\" is doing quite well with the critics, scoring 84% on the Tomatometer. Critics say its star Keke Palmer‘s winning performance makes it easy to forgive the film’s flaws.If \"Stick It\" does well at the box office, will we see the writer of \"Bring It On\" pen a movie about sychronized swimming? For all we know, that script is probably done, just waiting for a greenlight from studio execs. While that movie may hold promise, \"Stick It\" fails to score well with the critics with a reading of 21% on the Tomatometer. Filled with teen speak and shopworn cliches, the movie may appeal to teenage mallrats, they say.In Robin Williams‘ latest comedy \"RV,\" his family dreads the prospect of taking an extended road trip with him in a Winnebago, and with a reading of 32% on the Tomatometer, so do the critics. The reason? The movie’s not that funny.

The good news: Who cares? The third time’s a charm for the espionage/explosion series, and the scribes say \"Alias\"/\"Lost\" creator J.J. Abrams brings a fresh, loopy energy to the proceedings. Tom Cruise is back once again to save the world, this time from Philip Seymour Hoffman. With absurd-but-exhilarating action sequences and interesting supporting players, \"M:I:III\" is the best reviewed film of the series, and at 78 percent on the Tomatometer, it’s Certified Fresh.\"An American Haunting\"…like \"Casper,\" only…not.Recently, the makers of horror films have found that adding a \"based on true events\" handle gives their fright-fests an added jolt of heft. \"The Exorcism of Emily Rose\" tried it, and now comes \"An American Haunting,\" a ghost tale set in 1820s Tennessee.

Will \"Vendetta\" live up to the hype? Can a girly \"Man\" make teens swoon for Shakespeare? The scribes will tell us!Ah, the hype. \"V for Vendetta,\" arguably the year’s first event movie, has been generating the loudest buzz for months — and critics say it’s justified. Produced by the Wachowski brothers (masters of the Matrices), and starring Natalie Portman and a fully masked Hugo Weaving, \"Vendetta\" tells the story of a near-future dystopia, where a lone freedom fighter named V (Weaving) plots a series of revolutionary bombings to bring down a shady, secretly policed government. Along the way, V recruits young, frightened Evey (Portman), shaves her head, and turns her into a proper young revolutionary. The scribes say this political thriller is high on politics as well as thrills, with a few stunning set pieces augmenting an austere, yet stylish, mise-en-scene; however, the incendiary tone of its politics — which have been labeled terrorist-like by some — is more than a bit difficult for some to stomach in this post-9/11 day and age. Nevertheless, \"V for Vendetta\" is enjoying Fresh status with a 68% score on the Tomatometer, and the critical mass urges at least one thought-provoking viewing.Faring worse at the hands of the critics, \"She’s The Man\" is a teen-oriented take on Shakespeare’s gender-bender \"Twelfth Night,\" from two of the writers of a better Bard treatment, \"10 Things I Hate About You.\" TV teen queen Amanda Bynes stars as Viola, a prep school tomboy who decides to impersonate her twin brother Sebastian in order to play on his soccer team. Donning a short wig and boy’s clothing, Viola infiltrates Illyria Prep, but soon falls for her dreamy roommate, who’s crushing on a pretty blonde, who has the hots for the undercover Viola; hilarity and sexual confusion ensue. Unfortunately, the scribes say this comedy of errors is just that, with an erratic comic timing, unbelievable plotlines, and too-broad jokes that make you feel embarrassed for Bynes — the actress, not her character.

What will the critics say?\"The Shaggy Dog\" is a remake of the 1959 Fred MacMurray family comedy. This one stars Tim Allen as a district attorney who is accidentally injected with a chemical that periodically turns him into a dog; family togetherness ensues. Critics say this family fare is not sharp on its own modest terms, and despite some decent moments (many of them courtesy of Robert Downey Jr.), it lacks, ahem, bite. At 36 percent on the Tomatometer, this \"Dog\" could use a trip to the vet; it’s not as healthy as the original, which stands at 75 percent.Listen up, Hollywood, because I’m only going to say this once.

It’s like a red cape in front of a charging bull. \"Failure to Launch,\" starring Matthew McConaughey and Sarah Jessica Parker, tells the story of a regular 30-something dude whose parents want him to move out, so they hire a woman to try to go on a date with him. Scribes say the leads have an acceptable level of chemistry, and that the film benefits from quirky supporting players, particularly Zooey Deschanel. But they hasten to add that the title is a bit too apt, for the setup and the script are too contrived for the material to really achieve liftoff. At 34 percent on the Tomatometer, this one’s a… never mind.Wes Craven‘s \"The Hills Have Eyes\" gets the remake treatment from Alexander Aja, the director behind the recent slasher fave \"High Tension.\" The film tells the story of a family road trip that comes to an abrupt halt, thanks to a clan of bloodthirsty genetic mutants. Critics say it’s a pretty gruesome experience, and one of the better horror remakes of recent years; whether those are compliments depends on your taste. At 53 percent on the Tomatometer, this one’s a slight notch below the original (63 percent).Recent Matthew McConaughey Movies:————————————————20% — Two For the Money (2005)86% — Magnificent Desolation: Walking on the Moon 3-D (2005)38% — Sahara (2005)19% — Paparazzi (2004)42% — How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days (2003)","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"It, Purge, television, Lifetime, National, Masterpiece, Pride, movies, Rocky, independent, of, Heroines","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Critical-Consensus-Mangy-Dog-Rom-Com-Failure-Evil-Eye"},{"id":"47508809170898","title":"Critical Consensus: A Swinging \"Party,\" A Sweet and Sour \"16\"","content":"Critics Consensusvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Critical Consensus: A Swinging \"Party,\" A Sweet and Sour \"16\"by Tim Ryan | March 2, 2006 |  CommentsThis week’s wide releases will take us on a journey. We’ll walk a couple blocks (\"16 Blocks,\" \"Dave Chappelle’s Block Party\"), take a dip in the ocean (\"Aquamarine\") and feel the rays of the sun (\"Ultraviolet\"). And the critics will be our guide.With the first two \"Lethal Weapon\" films, Richard Donner perfected a certain kind of action-buddy template, and he gives it another try in \"16 Blocks.\" Bruce Willis and Mos Def star in this tale of a cop who must transport a witness across town to testify in court, but must make it past a bunch of bad guys first. Critics say the film is a solid action picture with interesting characters, but it’s still a little too formulaic. It’s currently at 49 percent on the Tomatometer, well below Donner’s best-reviewed action film (\"Superman,\" 94 percent) and Willis’ (\"Die Hard,\" 92 percent).We’ve missed you, Dave Chappelle. We were deeply concerned when you went on hiatus. We were afraid we’d lost the comedy voice of a generation. We needn’t have worried, say critics. \"Dave Chappelle’s Block Party\" is a raucous return to the spotlight, and Dave’s incisive, observational wit appears to be as sharp as ever. Directed with style by Michel Gondry and featuring exceptional musical performances by some of hip-hop’s heaviest hitters (including — will wonders never cease — the reunited Fugees), this is one swingin’ \"Party.\" It currently stands at 93 percent on the Tomatometer, and if that number holds, \"Block Party\" will be the best reviewed wide release of the year. It’s also nearly 50 points higher than Chappelle’s career Tomatometer of 44 percent. Heck, even he makes fun of \"Half Baked.\")\"Aquamarine\" tells a fish-out-of-water story — or, better yet, a mermaid-out-of-the-ocean story. A couple of teenage girls discover a mermaid who, like Ariel before her, is looking for love, preferably on dry land. As you can probably guess, the target audience for this movie is ichthyologists. Sorry, I meant teenage girls. Critics say that demographic will dig it to an acceptable degree, but their parents and the fellas will be feeling a bit seasick. At 50 percent on the Tomatometer, \"Aquamarine\" is a tad soggy.Extensive exposure to ultraviolet rays can be very harmful, particularly to the eyes. So the people behind the futuristic action flick \"Ultraviolet\" did the critics a favor by not screening the film for them. Whether it’s harmful for audiences, we can’t say at this point. Just be warned.Speaking of which, it’s time to announce the winners of last week’s Guess the Tomatometer contest. Mizzoucritic was one point off in his/her evaluation of \"Tyler Perry’s Madea’s Family Reunion,\" which landed at 32 percent, and lovelykeira came the closest to \"Doogal\"’s score of six percent. So the next time we’re in Mizzou’s neck of the woods, we’ll get dinner at Shakespeare’s Pizza to celebrate.

A cute pooch battles the forces of evil (\"Doogal\"). The irrepressible Madea holds a family reunion (\"Tyler Perry’s Madea’s Family Reunion\"). It can only mean one thing — this week’s wide releases!Paul Walker has spent 2006 getting out of tight spots. In \"Eight Below,\" he and a pack of sled dogs had to escape the cold of Antarctica, and now in \"Running Scared,\" he has to find a lost firearm used in a hit or face the consequences from his Mafioso bosses and the cops. It’s a pretty cool setup; heck, it made for a tense, involving picture when Kurosawa tried it in \"Stray Dog.\" But critics say director Wayne Kramer, who debuted with the kinetic \"The Cooler,\" is on shakier ground with this one; they say it’s got a weak twist and far too brutal violence. \"Running Scared\" currently stands at 37 percent on the Tomatometer.Speaking of running scared, apparently the people responsible for both \"Tyler Perry’s Madea’s Family Reunion\" and \"Doogal\" are terrified that critics will poison the coveted opening weekend box office with bad reviews. These two films weren’t screened for critics, joining an infamous list that includes last week’s \"Date Movie.\" So without further ado, Critical Consensus would like to give mad props to Roadhg67, who correctly guessed that \"Date Movie\" would have a Tomatometer of 10 percent.

What do the critics say?It’s a scenario Hollywood loves to (\"Stand and\") deliver: A tough-but-fair new teacher helps a ragtag bunch of teenage troublemakers learn to be better citizens and believe in themselves through a disciplined approach to basketball/martial arts/poetry/feng shui/tiddley winks, etc. Add ballroom dancing to the list. \"Take the Lead\" stars Antonio Banderas as a professional dancer whose old-school approach melds with the students’ hip-hop sensibilities. (If this sounds familiar, it’s because there was a documentary called \"Mad Hot Ballroom\" that told the same tale, albeit with elementary school kids, and uh, it was real.) Critics say the movie is fine, if a little shopworn; while the performances and dance numbers are stirring, we’ve kinda seen this one before. It’s currently at 45 percent on the Tomatometer.From its inscrutable title to its labyrinthine plot, the scribes are pretty split on \"Lucky Number Slevin.\" Is the screenplay smart? Yes, critics say. Too clever for its own good? Perhaps, they concede. Josh Hartnett stars as a regular dude who falls into a web of intrigue after a case of mistaken identity. The film has a stellar cast (Morgan Freeman, Bruce Willis, Lucy Liu, Ben Kingsley) and a plot with more twists and turns than a marathon session of Chutes and Ladders. So, is \"Lucky\" any good? Depends on which critic you ask. At 55 percent on the Tomatometer, \"Slevin\" is either pulp heaven or an overplotted purgatory.Like a utility infielder hitting well below the Mendoza line, \"The Benchwarmers\" probably deserves to ride the pine, since the scribes weren’t allowed to see it. And likewise, \"Phat Girlz,\" which was also not screened for critics, is probably not all that, uh, phat. So kiddies, it’s time for our new national pastime: Guess the Tomatometer!

Which of these movies will score with critics?As the Oscar-winning theme of \"The Poseidon Adventure\" put it, \"there’s got to be a morning after.\" In this day and age, there’s got to be a big-budget quasi-remake. The latest is \"Poseidon,\" Wolfgang Petersen‘s third boat movie (\"Das Boot\" and \"The Perfect Storm\" are the others.) Josh Lucas and Kurt Russell star as the leaders of a group trying to escape an overturned, sinking cruise ship. The critics say the film has some decent action scenes, but virtually no character development or good lines. At 36 percent on the Tomatometer, \"Poseidon\" is all wet.Jacinda Barrett and Josh Lucas run from the critical tide.There’s a Lou Reed album called \"Growing Up in Public,\" and few embody those words like Lindsay Lohan. She’s the star of \"Just My Luck,\" a screwball comedy about how a kiss reverses the fortunes of the world’s luckiest girl and the unluckiest guy. The film marks the end of Lohan’s teen queen phase; with this (and Robert Altman‘s \"A Prairie Home Companion\") she’s now playing adult characters. But critics say \"Just My Luck\" is still pretty juvenile, a lightweight rom-com that isn’t nearly sprightly enough. At 25 percent on the Tomatometer, the scribes say this one’s \"Just\" not that good.More excitement than a Friday night at Bungalow 8.We love inspirational sports flicks. We must, as the studios keep making them. The latest entry is \"Goal!,\" the first in a trilogy about a kid from East L.A. who ends up in Britain’s Premier division. The scribes say this is a better-than-average, utterly predictable film with a good performance by Kuno Becker as the up-by-the-bootstraps (or is it cleatstraps?) footballer. At 54 percent on the Tomatometer, this one’s a draw.\"Goal!\" is the best movie about kicking things since \"Kickboxer 4.\"Recent Wolfgang Petersen Movies:——————————————55% — Troy (2004)48% — The Perfect Storm (2000)77% — Air Force One (1997)56% — Outbreak (1995)97% — In the Line of Fire (1993)Recent Lindsay Lohan Movies:————————————–100% — A Prairie Home Companion (2006)42% — Herbie: Fully Loaded (2005)13% — Confessions of a Teenage Drama Queen (2004)86% — Mean Girls (2004)83% — Freaky Friday (2003)","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"of, Searchlight, anime","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Critical-Consensus-Poseidon-Sinks-Luck-Is-Lacking"},{"id":"47508811710435","title":"Critical Consensus: \"Domino\" Topples, \"Elizabethtown\" Disappoints","content":"Critics Consensusvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Critical Consensus: \"Domino\" Topples, \"Elizabethtown\" Disappointsby Tim Ryan | October 13, 2005 |  CommentsThis week, the wide releases regale us with tales of beautiful bounty hunters (\"Domino\"), existential romance (\"Elizabethtown\"), and masses of deadly condensed water vapor (\"The Fog\"). Which films will connect with the critics?The life of the late Domino Harvey would seem custom-made for a film. She was the daughter of a legendary actor (Laurence Harvey), she was supermodel-beautiful, and she worked as a bounty hunter. A story like that would make for a good movie, right? Well, according to the critics, that’s half correct: Tony Scott‘s \"Domino,\" starring Keira Knightley, is certainly more a movie than a biography, but it’s also not terribly good. The scribes say it’s simply a slam-bang, senses-assaulting action flick that gives off little indication that its heroine was a real person. At 18 percent on the Tomatometer, this \"Domino\" is getting knocked over. It’s also the worst-reviewed film of Scott’s career.When \"Elizabethtown\" was screened at the Toronto Film Festival, it didn’t get very good reviews. Director Cameron Crowe told audiences and critics that it was still a work in progress, that more cuts would be made. Well, the new version is now in theaters, and it isn’t faring much better, either. Orlando Bloom and Kirsten Dunst star in this you-can-go-home-again romantic comedy about a man returning to his hometown in Kentucky for his father’s funeral. The critics say Crowe never establishes a coherent tone, and despite the cuts, it’s still overlong. At 29 percent on the Tomatometer, \"Elizabethtown\" may not be worth a visit.In a development more ominous than dark clouds on the horizon, \"The Fog,\" a remake of the John Carpenter classic starring Tom Welling, Maggie Grace, and Selma Blair, has not been screened for critics.Recent Cameron Crowe Movies:—————————————39% — Vanilla Sky (2001)89% — Almost Famous (2000)85% — Jerry Maguire (1996)77% — Singles (1992)100% — Say Anything (1989)Recent Tony Scott Movies:——————————–39% — Man on Fire (2004)67% — Spy Game (2001)71% — Enemy of the State (1998)39% — The Fan (1996)89% — Crimson Tide (1995)","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"universe, VICE","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Critical-Consensus-Domino-Topples-Elizabethtown-Disappoints"},{"id":"47508810691548","title":"Critical Consensus: Lions And Witches And Wardrobes, Oh My!","content":"Critics Consensusvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Critical Consensus: Lions And Witches And Wardrobes, Oh My!by Tim Ryan | December 8, 2005 |  CommentsThis week’s sole wide release is the highly anticipated \"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe.\" Will the film garner the lion’s share of accolades?Once \"The Lord of the Rings\" became a hot cinematic property, it was inevitable that Hollywood would turn to Tolkien’s friend and fellow fantasist C.S. Lewis and give his \"The Chronicles of Narnia\" for epic big screen treatment. It’s got a built-in fan base, fantastical lands and creatures, and a grand quest. Critics say that although this is no \"Lord of the Rings\" (what is?), Andrew Adamson‘s film is largely a winner, filled with wondrous, phantasmagoric images, and deft acting. Though there are some complaints about the film’s length (140 minutes) and some quibbles about the CGI effects, the scribes say fans will be pleased with \"Narnia\"’s adherence to, and in some cases improvement upon, the source material. At 78 percent on the Tomatometer, it’s looking like the season of the \"Witch.\" The \"Narnia\" series is off to a good start, as the first film is Certified Fresh.In a completely unrelated note, I want to congratulate both almeisan and Galaxyfilms22 for their correct \"Aeon Flux\" Tomatometer predictions of 10 percent. As promised, you do indeed win props from Critical Consensus. However, a word of warning: Don’t let the studios know about your Tomatometer crystal balls, because they might go to sinister lengths to get their hands on them. Additional props to rockstarfrank (who I assume is male) for his astute, insightful assessment of \"Flux\": ‘This will clearly be one of the greatest movies in the history of mankind.

We have a man and his dog (\"Wallace &amp; Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit\"), sisters (\"In Her Shoes\"), disgruntled restaurant employees (\"Waiting…\"), and men who bond over gambling (\"Two for the Money\"). Which of these films will get some love from the critics?Is Wallace and Gromit the funniest duo in animation history? The critics say their feature film debut, \"Wallace &amp; Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,\" is powerful evidence for that claim. The quirky, cheese-loving inventor and his remarkably sentient and competent canine companion became popular in their Oscar-winning shorts, but critics say this film is something else altogether: funny, wild, eccentric, but also touching. At 95 percent on the Tomatometer, this \"Curse\" is a blessing. Or, more to the point, it’s the best-reviewed wide release of the year so far. Director Nick Park is batting a thousand; his first feature, \"Chicken Run,\" was another runaway critical success, scoring 97 percent on the Tomatometer.Sometimes you look at siblings and wonder how they could possibly be related. \"In Her Shoes\" tells the story of two sisters who are polar opposites except for their shoe size; it also describes Curtis Hanson‘s involvement in the film, as his last was \"8 Mile.\" But the critics say it’s a good fit. The performances by Cameron Diaz, Toni Collette, and (especially) Shirley MacLaine help elevate what could seem clichéd into a warm and involving drama. At 69 percent on the Tomatometer, \"In Her Shoes\" is a good fit.Gross-out comedy is tricky business. If you cross the line, a movie can just end up being disgusting. The critics say that’s just one of the problems with \"Waiting…,\" a film that covers similar ground as \"Office Space\" and \"Clerks,\" but with a greater focus on gags than people. Ryan Reynolds stars as a deeply jaded chain restaurant employee dedicated to high jinks, not customer service. Many of the pranks can’t be described in family newspapers, and the scribes say that’s the problem, they’re too over-the-top to be funny. At 25 percent on the Tomatometer, critics say you’ll be \"Waiting\" for laughs.Al Pacino stars as the head of a sports betting agency, with Matthew McConaughey as a once-promising quarterback with an almost preternatural ability to pick winners in \"Two for the Money.\" While the scribes say Pacino is his usual high-strung, compelling self, the rest of the movie is something of a fumble. Like a prima donna wide receiver who never makes the big play, this one’s a bit more flash than substance. At 15 percent on the Tomatometer, the critics say \"Two for the Money\" is a losing bet. But Pacino should be fine; his combined Tomatometer is at 71 percent.Recent DreamWorks Animated Films———————————————-54% — Madagascar (2005)35% — Shark Tale (2004)89% — Shrek 2 (2004)88% — Shrek (2001)97% — Chicken Run (2000)","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"Comics, documentaries, Hulu, Society, disaster, Bros., Infographic, golden, facebook, IFC, Year, Warner, comedy","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Critical-Consensus-Curse-Is-A-Blessing-Shoes-Fit"},{"id":"47508810673113","title":"Critical Consensus: A Regal \"Holiday,\" A Well-Trodden \"Road,\" A Tepid \"Tristan\"","content":"Critics Consensusvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Critical Consensus: A Regal \"Holiday,\" A Well-Trodden \"Road,\" A Tepid \"Tristan\"by Tim Ryan | January 12, 2006 |  CommentsThis week at the movies brings us films about a risk-averse woman cutting loose (\"Last Holiday\"), a groundbreaking underdog basketball team (\"Glory Road\"), and an ancient folktale of grand passion (\"Tristan &amp; Isolde\"). What do the critics have to say?There are some actors and actresses who are so likable, they can pull off nearly anything, no matter how predictable. Queen Latifah is one of them. \"Last Holiday,\" a remake of the Alec Guinness classic, tells the tale of a woman who, upon hearing dire medical news, decides to live every day as if it’s her last. Critics say a movie that could be a moderately entertaining rom-com about the virtues of believing in oneself becomes something altogether greater in the hands of Latifah, who brings a winning charm to every scene. At 68 percent, this is a \"Holiday\" to celebrate.The Kentucky Wildcats were among the dominant programs in college basketball during coach Adolph Rupp’s 42-year tenure. But in 1966, an all-African American starting lineup from Texas Western defeated Rupp’s all-white squad. There is no doubt that this is an inspiring, true-life underdog tale, and many critics say \"Glory Road,\" the big-screen adaptation starring Josh Lucas and Derek Luke, delivers the visceral thrills of our favorite sports flicks without skimping on the social commentary. But others say that inspiring true-life tales don’t necessarily make for exciting cinema; at 53 percent, this \"Road\" may be a little too well traveled.Speaking of inspiring, there’s a Celtic folktale that has inspired some of the world’s most monumental artistic works, from \"Romeo and Juliet\" to one of Wagner’s most influential operas. But critics say the movie treatment of \"Tristan &amp; Isolde\" isn’t poised to join the pantheon. A tale of romance in the war-torn aftermath of Roman control over England, critics say the film is too tepid and slow to pull off a sweeping romantic vision. At 32 percent on the Tomatometer, this is one love story that could use a little more passion.Recent Queen Latifah Movies:————————————40% — Beauty Shop (2005)33% — The Muppets: The Wizard of Oz (2005)70% — Barbershop 2: Back in Business (2004)3% — The Cookout (2004)10% — Taxi (2004)Recent Joshua Lucas Movies:————————————13% — Stealth (2005)51% — An Unfinished Life (2005)27% — Around the Bend (2004)57% — Undertow (2004)60% — Hulk (2003)","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"animated, TBS, comiccon, venice, Games, historical, 2018, godzilla, Academy, jamie","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Critical-Consensus-A-Regal-Holiday-A-Well-Trodden-Road-A-Tepid-Tristan"},{"id":"47508810716127","title":"Critics Consensus: Zathura‘s Got Game, Get Rich Dies Tryin’","content":"Critics Consensusvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Critics Consensus: Zathura's Got Game, Get Rich Dies Tryin'by Tim Ryan | November 10, 2005 |  CommentsThis week’s wide releases raise a number of questions. Is “Zathura” a game worth playing? Is 50 Cent‘s movie debut, “Get Rich or Die Tryin’,” the cinematic equivalent of a trip to the candy shop? Is “Derailed” a speedy locomotive, or is it true to its name? What do the critics have to say?“Zathura” is the third story by Rhode Island-based children’s book author Chris Van Allsburg to make the leap from the page to the big screen (the other two were “Jumanji” and last year’s “The Polar Express“). And critics say it’s the best of the bunch. “Zathura” tells the tale of a pair of squabbling brothers who must learn to work together after they are transported into space while playing the titular board game. According to the critics, the movie is solid family entertainment, with a real sense of adventure and wonder, emphasizing characters over the (not at all shabby) special effects. At 71 percent on the Tomatometer, “Zathura”‘s got game. And it beats “The Polar Bear Express,” which scored 56 percent on the Tomatometer, and “Jumanji,” at 48 percent.Curtis “50 Cent” Jackson has a life story that seems ready-made for cinematic treatment: he was a drug dealer, he survived a shooting, and he eventually became one of America’s biggest musical stars. But the critics say the semi-autobiographical “Get Rich or Die Tryin’,” which features 50 in his acting debut, still feels like the stuff of many other rags-to-riches dramas. The scribes say even veteran director Jim Sheridan can’t make it fresh, despite an excellent supporting cast that includes the always-dependable Terrence Howard. At 16 percent on the Tomatometer, “Get Rich or Die Tryin'” can’t make a dollar out of 50 Cent. And it’s the worst-reviewed film of Sheridan’s career (beating out “The Field,” at 46 percent).As the old saying goes, what a tangled web we weave, when we make a thriller about adultery and betrayal with lots of plot twists. “Derailed” tells the story of an extramarital affair gone terribly awry, after a very bad guy threatens the two trapped philanderers. The critics say the title is all too apt; the plot twists become more tangled as the film goes along, and Clive Owen and Jennifer Aniston, in spite of their considerable skills, are miscast as, respectively, a schlubby family man and a fundamentally decent femme fatale. At 19 percent on the Tomatometer, the critics say “Derailed” has jumped the tracks.Movies Starring Musicians Playing Musicians:——————————————————–5% — Undiscovered (2005) – Starring Ashlee Simpson81% — Hustle &amp; Flow (2005) – Starring Ludacris15% — Raise Your Voice (2004) – Starring Hilary Duff76% — 8 Mile (2002) – Starring Eminem7% — Glitter (2001) – Starring Mariah Carey14% — Crossroads (2002) – Starring Britney Spears24% — Duets (2000) – Starring Huey Lewis32% — Black and White (1999) – Starring Raekwon81% — Selena (1997) – Starring Jennifer Lopez11% — Cool as Ice (1991) – Starring Vanilla Ice70% — Purple Rain (1984) – Starring Prince","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"of, spain, History, Spike, Premium, VOD, rotten, Certified, TCA, 4/20","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"critical-consensus-zathuras-got-game-get-rich-dies-tryin"},{"id":"47508810704862","title":"Critical Consensus: \"Harry Potter,\" \"Walk the Line\" Both Certified Fre","content":"Critics Consensusvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Critical Consensus: \"Harry Potter,\" \"Walk the Line\" Both Certified Freby Tim Ryan | November 17, 2005 |  CommentsThis week’s wide releases find us within both a goblet and a burnin’ ring of fire. We’ve got legends, both fantastic (\"Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire\") and musical (the Johnny Cash biopic \"Walk the Line\"). Will these heavily anticipated films generate warmth, or be scorched by the critics?As the Harry Potter series progresses, the decision to cast actors who would literally grow into their roles is paying bigger dividends each time out; it’s becoming the fantasy equivalent of the \"Up\" documentaries. \"Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire,\" the fourth installment, is complete with the sorcery and effects that marked the earlier films, but this time, critics say, it generates the most drama and excitement when it focuses on the characters’ (achingly real) adolescent pains. At 87 percent on the Tomatometer, this \"Goblet\" is on fire, so hot, in fact, that it’s Certified Fresh. It’s only slightly below the best reviewed film of the series, \"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,\" which scored a lofty 89 percent. And it’s the second best-reviewed wide release of the year, behind only \"Wallace &amp; Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit\" (Tomatometer: 95 percent).There aren’t a lot of people who had both the Rev. Billy Graham and Glenn Danzig in their rolodexes. But there weren’t a lot of people like Johnny Cash, whose polarities are explored in \"Walk the Line,\" starring Joaquin Phoenix as the young Man in Black, and Reese Witherspoon as his wife and musical partner June Carter Cash. Critics say this one’s hotter than a pepper sprout, with great musical and thespian performances, and while \"Walk the Line\" may fall prey to many of the problems that plague movie biopics, you won’t cry, cry, cry about it in a film this well acted. How high’s the Tomatometer, mama? Seventy-eight percent, and while the wheat and the oats may be a washout, \"Walk the Line’s\" crop is Certified Fresh.Harry Potter Movies:—————————89% — Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (2004)82% — Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (2002)78% — Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone (2001)Recent Biopics:—————–92% — Capote (2005)89% — The Aviator (200481% — Ray (2004)89% — Kinsey (2004)74% — Auto Focus (2002)","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"Star, disaster, hollywood, Nickelodeon, Company, Yoda, Christmas, justice, Islander, FXX, motion","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Critical-Consensus-Harry-Potter-Walk-the-Line-Both-Certified-Fre"},{"id":"47508810664920","title":"Critical Consensus: \"Spear,\" \"New World\" Are OK, Not Great","content":"Critics Consensusvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Critical Consensus: \"Spear,\" \"New World\" Are OK, Not Greatby Tim Ryan | January 19, 2006 |  CommentsThis week at the movies brings us three culture clashes: Native Americans and Europeans (\"The New World\"), the Waodani people of Ecuador and a group of missionaries (\"End of the Spear\"), and, uh, werewolves and vampires (\"Underworld: Evolution\"). What will the critics say?Ever since the huge success of \"The Passion of the Christ,\" Hollywood has been looking for movies for religious folks that will cross over to the non-devout as well. \"End of the Spear\" tells the tale of an Ecuadorian warrior who, by tribal tradition, adopts the family of a missionary he has killed. While some critics have praised the film’s visuals and redemptive message, others say the message is a little too ham-fisted. It’s currently at 58 percent on the Tomatometer.Like the return of Halley’s Comet, director Terrence Malick‘s films are so rarely in theaters that it’s cause for celebration when they appear. With a career that began with the brilliant \"Badlands,\" Malick is a master, but a reclusive one. His latest is \"The New World,\" a meditative, evocative take on the Pocahontas/John Smith tale. The critics are pretty divided on this film; for some, it’s lyrical, visionary, and poetic, but for others it’s a slow, pretentious bore. At 58 percent on the Tomatometer, it’s well below Malick’s 79 percent career rating.One of the main principles of Darwin’s theory is survival of the fittest. It appears the studio didn’t think \"Underworld: Evolution\" was all that fit, since it wasn’t screened for critics. (Or maybe it wasn’t a work of intelligent design, either. Just covering all the bases.)Recent Colin Farrell Movies:———————————-71% — Intermission (2004)14% — Alexander (2004)49% — A Home at the End of the World (2004)72% — Phone Booth (2003)44% — The Recruit (2003)","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"Best, Sneak, rings, review, films, Games, sequels, camera, technology, Disney, leads, Reality, CBS, nature","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Critical-Consensus-Spear-New-World-Are-OK-Not-Great"}]
