From promising releases from new voices to&nbsp;experimental efforts&nbsp;from storied filmmakers – or perhaps the next indie darling to go the distance for end-of-year accolades – we will break it all down for you here each week in Fresh&nbsp;Indie Finds.&nbsp;This week the specialty box office provides us with a host of Pride-ful documentaries featuring iconic drag performers, along with some inspiring female-focused cinema. Plus, we’re looking ahead to August with the just-dropped trailer for&nbsp;Peanut Butter Falcon, which looks to be hilarious and heartfelt, and is currently at 100% on the Tomatometer.Opening This WeekendMaiden (2019)  98%The second documentary of the year from Sony Pictures Classics is likely their best shot an Academy Award in 2020. Maiden,&nbsp;which chronicles the trials and tribulations of the first all-female sail crew to enter the&nbsp;Whitbread Round the World Yacht Race,&nbsp;is a thrilling tale of determination, sportsmanship, and activism. Tired of being dismissed&nbsp;as a sailor&nbsp;because of her gender, 24-year-old Tracy Edwards took on&nbsp;the male-dominated competitive sailing world with her historic all-female team. Heckled and harassed at every turn,&nbsp;the crew tough it out in a thrilling doc that’s enriched by the presence of Edwards and a spectacular amount of home footage taken by the team. Philip De Semlyen of&nbsp;Time Out called Maiden “a knuckle-whitening tale of courage and grit.”Playing in New York and Los Angeles on June 28,&nbsp;expanding to limited screens on July 5.&nbsp;The Chambermaid (La camarista) (2019)  99%Actress turned director Lila Aviles makes an impressive debut with The Chambermaid. Title character Eve works as a maid in&nbsp;a luxurious Mexico City hotel&nbsp;where her days are filled with&nbsp;monotonous menial tasks performed over long hours. To end her boredom, she breaks the time&nbsp;with quiet examinations of the items left in rooms and new friendships that&nbsp;fuel&nbsp;her determination for&nbsp;a better life.&nbsp;Framing star Gabriela Cartol in stationary wide shots, director Aviles has an almost voyeuristic focus on the daily tasks of a housekeeper; as we watch and learn&nbsp;what&nbsp;motivates Eve outside of her job, we start to ache with her at the hardship and frustrations of her toils. Oliver Jones of The&nbsp;Observer said of the lead, “Eve is one of the most fully and forcefully crafted characters I have seen on screen in some time.”Playing in New York and Los Angeles on June 28,&nbsp;expands to limited screens on July 5.&nbsp;The Queen (1968)  96%The Queen is a bona fide piece of LGBTQ history. The&nbsp;documentary, re-released this week for Pride with a 4k restoration,&nbsp;follows the Miss All-America Camp Beauty Contest, where the MC for the&nbsp;night is Jack&nbsp;Doroshow (also known as Flawless Sabrina, his drag persona). Jack/Sabrina may have been director&nbsp;Frank Simon’s subject, but&nbsp;it’s one of the contestants who gives the film its most memorable scene. Legendary New York City drag queen Crystal Labeija’s rant after she loses – including the famous line, “Her makeup is terrible, and she doesn’t LOOK good!” – has become iconic in drag culture, and exposes some of the racial issues that permeated drag pageants at the time, when black and brown queens struggled to nab crowns.&nbsp;If you live for&nbsp;POSE&nbsp;and&nbsp;RuPaul’s Drag Race,&nbsp;don’t let this one get by you.Playing in New York on June 28,&nbsp;expands to Los Angeles, Miami, Nashville, Houston, Chicago, San Francisco and limited screens on July 5.&nbsp;Fresh and Still in TheatersParis Is Burning (1991)  98%Spotlight Pick!Re-released for Pride Month, Paris is Burning&nbsp;is still in theaters.&nbsp;Arguably&nbsp;the most iconic LGBTQ documentary of all time (and&nbsp;number 16 on our list of the 200 Best LGBTQ films ever),&nbsp;Paris is Burning took ballroom culture to the big screen. After the popularity of Madonna’s hit song “Vogue,” documentary filmmaker Jennie Livingston sought out the underground POC-led pageant/dancehall&nbsp;showcases that inspired it. Livingston, with the help of&nbsp;legendary staples of the ballroom scene Pepper Labeija, Angie Xtravaganza, Willi Ninja, and Paris Dupree, brought&nbsp;slang like “reading,” “shade,” and “fierce” to the masses. It makes for a perfect double feature with The Queen: the underground balls of Paris is Burning were founded by Crystal Labeija as a direct response to her snubbing at the pageant featured in the 1968 doc.&nbsp;&nbsp;In Limited Release until June 30.Along with… The Last Black Man in San Francisco (2019) ,&nbsp;a young black man and his best friend struggle against gentrification and marginalization in this lyrical debut from Joe Talbot.

The Biggest Little Farm (2019) , filmmaker turned farmer&nbsp;John Chester chronicles his and his wife’s 7-year mission to build a sustainable large scale organic farm in Southern California.

Jackson). What do the critics have to say?Unknown 55%Lately, Liam Neeson has a thing for European intrigue. He journeyed to Paris to rescue his daughter in 2009’s Taken, and now he heads to Berlin for Unknown, a twisty thriller that critics say undermines its strong premise with implausible plotting. Neeson stars as a man who falls into a coma after a car accident; when he awakens, he discovers his wife (January Jones) doesn’t recognize him, and he’s being targeted by shadowy forces. The pundits say Neeson and an expert supporting cast help keep Unknown watchable, but ultimately, the unlikely story and excessive action set pieces keep it from truly soaring.I Am Number Four 19%Another week, another tale of a teenager with supernatural powers. In I Am Number Four, our hero is neither a vampire nor a wizard, but an alien — which matters little to critics, who say the movie has some decent action scenes, but little in the way of memorable characters or original plotting. Alex Pettyfer stars as a teenage alien with extraordinary powers who wants to settle down and enjoy high school life in a sleepy Ohio town; unfortunately, some evil aliens have already killed three of his associates. The pundits say Four rips off just about every other film of its ilk, from Twilight to Harry Potter, without adding much to the formula, though there are a few exciting moments here and there.Big Mommas: Like Father, Like Son 5%Some cinematic stories are so sprawling or emotionally overwhelming that it takes a trilogy to tell them — think Lord of the Rings or the Apu trilogy. But the Big Momma movies? If the first two installments didn’t exactly set the critical world afire, the pundits are especially unamused by Big Mommas: Like Father, Like Son, calling it a particularly slim assemblage of crass gags that furthers the franchise’s one-joke premise without, ahem, expanding upon it. Once again, Martin Lawrence plays an FBI agent who must go undercover in the most counterintuitive of disguises — this time in an all-girls school after his nephew witnesses a killing. The pundits say Big Mommas is tired stuff – clichéd, dull, and shrill, with little reason to exist. (Check out this week’s Total Recall, in which we present a brief history of movies with dudes in drag.)Also opening this week in limited release:The Last Lions, a documentary about a lioness defending her cubs during a harsh journey, is at 90 percent.We Are What We Are, about a family of cannibals in a desperate situation, is at 77 percent.Zero Bridge, a realist portrait of young people in a gritty Kashmiri town, is at 75 percent.Even the Rain, starring Gael García Bernal in an ambitious drama about Spanish imperialism through the ages, is at 67 percent.Putty Hill, a drama about the effect of a young man’s death on a close-knit blue-collar community, is at 67 percent.Brotherhood, the tale of a fraternity hazing ritual gone seriously wrong, is at 50 percent.Vanishing On 7th Street, starring Hayden Christensen and Thandie Newton in a thriller about a mysteriously abandoned city neighborhood, is at 48 percent.The Chaperone, starring Paul “Triple H” Levesque in a comedy about an ex-con who tries to escape his bank robbing past by chaperoning a class trip, is at 33 percent.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"aliens, 2015, ABC, Emmys, Horse","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Critics-Consensus-Unknowns-Plot-Twists-Too-Much"},{"id":"47614450979867","title":"Through Bergman’s Past, Brightly","content":"var mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Through Bergman's Past, BrightlyRT Staffers Select Their Favorite Works from the Great Directorby Tim Ryan | July 30, 2007 |  CommentsWith the passing of Ingmar Bergman Monday, the world of cinema lost one of its most unique and important voices. Thus, we at Rotten Tomatoes decided to pick our favorite Bergman films as a tribute to the man who contributed so much to the art of movies.From dark allegory (The Seventh Seal) to light(er) comedy (Smiles of a Summer Night), from emotionally wrenching period drama (Sawdust and Tinsel, Cries and Whispers) to musical theater (The Magic Flute), Bergman contributed a depth of feeling and intelligence to the cinema seldom seen before. The great Swedish director confronted the mysteries of human existence head-on, and, in doing so, carved out a niche that casts a long shadow over the medium.Bergman’s work has influenced everything from The Break-Up to Bill and Ted’s Bogus Journey; Wes Craven utilized The Virgin Spring as the basis for Last House on the Left, while Woody Allen and Robert Altman cited him as a key influence.With a filmography as rich and potent as Bergman’s, it’s hard to know where to start. If you’re a beginner to Bergman’s oeuvre, here are some of our favorites.Wild StrawberriesA lyrical and sometimes surreal film about a man in the twilight of his life, Wild Strawberries explores Bergman’s recurrent themes of innocent children subjected to dishonorable elders. The old man in Wild Strawberries realizes too late that he’s failed to create meaningful relationships with those near to him and remembers, with some dishonesty, his often painful past.Fanny and AlexanderA broadly autobiographical film about Bergman’s own upbringing, Fanny and Alexander was made for Swedish TV and re-edited from 300 minutes down to 168 for release in American theaters. Bergman’s most popular film in the states, Fanny and Alexander deals again with Bergman’s issues of innocence and knowledge and displays in, sometimes depraved ways, how children don’t lose their innocence so much as have it stolen from them.— Sara SchieronWinter LightBest known as the middle entry of Bergman’s “faith trilogy,” Winter Light revolves around a pastor’s crisis of faith after he’s unable to console one of his congregation. It’s an emotionally direct film — no dream sequences, no parlor games with Death — and Bergman skillfully draws tension from this simplicity. The film essentially ends the same way it begins, but everything that transpires in between gives the film’s final moment a shot of existential horror Bergman is legendary for.— Alex VoPersonaA deeply unsettling, hypnotic work, Persona explores the fluidity of human existence. Liv Ullman plays Elizabeth, an actress who has suffered an onstage breakdown; she refuses to speak, and is cared for by Alma (Bibi Andersson). What follows is a disquieting journey into the depths of the soul; as Alma reveals her deepest secrets to Elizabeth, she finds herself in an emotional tug-of-war with her patient. Persona is Bergman at his most formally experimental, and his obsession with the poetry of the human face is at its apex in this mysterious, rewarding film.MonikaOne of Bergman’s earliest films, Monika is about the fleeting nature and naiveté of youthful passions. A free-spirited teenager named Monika (Harriet Andersson) and her reserved boyfriend Harry (Lars Ekborg) spend an idyllic summer on a remote island — before reality and responsibility set in. Monika may lack the existential probing and Big Questions of Bergman’s later films, but as an examination of the messiness of teenage emotions, it has a delicate beauty all its own.— Tim Ryan","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"Tyler, Sundance, harry, Funimation, anthology, E3, nfl, zombies, festival, Animation, halloween, golden, Pet","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"through-bergmans-past-brightly"},{"id":"47509201196533","title":"Weekly Ketchup: The Big Short Lands Brad Pitt, Christian Bale, Ryan Gosling, and Steve Carell","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Weekly Ketchup: The Big Short Lands Brad Pitt, Christian Bale, Ryan Gosling, and Steve CarellPlus, new roles for Michael Keaton, Tom Cruise, Ben Affleck, and Bradley Cooper.by Greg Dean Schmitz | January 16, 2015 |  CommentsThis Week, the biggest movie-related story was obviously the Academy Awards nominations and the controversies that have sprung up in reaction to them (like the nominations that didn’t happen). But since the Weekly Ketchup is dedicated to the hottest stories in “film development” (what new movies were announced, casting news, etc), we’re not going to directly cover the Oscars here, though many nominees (such as Steve Carell, Bradley Cooper, and Michael Keaton) did make the news this week.&nbsp;This Week’s Top StoryTHE BIG SHORT LANDS AWARD FRIENDLY QUARTET: PITT, BALE, GOSLING, CARELLAfter the Academy Awards nominations were announced Thursday morning, a big social media spotlight was shone on the membership statistics of the Academy. The movies that get covered in the Weekly Ketchup in one year become the movies in theaters in the next, or the year after that. In other words, if there’s a problem with the movies the Academy is awarding, part of the problem starts with the films that Hollywood is producing. Every year as Oscar nominations (and then later, the actual awards) are announced, Oscar favorites often also make the news with fresh projects on the way. The most star-studded new project this week had to be The Big Short, based on the Michael Lewis book about the 2008 financial crisis. The first three stars were not specifically nominated this year, but Brad Pitt executive produced Selma, Ryan Gosling is a past nominee (for Half Nelson), and Christian Bale won his first Oscar for The Fighter, and was nominated for American Hustle. Brad Pitt also won an Oscar for producing 12 Years a Slave, has been nominated three times as an actor, and is also producing The Big Short. That trio was soon joined by one of this year’s nominees, Steve Carell (for Foxcatcher), who is also in talks. The four actors are in negotiations to play leading figures at financial institutions Deutsche Bank, Cornwall Capital, FrontPoint Partners, and Scion Capital. Comedy director Adam McKay (Anchorman; cowriter of Ant-Man) is expected to make a genre shift to serious drama with The Big Short.Fresh Developments This Week#1 MICHAEL KEATON: FROM BIRDMAN TO MCDONALD’S BIOPIC THE FOUNDERThe week started for Michael Keaton with an emotional speech at the Golden Globes, and continued right on through a nomination for Best Actor for Birdman. The veteran actor is back in the spotlight, and his agents are continuing to land him new deals. Keaton is now in talks to star as Ray Kroc in The Founder, which will tell “the dark story of the rise of the McDonald’s fast food empire.” Keaton will also be costarring with another of this year’s Golden Globes winners, J.K. Simmons (and Avengers costar Tom Hiddleston) in Kong: Skull Island, which Simmons revealed this week will take place at least partly in Detroit in 1971. Universal Pictures has scheduled Kong: Skull Island for March 10, 2017.&nbsp;#2 BEN AFFLECK’S GONE GIRL TEAM TO REUNITE FOR STRANGERS ON A TRAIN REMAKEThe Weekly Ketchup regularly delegates remakes to the “Rotten Idea” section. It’s sort of a thing. Sometimes, however, it’s not quite that easy. Take, for example, the remake of Alfred Hitchcock’s Strangers on a Train, which has been in development for a while (except that the previous news was about a very different take). In a surprising turn, three of the key players in this year’s Gone Girl are now planning to reunite for just such a Hitchcock remake. Gillian Flynn (author and screenwriter of Gone Girl) will adapt Patricia Highsmith’s novel as Strangers, about a famous actor (played by Ben Affleck) in the middle of awards season, who accepts a private plane ride from a wealthy stranger (who presumably proposes a murderous deal). Strangers will be directed by David Fincher (Fight Club, Gone Girl), who a few years ago directed the English language remake of The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo. Warner Bros has put Strangers on a fast track for production within the next year or so, hoping to start filming before Ben Affleck starts filming Justice League in 2016.&nbsp;#3 EDGE OF TOMORROW REUNION: TOM CRUISE TO STAR IN 1980S DRUG DRAMA MENAThe Gone Girl reunion wasn’t the only such story this week. Edge of Tomorrow may have had a generic title that ended up being relabeled as Live Die Repeat, but the film was a critical darling. And, apparently, Tom Cruise and director Doug Liman enjoyed working togeter, because they are now attached to another film together. Cruise and Liman are now in talks with Imagine Entertainment and Universal Pictures to reunite for the 1980s drug drama Mena, based on a true story. Tom Cruise will play “Barry Seal, a pilot who, in the 1980s, was a gun runner, and drug trafficker who transported contraband for the CIA and the Medellin cartel. He was eventually shot to death by the latter in Baton Rouge. The title refers to Mena, Arkansas, where a lot of the illegal activity took place, under the noses of Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush, and then-Arkansas Governor Bill Clinton.” Doug Liman has a strong history at Universal Pictures, since he was the director of The Bourne Identity. If the deals work out, Mena will start filming later this year.&nbsp;#4 EDGAR WRIGHT’S BABY DRIVER DETAILS REVEALEDThe movie that is chugging along towards production in the shadow and dust following Edgar Wright’s departure from Marvel’s Ant-Man is his long-in-development Baby Driver, which until this week, we knew relatively little about. Now we can report that Baby Driver is a “rock and roll chase movie” about a “young getaway driver who relies on the beat of his personal soundtrack to be the best in the game. But after being coerced into working for a crime boss, he must face the music when a doomed heist threatens his life, long, and freedom.” People are drawing comparisons to Drive, but the premise also sounds to this writer a bit like The Transporter. Edgar Wright is reportedly hoping to cast Ansel Elgort (The Fault in Our Stars) as the lead character, with Emma Stone and Michael Douglas (AKA his almost Ant-Man coworker) both being pursued to take supporting roles.&nbsp;#5 TOM HARDY DROPS OUT OF SUICIDE SQUAD — WILL JAKE GYLLENHAAL REPLACE HIM?When Warner Bros announced an ambitious ensemble cast for their super villain movie Suicide Squad, it was perhaps inevitable that scheduling conflicts would come into play. Some of the most successful actors are also the busiest, and fitting in several months for a big tentpole production sometimes just isn’t possible. That’s what happened to Warner Bros’ DC Comics adaptation Suicide Squad, which this week lost Tom Hardy (as team leader Rick Flagg) due to production over runs on The Revenant (for Birdman director Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu). Warner Bros is reportedly hoping to replace Tom Hardy with Jake Gyllenhaal, who worked with director David Ayer on End of Watch. If Gyllenhaal signs on, and everyone else’s deals stay firm, he will join an ensemble cast which includes Jared Leto (The Joker), Will Smith (Deadshot), Jai Courtney (Captain Boomerang), Viola Davis (Amanda Waller), Cara Delevigne (Enchantress), Jesse Eisenberg (Lex Luthor), and Margot Robbie (Harley Quinn). This story is truly borderline — we almost called it a “Rotten Idea” — but the promise of Jake Gyllenhaal leading a super villain team movie is sort of awesome.&nbsp;#6 BRADLEY COOPER TO MAKE DIRECTORIAL DEBUT WITH HONEYMOON WITH HARRYWhen Selma star David Oyelowo wasn’t nominated for a Best Actor Academy Award, one of the actors whose nomination was questioned by columnists was Bradley Cooper for American Sniper. While some of the other Oscars-timed announcements this week seem like previews of Awards season 2016 or 2017, Bradley Cooper’s is a “dramedy” (a genre blend the Academy has mostly rejected since the late 1990s). Bradley Cooper will also make his directorial debut with New Line Cinema’s Honeymoon with Harry, about a man whose bride dies just before their wedding, and who is forced to spend their would-be honeymoon with his grieving would-be father-in-law, to be played by Robert De Niro. Honeymoon with Harry has been in development for over ten years, and is most frequently compared to the films of James L. Brooks (Broadcast News, As Good As It Gets, Terms of Endearment). Are audiences ready for a movie like that to return with two big stars?Rotten Ideas of the Week#3 THE SPIDER-MAN/AVENGERS RUMORS CONTINUEAt first glance, it might be baffling why we’re calling this specific story a “Rotten Idea.” After all, it’s about Spider-Man joining the MCU as a member of the Avengers in Avengers: Infinity War Part 1, and that would be awesome, right? The problem is, yes, that was a huge story this week, and you probably saw it on Twitter or Facebook a dozen times, but… it might be complete hooey, with a Sony representative saying the story has “no validity whatsoever.” So, the Rotten Idea here is not the dream of Spidey fighting alongside Captain America and Iron Man and Thor — we are right there with you. But these semi-regular cloud-chasing rumors don’t really help accomplish our cinematic daydreams. They often just lead to disappointment when a year or two goes by, and you remember it never happened.&nbsp;#2 YOU CAN’T ESCAPE FROM THE ESCAPE FROM NEW YORK REMAKEIn the last ten or so years when Hollywood was particularly addicted to genre remakes, one of the projects that just wouldn’t go away was the Escape from New York remake. Recently, there was a bidding war between various studios, and 20th Century Fox won the bid, with John Carpenter attached to executive produce. You can probably disregard most of what you’ve heard in the past, because a “start from scratch” approach is being touted. Having said that, some of the previous rumors or discussions might still happen (you never know). Recent rumored stars to be the new Snake Plissken have included Charlie Hunnam (Pacific Rim) and Chris Hemsworth (Marvel’s Thor). The Escape from New York remake now needs to find a director, and they don’t even have the help of a beacon. We’re calling this one a “Rotten Idea” just because… if there’s any John Carpenter film that still holds up without a remake, it’s The Thing ( and look at what happened there). If there’s a second one… it’s Escape from New York. Can anyone beat Kurt Russell as Snake Plissken?&nbsp;#1 JAMES CAMERON PUSHES THE AVATAR SEQUEL TRILOGY BACK TO START IN 2017What to do with Avatar is a bit of a conundrum. On one hand, the film was a huge hit for 20th Century Fox and director James Cameron, so obviously, consideration of a sequel was going to happen. However, we’re now over five years past Avatar, and in that time, Cameron’s work on a trilogy of Avatar sequels has had at least one obvious impact: we haven’t been getting new movies from director James Cameron. And this week, we found out that the trilogy, which was expected to be released a year apart starting 2016, has been pushed back another year so the three films will be released in late 2017, 2018 and 2019. So, now we’re looking at 8 years without new films from James Cameron. If you take out his documentary work, there will now be a 20+ year space (1995 to 2016) in Cameron’s career where he only directed two non-documentary films: Titanic and Avatar. For fans of his 1980s and 1990s action films, that’s a pretty Rotten Idea. At this pace, will we ever get Cameron’s adaptation of Battle Angel Alita?For more Weekly Ketchup columns by Greg Dean Schmitz, check out the WK archive, and you can contact GDS via Facebook.","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"Games, mission:, Plus, street, fiction, Annual, Fox, true, action, independent, It","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/ryan-gosling.jpg","slug":"weekly-ketchup-the-big-short-lands-brad-pitt-christian-bale-ryan-gosling-and-steve-carell"},{"id":"47614651127907","title":"RT on DVD & Blu-Ray: Endless Love and Steve Zissou","content":"RT on DVDvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})RT on DVD &amp; Blu-Ray: Endless Love and Steve ZissouA bad romance leads the pack in a week devoid of any big releases.by Ryan Fujitani | May 27, 2014 |  CommentsIt looks like the home video departments at all the studios decided to take Memorial Day off, because hardly anything worth mentioning is hitting shelves this week. We start off with a romance remake critics didn’t like very much, and a handful of TV shows and small movies only a handful of people chose to see. Read on for details:Endless Love 16%Though the film is notable for featuring a young Tom Cruise in his first role, the most enduring thing to come out of Franco Zeffirelli’s 1981 romance Endless Love might be the chart-topping duet by Diana Ross and Lionel Richie it inspired. Nevertheless, we got a remake of that film earlier this year, and critics say it’s even less memorable this time around. Based on the novel by Scott Spencer, the story revolves around the romance between high schoolers Jade (Gabriella Wilde) and David (Alex Pettyfer), whose attempts to be together are repeatedly thwarted by Jade’s father (Bruce Greenwood). Will Jade forsake her love and leave for a summer internship in preparation for a medical career at Brown University? Of course not. Endless Love is less faithful to its source material, which isn’t a problem in and of itself, except that it’s strikingly bland, full of clichés, and in some moments, even unintentionally funny.Also available this week:A Birder’s Guide to Everything (90%), starring Kodi Smit-McPhee and Ben Kingsley in a coming-of-age road movie about a teen who sets off with his friends in search of an extinct bird.Run &amp; Jump (86%), starring Maxine Peake and Will Forte in a drama about an Irish housewife whose husband suffers a stroke and whose family is subsequently made the subject of a psychological study.Cheap Thrills (85%), a Certified Fresh dark comedy about two friends and a wealthy married couple who meet at a bar and engage in a series of progressively more twisted dares.Another Criterion Collection release this week: Wes Anderson’s The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou (55%), starring Bill Murray and a bunch of people in a story about an oceanographer in search of a shark who once ate one of his men.Season three of BBC’s adaptation of the Swedish crime drama Wallander (100%), starring Kenneth Branagh as the titular detective.Season four of USA’s Covert Affairs (100%), which finds Piper Perabo’s CIA agent Annie posing as an importer/exporter of fine goods.Season three of another USA drama, Suits (70%), about a young NYC lawyer without a degree and the mentor who helps keep his secret.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"Mystery, HBO, Black, TV+, of, movies","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"rt-on-dvd-and-blu-ray-endless-love-and-steve-zissou"},{"id":"47614860680398","title":"Roselyn Sanchez Prepares for \"The Game Plan\" and \"Rush Hour 3\"","content":"var mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Roselyn Sanchez Prepares for \"The Game Plan\" and \"Rush Hour 3\"by Scott Weinberg | June 14, 2006 |  CommentsLovely young actress Roselyn Sanchez has a pair of high-profile flicks on the way, one of which is a Disney family comedy called \"The Game Plan,\" in which she’ll co-star with The Rock, and the other of which is \"Rush Hour 3,\" in which she’ll (briefly) reprise her role from the first sequel.From The Hollywood Reporter: \"Roselyn Sanchez has landed the female lead in the Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson starrer \"The Game Plan\" for Walt Disney Pictures.

The latest&nbsp;Star Wars&nbsp;episode was always expected to top the box office with ease over the New Year’s frame but moviegoers have been having a wild ride with&nbsp;Jumanji&nbsp;and spreading electric buzz throughout the marketplace. The former suffered the largest decline of any wide release while the latter enjoyed a strong bump up from last weekend.In fact, daily grosses were about dead even between the two films on both Saturday and Sunday and Sony is actually projecting a higher gross for Jumanji&nbsp;on the New Year’s Day holiday Monday ($16.4M) than Disney is for&nbsp;Jedi&nbsp;($13.2M). The public must vote with its own dollars, but these two films are clearly commanding the lion’s share of the box office as 2017 closes out. 59% of all ticket sales for the top ten films this weekend went to this pair of hits.Leading the Friday-to-Sunday weekend period by less than $2M,&nbsp;Last Jedi&nbsp;grossed an estimated $52.4M falling 27% in its third round. Disney has amassed a stellar $517.1M through December 31 surpassing the $504M of its own&nbsp;Beauty and the Beast&nbsp;to become the top grossing domestic hit of 2017. And it still has more to go. Jedi&nbsp;also now sits at number eight on the list of all-time domestic blockbusters on its way past the $600M barrier in the coming weeks.Compared to the last two&nbsp;Star Wars&nbsp;movies released this same time of year,&nbsp;Last Jedi’s 17-day total is running 30% behind 2015’s&nbsp;The Force Awakens&nbsp;but 22% ahead of Rogue One&nbsp;from last year. It should be noted that the potent New Year’s Day fell during this period for the last two films, but not for this new chapter. The road ahead for&nbsp;The Last Jedi&nbsp;should allow it to finish in the neighborhood of $650M challenging&nbsp;Jurassic World&nbsp;for the all-time number four spot.Overseas, the new Luke Skywalker saga grossed an estimated $68M this weekend pushing the offshore tally to $523.3M as the domestic/international split has remained steady at about the 50/50 level. The global box office broke the $1 billion mark this weekend and now sits at $1.04 billion with the much awaited China release kicking off this coming Friday.The overperforming wonder of this holiday season has been Jumanji&nbsp;which was expected to post solid numbers, but has truly been turbo-charged propelled by starpower, great word-of-mouth, and being a highly entertaining package at a time when a broad audience really wants that. The Sony hit grossed an estimated $50.6M this weekend jumping up an impressive 39% from last weekend’s opening frame. With last Sunday being Christmas Eve, a depressed day at the box office, many holdovers saw increases this weekend.After only 12 days, the action adventure has soared to a stunning $169.9M and is close to smashing the $200M mark. Jumanji&nbsp;will easily become Dwayne Johnson’s top grossing live action film outside of the&nbsp;Fast &amp; Furious&nbsp;franchise. Based on early four-day weekend estimates which include studio projections for Monday’s holiday, Jumanji‘s $67M will edge out the $65.6M of The Last Jedi. Of course, ticket buyers must ultimately spend their time and money their own way and final four-day numbers will be reported on Tuesday, but to even be in the ballpark of beating out&nbsp;Star Wars&nbsp;is a terrific accomplishment.Sitting in third place again was the comedy sequel Pitch Perfect 3&nbsp;which dipped 11% from its debut to an estimated $17.8M pushing Universal’s cume to $64.3M. Fox’s Hugh Jackman musical The Greatest Showman&nbsp;surged a stellar 73% to an estimated $15.3M putting the PG-rated crowdpleaser at $48.8M to date.The studio took the next spot too with the animated comedy Ferdinand&nbsp;which grossed an estimated $11.7M in its third weekend, up a sturdy 59%, for a new total of $53.8M. Rival toon Coco&nbsp;was in sixth in its sixth weekend taking in an estimated $6.6M, up 22%. The Pixar hit has now banked $178.9M in North America, $173.3M in China, and a grand total of $537.9M worldwide with Korea, the U.K. and Japan still to open.Ridley Scott’s new kidnapping drama&nbsp;All the Money in the World&nbsp;ranked seventh with an estimated $5.5M in its first weekend of play averaging a mild $2,628 from 2,074 theaters. Sony opened the R-rated film on Christmas Day and has collected $12.6M in its first seven days of release.&nbsp;World&nbsp;gained attention for its last-minute replacement of Christopher Plummer for Kevin Spacey in the key supporting role.The Winston Churchill film Darkest Hour&nbsp;rose 36% to an estimated $5.3M giving Focus $17.9M so far. The Matt Damon flop Downsizing&nbsp;followed with an estimated $4.6M, down 7%, putting Paramount at $17.1M. Rounding out the top ten was the comedy Father Figures&nbsp;which continued to be ignored taking in an estimated $3.7M, up 13%, leaving Warner Bros. at a measly $12.7M overall.The top ten films grossed an estimated $173.3M which was up 4% from last year when&nbsp;Rogue One&nbsp;stayed at number one with $49.6M; but down 13% from 2015 when&nbsp;The Force Awakens&nbsp;remained in the top spot with&nbsp;$90.2M.Get earlier box office updates and analysis by following BoxOfficeGuru.com on&nbsp;Twitter.","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"Martial, Out, TV, Dark, National, Tour, TNT, Ellie, your, rt, Fantasy, ABC, Cartoon, Chilling","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/31130836/RT_BoxOffice_Jedi-Jumanji_600X314.jpg","slug":"box-office-jedi-and-jumanji-lead-final-2017-weekend"},{"id":"47612879289679","title":"New on DVD & Blu-Ray: A Haunted House 2, Bears, and Locke","content":"RT on DVDvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})New on DVD &amp; Blu-Ray: A Haunted House 2, Bears, and LockePlus, the latest Irvine Welsh adaptation, a number of indies, and some new TV.by Ryan Fujitani | August 12, 2014 |  CommentsThis week on home video, we’ve got a poorly reviewed horror spoof sequel, Disneynature’s latest adventure, and a powerful one-man drama to head things off. Then, we’ve got a James McAvoy-powered Irvine Welsh adaptation and a number of smaller releases, as well as a couple of notable choices on TV. Read on for details:A Haunted House 2 8%If you thought the Wayans family would be satisfied skewering horror movie conventions with their Scary Movie franchise, you were dead wrong. Marlon Wayans, the star of that franchise’s first two installments, decided to co-produce, co-write, and star in A Haunted House, another horror spoof lampooning the genre’s influx of Paranormal Activity-styled found footage films. Made on a budget of $2.5 million, the film grossed over $60 million worldwide despite dismal reviews, so this year we got a sequel, whether we wanted it or not. Filled with the usual gags and pop culture references, A Haunted House 2 was even less impressive, netting an 8 percent Tomatometer score and a paltry $24 million in box office receipts. For those of you willing to brave it, special features are limited to just a commentary track and some deleted and extended scenes.Bears 90%BBC nature producer Alastair Fothergill and his team of supremely talented photographers have proven to be a rather great match for Disneynature, as the latter has consistently turned the former’s stunning work into successful feature films. Their latest joint effort is Bears, which opened back in April. In lieu of Dick Butkus, John C. Reilly was hired to narrate the tale of an Alaskan grizzly bear and her two cubs as they overcome obstacles and learn to survive over the course of a year. Certified Fresh at 91 percent, Bears earned the best reviews of any Disneynature film to date, with critics applauding its typically outstanding cinematography and its sweet-but-not-too-sweet story. The Blu-ray includes four featurettes covering how the film was made and a music video by Olivia Holt.Locke 91%If you’re going to make a movie that largely (or entirely) rests on the charisma of its lead, it’s best to get someone with the chops to pull it off properly. Cast Away had Tom Hanks, All Is Lost had Robert Redford, and even Ryan Reynolds surprised some folks with his work in Buried. Likewise, Steven Knight’s single-location drama features Tom Hardy driving in his car and talking on his cell phone for the entirety of its 85-minute runtime, and it worked like gangbusters, according to critics. Ivan Locke (Hardy) is a construction foreman who, on the night before an important job, discovers the co-worker he had a one-night stand with is about to give birth; racing to be with her, Ivan phones his family, his mistress, and a colleague, juggling his responsibilities the best he can. Hardy offered up a powerhouse performance in Locke and critics took notice, rewarding his efforts with a Certified Fresh 88 percent on the Tomatometer. The only features available on the home video release are an audio commentary with Knight and a making-of featurette.Filth 66%Irvine Welsh adaptations haven’t seen much success since Danny Boyle’s Trainspotting first brought his work to the big screen — 1998’s The Acid House was disjointed at best, and 2012’s Ecstasy was essentially a poor rehash of Trainspotting (even its poster mimicked the earlier film). Released last year in the UK and earlier this year in the US, Filth hoped to fare better, employing a cast that included Jamie Bell, Jim Broadbent, Eddie Marsan, Imogen Poots, and as the manipulative, drug-addled, alcoholic, abusive Detective Sergeant Bruce Robertson, James “Young Professor X” McAvoy. The film follows Robertson’s exploits as he investigates the murder of a Japanese student, slowly descending into insanity amid severe hallucinations. It’s a dark, twisted comedy, and most critics went along with it, particularly for McAvoy’s performance, even if many found the film lived up to its title a bit too accurately. Another fairly barebones release, Filth comes with just a behind the scenes featurette and its theatrical trailer.Also available this week:The Railway Man (66 percent), starring Colin Firth and Nicole Kidman in a true story about Eric Lomax, a former WWII POW who discovers years later that his Japanese interpreter is still alive, and seeks him out.Breathe In (54 percent), starring Guy Pearce and Felicity Jones in a drama about a foreign exchange student who upsets the balance in her host family’s home.Hateship Loveship (51 percent), starring Kristen Wiig and Guy Pearce in a dramedy about a young girl who plots a faux relationship online between her housekeeper and her widower father.Summer in February (36 percent), starring Dominic Cooper and Emily Browning in the dramatized true story of painter Sir Alfred Munnings, who falls in love with the same woman as his closest friend.Frankie &amp; Alice (21 percent), starring Halle Berry and Stellan Skarsgard in a drama about a woman with multiple personality disorder trying to make sense of her condition.Rage (15 percent) starring Nicolas Cage in an action thriller about a man with a violent past who seeks revenge when his daughter is kidnapped.The Certified Fresh first season of NBC’s The Blacklist (82 percent) is available on DVD.Season one of AMC drama Low Winter Sun (45 percent) is also available on DVD.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"Creative, streaming","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"new-on-dvd-and-blu-ray-a-haunted-house-2-bears-and-locke"},{"id":"47613879288589","title":"Christopher Nolan Hints About \"Joker\" Approach","content":"var mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Christopher Nolan Hints About \"Joker\" Approachby Scott Weinberg | August 24, 2006 |  CommentsBlogger / humorous journalist / serious movie geek Josh Horowitz recently had a sit-down with \"Batman Begins\" director Christopher Nolan in order to get some info on the filmmaker’s next project, \"The Prestige\" … but you just know that \"The Dark Knight\" (aka \"Batman Begins 2\") was going to come up at some point.

Cinematographer Jess Hall reveals some production secrets that made Wanda's manic sitcom fantasy world possible.by Erik Amaya | March 4, 2021 |  Comments(Photo by Marvel Studios)As revealed in last week’s episode of WandaVision, the sitcoms recreated in its earliest episodes truly mattered to Wanda (Elizabeth Olsen). The homages to The Dick Van Dyke Show, Bewitched, The Brady Bunch, and Malcolm in the Middle literally recall a suitcase her father carried around Sokovia. The shows continued to offer her solace into her adulthood, as seen in the moment when she and Vision (Paul Bettany) first bonded at Avengers HQ. Although there is some discussion as to when the DVD box sets in the suitcase were available at the time, and a few other questions about the timeline, this thematic connection is key to the overall story. And, as the program’s director of photography Jess Hall told Rotten Tomatoes recently, it was there from very early on.“It was in the first draft of [showrunner] Jac Schaeffer’s episode eight script that I read early in pre-production,” he said. “So it was in my mind and informed my approach from the beginning.”In the flashback to her Sokovian child, viewers learned Dick Van Dyke was Wanda’s favorite of the old American sitcoms exported to the Eastern European country. Naturally, it was the one the series took the greatest pains to recreate.Although, as Hall explained, “It was never simply about recreating specific shows; we were also interested in&nbsp;eras&nbsp;and the stylistic and technical approach that defined specific periods in the history of television sitcoms,” which&nbsp;led to many more visual departures in subsequent episodes. It also created a mission for Hall to find the line between completely recreating the visual look of a 1950s sitcom and that of the contemporary story the series is actually telling.(Photo by Marvel Studios)One vintage look the show avoided, for example, was that of the kinescope. Prior to the adoption of 2″ videotape in 1957, many live programs were recorded by simply pointing a film camera at a TV monitor. The resulting image garbled the intended contrasts and warped the overall image, but created a “good enough” copy for these programs to be shipped off to affiliate broadcasters outside of, say, the New York area. For WandaVision, it would’ve been distracting. But even in terms of series originally shot on film, like Bewtiched, Hall noted it is still rare to actually see the original quality of the recording.“One of the things in going back to the original [broadcast of shows] was you’re obviously not looking at an ‘original original,’ because you’re looking at something that was shot on film and then transferred to video,” he said. “What I was able to do on the early footage [of WandaVision] was get some prints of some of the early sitcoms on film. I got some from the original negative and I then projected those and I looked at those.”The research led to the first episode’s recreation of The Dick Van Dyke Show’s lighting scheme and camera angles. Although, thanks to the rare negatives he looked at, the WandaVision footage is sharper than most people’s memories of that vintage program.(Photo by Marvel Studios)Creating that clearer-than-you-remember image became the working philosophy for the subsequent recreations of shows like Bewitched, The Brady Bunch, and even Family Ties – itself now a vintage program to the horror of many viewers.“In my mind, the reference was actually much closer to the original, not necessarily what had been seen by viewers on the televisions of the period,” he said. “I think once you go to that level, you’re potentially degrading the image so much that you’re losing some of the original characteristics. So our objective was not quite that.”He added the aim of the photography was to “look at the [vintage] material and then create something that somehow has a modernity to it.”That modernity matters as, ultimately, The Brady Bunch and Malcolm in the Middle prove to be what Wanda was watching at pivotal moments in her life. Presumably, Bewitched and Family Ties held similar positions her memories for traumas yet to be explored.Series director Matt Shankman “identified shows that were iconic both in terms of&nbsp;era&nbsp;and integral to Wanda’s history via an emotional connection established in her childhood,”&nbsp;Hall explained. Thus, recreating the camera movements of Family Ties became important on both the technical and thematic levels. And, as it happens, those details would create a strong connection for the audience young enough to remember when that show aired on NBC or when some of the older programs ran in syndication — to say nothing of the people who may remember when Dick Van Dyke first aired!(Photo by Marvel Studios)To younger viewers, though, notions of fuzzy images caused by poor antenna reception, overworked videotape sources, and even the lower resolution of television in the 20th century would require explanations all their own and had the potential to get in the way of the story. In situations like those, Hall, Shankman, and the rest of the crew would look critically at what they could do with the image and judge whether it was too much.“This is maybe [correct for] the era, but does it really serve the dramatic purposes of our narrative?” was the question Hall would ask. “That’s what really leads the choices,” he said. This is why the boxier aspect ratio of the first three episodes gives way to the wider 16:9 frame of HDTVs in episode five.The cinematography adds a dimension to Wanda’s story — something Hall called “the difference between an original and the memory of an original.”“The reality that Wanda’s creating is quite fragile. So I think absolute replication was definitely not the goal. It was more about kind of whirring the audience into this kind of comfortable sitcom reality that was vaguely nostalgic,” he said.Creating that comfort also meant the visuals could be disrupted to “bring in some of the more sinister aspects of the narrative.” A great example of this in episode&nbsp;one when Mr. Heart (Fred Melamed) starts choking; the Dick Van Dyke–inspired staging and lighting gives way to more modern photography for the series’ first chilling moment.(Photo by Marvel Studios)But even with the elements he wanted to recreate – the filmic look of 60-year-old sitcoms shot on 35mm film, for example – technical limitations still appeared by virtue of the changes in filmmaking technology. Hall called it an “inherent challenge” as the 4K resolution High Dynamic Range digital cameras used to capture WandaVision result in a substantially different image than a film camera from the 1960s.“You’re taking that highest level of quality and then trying to degrade it. There’s a kind of contradiction there,” he said. “But it’s a really interesting way to approach it. If someone asked me to do [a show like WandaVision] five years ago, I might’ve said, ‘Oh we should shoot that on 35 mil,’ or ‘Let’s shoot that shoot on 16 mil, let’s get an old video camera to do that.’ With this show, I really decided to do the whole show on one camera and to really try and use the technology to actually create the different looks.”In fact, a whole field of filmmaking is devoted to making the qualities of specific vintage film stocks available to cinematographers like Hall. The results can be striking, as seen in the first three episodes of WandaVision.“There was a lot of in-depth color science work that I did with Technicolor to place a huge-bandwidth, raw high-quality camera signal in ‘an envelope,’ which restricted the signal down to a 1950s black-and-white look, or an early color film look, or an early video look.”There are plenty of algorithms and lots of computer tech behind that color science, but Hall said he really relished “exploring the digital platform to its full capabilities. That was really one of the exciting things about this project and sort of appropriate to Marvel, who I feel are always kind of at the cutting edge technologically.”And by shooting the entire series in 4K HDR, Hall delved into the higher end of what can be captured on the format.“The potential to have richer colors is actually technically a possibility now,” he said. “That really opened up a whole world for me in terms of what I looked at on the comic book reference, which had this incredibly vivid color.”(Photo by Marvel Studios)The results lead to the dynamic contrast in scenes set outside Wanda’s Hex, the colors on display when Monica steps through the barrier in episode seven, and the beauty of the images within Wanda’s recreation of classic sitcoms.Of course, recreating sitcoms led to one more challenge for Hall: the three-camera set-up itself. Unlike movies, which typically light and shoot one angle of a scene at a time, sitcoms typically light an entire stage with three cameras following the actors as they play out a scene. In many productions, the job of editing the shots was done on the fly as a videotape recorded the resulting program. Other shows would take the material caught be the three cameras to the editing room and build the episode there. For WandaVision’s debut episode, the production mounted a full live-to-tape recording in front of a studio audience. episode five — the Family Ties-inspired episode — was also shot in the three camera set-up, but lacked a studio audience,&nbsp;a difference sure to please fans of television production.Nevertheless, lighting for three simultaneously running cameras taught Hall — a veteran of single-camera productions — a new set of skills.“You’ve got to light for the 180 [degrees of the stage]. You’re shooting a wide shot and two medium shots at the same time or you’re shooting a two shot and two close ups at the same time,” he said. That means finding a lighting scheme which serves several cameras at once while still conveying the intent of each shot. He credited Shankman, a veteran sitcom actor from shows like Just The Ten of Us, with putting him through a “sitcom bootcamp” to hone the multicamera discipline. As a result, they wound up shooting scenes outside the Hex with multiple cameras.“There were action sequences that required coverage. And if you’ve got a stunt, you might as well put a third camera on it because it might not be replicated again,” he said. Nevertheless, he admitted there were times he was happy to be out of the studio and on location with the S.W.O.R.D. crew or in Westview’s beautifully manicured exteriors. “I think the location work definitely provided some light relief from the set work, which became quite intense,” he said. “But this show had so much diversity in it, you never had a chance of getting bored because every day was different.”(Photo by Marvel Studios)Near the end of episode eight, Hall had the opportunity to turn the camera at his own lights just as Wanda came to understand why she started recreating old TV shows in the first place. As he put it, “it’s a self-reflexive moment that exposes the constructed reality of a show which thematically features a constructed reality at its core.” And though we may not yet know the full extent of what Wanda, as the Scarlet Witch, can construct, the moment stands as one of the most fascinating in terms of what it took to tell her story.“We are revealing the mechanisms of the medium itself and illustrating to the spectator that their perception of reality is manufactured, subject to change and transformation,” Hall said.With one episode or revelations yet to be transmitted, we can’t wait to see how Hall and his team photograph WandaVision‘s conclusion.The&nbsp;WandaVision&nbsp;season 1 finale premieres on Friday, March 5 on&nbsp;Disney+.On an Apple device?

Now Disney has finally made a sequel with the same team involved, and it’s sure to be one of the biggest movies of the year (maybe of all time?).But is Frozen II&nbsp;worth the wait, or is it just a pointless cash grab? The first reviews of the follow-up aren’t as enthusiastic as they were for its predecessor, but most critics agree it’s a worthy new adventure that should dazzle fans with its stunning animation, laugh-out-loud humor, and fun soundtrack.Here’s what critics are saying about Frozen II:How does the sequel compare to the original?“The sequel is not only better than the 2013 original, but it also improves the original film by adding to its mythology and shining a light on the events of that story in a whole new way.” – Germain Lussier, io9“Frozen II&nbsp;is nominally a slight improvement on its predecessor.” – Josh Spiegel, Slashfilm“Frozen II&nbsp;is as magical as its predecessor.” – Danielle Solzman, Solzy at the Movies“It’s a sequel that stands toe-to-toe with the original, which isn’t exactly an easy feat to accomplish.” – Matt Rodriguez, Shakefire“If it doesn’t&nbsp;quite match the original, it comes very, very close.” – Ian Sandwell, Digital Spy“The film itself is a satisfying but very familiar retread of the first movie.” – Matt Singer, ScreenCrushAnd how does it compare to other Disney sequels?“It carries the same lackluster energy of one of Disney’s direct-to-video sequels from times past: 1998’s Lion King 2: Simba’s Pride, or 1994’s The Return of Jafar.” – David Jenkins, Little White Lies“Frozen 2&nbsp;gives off the same lackluster dimness that hand-drawn direct-to-video sequels like&nbsp;Return of Jafar&nbsp;and&nbsp;Beauty and the Beast: The Enchanted Christmas&nbsp;did back in their humbler day.” – Richard Lawson, Vanity Fair(Photo by Walt Disney Studios)Will fans enjoy it?“The characters and music plus the gorgeous visuals are enough to make&nbsp;Frozen II&nbsp;a fun film even if it has none of the staying power of its predecessor.” – Matt Goldberg, Collider“Frozen II is anything but a mindless remake. Ironically, Frozen fans may secretly be wishing for a more straightforward rehash.” –&nbsp; Peter Debruge, VarietyIs the new story worth the wait?“Frozen 2 is crammed with material, most of which works.” – Kate Erbland, IndieWire“The mythology is somehow both overly complicated and oddly perfunctory. Really, the plot is mainly an excuse for the characters to hang out. And why not?” – Justin Chang, Los Angeles Times“The&nbsp;Frozen&nbsp;team is forced to go bigger, grander, more existential, while still keeping things accessible to children. That’s a really tough balancing act, one&nbsp;Frozen 2&nbsp;can’t manage.” – Richard Lawson, Vanity Fair“A lot goes on but nothing really happens…the only surprising thing about this film is how complex and contrived it is.” – David Jenkins, Little White Lies“Here’s the one problem with&nbsp;Frozen II: the structure of the story…most of it comes in dense, exposition-heavy chunks that are staggered across the film.” – Germain Lussier, io9“The narrative is a disastrous mess, to a thoroughly disappointing degree, where character and story aren’t appropriately motivated.” – Courtney Howard, Fresh FictionWhat about its message?“Frozen II&nbsp;certainly delivers a solid morality tale without being overly moralizing.” – Linda Marric, HeyUGuys“Female empowerment and finding strength through sisterhood assuredly remain sturdy tethers. There’s also a hearty ecological message instilled about working with nature, not against it.” – Courtney Howard, Fresh Fiction“All children should see Frozen 2, not just little girls. Because when Kristoff says, ‘I’m here. What do you need?’ that’s worthy of a discussion with everyone.” – Tania Lamb, Lola Lambchops(Photo by Walt Disney Pictures)Is it funny?“Several times I started crying because I was laughing so hard, and once, I had a hard time catching my breath. This movie was funnier than I ever imagined it would be.” – Tessa Smith, Mama’s Geeky“The sequel is funnier, with Olaf stealing the show… even the most die-hard Olaf critics will find him hilarious in this.” – Ian Sandwell, Digital Spy“The biggest problem is that Olaf’s lines are all so funny the audience was laughing too hard for me to hear half of them.” – Germain Lussier, io9“What surprised me most about the film was just how hilarious they make Olaf. He was great in Frozen, but he absolutely steals the entire film this time around.” – Matt Rodriguez, Shakefire“Olaf totally steals the show this time as he grows up to ask the serious questions that every child is thinking.” – Tessa Smith, Mama’s Geeky“This time around, [Olaf is] a scene-stealing, joke-dispensing machine from start to finish, and with a pretty good hit-to-miss ratio.” – Justin Chang, Los Angeles Times“Every time he opens his mouth I felt like doing cartwheels.” – Charlotte O’Sullivan, London Evening StandardHow are the new characters?“The newbies have their moments and all together make for a grander experience.” – Germain Lussier, io9“There’s also a&nbsp;handful of new friends to meet, all of which are welcome, many of which are underserved (Sterling K. Brown is the lone newbie who really gets to leave a mark).” – Kate Erbland, IndieWire“New sidekicks like playful wind spirit Gale and Bruni the Salamander are fun and cute but don’t add much to the proceedings.” – Courtney Howard, Fresh Fiction“There are very few new characters of any consequence.” – Matt Singer, ScreenCrush(Photo by Walt Disney Pictures)And the visuals?“The real power of this movie comes through its gorgeous, often jaw-dropping animation… whatever else can be said,&nbsp;Frozen II&nbsp;is truly beautiful.” – Josh Spiegel, Slashfilm“Aesthetically speaking, this a dazzling beauty. The animators have created powerful imagery… highly detailed work [that] always shines through the fray.” – Courtney Howard, Fresh Fiction“Frozen 2’s weirdest, and maybe worst, sin is how routinely unpleasant it is to look at. The animation is oddly bland and inert.” – Richard Lawson, Vanity Fair“What Disney hasn’t quite solved is its digitally rendered character designs, subtly altered from the earlier movie but still more akin to computer-generated Bratz dolls.” – Peter Debruge, VarietyMore importantly, how’s the music?“The soundtrack is just as fun as the first&nbsp;Frozen.” – Danielle Solzman, Solzy at the Movies“When I tell you that this soundtrack is better than the first one, I know it will be hard for you to believe me. But it is true.” – Tessa Smith, Mama’s Geeky“There really is a song for every mood, and I can see myself listening to the soundtrack on repeat.” – Matt Rodriguez, Shakefire“The song-writing team’s contribution to the franchise’s success can scarcely be over-estimated.” – Todd McCarthy, Hollywood Reporter“There’s nothing wrong with these songs, per se, but the effort to replicate their previous success weighs down any possibility of letting them shine on their own.” – Alonso Duralde, The Wrap“They all sound fine, and are sung with the usual bombast… and yet, not a half-hour after seeing the movie, I couldn’t call up a single melody.” – Richard Lawson, Vanity Fair“The creative team have brought in the D-list for songwriting detail… with every song coming across like over-produced, over-polished album track filler with no hooks and no heart.” – David Jenkins, Little White Lies(Photo by Walt Disney Pictures)Does it deliver the next “Let It Go?”“The ‘Let It Go’ of Frozen II is called ‘Into the Unknown’… it’s guaranteed to entrance exhibitionist preschoolers looking for a new song to belt out at the top of their lungs.” – Matt Singer, ScreenCrush“There isn’t one A-plus standout like ‘Let It Go’ from the first film,&nbsp;but this time around, all the songs feel more uniform quality-wise. There isn’t a dud in the bunch.” – Germain Lussier, io9“The songs don’t have that same punch this time around… there’s nothing in here that I think will take the world by storm like ‘Let It Go.’” – Matt Goldberg, Collider“Although not a single song in this sequel is likely to have the same iconic reach of songs such as&nbsp;‘Let It Go’&nbsp;or&nbsp;‘Love Is An Open&nbsp;Door,’ there is still plenty here to shout about.” – Linda Marric, HeyUGuysIs it still a good time for families?“For the most part, the kids seemed to think&nbsp;Frozen 2&nbsp;was pretty great — pretty exciting, pretty funny, pretty transporting.” – Richard Lawson, Vanity Fair“Tip: the youngest Frozen fans might need some warm hugs to get through a fraught final act.” – Kate Erbland, IndieWire“Frozen II&nbsp;is arguably a darker, more mature film… it feels like it’s marketed to a slightly older fanbase than the first – perhaps the kids who grew up loving the initial entry.” – Hannah Lodge, The Beat“Frozen II is the must-see movie for families this year.” – Tania Lamb, Lola LambchopsFrozen II&nbsp;is in theaters November 22.&nbsp;#1Frozen II (2019) 78%#1Adjusted Score: 92.174% Critics Consensus: Frozen II can't quite recapture the showstopping feel of its predecessor, but it remains a dazzling adventure into the unknown.Synopsis: Why was Elsa born with magical powers?

Russell’s most irrepressibly vibrant direction.Where to Stream: TubiBeavis and Butt-head Do America (1996) 72%Critics Consensus: Beavis and Butt-Head Do America is unabashedly offensive, unapologetically stupid, and unexpectedly funny.Where to Stream: CrackleThe Big Lebowski (1998) 83%Critics Consensus: Typically stunning visuals and sharp dialogue from the Coen Brothers, brought to life with strong performances from Goodman and Bridges.Where to Stream: IMDBBirdman (2014) 91%Critics Consensus: A thrilling leap forward for director Alejandro González Iñárritu, Birdman is an ambitious technical showcase powered by a layered story and outstanding performances from Michael Keaton and Edward Norton.Where to Stream: IMDBBlack Swan (2010) 85%Critics Consensus: Bracingly intense, passionate, and wildly melodramatic, Black Swan glides on Darren Aronofsky’s bold direction — and a bravura performance from Natalie Portman.Where to Stream: IMDBBrick (2006) 80%Critics Consensus: This entertaining homage to noirs past has been slickly and compellingly updated to a contemporary high school setting.Where to Stream: TubiNational Lampoon's Christmas Vacation (1989) 68%Critics Consensus: While Christmas Vacation may not be the most disciplined comedy, it’s got enough laughs and good cheer to make for a solid seasonal treat.Where to Stream: TubiTim Burton's Corpse Bride (2005) 84%Critics Consensus: As can be expected from a Tim Burton movie, Corpse Bride is whimsically macabre, visually imaginative, and emotionally bittersweet.Where to Stream: TubiEddie Murphy Raw (1987) 81%Critics Consensus: Like its title suggests, Eddie Murphy Raw is a searingly unbridled and viciously funny showcase from one of comedy’s best.Where to Stream: CrackleEve's Bayou (1996) 82%Critics Consensus: Eve’s Bayou marks a striking feature debut for director Kasi Lemmons, layering terrific performances and Southern mysticism into a measured meditation on disillusionment and forgiveness.Where to Stream: TubiEyes Wide Shut (1999) 75%Critics Consensus: Kubrick’s intense study of the human psyche yields an impressive cinematic work.Where to Stream: TubiFried Green Tomatoes (1991) 74%Critics Consensus: Fried Green Tomatoes‘ tearjerking drama is undeniably manipulative, but in the hands of a skilled cast that includes Jessica Tandy and Kathy Bates, it’s also powerfully effective.Where to Stream: IMDBFull Metal Jacket (1987) 92%Critics Consensus: Intense, tightly constructed, and darkly comic at times, Stanley Kubrick’s Full Metal Jacket may not boast the most original of themes, but it is exceedingly effective at communicating them.Where to Stream: TubiHustle &amp;

That said, the show has inspired a cult following of super fans, which has helped keep it on the air for five seasons. With the next season yet to be announced, consider this our invitation to check out this unique sitcom in hopes that you will soon join us in chanting, “Six seasons and a movie!”UPDATE: Aaaand, less than 24 hours after this article went live, we’ve just learned that NBC has, in fact, cancelled Community. Tis a sad day for Human Beings the world over.In any case, here’s what you need to know before you start Community.&nbsp;CommunityWhat’s the premise? In order to make up for a degree he falsified on his resume, a disgraced attorney is forced to take classes at a community college, where he and an oddball study group frequently find themselves caught up in unpredictable adventures.What’s it like? It’s not easy to find another show that resembles Community, which regularly pokes fun at the traditional sitcom formula — when it’s not aggressively defying it, that is — even as it successfully utilizes that formula to propel its wacky plots and heartfelt moments. There are some narrative through-lines that provide a framework of story arcs, but the show’s strengths lie in the relationships between its unique characters, its crafty use of pop culture references, and its willingness to take some bold risks with its format. In broad strokes, you could compare Community to Undeclared with a 30 Rock-meets-Spaced sensibility to it.Where can I see it? All five seasons are available on Amazon Instant Video, Vudu and iTunes.How long will it take? Since NBC essentially halved seasons four and five, offering just 13 episodes for each, you’re looking at a total of about 97 episodes, all running pretty close to 22 minutes. Depending on how frequently you indulge and how many you watch at a time, you could employ a leisurely pace and get caught up in about three months, or blaze through all five seasons in a third of that time.What do the critics think? The first season secured an 88 percent on the Tomatometer, but the second and third seasons — considered by many fans to be the best of the show — didn’t earn enough reviews to get Tomatometer scores. The fourth and fifth seasons are both Certified Fresh, however, at 76 percent and 92 percent, respectively, even despite the fact that most agreed season four suffered from the absence of Harmon from the showrunner’s chair. Upon its premiere, the Boston Globe’s Matthew Gilbert wrote, “One of the pleasing things about Community has to do with what it is not. The show doesn’t fit into any of the more familiar half-hour comedy formats on network TV right now.” In his review of the most recent season, Entertainment Weekly’s Jeff Jensen perhaps summed it up best: “The series has always sought profundity by finding the universal in the particulars of genre pastiche.”Why should I watch this? While Community initially introduces us to Greendale Community College through the lens of Jeff Winger’s (Joel McHale) story, the series begins to experiment wildly as it finds its footing, and for most novices, this will probably be the most effective selling point. After all, it’s difficult not to be intrigued by an episode centered around a campuswide paintball tournament tailor-made to riff on action movie clichés, or one about a blanket fort dispute that pays direct homage to Ken Burns’ The Civil War, or an animated episode featuring the cast reimagined as characters on G.I. Joe, complete with parodies of the action figure commercials that were ubiquitous during the 1980s. Thanks to creator/showrunner Dan Harmon’s singular vision, the series is chock-full of fun pop culture references and meta-commentary, and its cast of impressive guest stars includes everyone from Patton Oswalt, LeVar Burton, and Keith David to Vince Gilligan, Brie Larson, and Jack Black. But the heart of Community is and always has been, well, its heart, which its talented ensemble cast does a marvelous job of balancing right alongside the rapid-fire dialogue and screwball antics. So yes, you might get a Christmas episode phenomenally crafted entirely in Claymation, but it’s in service of a story addressing Abed’s (Danny Pudi) mental well-being. Does the show get a little sappy from time to time? It can, sure, but it never feels disingenuous, and the show is also fully self-aware about that, evolving the notion into something of an in-joke. In short, this is a sweet, funny, and clever sitcom about a bunch of lovable misfits who become unlikely friends, and it’s the only show on TV where you’ll find references to both Pulp Fiction and My Dinner with Andre in the same half hour.What’s my next step? The aforementioned Undeclared, 30 Rock, and Spaced are great places to start, as each of them represents a specific element found in Community (the college atmosphere, the self-referencing wackiness, the pop culture savvy), and all feature outstanding ensemble casts. Other notable sitcoms with clever writing, eccentric characters, and cult followings include Scrubs, Arrested Development, and Parks and Recreation. In addition, Dan Harmon served as co-creator of the Cartoon Network series Rick and Morty, which just finished its first season, and as long as we’re talking about animated shows, it behooves us to mention The Simpsons, Home Movies, and The Venture Bros. which all rely on a degree of pop culture familiarity. If you’re more of a movie person, you can pick up a rental of Back to School.What do you like about Community? How would you explain it to a newbie?

First thing on everybody’s mind: The Dark Knight‘s “snub.” Fans were hopeful it’d get the Best Picture nomination (especially with its strong support in other awards ceremonies), though it did get seven technical awards and the requisite Heath Ledger Supporting Actor nom.The nearly Rotten The Reader makes a surprisingly strong showing, with a Best Picture and Best Director nod, and a switcheroo for Kate Winslet to Best Actress from Best Supporting Actress, leaving that category open for this year’s favorite, Penelope Cruz.Further surprises include the absence of Sally Hawkins for Happy-Go-Lucky (who took home the Golden Globe weeks prior) and Bruce Springsteen for Best Original Song in The Wrestler. (In addition, there were plenty of hold-outs hoping for a Wrestler Best Picture and Best Director.) But no doubt Robert Downey Jr’s Supporting Actor nom is a bright spot for eager comedy fans.The best-reviewed movie of the year, WALL-E, was always a very long shot for Best Picture, and will settle for a virtual lock in the Best Animated Picture category. With its presence in other categories, WALL-E currently holds the highest number of nominations ever for a CGI film. In addition, the Best Screenplay nod for Andrew Stanton continues Pixar’s quiet and impressive streak in that category.Best Motion Picture of the YearThe Reader60%SlumdogMillionaire94%The Curious Case

Or have you still not had a go at breakout freshmen series like Underground and Love? Not to worry: there is still time to catch up before these series — and four Fresh others! — return to your small screens and laptops later this month. Catch our rundown of what to binge before April showers bring us into spring.The Americans  96%What it is: Now entering&nbsp;its fifth season, this slow-burning espionage series stars real-life couple&nbsp;Kerri Russell and Matthew Rhys as married KGB spies infiltrating the nation’s capital at the height of the Cold War.Why you should watch it: We know, we know: you’re hearing enough about Russia in the day’s headlines, so why should you want to watch a show about KGB spies infiltrating the States? Trust us; The Americans isn’t just any show. In Russell and Rhys, the FX critical darling boasts two of television’s finest performers matched with airtight scripts and sublime direction and cinematography well deserving of its outstanding drama series Emmy nomination last year. Tune in and find out why The Americans has slowly but surely gained a dedicated, impassioned following and become subject of the thinking-man’s water cooler talk each Wednesday morning. Season 5 premieres March 7.Where to watch: Amazon Prime, FandangoNow, Google Play, iTunes, Microsoft, PlayStation Video, Vudu&nbsp;Commitment: About 40 hoursUnderground  96%What it is: Creators Misha Green and Joe Pokaski’s Underground follows a group of slaves led by Jurnee Smollett-Bell’s Rosalee as they flee Georgia and make their way along the historic and storied Underground Railroad.Why you should watch it: A traditional slave narrative, this is not. In a thrilling reflection of its heroes’ dire circumstances, Underground plays out at a breakneck pace, more like a cat-and-mouse thriller than a somber prestige project of America’s darkest hour. The gamble works, making audiences practically taste the sweat on Smollett-Bell’s brow while enduring the elements of the hot Georgian son. Season 2 premieres on March 8.Where to watch: Amazon, FandangoNOW,&nbsp;Google Play, iTunes, Microsoft,&nbsp;PlayStation Video, VuduCommitment: About 7.5 hoursThe Catch  74%What it is: The Catch, ABC’s latest Shondaland production, comes from creators Jennifer Schuur, Kate Atkinson, and Helen Gregory and stars Mireille Enos (The Killing) and Peter Krause (Parenthood, Six Feet Under). Enos is Alice Vaughan, an L.A.-based private investigator who learns her fiancé, Benjamin Jones (Krause), is a world-class conman.Why you should watch it:&nbsp;You know what you’re getting with most Shondaland projects, and if you’re a fan of what’s come before, you’ll be a fan of The Catch. Chock full of sexy, twisty fun, the series is escapist entertainment with a leading pair of memorable characters and a particularly excellent performance from Enos — but no surprise there. Season 2 premieres on March 9.Where to watch: Amazon, FandangoNOW,&nbsp;Google Play, iTunes, Microsoft, PlayStation Video, VuduCommitment:&nbsp;About 7.5 hoursLove  94%What it is: From creators Judd Apatow,&nbsp;Lesley Arfin,&nbsp;and Paul Rust (who also stars as the affable Gus), Love is the unlikely friendship-turned-L.A. love story of Rust’s hero and the troubled girl next door, Mickey (Community’s Gillian Jacobs).Why you should watch it:&nbsp;While the elevator pitch — “opposites attract and fall in love in the City of Angels” — is more likely to cause eye rolls than guarantee contracts, Love navigates its characters’ winding hearts with nuanced precision — and circumvents cliché along the way. While production assistant and aspiring screenwriter Gus is perfectly likable, it’s Jacobs as Mickey that steals the show. Playing a recovering sex addict and alcoholic, she nails the nuances of destruction and dependency in all its forms to both heartbreaking and hilarious effect. Season 2 premieres on March 10.Where to watch:&nbsp;NetflixCommitment:&nbsp;About 8.5 hoursAmerican Crime  96%What it is: From Academy Award winner John Ridley (12 Years a Slave), American Crime on ABC is an anthological series tackling timely sociopolitical matters head-on through compelling characters and dramas.Why you should watch it: No, you don’t have to watch the first two seasons of the Emmy-winning American Crime to know what’s going on in Season 3, but you’ll be glad you did. Top-tier, thought provoking writing and career-best performances from Regina King, Felicity Huffman, Timothy Hutton, Lilly Taylor, and countless others elevate the acclaimed series from primetime soapbox to must-watch TV. Season 3 premieres on Sunday, March 12.Where to watch: Amazon,&nbsp;FandangoNow,&nbsp;Google Play,&nbsp;iTunes, Microsoft, Netflix,&nbsp;PlayStation Video,&nbsp;VuduCommitment:&nbsp;About 16 hoursGreenleaf What it is: An original scripted drama from Oprah Winfrey’s OWN network, Greenleaf stars Merle Dandridge as Grace, a pastor who returns to her estranged family — megachurch bishop James Greenleaf (Keith David) and Lady Mae Greenleaf (Lynn Whitfield) — after a 20-year absence. The occasion? The mysterious death of her sister, Faith.Why you should watch it: Greenleaf packs an emotional punch, thanks largely due to its trio of lead performances and a hearty supporting turn from Ms. Winfrey herself. The drama in this Tennessee family runs thicker than their shared blood, and it makes for savory, soapy television you can’t keep your eyes off of. Season 2 premieres on March 15.Where to watch: Amazon, FandangoNOW,&nbsp;Google Play, iTunes, Microsoft, PlayStation Video, VuduCommitment:&nbsp;About 10 hoursGrace and Frankie  88%What it is:&nbsp;In a spin on the classic odd couple set-up, Netflix’s Grace and Frankie stars Jane Fonda and Lily Tomlin as the titular pair, who are forced to put their differences aside and become housemates after their husbands (played by Martin Sheen and Sam Waterston) come out as gay and leave them for one another.Why you should watch it: Who says they don’t make good roles for actresses over a certain age? In Grace and Frankie, screen icons (and former&nbsp;9 to 5 costars) Fonda and Tomlin have their best roles in years. It may&nbsp;seem at first like a case of stunt casting for nostalgia’s sake, but as the series goes on, these characters grow and develop in unexpected, complicated, and heartwarming ways. It’s utterly watchable. Season 3 premieres on March 24.Where to watch: Amazon, FandangoNow, Google Play (Season 2 only), Microsoft, Netflix,&nbsp;PlayStation Video, VuduCommitment:&nbsp;About 13 hours","section":"Binge Guide","tags":"Carpet, show, archives, anime, documentaries, CW, Awards, series, Comics, bond, One, critic","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/28164416/Americans-March-2017-Binge.jpg","slug":"7-tv-shows-you-should-binge-watch-this-march"},{"id":"47508664490641","title":"Your Weekly Binge: Superhero Satire, Detectives Old and New, and A Sitcom Worth Saving","content":"Binge Guidevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Your Weekly Binge: Superhero Satire, Detectives Old and New, and A Sitcom Worth SavingWhat's the RT staff watching while stuck at home? We're giving you a new weekly guide to inspire your next big binge.by RT Staff | March 17, 2020 |  CommentsLike much of America, the Rotten Tomatoes staff is working remote right now, doing the responsible thing and “social distancing.” And like much of America, and the world, we’re spending a lot of our time – when we’re not working, of course – catching up on the shows and movies waiting for us on our watchlists, and digging around the various streaming services to find previously undiscovered gems. Every week for the next little while,&nbsp;we will be highlighting what our staff members are watching while at home in the hope that we’ll inspire you to discover something new and Fresh, and that you can watch along with us.&nbsp;The Boys: Season 1 (2019)  84% (Amazon Prime Video)Before the series returns for season 2 this summer, catch up on the Certified Fresh first season of the alt-superhero series, in which the villains are (mostly) the characters with powers. A thoroughly satisfying binge, The Boys season 1 requires fewer hours than most workdays – and is a helluva lot more fun. The series stars Jack Quaid as unassuming nice-guy Hughie Campbell, who crash-lands into a world of vigilante vengeance after a superhero inadvertently kills his girlfriend. Karl Urban is unhinged head superhero-hunter Billy Butcher, and Antony Starr is large-and-in-charge super-powered a–hole Homelander. Erin Moriarty, as powered up-and-comer Starlight, brings the humanity, while Elisabeth Shue’s Madelyn Stillwell is corporate greed incarnate. – Debbie Day, Senior TV EditorWhere to watch: AmazonCommitment:&nbsp;8 hoursRick and Morty  94% (Cartoon Network)It’s hard not to fall in love with this hilarious, absurd, and sometimes viscerally disgusting animated sci-fi show that’s actually a painfully accurate depiction of family drama and dysfunction. The plot is simple: A boy and his narcissistic, alcoholic, scientific genius grandfather go on an adventure every episode. But meta references, deep cuts, and heartache come at you fast and each season warrants multiple viewings, so you may just find yourself binge-watching the four-season series more than once. Wubba lubba dub dub, indeed. – Sara Ataiiyan, Review CuratorWhere to Watch: Adult Swim, Hulu, Amazon, Google Play, Vudu, iTunesCommitment: Approx.&nbsp;15 hoursThe OA  84% (Netflix)Seeing is definitely believing with The OA, a slightly bonkers, but mostly totally brilliant metaphysical mystery. It’s not a show you can fold laundry to; from epic dimension-hopping dance moves to deeply felt character moments, The OA lives and breathes in its constantly spiraling lore. And boy, does it spiral. Creator/star Brit Marling is captivating as Prairie, a missing young blind woman who is found with her vision&nbsp;restored – and whose discovery shakes a small suburban town. The cast around her is equally capable: Jason Isaacs, Phyllis Smith, Sharon Van Etten, Emory Cohen, and Paz Vega are great, and joined by the glorious Zendaya in the show’s second season.&nbsp;The series is probably not for everyone, but those willing to learn its movements will find rich rewards in each passing chapter of Prairie and company’s entangled tales. Though it was unfortunately cancelled after its second season, The OA&nbsp;is worth watching if you’re looking for a show that will truly challenge your expectations, both of the medium and reality. Or if you’ve just finished Watchmen and are looking for a new show that features strange cephalopods. – Haña Lucero-Colin, TV Curation ManagerWhere to watch:&nbsp;NetflixCommitment: Approx.&nbsp;16 hoursMarcella  70% (Netflix)(Photo by © Netflix)Anna Friel&nbsp;is brilliant in the&nbsp;lead role of DS Marcella (pronounced Mar-chella) Backland, a London detective who&nbsp;returns to the force after a decade-long leave just as a serial killer returns. With her dissolving marriage and unexplained blackouts, she may be more of a mystery than the case she’s trying to solve. Marcella&nbsp;is a dark British crime drama that has a suspenseful first season, followed by a slightly slower second season, and is well worth the 16-episode, two season-investment (even with a cliff-hanger ending). And, with a rumored third season in the works, it’s a great time to play catch-up&nbsp;– Jennifer Jevons, Senior Social Media StrategistWhere to watch:&nbsp;NetflixCommitment: Approx.&nbsp;16 hoursColumbo &nbsp;(Amazon Prime Video)(Photo by Courtesy the Everett Collection)Columbo is the&nbsp;comfiest, coziest show about murder ever made. Every episode, a guest celebrity (ranging from Leonard Nimoy to William Shatner to Ruth Gordon) offs another member of high-society out of passion or premeditated personal gain. Enter L.A. Police Lieutenant Columbo, played to bumbling perfection by Peter Falk, whose insistently circuitous speech and drab appearance lulls crooks into a haughty sense of false superiority.&nbsp;The show&nbsp;reverse-engineers the whodunnit structure by revealing the murderer and the motive in the opening of each episode, with most of the episode framed from their point of view. The joy is in watching how they’ll get caught. The other joy is, of course, Falk himself. The brilliant conceit of his character is that he is always in “character” – how much of Columbo’s lack of social graces and apparent incompetence is real, and how much of it is a front to lure suspects out? You never see any of Columbo’s personal life (though he frequently mentions a never-seen wife); he exists only within the context of the crime. I see shades of this type of character drama in Breaking Bad’s Saul Goodman (imagine if we never got to meet Jimmy McGill) or The Dark Knight’s Joker (we never see him at home base or making plans, only executing them).&nbsp;Five must-watch episodes are “Murder by the Book” (directed by a 24-year-old Steven Spielberg), “Suitable for Framing,” “A Stitch in Crime,” “Any Old Port in a Storm,” and “Try and Catch Me.” – Alex Vo, EditorWhere to Watch: Amazon Prime VideoCommitment:&nbsp;100 hoursOne Day at a Time  99% (Netflix)There’s no better time to binge One Day at&nbsp;a Time, the modern remake of Norman Lear’s classic sitcom that centers around a Cuban-American family in gentrifying eastern Los Angeles. The series ran for three seasons on Netflix before the streamer gave it the ax and, after fan outcry, was saved by Pop TV. Before season 4 premieres on that channel on March 24, give the first three seasons a binge: the show is heartfelt, hilarious, and shows the old multi-camera sitcom format can work if you have the right people behind of and in front of those lenses. Speaking of: Rita Moreno is a flamboyant standout as scene-stealing abuela Lydia, while Justina Machado gives a star turn as matriarch and military veteran Penelope. Bonus: The show is feel-good (we need that) and kid-friendly. – Joel Meares, Editor-in-ChiefWhere to watch:&nbsp;NetflixCommitment: Approx.&nbsp;19 hoursCastlevania  94% (Netflix)This video-game adaptation follows warrior, a wizard, and a half-human half-vampire prince as they battle Dracula and his minions.&nbsp;And we know what you’re thinking: most video-game adaptations are not great – we love them, but Assassins Creed isn’t winning Oscars anytime soon.&nbsp;That said, recent movies like Detective Pikachu and Sonic the Hedgehog have shown us glimmers of hope in the genre, and on the TV side, Castlevania is by far the best of what we have to offer. A faithful adaptation of the beloved Konami game series, the Netflix series expands the world of the labyrinthian game from the ’80s into a compelling adventure with incredible voice performances and thrilling fight scenes. With the last two season rated 100% Fresh, critics agree its worth a watch and now would be the perfect time to start the series as season three was just released. Perhaps you could dust off your old Nintendo or download the original game afterwards if you are feeling suddenly nostalgic. –&nbsp;Jacqueline Coley, EditorWhere to watch:&nbsp;NetflixCommitment:&nbsp;9.5 hoursCheck out our regular March Binge Guide.

The best ones manage to recapture the sense of discovery we felt with the original films while offering fresh new experiences;&nbsp;most remakes fail to accomplish one of those two goals, and the very worst ones miss the mark on both. Before&nbsp;it became trendy to refashion every beloved film as a tentpole blockbuster, Peter Jackson&nbsp;followed on the huge success of his Lord of the Rings trilogy with his own take on a childhood favorite, King Kong.Jackson’s version is a gargantuan journey to a lost world using cutting-edge visual and special effects, with a story that imparts more weight to classic characters. This tale of hubris is not only a fantastic movie in its own right, but it also set a standard for blockbuster remakes that play with audiences’ familiarity with the source material and provide new perspectives on classic tales. To celebrate its 15th anniversary, we head to Skull Island explore how Peter Jackson successfully reintroduced a cinematic legend to a new generation by putting his own stamp on it.It Feels Like a Throwback(Photo by Universal Pictures)After the 1976 King Kong brought its central character to a contemporary setting, Jackson took the story back to its roots as a period piece set in the 1930s. While director Merian Cooper’s&nbsp;original 1933 film mostly&nbsp;avoided portraying the Great Depression because audiences didn’t need a reminder of what was happening around them, Jackson dove into how that environment helped birth the Kong myth. The opening scene of his film introduces the grandeur of New York’s wealth and the birth of its skyline, while giving equal gravitas to the city’s squalor; people are being served eviction notices, and soup lines extend as far as the eye can see. Not only are people desperate for money — like protagonist Ann Darrow (Naomi Watts), who accepts a job to shoot a film overseas with only the promise of maybe getting paid — but they are desperate to have some magic come back to the world.Jackson grants added importance to the setting, not just in the cultural background, but also in the filmmaking landscape of the time. There are plenty of references to the original film, including a mention of original actress Fay Wray, and&nbsp;Jack Black’s character Carl Denham is also clearly meant to represent a more frustrated and unsuccessful version of Orson Welles. Jackson also takes a more old-fashioned approach to the pacing of his film, playing with audiences’ expectations and making them wait nearly an hour before finally, slowly and patiently, revealing the titular Kong.Skull Island Feels Like a Distinct WorldEven if Peter Jackson honored the original and stuck to some old-school techniques, there’s no doubt King Kong takes full advantage of every advancement in filmmaking, especially visual effects. The moment the film arrives at Skull Island, Jackson shifts gears and fully brings King Kong into horror movie territory. Sure, some of the computer-generated dinosaurs haven’t aged particularly well, but the scene when the ship’s crew falls into an insect pit — a concept Merian Cooper abandoned because it scared test audiences back in the ’30s — is utterly terrifying, especially when Lumpy (played by a human Andy Serkis, who also provided the motion capture performance for Kong himself)&nbsp;is devoured by an army of leeches.The wildlife of the island not only looks great and is utilized effectively to convey a sense of wonder and horror, but the actual location looks like nothing audiences had seen to that point (except maybe in the Lord of the Rings trilogy). Skull Island feels like a place that belongs in our world, but was lost to time. The giant walls that surround the island, the temple-like architecture, and the towering mountains that&nbsp;loom above miles-long pits filled with giant insects lend the location a real sense of geography, capturing the mystery and adventure Carl Denham is constantly boasting about.It Plays with Your ExpectationsHow do you capture the shock and awe of seeing Kong climb up the Empire State Building when everyone on Earth has either witnessed the moment themselves or seen countless parodies and homages to it for over 70 years after the original film was released? You do it by showing it from a different point of view. Just as he extends the wait before we finally meet Kong, Jackson reframes the film’s most famous set piece as a melancholy tragedy. Rather than watch the action from the perspective of the heroic airplane pilots who attempt to rescue Ann, we watch the incident unfold from Kong and Ann’s perspective, as Jackson slowly builds up the human threat to Kong before revealing the planes as if they were the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse.&nbsp;King Kong doesn’t invite the audience to be awed by the prowess of the pilots or the spectacle of a 25-foot gorilla. Instead, this scene&nbsp;continues&nbsp;long enough to make you feel the sense of dread and&nbsp;imminent doom&nbsp;descending upon the&nbsp;titular king. The death of Kong was sad even in the original film, but it was Peter Jackson’s King Kong that finally recognized the huge tragedy of the scene and its emotional weight, and it works because it knows you are already familiar with it.It’s Secretly About Filmmaking(Photo by (c)Universal courtesy Everett Collection)Though King Kong is full of imagery and references to Joseph Conrad’s Heart of Darkness and plays on the ideas of savagery and civilization, the film can easily be read as an exploration of the magic of filmmaking.Indeed, if the original film was all about mankind’s obsession with trying to tame and control nature, Jackson’s&nbsp;remake is about how a filmmaker shares that same false sense of control. Carl Denham spends the first act trying to sell the idea for his movie as a public service because he’s capturing the last piece of mystery left in the world. His journey to getting the film made is arduous and long — not unlike Jackson’s own journey with the film, which he had to partially finance after it became far longer and more expensive than anticipated. But Denham’s misplaced sense of duty results in the death of most of his crew, which he tries to downplay as a noble sacrifice he’ll honor by dedicating the finished production to them. This version of Denham is a far more complex antagonist than in previous versions of the film, one that mistakes his obsession with control with artistic integrity and a sense of duty towards an audience that needs escapism.It Features an Incredible Performance from Andy SerkisWhen Andy Serkis’ Gollum first showed up in The Lord of the Rings trilogy, it was a groundbreaking moment for motion-capture performance. If Gollum was Serkis’ opening statement, however, King Kong is his mic drop moment. This Kong is neither the savage brute of the original film nor the nearly no-show from the 1976 film, but a giant who looks to the horizon with big dreams in his mind and melancholy in his heart. Serkis’ Kong sold audiences on the idea that they could watch an animal behave and act with as many expressions and as much heart as its human co-stars.A big reason why Kong’s death at the end of the film hits so hard is because of Serkis’ characterization of him not as a monster, but as someone with a soul who connects to Ann on a deeper level than just as a plaything. Even if by the end of the film we’re supposed to connect to Ann and Adrien Brody’s Jack, the real romance is between Ann and Kong; the two quickly connect as marginalized creatures who bond over the emptiness in their lives.Serkis would, of course, go on to play Caesar, the chimpanzee leader of the newly evolved apes in the rebooted&nbsp;Planet of the Apes franchise, in another remarkable motion-capture performance that cemented Serkis as the king of the form.&nbsp;But he is one of the biggest reasons Peter Jackson’s&nbsp;King Kong works as well as it does, and after 15 years, his work&nbsp;here may still be the most compelling reason among many to revisit the film.King Kong&nbsp;was released in theaters on December 14, 2005.On an Apple device?

He’s produced four films that are being released this year (Forgetting Sarah Marshall, Pineapple Express, Step Brothers, and Drillbit Taylor, which opens this Friday), and he’s also one of the writers of You Don’t Mess with the Zohan. But he was kind enough to take time out of his busy schedule to talk to us about which movies have really influenced him as a filmmaker.&nbsp;The Last DetailThere are certain movies that I always go back to, but before I make a movie, I always find myself watching The Last Detail, the Hal Ashby movie. There’s something about it that’s so alive. It’s one of the first movies to really have frank language. I think it was somewhat shocking at the time. It was the first movie where everyone aggressively cursed, but it was about people in the armed services. It’s also a small story that’s very intimate and you just fall in love with all these characters that are in this terrible situation.I always watch it because Hal Ashby shot it in such a way that it just feels real. It’s almost like a documentary. I like how he paces the scenes, the coverage, and I always go back to it because it reminds me that the most important thing I can do as a filmmaker is convince the audience that what they’re watching is really happening. I don’t want them to be aware of me. So that’s one movie. It’s both heartbreaking and hilarious, which is always my favorite combination.Terms of EndearmentTerms of Endearment is always a touchstone movie for me. That’s one of the best acted comedy-dramas that has ever been made.I can never get enough of Terms of Endearment. I find myself watching it over and over again. It does everything that I want a movie to do. I fall in love with the characters. I care about their journeys. It never does anything easy to make me like the characters. It doesn’t sell out the characters for likeability. They all do things that are awful to each other. The relationships are very complicated. Yet, you root for all of them when you watch the movie.A large portion of the movie is also about cancer. It’s treated realistically and it is also hilarious in some of those moments. It’s not a maudlin movie. There are moments in that movie that I think about all the time that haunt me. The moment when Shirley MacLaine is yelling at the nurse to give her daughter more medicine… As you get older, you find yourself in those situations. It may be my favorite film of all time.Being ThereBeing There is one of my favorite movies. It’s much more precise than a movie like The Last Detail. It’s a type of movie I hope one day to be able to attempt to make. It’s brilliant on every level. It is one of movies that I watch and go, “I probably will never be able to get close to this, but I should try.”The use of television in the movie is spectacular – how what’s happening on the television in the rooms that they’re in reflects or comments on the action. Nobody has ever done that better and people have tried since and always failed. Any time I see something on a TV in a TV show, I know that they’re thinking about how great they did it in Being There. It’s another movie with some of the best performances in comedy history – Jack Warden, Melvyn Douglas, and Shirley MacLaine, so I go back to that a lot.Welcome to the DollhouseI’ve always been fascinated by the film Welcome to the Dollhouse, the Todd Solondz film. It’s a really dark comedy. It might be because I grew up in Long Island and it feels like where I grew up. A lot of the strangeness of it feels familiar to me. I love the look of it. I love the tone of it.When we started working on Freaks and Geeks, I thought a lot about Welcome to the Dollhouse, in terms of how it was lit, the production design, the strange cadences of its comedy, and these kids who feel like they’re in hell, their families and how their parents treat them. She (Heather Matarazzo) and that character (Dawn Wiener) is one of the greatest outcast nerd characters ever created in film or television. So it’s for someone who always loves a great underdog story. That’s one of my favorites and not a movie that makes it a triumphant fantasy for the nerdy girl either. That is never the Todd Solondz way.I thought about it when we did Freaks and Geeks because we often thought, “This movie is about how you handle failure. It’s not about succeeding. It’s not a show about wish fulfillment.” You see that in a lot of Todd Solondz work. I don’t think we had half the balls that he has.TootsieTootsie is a perfect movie. I watch that all the time. You know there used to be a commentary track on it. They put it out on laserdisc, and there was a commentary, [but] they keep doing “anniversary editions” and they don’t have the Sydney Pollack commentary track. As a comedy nerd, I’m up in arms.","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"The, breaking, doctor, Opinion, Critics, DC, American, elm","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2008/03/Judd-Apatow.jpg","slug":"five-favorite-films-with-judd-apatow"},{"id":"47509157180505","title":"Box Office Guru Preview: Keaton and Kids Hope to Score Touchdown","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Preview: Keaton and Kids Hope to Score Touchdownby Gitesh Pandya | February 1, 2007 |  CommentsAs the Chicago Bears and the Indianapolis Colts get ready to rumble at the Super Bowl on Sunday, Hollywood goes into counterprogramming mode and targets female moviegoers with a pair of new releases.Those looking for big names will get to laugh with the new comedy \"Because I Said So\" while those in the mood for a scare get the haunted house flick \"The Messengers.\" Overall, it should be a low scoring game at North American multiplexes this weekend.Diane Keaton leaves behind the men and anchors her own comedy in \"Because I Said So\" playing an overbearing mother trying to find the right man for her youngest daughter. Directed by Michael Lehmann (\"Heathers,\" \"40 Days and 40 Nights\"), the PG-13 film boasts some added girlpower in the cast with Mandy Moore, Piper Perabo, and Lauren Graham playing the daughters. The Universal release will undoubtedly skew heavily female and heavily Caucasian, but the acting ensemble could lead to a broad age range with mature women drawn in by Keaton’s motherly problems and young women connecting with the sisters. Aside from Mother’s Day weekend, the Super Bowl frame could indeed be the best time to launch a film like this as male interest will be low.In a world where Meryl Streep can open \"The Devil Wears Prada\" to $27.5M, Jane Fonda can drive \"Monster-in-Law\" to a $23.1M debut, and Helen Mirren keeps bringing in audiences month after month with \"The Queen,\" there certainly is box office gold with Hollywood’s elder stateswomen. Whether Keaton can join the ranks with this particular vehicle might be a different story. The studio has been pushing \"Because\" with great energy, but poor reviews could prompt many to just wait for the DVD. Starpower should help drive women of different ages to the box office and away from football and in a weak marketplace, that may be enough to reach the top spot. Opening in 2,526 theaters, \"Because I Said So\" might debut with around $14M.Diane Keaton in \"Because I Said So.\"Also opening on Friday is \"The Messengers,\" the fourth horror film in as many weeks to hit multiplexes. The PG-13 film directed by the Hong Kong-born Pang brothers tells the story of a family that moves into a run-down old house only to find creepy forces at play. Audiences have rejected every fright flick Hollywood has offered since October and \"The Messengers\" does not seem to bring anything new and exciting to the table to change things. Teens and young adults seem to be the core audience and with the big game in Miami commanding a lot of attention from the boys, Sony is hoping that teenage girls will be up for a scare. Marketing has been textbook and identical to every other horror pic. The starpower battle will be lost against \"Because\" so this flick will have to cater to those young ladies who do not want to be reminded of how meddlesome mothers can be. \"The Messengers\" opens in 2,528 theaters and could scare up around $12M for the weekend.Kristen Stewart gets a message in \"The Messengers.\"Among holdovers, the spoof comedy \"Epic Movie\" may have won last weekend’s box office derby beating fellow freshman \"Smokin’ Aces,\" but the R-rated action pic has taken over at number one each day during the mid-week period as \"Epic\" fans have gone back to class. The Fox comedy should see the larger drop as word-of-mouth will be nonexistent given its pathetic 3% score on RottenTomatoes.com which makes it the odds-on favorite so far for next year’s Razzie Awards. A 50% fall would leave \"Epic Movie\" with about $9M and a ten-day cume of $30M.\"Smokin’ Aces\" has held up better during the week and newcomers won’t threaten its audience of young men that much. A 45% drop would give the Universal release around $8M for the weekend and a total of $27M after ten days.The blockbuster \"Night at the Museum\" will enjoy yet another weekend when no kid movies enter the marketplace. That should lead to a small drop, possibly 25%, giving the Ben Stiller pic roughly $7M for the frame pushing the cume to an amazing $225M.LAST YEAR: Thrills ruled the box office as the scary pic \"When a Stranger Calls\" opened at number one with a strong $21.6M to easily lead the frame. Sony found its way to $47.9M. Fox’s \"Big Momma’s House 2\" dropped a notch to second with $13.6M in its second weekend while the kidpic \"Nanny McPhee\" finished in third with $9.8M. \"Brokeback Mountain\" climbed to the highest position of its entire run coming in fourth place with $6M. Rounding out the top five was the animated hit \"Hoodwinked\" with $5.3M. Focus opened its new cross-cultural romantic comedy \"Something New\" in seventh place with a mild $4.9M on its way to only $11.5M.Author: Gitesh Pandya, www.BoxOfficeGuru.com","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"story, 2016, impossible, french, Kaling, Winners, Diego, Chernobyl, Kemper, Columbia","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Preview-Keaton-and-Kids-Hope-to-Score-Touchdown"},{"id":"47613295311345","title":"Interview: Julien Temple on Joe Strummer: The Future is Unwritten","content":"var mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Interview: Julien Temple on Joe Strummer: The Future is UnwrittenCan Mick Jones: The Reckoning be far behind?by Tim Ryan | October 31, 2007 |  CommentsIn Joe Strummer: The Future is Unwritten, directorJulien Templepresents a fascinating portrait of the Clash frontman, whose life was filledwith contradictions. He was embarrassed by his boarding school education. He wasa hippie who became a punk. He was politically liberal and open-minded butoccasionally staunchly ideological. And he was fascinated by American culture,even though he wrote a song called \"I’m So Bored with the U.S.A.\"Temple is uniquely positioned to tell this story. Not only was he was a friendof Strummer‘s, but he’s made a number of excellent music films, from a wellconstructed history of the Sex Pistols, The Filth and the Fury, to Glastonbury,a portrait of Britain’s venerable rock fest. To tell Strummer’s story, Templeutilizes a mix of images, from concert footage to scratches of Strummer’swritings. Before his death from a heart attack in 2002, Strummer became obsessedwith the idea of the community of campfires, and Temple uses the concept as aframing device, interviewing Strummer’s friends and famous fans (includingBono,Johnny Depp, and Melle Mel) next to a campfire.Temple spoke with Rotten Tomatoes at the Mill Valley Film Festival, where TheFuture is Unwritten screened before its limited release this week. Thedirector discussed a number of subjects, including the legacy of the Clash, thechallenge of making original musical documentaries, and whyTupac Shakur was oneof the few musical artists who could actually act.Rotten Tomatoes: Someone like Joe Strummer is indicative of punk becoming a culturalphenomenon. He went from an underground situation to selling out stadiums andbecoming this beloved figure. What’s the story you wanted to tell in making thisfilm about him?Julian Temple: I wanted to tell the story of his life beyond the Clash, what led up to thatand what he had to deal with breaking it up. I was interested in it on a numberof levels. I was born in the same year [he was] so I wanted to make a history ofour culture through [that] kind of framing device: how Joe was educated, how hewas shaped by our culture and then went on to have some quite profound impactson English and global culture. On one level it was a social history, on anotherlevel it was a film about a friend. It wasn’t really a film about music. You cancall it a music film if you want but it’s about celebrity [and] its effect [on]not just the fans but on somebody famous. Those were various elements that seemintimate to me but his life throws up so many ideas. I like him as a philosophermore than as a rock star.Joe Strummer sort of embodies a contradictory spirit. He began as a hippieand then he jettisoned that and then the Clash became something else. Your filmis a celebratory film but not altogether.JT: It’s not a fan film. That was Joe’s strength. He was very, very human andthat’s what he fought to retain: his connection with his own humanity. Obviouslythat means flaws and faults. A lot of rock stars I think believe they’reperfect. A lot of a–holes thinking they’re above criticism and confliction andcontradiction. In contrast with that, I think Joe used the flaws andcontradictions as the motive for his work.Was it tough making a “warts and all” film about a person you knew?JT: It is. I knew I had to do that because Joe would have risen from the graveand strangled me. He may yet do that, I don’t know. He would have wanted “wartsand all” but what was quite hard was getting the balance in your own head andgetting over this thing of trying to second guess what he would have thought. Inthe end he’s not going to give you an answer but obviously I didn’t want toassassinate the guy because I loved him. But on the other hand I wanted to showwhat was special about him. He was deeply flawed as well as deeply generous andinspirational like most people.You seem to have a pretty interesting way of making these biopics in thesense that you’re not doing the “talking heads” thing. Are you trying to breakout of the model?JT: I’m just trying to find another way of doing it. Treat each time as thoughyou know nothing about the form. Certainly, I do hate, more than anything, thecurse of the talking head. Going on about how he made an album, that’s as bad asit gets. It’s so far away from the cinema but you do have to include talking andyou have to find ways of doing that that doesn’t kill everything else stonedead.Were you at all concerned the narrative might get lost if people didn’t knowwho was whom?JT: Not really. In a film with that many people you’d be having a title everytwo seconds. So you wouldn’t be watching the film, you’d be reading names. Youhave to do it for everybody or else you shouldn’t do it. What I’d hoped to do istreat [the story] like cinema and fly [viewers] into the screen, into this lifethat Joe lived. And if you’ve got captions, you can’t fly. It’s like barbedwire. You get caught.Your fiction films include musicians of some stripe. At Cannes,Wong Kar-Waisaid singers have a sort of built-in actor-ly rhythm. Does that appeal to you?JT: I disagree with that. Some singers are the worst actors you can dream of.Mick Jagger, for example. Singers have a rhythm they have to lose, unless youwant them to play themselves. Performance, Mick Jagger isn’t bad in that.But if you want him to playNed Kelly, he’s got a big handicap. He hasto get rid of his Mick Jaggerisms.How was it working with Tupac Shakur on Bullet?JT: It was cool. I think rap stars are a bit different than pop stars. Ihad a great time with Tupac. We got along really well; I think he’s a veryintelligent guy and a real rebel so I liked him a lot. I was lucky actually,because I have Mickey Rourke in the same film and Mickey can play up the bad guyand because, I think, he realized Tupac was badder than anything he could come upwith so he behaved a bit more. Tupac had quite an aura about him; like if youwant to do something, take it seriously and do it. In a context like we were in,that was really helpful.Do you think on some level the Clash, who had something to say and sold outarenas, do you think they’re the last group who could have that? Is thatsomething your film is saying?JT: The film is about the process because it does show a no-win situation. Youbelieve things you’re doing and saying in your music and reaching an audiencewith that music. And when you do, you have to sign up with some machine thatallows you to play places that’ll reach big audiences and sell records but indoing that you’re doing a deal with the devil and you have to live with that andyou don’t like it. That’s part of why Joe is really interesting. On a biggerlevel, he wrestled with that. And that’s the drama of the film: that strugglewith what you want and what you get.What do you think about the state of music today?JT: I think there’s great music out but not any great commercial music. That’s akind of contradiction. It’s certainly much harder for really good music to beseen as commercial or meeting a mass audience than it was in the past. I thinkthat’s partly the problem. There is great music out there but people don’t getto hear it. Same with movies. You’re fighting a machine that only wants you tohear shit. I saw a punk band in London — which normally would scare me, but nowhow pathetic that idea is. The band was really [good] but they’ll never get analbum. A lot of people don’t think [so], but there are still people who do [goodmusic] and what they do is as good as it ever was.Was Joe Strummer unhappy after the Clash broke up?JT: I didn’t really know him at the time. I was working with the Pistolsalready. I was given the ultimatum by the Clash: “Us or them.” So I didn’treally see The Clash very much for like 20 years. I did bump into them, funnyenough, [when] Joe came down to where I lived, by chance, to Somerset. He was onhis way out of that [dark] period. I got the feeling he was very lost andhaunted by a lot of things and unable to find a direction that made sense tohim. A lot of people I got to know [who were] close to him didn’t [recognize]that thinking. Sometimes you’d get the sense that was a really dark place he wasin.It seemed so long between the Clash and [Strummer’s last band] the Mescaleros. I wondered wherehe’d been.JT: He was always capable. That was exciting to me because I was part of seeingthat process. He did really do it around campfires. He would find musicians andtalk to them in-depth around the fire and he’d play incredibly diverse musicaround the campfire — music from different cultures. You could see him piecing away to the Mescaleros between different fires. He had different attempts at itwith characters that weren’t in the final lineup of the Mescaleros. That wasreally interesting, it wasn’t overnight.Was he really haunted by his brother’s suicide?JT: I think he was. He never really talked to me about it. He spoke with my wifewhen we were living with Joe in Somerset, because she lost her brother tosuicide. Joe was very responsive to her and what she was feeling but he wouldn’ttalk to most people about it. He did say that he made a point of thinking aboutit once a day.Is that similar to a political or world view of —JT: Yeah, I think Joe saw him as a real victim of that school system. And Ithink Joe saw himself as a survivor who had to move as far away from what heexpected to become as a product of that system. So it did have a sort ofspringboard effect on what Joe would become. I don’t think it was a kind of a‘rosebud’ thing to what Joe Strummer is.Joe Strummer wrote a lot of notes to himself. Was he always writing randomlyor did he have a diary?JT: He was constantly doing that. I think it came from writing lyrics. By theend it became a thing in itself, it didn’t have to be part of a lyric, if hethought something he’d write it down. He had plastic carrier bags of thesedoodles in his bath. It’s funny, he could slam the door on different parts ofhis life and still get away with these carrier bags full of doodles and ideas.He was funny. He did have a sense of some kind of destiny about him. Some sensehe’d do something important. Maybe everyone does but he certainly delivered onthat.What else are you working on?JT: I’ve just done an opera film, actually. It’s called The EternityMan, it’s an Australian Opera. I hadGuy Pearce wanting to do it for a whileand it’s a difficult decision but in the end he couldn’t do the arias. Opera isquite an art. We tried out musical theatre people and they couldn’t do it. It’snot like you can master the technique in two weeks. It’s probably harder to getactors to sing but it’s hard all around. These opera singers are used to havingto hit the back rows. It’s never going to be the same as in a regular close up,they’re singing, but we did need to find a way to get them to feel ‘in themoment.’ I also didn’t realize how important counting and conducting is. Weactually had a conductor off-screen conducting and keeping time, white glovesand all. They [the singers] are actually looking at this conductor and thentrying to deal with entering and how to act in each scene.Are you working on any other music biopics?JT: I don’t want to do another one like this immediately. You know, youget pigeonholed. And they’re hard to do, energy-wise. It’s quite nice to have ascript when you edit. You know: This shot goes next to this one and that onebefore this, whereas [in a documentary] you’ve got all this footage for thisfilm and there’s a million ways to put it together. So I’d like to work on somenarrative films, but I’d like to be free with them the way I have been withthese [documentaries]; where I’ve not been told so much what to do. I have aproject called Wise Children by novelist Angela Carter, who died in theearly 1990s. I have a thriller about Christopher Marlowe, the playwright fromthe time of Shakespeare. I do want to do a film on The Kinks at some point. I’msort of searching and not quite ready. Though I think that would have to have alayer of fiction involved in it.What do you hope a young person who doesn’t know anything about the Clashmight take away from this film?JT: That you can create a whole code of liberties when you’re young that youdon’t have to give up on when you’re older. I think a lot of people grow out ofwho they were and that paradigm of having joy making whatever it is they make.They don’t have to take on that paradigm of thought that once they grow up theyhave to let go of their right to think. I love that about Joe: he had a code hecreated when he was young — though you don’t have to come up with it whenyou’re young — and he held by it. He knew you don’t have to abandon those waysof thinking when you get older. You’re forced to do it on many levels but in thecore part of you, you don’t have to do that. And Joe was a philosopher. Hereally enjoyed thinking things through and trying to find a new way of lookingat whatever it was.

But it is also a statement of purpose executive producers and showrunners Justin Halpern and Patrick Schumacker told Rotten Tomatoes was necessary to set the show apart from other animated offerings.“We were really concerned about people thinking maybe the show is for kids,” Halpern said. “We wanted to come out strong in the first couple minutes and make it very clear that the show was an adult show and it very much is not for kids.”(Photo by DC Universe)With its occasional potty-mouth, outrageous cartoon violence, and focus on villains like Harley Quinn (Kaley Cuoco), Poison Ivy (Lake Bell), and King Shark (Ron Funches), Harley Quinn is a different kind of animated DC cartoon. Like Halpern and Schumacker’s previous DC Entertainment effort, the short-lived sitcom Powerless, it refocuses fantastic concepts into everyday life, but unlike that show, the mundane comes to singular characters like Harley and Lex Luthor; in fact, it begins with one of the most common heartaches people experience: a breakup. This breakup, however, features Harley and the Joker (Alan Tudyk).“We wanted to structure the first season as a prolonged breakup story, dealing with the post-breakup and how you remove yourself from underneath the specter of your ex who has sucked all the air out of the room and is the superstar of the relationship. The [person] everybody thinks about first,” Halpern explained.(Photo by DC Universe)Set against the breakup is Harley’s attempt to join the Legion of Doom and prove she’s more than the Joker’s girlfriend. To that end, she forms a crew of her own comprised of some great DC Comics misfits.“We take it in think a different direction than the comics have taken it,” Schumacker added. “In the current version you have her living in Coney Island with a cast of newer characters. We wanted to use [more] established characters in the Batman and Gotham City sandbox, as well as characters like Dr. Psycho, a classic Wonder Woman villain who becomes part of Harley’s crew.”Psycho (Tony Hale) joins the team alongside Clayface (also Tudyk), who in turn invites King Shark to handle IT support.Both have some presence on television thanks to Batman: The Animated Series and The Flash, respectively, but the characters have some new quirks thanks to the Harley Quinn writers and the performers themselves.“We knew that we wanted to portray Clayface as this sort of erudite, Juilliard reject. A self-serious ‘act-or’ with a capital-A, and Alan knows [how to pull that off],” Schumacker said. “All you have to do is say, ‘Kind of like a Juilliard, Mid-Atlantic accent. Go.’”Funches, meanwhile, was the perfect voice for an “excitable” and more verbal take on the comic book shark-man.But even with the focus on older DC characters, current Harley Quinn comic book cast member Sy Borgman makes his animated debut in the series.“When we found out that we could get Jason Alexander to [voice] an elderly Jewish cyborg … you have to take that,” Halpern said.(Photo by DC Universe)The series also features a number of surprise cameo voices that will leave you searching the end credits to see if a guest character actually voiced themselves. Halpern credited Cuoco (who also serves as an executive producer) with helping to bring both the guest and regular voice cast together.“Once we had Kaley on board – and Lake and Alan who we had worked with before as well as Ron, actually – it kind of snowballed from there,” he explained. “I think people were like, ‘Oh, OK, this is like legit. There’s clearly these highly respected colleagues that are interested in doing the show.’”The availability of talent also meant they could go further with reinventions of like King Shark and a broken Jim Gordon voiced by Christopher Meloni.“Our basic thought was what would Gordon actually be like if he had to be the commissioner of Gotham City for every day of his life and live the movie Seven every day,” Halpern said. “He’d have trauma and probably some sort of substance abuse problem.”Meloni, who seems to enjoy demolishing cop archetypes in series like Happy! was game for the wildly different take on Gordon.“If you tell Chris we need to play it a little bit ‘up,’ he’s going to give you something pretty special,”&nbsp;Schumacker said.(Photo by DC Universe)Also special was the showrunners’ take on Bane – that is to say, they decided to play with the comedic potential of the voice Tom Hardy gifted the character in The Dark Knight Rises.“James Adomian kind of took that and ran with it … that version of the voice just fit our representation of Bane so well,” Halpern explained.The voice, as it did in The LEGO Batman Movie and with comedians across the country, makes the character something of a joke, which the producer was quick to admit is a very different interpretation from the comics.“He’s one of the smartest criminal geniuses in the whole entire DC Universe and in our show he’s — not that,” Halpern explained. “For the longest time we were just like, ‘OK, he’s like a punching bag for the rest of the criminal underbelly. It shouldn’t just be just like an elaborate ruse, because he’s all about those long cons, and then we were just kind of like, ‘Nah, this is too funny.’”The producers’ sense of humor led them to directly adapt one idea from a 2001 JLA story by introducing a villain called the Queen of Fables (voiced by Wanda Sykes in the series) in the exact state the Justice League left her at the end of the issue – stuck inside a paper copy of the United States tax code.“We just thought that was so funny and absurd,” Schumacker said. “And then we were like, ‘What’s the next evolution of that?’ What can she do inside of that tax code? Well, she can become a CPA.”But beyond her humorous appearance, the Queen of Fables also serves a role in Harley’s ongoing story.“We wanted a very powerful, female supervillain to act as sort of the cautionary tale for Harley if she were to break [the Legion of Doom’s] glass ceiling, and the Queen of Fables felt like a perfect fit,” Halpern explained, noting that&nbsp;her relative obscurity meant the character could serve this role in an accessible way to viewers who may not have read the original JLA story. “Even if you don’t know who she is, [you realize], ‘OK, she’s an evil sorceress who has Gumby-like power. Got it.’“Also [the League’s] punishment for her was so much worse than their punishment for literally every other supervillain,” he added. “That’s what I think jumped out to us. I think that that was our jumping off point.”Nonetheless, viewers will see a major difference between Harley and the Queen of Fables. One which Halpern called their “North Star” while developing the series.“Harley has her own moral code,” he said. “It definitely does not align with the moral code of most people on Earth. But in her mind, she’s doing what she thinks is right.”(Photo by DC Universe)Viewers will also see that moral flexibility with Poison Ivy, who insists she’s not part of Harley’s crew and just doing her thing to protect the environment. Her unique worldview also makes Harley the one human being she considers a friend.Historically, the two have had a rapport since the 1993 Batman: TAS episode “Harley and Ivy.” In the comics, it eventually evolved into a romantic dynamic. But for the purposes of Harley Quinn’s first season, that element is being downplayed for an important reason.“If we’re breaking her away from the Joker and we’re telling a story of self-discovery, we didn’t want that self-discovery to get wrapped up in yet another relationship,” Halpern explained. “We didn’t want Harley to be defined by the person she was dating. We wanted her to be able to explore [the question] ‘What does my life look like and what do I actually want when I’m not tethered to someone else?’”Nonetheless, their relationship may be teased here and there, and Halpern suggested it may come into play in a potential second season.In the meantime, their friendship is one of the show’s highlights. Ivy’s deadpan delivery and Daria-like outlook bounces off the energetic Harley, who Halpern described as a “consummate optimist.” Well, an optimist freed from “societal pressures and norms” anyway.When not cracking jokes, the series will explore a little bit of the divide between Harley and her life as Dr. Harleen Quinzel. Although, both Halpern and Schumacker agreed “the core [of her] was still the same,” with Halpern adding there was “probably a lot of work to keep Harleen ‘Harleen.’”It is the sort of thing adult animated shows explore alongside the freedom to curse.Harley Quinn premieres Friday, November 29 on DC Universe","section":"Comics on TV","tags":"we, crime, A24, King, teaser, crossover, TCA","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/27130300/harley-quinn-600x314.jpg","slug":"harley-quinn-producers-stress-this-animated-series-is-for-adults"},{"id":"47508863875535","title":"Five Favourite Films with J.

J. AbramsThe Star Trek director takes the captain's chair and talks space, John Ford and classic cinema.by Joanna Cohen | April 27, 2009 |  CommentsThe blockbuster season is upon us and amongst the line-up is the highly anticipated reboot of Star Trek. RT spoke to the man in the captain’s chair, J. J. Abrams, about his galactic re-imagining of the great Trek franchise as well as the films that have inspired him.Abrams made his name creating ratings gold on the small screen in the form of Felicty, Alias and the mind-bending Lost. His feature directorial debut came in 2006 with Mission: Impossible III and in 2008 he produced the film marketer’s dream, Cloverfield.Today, J.J. Abrams talks to Rotten Tomatoes about the light and dark in the Star Trek universe and the challenges and freedoms provided by the scale of shooting in space.We put him through the torture of selecting his top five favorite films right now. In doing so he produced a list that reveals a fan of great and classic cinema.Check out the video interview or skip below for a pull-out of his five faves.Jaws (1975, 100% Tomatometer)Jaws is an undeniably great movie. Jaws is just one of the greatest movies ever. It’s on TV all the time. It is never not on television. They should just have a Jaws Network where they just show Jaws all the time because I would subscribe like crazy. The movie is just wonderful and the characters are so great. I am just in awe of that movie. I think that movie is spectacular.Philadelphia Story (1940, 100% Tomatometer)Brilliant dialogue and even better chemistry.Star Wars (1977, 95% Tomatometer)I can’t understand why that would not be on the list…Tootsie(1982, 87% Tomatometer)&nbsp;Things come to mind and this sounds nuts but Tootsie. It is as preposterous premise as they come and yet you completely believe it is real and happening.Rear Window (1954, 100%)And maybe that is just because when Grace Kelly goes to kiss Jimmy Stewart that first time it was just one of those things where it is the best special effect in the history of timeIf you are as excited about the reboot as we are, and want to get your Trekkie credentials up to date, join Editor, Tim Ryan, for Trekking With Tim. He will boldly take you on his journey through time as he visits every Star Trek film in the franchise leading up to the reboot.","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"cinematic, Spring, Horse, police, Superheroes","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/JJAbrams.jpg","slug":"five-favourite-films-with-j-j-abrams"},{"id":"47508875722290","title":"Sing, Bill and Ted’s Excellent Adventure, Superbad and More on Netflix and Amazon Prime This Week","content":"Now Streamingvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Sing, Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure, Superbad and More on Netflix and Amazon Prime This Weekby RT Staff | August 8, 2017 |  CommentsThis week on streaming, we have an animated hit, new and old comedy classics, some worth Netflix originals, and a lot more.

Anne Hathaway first worked with Christopher Nolan on last year’s The Dark Knight Rises in the role of Catwoman, and she is now near a deal with Paramount and Warner Bros to costar in his next film called Interstellar. Anne Hathaway joins the previously announced Matthew McConaughey, who with Interstellar will be making his debut as a Nolan cast member. The details of Interstellar are not known, but it’s expected to possibly involve a voyage through outer space to a wormhole as an attempt to test theories relating to time travel.  That, at least, was what we thought we knew about Interstellar back when it was one of the movies that Steven Spielberg had on his massive development slate.  Paramount Pictures will be releasing Interstellar in the U.S. on November 7, 2014.\n\n\n\nFresh Developments This Week\n\t\n#1 MORGAN FREEMAN JOINS SCI-FI PROJECT TRANSCENDENCE\n\nA lot of other trends get more attention (remakes, fairy tale reboots, etc.), but it’s probably obvious that the science fiction genre is currently experiencing something of an uptick.  Christopher Nolan is involved with at least two of the upcoming science fiction films.  Nolan’s directing the previously mentioned Interstellar and executive producing for Warner Bros a project called Transcendence, which will mark the directorial debut of his frequent cinematographer, Wally Pfister (the Dark Knight trilogy, Inception, etc.).  Johnny Depp will star in Transcendence as (we think) a man whose mind gets uploaded to a supercomputer.  And there to probably give some sagely advice (since that’s pretty much what he does in most movies these days) will be Morgan Freeman.  Freeman joins the previously announced Johnny Depp, Paul Bettany (who is probably the mind transference guy if Depp isn’t), Rebecca Hall, and Kate Mara.  Warner Bros has scheduled Transcendence for a release date of April 25, 2014.\n\n\n\t\n#2 ROBERT REDFORD WILL BE (THE FIRST HALF OF) THE OLD MAN AND THE GUN\n\nRobert Redford recently made the news on all the various sites that concern themselves with superhero movies when he joined the cast of Captain America: The Winter Soldier as one of the leaders of S.H.I.E.L.D.  For his next film after that, Redford will be helping out one of the filmmakers that recently emerged from his most famous pet project, the Sundance Film Festival.  Redford will be starring in (and producing) The Old Man and the Gun, which will be adapted and directed by David Lowery, who made his debut with Ain’t Them Bodies Saints, which is expected to be in limited release starting this August.  The Old Man and the Gun will be based on a true story as depicted in a 2003 article by David Grann in The New Yorker.  The focus of the story is a bank robber named Forrest Tucker  who spent most of his life either in jail, escaping from jail, or on the run from jail, with a total of 18 escapes on his record (from various prisons that included Alcatraz and San Quentin). Considering the title, it’s likely that the film will focus on Tucker’s last heist (and resulting high speed pursuit), which came in 2000 when Tucker was in his late 70s and living with his third wife in a Florida retirement community.\n\n\n\t\n#3 LIAM NEESON AND WOODY HARRELSON MAY PURSUE BONNIE AND CLYDE IN HIGHWAYMEN\n\nUniversal Pictures and Media Rights Capital (Elysium, Riddick) are teaming up for a true crime story film called Highwaymen about the Texas Rangers that hunted down and executed the bank robbing team of Bonnie (Parker) and Clyde (Barrow) in 1934. Highwaymen will be directed by John Lee Hancock, whose next film to be released will be the making-of-Mary Poppins film Saving Mr. Banks, and whose past films include The Rookie and The Blind Side.  Liam Neeson and Woody Harrelson are being courted (but aren’t yet signed) to star in Highwaymen, but it’s unclear which actor would be playing the central character of Frank Hamer who actually organized the posse in question.  The Highwaymen script was adapted by screenwriter John Fusco (The Forbidden Kingdom, Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron).\n\n\n\t\n#4 WALTER WHITE AND THE NEW HANNIBAL LECTER JOIN THE VOICE CAST OF KUNG FU PANDA 3\n\nNormally, if one saw that a new movie was going to feature the talents of Bryan Cranston (TV’s Breaking Bad) and Mads Mikkelsen (TV’s Hannibal), you might think that the movie in question was going to be an intense drama that probably ends with a lot of blood, gore, and anguish.  Or, we could be talking about Kung Fu Panda 3, to which Rebel Wilson (Bridesmaids) will be also contributing her voice talent.  These three join the several other voice actors from the two previous films that are likely to be returning, such as Jack Black, Angelina Jolie, and Seth Rogen.  DreamWorks Animation has also bumped up the release date of Kung Fu Panda 3 from March, 2016 to December 23, 2015.\n\n\n\nRotten Ideas of the Week\n\t\n#5 ROBERT DE NIRO SIGNS FOR HIS SECOND UPCOMING BOXING MOVIE WITH HANDS OF STONE\n\nRobert De Niro (Raging Bull) recently teamed with Sylvester Stallone (Rocky) in an upcoming boxing movie called Grudge Match which seemed to be produced entirely around the gimmick that its two aging stars were both in famous boxing movies decades ago.  Robert De Niro is not, however, entirely done with boxing movies just yet, as he has signed on to costar with Edgar Ramirez in the Roberto Duran boxing biopic Hands of Stone.  De Niro and Ramirez are coming to this movie after two other actors that had previously been announced as being in talks for those roles (Al Pacino and Gael Garcia Bernal).  Filming will start in Panama in September, 2013 under the direction of Jonathan Jakubowicz (Secuestro Express).  This is a borderline Rotten Idea this week based on the “Rotten” score for Jakobowicz’s only previous film.  Hopefully, audiences won’t be exclaiming “No mas!” when this movie comes out, probably in 2014.\n\n\n\t\n#4 DJ DIPLO TO STAR IN AN EDM MOVIE\n\nOh, musical trends.  The movies you inspire generally don’t end up being very good (on average, anyway).  The latest such musical style to start getting attention from Hollywood is “electronic dance music,” which sounds pretty much like exactly what it is.  Warner Bros last year started development on an EDM movie with director McG, and this week, 20th Century Fox also got into the mix, with the DJ who calls himself Diplo as executive producer.  The untitled project about three teens trying to get Diplo’s Electronic Music Festival is being compared to “8 Mile meets Project X,” but the premise sounds closer to Detroit Rock City, if KISS produced electronic farts while standing around in the dark staring at record players.\n\n\n#3 JIM CARREY REPLACES JAMES FRANCO AND JOAQUIN PHOENIX AS RICKY STANICKY\n\nJim Carrey has signed with Summit Entertainment to star in the comedy Ricky Stanicky, taking a role that, in the last three years, was almost played first by James Franco and then Joaquin Phoenix.   The premise of Ricky Stanicky involves an out of work actor who is hired by a group of friends to play the imaginary character that they invented when they were teenagers as an alibi whenever they were in trouble (as in, “I didn’t do it, Ricky Stanicky did it”). Ricky Stanicky will be directed and rewritten by Steve Oedekerk, who has worked with Jim Carrey in the past on Bruce Almighty and Ace Ventura: When Nature Calls.  This is one of the week’s Rotten Ideas because of the large number of “Rotten” scores on Steve Oedekerk’s RT Tomatometer page.\n\n\n\t\n#2 NOW WE KNOW WHY KEANU’S SO SAD: THE POINT BREAK REMAKE IS STILL HAPPENING\n\nNever say this column isn’t all about the super timely meme references.  Anyway, it’s been a while since the world heard anything about the plans to remake the 1991 Keanu Reeves/Patrick Swayze crime thriller Point Break, so most people probably figured that it would thankfully never happen.  Except that this week we found out that the Point Break remake will be directed by Ericson Core (2006’s football drama Invincible), and thus, might actually happen, possibly soon (by the end of 2013 is the plan).  That the remake is happening 22 years later is particularly interesting considering this quote from the original, spoken by Gary Busey’s character, which you can interpret however you like: “Twenty two years, man.  L.A. has changed a lot during that time.  The air got dirty and the sex got clean.”\n\n\n\t\n#1 WARNER BROS MOVES AHEAD WITH PLANS TO MOVE BACK TO THE OVERLOOK HOTEL\n\nSure, Stephen King wasn’t thrilled with Stanley Kubrick’s The Shining, but a whole lot of people disagree with him (this writer personally considers The Shining to be the best horror film ever made).  Thankfully, Warner Bros is not outright “remaking” or “rebooting” The Shining, but what they do have planned might seem just as unnecessary, considering how much time Kubrick’s film already spent exploring the back story.  That’s right, Warner Bros has started development of a prequel to The Shining called The Overlook Hotel, which presumably will go back to cover one of the caretakers before Jack Torrance arrived in the late 1970s.  The writer that Warner Bros has hired to work on The Overlook Hotel is famous for taking over another horror project that was established by someone else first: Glen Mazzara was, until recently, the showrunner of the AMC series The Walking Dead, which he took over after the departure of Frank Darabont.  Meanwhile, Stephen King himself is revisiting The Shining (sort of) with the sequel novel Doctor Sleep, but The Overlook Hotel doesn’t really figure into that story’s premise (as far as we know).\n\n\nFor more Weekly Ketchup columns by Greg Dean Schmitz, check out the WK archive, and you can contact GDS via ","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"actors, Mirror, America, It","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Weekly-Ketchup-Anne-Hathaway-Joins-Christopher-Nolans-Interstellar"},{"id":"47509112774346","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: Think Like a Man Too Hits the Jackpot","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: Think Like a Man Too Hits the Jackpot22 Jump Street and How to Train Your Dragon 2 round out the top three.by Gitesh Pandya | June 22, 2014 |  CommentsSony ruled the North American box office with a pair of popular comedy sequels, each connecting well with its target audience. The battle-of-the-sexes pic Think Like a Man Too featuring an ensemble cast including red hot star Kevin Hart opened in first place by a narrow margin with an estimated $30M. That was off 11% from the $33.6M debut of its predecessor from April 2012, but still a muscular start. The PG-13 film averaged a spectacular $13,483 from 2,225 locations.The first pic was well-liked and the sequel brought back the cast and also offered something new and engaging with its story of a wedding weekend in Las Vegas. Just as before, females led the way and made up 63% of the audience (same ratio as last film). 59% were over 30. Reviews were mostly negative, but that is common for comedy sequels. Ticket buyers instead responded to the starpower, brand, and humor. They liked what they got given the A- CinemaScore. Too may not reach the $91.5M final gross of its predecessor, but the $24M-budgeted film should certainly end up being another moneymaker for Sony.After a sparkling debut last week followed by healthy mid-week sales, the buddy cop sequel 22 Jump Street finished close behind in second place this weekend with an estimated $29M. Off 49% – a terrific hold for a sequel – the R-rated comedy has now banked an impressive $111.5M. Should it continue to enjoy this impressive playability driven by strong word-of-mouth, it could end up in the range of $190M. The next major adult comedy does not arrive until Melissa McCarthy unleashes Tammy on July 2.Jump Street actually was number one on Saturday and Sunday but the hefty opening day Friday for Think Like A Man Too (which included Thursday pre-shows) was enough to give that film the weekend crown.Despite no new kidpics opening, the DreamWorks Animation title How to Train Your Dragon 2 fell 49% in its second weekend to an estimated $25.3M pushing the cume to $95.2M thus far. Among summer sequels from the toon studio, the drop was more like 2011’s Kung Fu Panda 2 (-50%) than 2012’s Madagascar 3 (-44%). Last summer’s Pixar sequel Monsters University dropped 45% in June.A domestic final of around $170M seems likely for the well-reviewed Fox release putting it near the $187.2M of the animation studio’s The Croods from last year. Competition has come from Disney’s fairy tale hit Maleficent which is roaring towards $200M and next weekend, the new Transformers will take away many older kids. The first Dragon was a sleeper hit and eased only 34% in its second weekend, though a hold like that was never expected for the new installment.Clint Eastwood’s Jersey Boys opened in fourth to mild results attracting one of the oldest audiences in recent years with an estimated $13.5M from 2,905 locations for a $4,652 average. The R-rated adaptation of the Tony Award-winning musical about 1960s music group The Four Seasons skewed female and much older. Studio research from Warner Bros. showed that women made up 61% of the crowd and a very high 71% were over the age of 50. Reviews were mixed and the gross was in line with what Eastwood usually sees in his first wide weekend. With an A- CinemaScore and an older target audience, Jersey may hold up moderately well in the weeks to come although keeping a national ad campaign going does not come cheap.Angelina Jolie reached a new career high this weekend with her latest hit Maleficent which became her biggest global grosser ever for a live-action film. The Disney pic dipped only 30% in North America to an estimated $13M for a new total of $186M. A strong $20.3M opening weekend in China propelled the overseas total to $335.6M and the worldwide tally to $521.6M beating 2005’s Mr. &amp; Mrs. Smith. Her spy smash with Brad Pitt had been her top-grossing live-action film for the past nine years with $478M. Maleficent has higher ticket prices and 3D surcharges, though.Tom Cruise is not making as much money with his latest action entry Edge of Tomorrow, however his well-liked sci-fi action pic is holding up well thanks to fan support. The pricey Warner Bros. release dropped 37% to an estimated $10.3M in its third lap pushing the sum up to $74.5M. It now has a good shot at joining the century club. That comes as good news for the actor who has not crossed $100M domestically in a lead role outside of his signature Mission: Impossible franchise in the nine years since 2005’s War of the Worlds.Fox followed with a pair of hits. The romance The Fault In Our Stars dropped a moderate 42% to an estimated $8.6M for a new cume to date of $98.7M on the edge of being the summer’s latest $100M+ grosser. X-Men: Days of Future Past followed with an estimated $6.2M, down 37%, for $216.8M to date. It is the summer’s top-grossing film so far and now stands as the second highest grossing film in the seven-pic X-Men franchise. Look for Past to challenge the $234.4M of 2006’s The Last Stand.Indie hit Chef collected an estimated $1.8M, dipping only 16%, with $16.9M to date for Open Road. Godzilla rounded out the top ten with an estimated $1.8M as well falling 45% in its sixth weekend. With $194.9M so far, the big-budget 3D monster movie is heading to a $200M finish although total tickets sold will still end up substantially lower than the 1998 Godzilla.The top ten films grossed an estimated $139.6M which was down 39% from last year’s record June frame when Monsters University opened at number one with $82.4M; and off 8% from 2012 when Brave debuted on top with $66.3M.Follow Gitesh on Twitter!","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"universe, NYCC, President, Box, docudrama, Hallmark, Games, period, nbcuniversal, adaptation, YA, biography, golden, Geo, talk","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-Think-Like-a-Man-Too-Hits-the-Jackpot"},{"id":"47508696305592","title":"How The Gifted Ties into X-Men History (Including The Animated Series)","content":"Comics On TVvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})How The Gifted Ties into X-Men History (Including The Animated Series)Muties, Sentinels, and a Logan connection – where do these mutants fit? And do they bleed the X-Men blue and gold?by Erik Amaya | October 6, 2017 |  Comments(Photo by Miller Mobley/FOX)The Gifted’s solid debut means the X-Men finally have a strong foothold on broadcast television. And while its premise emphatically states that it takes place in a world without the X-Men, there are more than enough nods, winks, and outright lifts from the comic book series’ past that it is worthy to explore their origins back in the pages of Uncanny X-Men and its numerous spin-offs.1. Don’t Call Them Muties(Photo by Ryan Green/FOX)Early in the pilot, Andy (Percy Hynes White) refers to mutants as “muties.” Based on Lauren’s (Natalie Alyn Lind) reaction, we know that word is not a term of affection. In use by November 1965’s X-Men #14 by Jack Kirby and Stan Lee – though Robert Heinlein was using the term in stories as early as the 1940s — “Mutie” quickly became the slur of choice for bigots when confronted by a mutant. It was never more popular amongst anti-mutant groups than in 1982’s X-Men graphic novel God Loves, Man Kills by Chris Claremont and Brent Anderson. In the story, William Stryker uses it to foment anti-mutant leanings at his church revivals and to bait Professor Xavier into debating him on television; leaving him open to a kidnapping. Curiously, The Gifted is the first X-Men live action project to make a very pointed connection to the term and other bigoted slurs. Expect it to recur whenever the Mutant Underground ventures into the wide world.2. The Blue and Gold(Photo by Marvel; Eliza Morse/FOX)In getting ready for the dance, Lauren asks her date which outfit looks better: blue or gold. The color schemes of her options are a quick visual reference to the standard X-Men uniform. Though some might argue the blue was intended to read as black due to printing issues in most comics of the time, the blue-and-gold uniforms debuted in 1963’s X-Men #1. The team eventually switched to more individualized costumes in issue #39 – designed by Jean Grey no less! – but the blue-and-gold motif would return whenever the changing creative teams wanted to recall those early days. During Grant Morrison’s New X-Men series, he and artist Frank Quitely redesigned the uniforms with a more stylish, fashion-forward feel. Sadly, Marvel never made New X-Men wear available, and the color scheme continued to be the butt of jokes in X-Men films. The blue-and-gold uniforms finally made their debut in X-Men: First Class, proving they can look good in live action. Will the mutants of The Gifted ever adopt costumes or uniforms? They’d have to become a team first.3. Where Stand The Sentinels?(Photo by Ryan GreenFOX)Once Andy’s powers cause an incident, a federal agency called Sentinel Services knocks on the Struckers’ door. The name immediately recalls the robotic Sentinels first seen in Uncanny X-Men #14. Despite their visual similarity to Magneto, they were primarily the weapon of non-mutant antagonists like Bolivar Trask and Project Wideawake. A few Mutants, like Cassandra Nova, would also adapt some of the technology to their own ends. But beyond the Sentinel connection, Sentinel Services also resembles any number of Marvel governmental agencies and mutant research groups like Department H and the Mutant Response Division. It will be interesting to see how much time The Gifted will devote to developing the agency and filling its ranks with recognizable anti-mutant foes.4. Magnetic Personalities(Photo by Eliza Morse/FOX)If Lorna Dane’s (Emma Dumont) powers and plastic-cell imprisonment remind you of Magneto, that’s no accident. First introduced in X-Men #49, Lorna was eventually revealed to be the daughter of Mutant Brotherhood founder Erik Magnus Leshner (Magento) 35 years later – although the issue was brought up many times in the intervening years. In fact, in her first adventure with the X-Men, an android of Magneto claimed to be her father. At the time, the whole thing was dismissed as a ruse by the villain Mastermind to control her powers, but it seems the android knew better.Magneto, for his part, got around, also fathering Wanda and Pietro Maximoff, better known as Avengers’ Scarlett Witch and&nbsp;Quicksilver (the latter of which also appears in&nbsp;X-Men: Days of Future Past&nbsp;played by a different actor than the Avengers films). It is currently unclear if The Gifted will make use of Lorna’s parentage. Just like the paternity issue on Legion, Marvel and Fox’s ability to reference the X-Men film characters must go through many approvals at a number of corporate entities. Nevertheless, it is interesting to note that Marco says she founded the Atlanta chapter of the Mutant Underground, as her comic book counterpart would eventually go on to be the uncomfortable leader of X-Factor.5. Mutants Underground(Photo by Eliza Morse/FOX)While the X-Men and the Brotherhood are the best known mutant groups, there are other organizations. For some mutants, the struggle between Xavier and Magneto’s goals is too much to take and others just want to hide away from the world. On The Gifted, these other groups may emerge as members of the Mutant Underground or as rival factions rising up as the central leadership the X-Men and Brotherhood offered disappears.One such group is the Morlocks, introduced in Uncanny X-Men #169. As most are too deformed by their mutations to live in mainstream society, they literally dwell underground in tunnels around the New York area. Led by Callisto, the group consciously chose their name from H.G. Wells’ The Time Machine to reflect their exile status. Under the leadership of Storm, the group waxed and waned over the years, but eventually re-established their underground society and welcomed humans into their ranks following a number of upheavals above ground. The mostly benevolent group closely resembles The Gifted’s Mutant Underground, but may yet appear as a faction of their own at some point. In fact, it would be interesting to see stranger looking mutants appear on the show; even if the makeup effects mean those appearances would have to be brief.6. Strucker Like The Wolf(Photo by Ryan Green/FOX)No matter how you slice it, “Reed Strucker” (Stephen Moyer) is an interesting name. It is composed of two very important names from elsewhere in the Marvel Universe: Reed Richards and Baron Wolfgang Von Strucker. Reed, of course, was there at the dawn of the Marvel Age of Comics in issue #1 of Fantastic Four. And like the Reed of The Gifted, he’s dedicated to his causes and often forgetful about his family until menace lands on their doorstep.Strucker, meanwhile, was a leading HYDRA figure who debuted in Sgt. Fury and His Howling Commandos #5 (another work of Kirby and Lee). But he also has a surprising tie to the X-Men line of titles via his genetically altered children Andrea and Andreas Von Strucker. Introduced in Uncanny X-Men #194 by writer Chris Claremont and artist John Romita Jr., the twins were in charge of a white supremacist organization known as Fenris; challenging Storm and Magneto at different times. The pair eventually became involved in a number of villainous organizations like The Upstarts. Sometime later, Andrea died when she discovered Baron Zemo lurking in the body of Citizen V. Andreas would become The Swordsman, eventually dying himself at the hands of Spider-Man foe Norman Osborn. As this is Marvel Comics, both siblings eventually returned to the land of the living and opened Club Fenris, a hotspot for supervillains. Oh, they also love each other very much – in the Targaryen sense.Of course, it is hard to tell what this means for The Gifted. But it is notable that Reed’s children are named Andrea and Andrew. The show also makes an early wink to their comic-book counterparts as Andy draws a wolf in the opening moments. But is it just a wink? Perhaps someone in the Strucker line altered their genetic makeup. The possibilities are almost as thrilling as the pilot episode’s climatic chase scene.7. That RingtoneWhile not a comic book connection, Marco’s ringtone is clearly the theme song from the 1990s X-Men cartoon: the only truly memorable X-Men musical theme ever composed.8. The Logan Connection(Photo by Twentieth Century Fox Film Corporation)Vague references to the Incident, the missing X-Men, the anti-mutants laws and “the Wall” all suggest that The Gifted may be taking place some years before the events of Logan. It is a good X-Men timeline to work from as it closely resembles our own world, yet takes for granted knowledge of things like mutation and the X-Men. It also quickly sweeps away established characters unavailable to the show while giving characters like Polaris and Blink an opportunity to take the spotlight. Though the connection to Logan is unconfirmed, tying The Gifted to that film’s history also makes the various metaphors of mutation that much stronger. If Logan is part of The Gifted’s future, we know the mutants will lose.At the same time, that definite outcome may be the strongest reason for The Gifted to stand on its own while finding great characters and ideas in the source material. Despite 10&nbsp;X-Men feature films, a cable network drama and countless episodes of animated X-Men shows, The Gifted still has enough unexplored comic book lore to mine that it could very well start its own television universe.The Gifted airs Mondays at 9 p.m. on Fox.","section":"Comics on TV","tags":"nfl, Toys","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/09161309/new-x-men-gifted-split-600x314.jpg","slug":"the-gifteds-ties-to-the-x-mens-past"},{"id":"47509103614573","title":"The Boss Barely Beats Batman v Superman","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})The Boss Barely Beats Batman v SupermanZootopia rounds out the top three.by Gitesh Pandya | April 10, 2016 |  CommentsNorth American audiences were split between a new comedy and a holdover super hero smackdown as Melissa McCarthy’s&nbsp;The Boss&nbsp;opened just $45,000 ahead of the third round of&nbsp;Batman v Superman. The race for the number one spot was too close to call with this razor-thin of a margin. Final grosses to be reported on Monday morning will determine the order.But McCarthy’s popular R-rated humor in&nbsp;The Boss&nbsp;attracted the expected audience with an estimated $23.48M for the weekend from 3,480 locations for a good $6,747 average. Universal projected a 42% Saturday-to-Sunday decline while Warner Bros. went with 37% for BvS.Hammered by critics,&nbsp;The Boss&nbsp;still broke $20M which does not always happen with critically-panned R-rated comedies. It was a weaker opening than what the actress has seen with past comedies&nbsp;Identity Thief&nbsp;($34.6M) and&nbsp;The Heat&nbsp;($39.1M) which both had co-stars to promote.&nbsp;The Boss&nbsp;was marketed as a solo vehicle for McCarthy. Audiences were not too pleased as evidenced by the lousy C+ CinemaScore grade signaling a rocky road ahead.Also having a shot at the number one spot was&nbsp;Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice&nbsp;which grossed an estimated $23.44M in its third weekend for an understandable drop of 54%. Warner Bros. has banked $296.7M to date and is on course to finish with about $340M from North America. Second and third weekend drops have been higher on BvS than last year’s Easter opener&nbsp;Furious 7&nbsp;which suffered declines of 60% and 51%.Overseas markets saw a bigger slowdown as the weekend take was $34M dropping a hefty 60%. Competition got heavier as Disney’s&nbsp;The Jungle Book&nbsp;and Universal’s&nbsp;The Huntsman: Winter’s War&nbsp;opened in various territories collecting nearly $50M in business. The international cume for&nbsp;Dawn of Justice&nbsp;is $486.8M and the new worldwide haul sits at $783.5M surpassing recent super hero hits&nbsp;Guardians of the Galaxy,&nbsp;Deadpool,&nbsp;X-Men: Days of Future Past, and&nbsp;Captain America: The Winter Soldier. A final global gross close to $900M still seems likely.Disney’s smash hit&nbsp;Zootopia&nbsp;remained in the top three for a sixth weekend grossing an estimated $14.4M, down just 26%. With $296M to date, the animated blockbuster is hoping to get to the $350M vicinity by the end of its domestic run. Overseas grosses rose to $556.5M boosting the global tally to an incredible $852.5M and it will break the $900M barrier before Japan’s release which begins on April 23. In China,&nbsp;Zootopia&nbsp;has soared to $232.2M allowing it to surpass&nbsp;Avengers: Age of Ultron&nbsp;to become the third biggest Hollywood blockbuster of all-time there behind&nbsp;Furious 7&nbsp;and&nbsp;Transformers: Age of Extinction. This is an astounding performance for an original movie, whether animated or live-action.Universal’s comedy sequel&nbsp;My Big Fat Greek Wedding 2&nbsp;slipped 43% to an estimated $6.4M putting the new sum at $46.8M which is a whopping 81% below the $241.4M final of its 2002 predecessor.Young men failed to turn out for the new ultraviolent action thriller&nbsp;Hardcore Henry&nbsp;which debuted in fifth place with an estimated $5.1M from a very wide 3,015 locations for a puny $1,690 average. Reviews were mixed for the R-rated title from STX and exit polls showed the audience to be 76% male with two-thirds being 17-34. In recent years, this has become one of the most unreliable demographics for action movies not tied to a popular brand.Faith-based hit&nbsp;Miracles from Heaven&nbsp;declined by 34% to an estimated $4.8M and Sony has taken in a solid $53.9M overall. Fellow religion-themed drama&nbsp;God’s Not Dead 2&nbsp;fell 43% after a weak opening to an estimated $4.3M for a cume of $14.1M for Pure Flix.Falling 38% to an estimated $3.6M was&nbsp;The Divergent Series: Allegiant&nbsp;which has collected a disappointing $61.8M thus far in North America. That’s down a troubling 46% from Insurgent at the same point a year ago. The sci-fi pic&nbsp;10 Cloverfield Lane&nbsp;dropped a reasonable 34% in its fifth weekend to an estimated $3M putting Paramount at $68M to date. Helen Mirren spent another weekend in the top ten with her military pic&nbsp;Eye in the Sky&nbsp;which made an estimated $2.8M, off 29%, for a new total of $10.4M for Bleecker Street.Opening poorly outside the top ten was the Jake Gyllenhaal drama&nbsp;Demolition&nbsp;with an estimated $1.1M from 854 locations for a poor $1,317 average. The Fox Searchlight release did not fair well with critics earning lackluster reviews and paying audiences were not too pleased either.The top ten films grossed an estimated $91.3M which was down 26% from last year when&nbsp;Furious 7&nbsp;stayed at number one with $59.6M; and down 30% from 2014 when&nbsp;Captain America: The Winter Soldier&nbsp;remained in the top spot with $41.3M.","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"All, Office, Larson, marvel, TV, Mirror, Network, Dark, reboot, obituary, Endgame","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/06201434/TheBossCC.jpg","slug":"boss-barely-beats-batman-v-superman"},{"id":"47508683310915","title":"Green Arrow and the Canaries Star Katherine McNamara Teases Mia Smoak’s New Vigilante Role","content":"Comics On TVvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Green Arrow and the Canaries Star Katherine McNamara Teases Mia Smoak's New Vigilante RoleWith the loss of Oliver Queen still fresh, McNamara teases the direction the Arrowverse story will take with CW's new backdoor pilot.by Aaron Pruner | January 21, 2020 |  CommentsAs the series end to Arrow looms, the characters in the Arrowverse, as well as the program’s huge fanbase, were dealt an emotional blow when Oliver Queen (Stephen Amell) sacrificed his life to save all of humanity. Oliver may have perished several times throughout the series, but his death in the recent crossover event, “Crisis on Infinite Earths,” proved to be his final bow. But all is not lost, though. The show’s penultimate episode, titled “Green Arrow and the Canaries,” not only explores this loss through his daughter, Mia Smoak (Katherine McNamara), it’ll also act as the backdoor pilot for CW’s new superhero series of the same name.Before his death, Oliver passed the vigilante mantle to Mia, naming her the new Green Arrow. With the title, comes a cool new suit, which is all pretty awesome, considering the conflicted relationship Mia had with her father throughout the past two seasons. This is where things get sticky, though. When Oliver Queen saved the world, he created a new Earth-Prime timeline. And in the process, Mia’s memories of her dad and this whole debacle were erased.(Photo by Colin Bentley/The CW)These details will lead the Arrow story into new territory once the second-to-last episode of the series airs. A time-jump to the year 2040 will add distance from the Stephen Amell-led series, giving Mia a chance to live in this new situation — which finds her enjoying the wealthy socialite life up in Queen Mansion. But as much as she voiced distaste for her father’s lifestyle, in the past, we have to wonder: is Green Arrow and the Canaries going to be a like-father, like-daughter situation?How will Oliver Queen’s legacy impact Mia moving forward? Katherine McNamara spoke with Rotten Tomatoes to give further insight into the life of Mia Smoak — we mean, Mia Queen — in the backdoor pilot and new spinoff series.(Photo by Colin Bentley/The CW)Aaron Pruner for Rotten Tomatoes: Shadowhunters ended with Clary losing her memory. Now, after the events that transpired in “Crisis on Infinite Earths,” Mia got her memory wiped. Is this becoming a trend?Katherine McNamara: I am not sure. It’s starting to give me a bit of a complex. What’s funny about it is in the crossover, we were fighting shadow demons and going to purgatory. And then in Shadowhunters, we fought demons and went to hell, and then the memory-wiping and all of this. But, you know it’s fun to find the differences between the two and to also get to, sort of, play out the aftermath of the memory wipe that they didn’t get to do in Shadowhunters.(Photo by Bettina Strauss/The CW)You’re basically picking up the mantle as a show, but also as a character. What are the challenges in continuing the legacy in a universe that was built on Oliver Queen’s story on Arrow?McNamara:&nbsp;Well, it’s a huge responsibility. And I’ve known that since I started playing this character. The fact that Olicity is so beloved, and the fact that Stephen [Amell] and Emily [Bett Rickards] have put so much time and energy and care into their characters, and their relationship on the show … I had my work cut out for me. But that’s also been part of the fun; because there’s such a richness to it. Mia really is the amalgamation of these two characters and getting to find those elements and pull those little mannerisms, and play with that, and grow with that, and see where it takes her has been really fun. And that only continues here. But I’m so grateful for everything that Stephen has built and for the father that he’s been to me in passing the mantle, both as an actor and as a character.(Photo by Katie Yu/The CW)This upcoming episode, as well as the new series, is based on this watershed moment that removes an integral character from the story. How does that impact you as the actor playing&nbsp;Mia? And how does it impact the ending of&nbsp;Arrow&nbsp;and Green Arrow and the Canaries?McNamara:&nbsp;In this episode, in particular, you see that in both iterations of Mia, both before and after she gets her memories back. In this new 2040, you have a Mia Queen who has grown up with the responsibility of being the daughter of the Green Arrow and knowing all of the amazing things that her father has accomplished, wondering how anything she does in her life will ever live up to that. But then she remembers the past and in putting on the suit again and taking up the mantle, she’s constantly reminded of watching her father breathe his last breath and him giving her the suit and all of these things that they went through, together. She wanted more time, she needed to fight with him more and to learn something more. She doesn’t get that.(Photo by Katie Yu/The CW)Is it safe to say that Mia’s working through these unresolved daddy issues by putting on this costume and pursuing the type of vigilante life she used to despise?McNamara:&nbsp;Absolutely, and you see that in episode 9 and you see that in the series finale of Arrow, as well. What’s great about it is you get to see this girl who has all of the capabilities and all of the opportunities at her fingertips. You know, she’s still the same smart, cunning girl that we’ve known, but because she’s never really known any loss in her life and isn’t, you know, a fighter by nature, she hasn’t really found her passion. She hasn’t really found that thing that makes her feel alive. Discovering that through taking on the mantle, and through finding herself in finding the Green Arrow is a really interesting journey.How will Team Arrow evolve in the new series?McNamara:&nbsp;It’s great to see the most unlikely of characters put into these positions. You see Mia, who’s a tiny blonde girl, being this brooding dark vigilante, in a sense. And you get to see her brother who is also the least likely of vigilantes, who takes on the Overwatch position and be the technical side and the smart side of things. You see all of these characters that you wouldn’t expect to be fulfilling these roles and it gives it a different kind of diversity. You still have the same superhero tropes that we all know and love of the dark vigilante. But you get to see that in the least likely of human beings, and it is really fun to kind of turn the classic tropes on its head and provide a fresh perspective, while still playing into the same superhero legacy that everyone loves.RELATED:&nbsp;What’s in Store for The CW Heroes Post-“Crisis”It’s been teased that Deathstroke will be back in Green Arrow and the Canaries, how does Oliver’s death and the passing of time change the threat Deathstroke poses in Star City?McNamara:&nbsp;We’ve seen Deathstroke in many iterations and Deathstroke is always a threat to Star City and always a threat to the Green Arrow.

Read on for details.NEW IN THEATERS&nbsp;Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials (2015)  47%Rating: PG-13, for extended sequences of violence and action, some thematic elements, substance abuse and language.It’s the second movie in the Maze Runner series and pretty standard post-apocalyptic, YA-novel fare, so in theory you know what you’re getting into here. The plucky hero of the first film (Dylan O’Brien) and his friends have escaped the maze, but now they find themselves in even more varied kinds of danger in the outside world. This includes: bad guys holding kids captive, then chasing after and shooting at them; teens being used for creepy medical experiments; squalor in a ravaged city; ravenous, fast-moving zombies in an abandoned shopping mall; and large-scale shootouts. There’s also a long party scene in which revelers drink something that looks like absinthe and makes them hallucinate. Plus, there’s just the general, all-consuming oppression of life in a dystopian future – but that exists in all these movies, so the target audience should be used to it by now. OK for tweens and older.Everest (2015)  73%Rating: PG-13, for intense peril and disturbing images.Basically the point of this movie is: Don’t climb Mt. Everest. You won’t make it up to the top, and if you do, you probably won’t make it back down. And even if you do make it back down, you’ll probably have frostbite. The visuals are spectacular, though, especially if you can see it in IMAX 3-D. An all-star cast including Jason Clarke, John Hawkes, Jake Gyllenhaal and Josh Brolin brave the elements in this harrowing recreation of a real-life, ill-fated trek up the mountain in 1996. Keira Knightley and Robin Wright are among the women waiting and worrying for them back home. The characters struggle and suffer in disturbing ways, and not everyone makes it out alive. Amid the striking imagery, director Baltasar Kormakur also shows us dead, frozen bodies in the snow. My son (who’s almost 6) was curious about Everest, though, so I brought him with me to a screening and he did fine. This should be suitable for older kids and up.Pawn Sacrifice (2015)  71%Rating: PG-13, for brief strong language, some sexual content and historical smoking.Tobey Maguire stars as the famously brilliant (and notoriously paranoid) chess champion Bobby Fischer. Director Edward Zwick’s film focuses on his matches against his rival, Russian champion Boris Spassky (Liev Schreiber), which served as a reflection of U.S.-Soviet tension at the height of the Cold War. There’s quite a bit of language here; Fischer frequently went on rants, which included anti-Semitic sentiment. There’s also the suggestion that he lost his virginity to a flirty young woman he met at a motel, but all you see is the two of them lying in bed together afterward. And everyone smokes all the time. It was the ‘70s, after all. It might be a little boring for younger viewers at nearly two hours; plus, two people engaging in such an internal, cerebral battle isn’t necessarily the most thrilling activity to watch. But if you have kids in your house who are interested in chess, they might enjoy this and will probably learn something.NEW ON DVD&nbsp;Cinderella (2015)  83%Rating: PG,&nbsp;for mild thematic elements.Perhaps you’ve heard this story before: A sweet young woman, tortured and abused by her evil stepmother and stepsisters, enjoys an enchanted (but brief) evening with a handsome prince, only to scurry off mysteriously at midnight. Director Kenneth Branagh tells this classic fairy tale in rather straightforward, live-action fashion — there’s no self-referential irony, no transformation of Cinderella (Lily James) into a sword-wielding warrior princess — but his film is lively and visually sumptuous. Cate Blanchett is formidable as Cinderella’s stepmother but there’s an actual explanation for the origin of her cruelty. Parents die, as is always the case in such stories, so there are a few heavy, emotional moments. Mainly, though, this is a solid way to introduce kids to this enduring story. My 5-year-old son said he thought it was “boring,” but the little girl who came with us to the screening absolutely loved it. I recommend it highly for all ages.Disneynature Monkey Kingdom (2015)  93%Rating: GThe cute factor is high in the latest film from Disney’s Disneynature branch, which releases a family-friendly documentary nearly every year in April around Earth Day. This time, the cameras follow a community of macaque monkeys living in the jungle in Sri Lanka. Among them are Raja, the alpha male; a trio of regal females known as the Sisterhood; and the story’s heroine, Maya, a lowborn who becomes a mother and unlikely leader. Children will delight in their playful antics, and they won’t notice that some of them clearly have been staged, including a siege on a kid’s birthday party when the monkeys travel to a nearby town. But because this is a Disney movie, there is peril, too. A monitor lizard preys on them as they seek food in a lily pond. And when a rival band of monkeys fights them for control of the rock that’s been their longtime home, there are casualties — but nothing nearly so brutal as the zebra attack in 2011’s &nbsp;African Cats. Also: Maya’s baby, Kip, is kidnapped briefly, but the two are reunited. This is totally fine for all ages.Furious 7 (2015)  82%Rating: PG-13,&nbsp;for prolonged frenetic sequences of violence, action and mayhem, suggestive content and brief strong language.It’s the seventh film in the blockbuster Fast and Furious&nbsp;franchise, so if you’ve seen any of the previous movies, you know what you’re in for here — only the gravity-defying chases, crashes and stunts are even bigger and more insane than usual. Cars drop from planes, float beneath parachutes and fly between skyscrapers. They smash into each other at alarming speeds and tumble down craggy cliffs. Explosions and gunfire abound, some of which result in characters’ deaths. In between the big set pieces, Vin Diesel and his crew engage in brutal fistfights with enemies of various ethnicities. There’s also quite a bit of language as well as scantily clad women dancing and grinding into each other in cartoonish, music-video fashion. It’s all over-the-top, silly fun, but it’s also probably best suited for mature tweens and older.","section":"Parental Guidance","tags":"FXX, Shondaland, movie, Television, Network, Lifetime, potter, toronto, nbcuniversal, Paramount, Review, Set, comedies, boxing, TLC","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/MazeRunnerScorchTrials.jpg","slug":"parental-guidance-how-family-friendly-are-maze-runner-the-scorch-trials-everest-and-pawn-sacrifice"},{"id":"47612622427427","title":"Character Face-Off: The Best Version of 15 Mega Popular Movie and TV Characters","content":"Newsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Character Face-Off: The Best Version of 15 Mega Popular Movie and TV CharactersMore Mulan, Tinker Bell, Robin Hood, He-Man, Batman, Spider-Man and more are coming, but which is the best?by Fred Topel | July 21, 2018 |  Comments(Photo by © Warner Bros.)Neil Blomkamp is reassembling RoboCop,&nbsp;Joaquin Phoenix is getting his own Joker movie, and Robin is about to lead the Titans on streaming. That’s the great thing about our favorite characters: they’re never really gone – someone new can always bring them back. But how many of these adaptations really capture what we love about our favorite characters? And which adaptations do it best?To find out, we&nbsp;took a deep look at 15 characters who have had at least five different versions of them made, and which have current or upcoming adaptations on the way. For some who’ve had dozens (thanks to public domain), we&nbsp;stuck to the 10 most famous versions. If a role was just recast during the same series – as opposed to a wholly new take – we counted them together. For each character, we also found their highest Tomatometer-rated portrayal – the ultimate arbiter of which version is the best (and likely the ultimate argument-starter among those who disagree!).RoboCop(Photo by © Orion/courtesy Everett Collection)Number of RoboCops: 6All the RoboCops: Original Trilogy (Peter Weller/Robert Burke), 1988 animated series (voice of Dan Hennessey), 1994 RoboCop TV Series (Richard Eden), RoboCop: Prime Directives TV series (Page Fletcher), 2014 RoboCop (Joel Kinnaman), Neil Blomkamp RoboCop (TBD)The Best RoboCop: RoboCop (1987)  90%No surprise, the original 1987 RoboCop is still rated highest.

To celebrate those works and mark Pride month, we asked a number of Tomatometer-approved critics to reflect on the LGBTQ movies that influenced their lives and their work.&nbsp;One of the great challenges transgender people face is learning to deal with those who think we deserve to be treated differently because of who we are. For some, facing this idea that universal human rights are not actually meant to be universal can lead to outrage. In Sebastián Lelio’s A Fantastic Woman, protagonist Marina meets the challenge again and again as she is put in positions that undermine not only her gender identity, but also her basic dignity as a human being. As we follow her, the film offers a painstakingly authentic portrayal of transgender life.Too often, transgender narratives in film center themselves on the mechanics of transition, placing great emphasis on the pain of a soul in conflict with the nature of its being. A Fantastic Woman is a film set after all of that dust has settled, starring a transgender woman firmly settled in her post-transition world. Marina thrives in her new environment, able to share her talents as a singer in Santiago, Chile on he­r terms, presenting as the individual she always knew herself to be. She shares her life with her partner, Orlando, an older man with an open heart and a thirst for life.Daniela Vega and Francisco Reyes in A Fantastic Woman. (Photo by Sony Pictures Classics/Everett Collection)The conflict in A Fantastic Woman comes not from Marina’s inner turmoil, but from the prejudice of others. Orlando’s sudden death from a brain aneurysm brings out the worst in his family, who treat Marina as an abomination; to them, their relationship is proof that he must have been suffering from dementia. The police similarly view their relationship with suspicion, harassing Marina at work and subjecting her to invasive bodily inspections as she struggles to cope with her sudden loss. Of all the many ways transgender people find rejection from society at large, the idea that Marina would not even be allowed to grieve with dignity strikes at the core of injustice.Daniela Vega as Marina in A Fantastic Woman. (Photo by Sony Pictures Classics/Everett Collection)Lead actress Daniela Vega, in just her second film role, makes a strong case for the power of casting transgender people in trans roles. Marina pushes back on the various indignities she’s expected to endure with resounding grace, acknowledging the realities of her situation but never backing down even after being physically assaulted. Vega’s subtle expressions speak volumes as she stares bigotry square in the face, and refuses to stay away from the wake or funeral. A cisgender actor can ponder the meaning of the “trapped in the wrong body” trope, but Vega carries herself as a woman who knows what it’s like to have someone try and strip you of your humanity.Director Sebastián Lelio accepts Best Foreign Language Film for A Fantastic Woman with cast/crew onstage at the 90th Annual Academy Awards. (Photo by Photo by Kevin Winter/Getty Images)A Fantastic Woman, which won the Oscar for Best Foreign Language Film at last year’s Academy Awards, is a powerful testament to the universality of the transgender experience. The hardships that Marina endured in Chile are uncomfortably similar to many of my own here in America. A transgender person’s romantic relationships are subject to so many unnecessary lines of inquiry by a world that too often refuses to accept the normalcy of our existence. Throughout the world, we live, we love, and we prosper each and every day.The onslaught of transphobia that Marina faces throughout the film is an unnecessary fact of life for many of us, and A Fantastic Woman triumphs through Marina’s resiliency despite her circumstances. Transgender people live life fully aware that bigotry cannot be vanquished overnight – we just want a chance to find some sense of happiness.Ian Thomas Malone is an author and podcast host based out of Long Beach, California.

Since 1965, the Frank Herbert epic has been a bewitching vision shared between the minds of adventurous readers, worming deep into the psyche of grand science-fiction devotees. Of course, Villeneuve stands out among Dune fans – he’s the first one in decades who gets to turn the novel into a movie. Like the book, it will follow the path of royal Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet), his training in psychokinetic arts, and his family’s arrival to rule desert planet Arrakis, the galaxy’s sole source of a powerful mineral mixture called spice.Dune will release December 2020, but if you need those inhospitable desert fumes in your life now, you can watch Villeneuve’s Blade Runner 2049. Get to the Las Vegas sequence and pretend that’s Arrakis wind and sand whipping your face. (The surrounding movie’s pretty good, too.) Or just go straight to the well and watch the previous movie version of Dune, directed in 1984 by David Lynch. He’s essentially disowned the film, but it’s a well-meaning attempt, rendered mostly incomprehensible by the end if you’re not familiar with the book – exactly why Villeneuve’s Dune will be split into two movies. Dune has long stymied filmmakers (it was actually done decently on TV with the 2000 miniseries), and you’ll get the behind-the-scenes treatment of a noble but failed adaptation inside the wonderful documentary Jodorowsky’s Dune.Dune towers within the space opera: A genre of sci-fi adventure where pulpy action and plot twists rule the stars, with frequent space and military battles, and streaks of sweeping romance. More space operas from movie history include The Chronicles of Riddick, The Last Starfighter, Flash Gordon, The Fifth Element (there’s a literal opera in this), Serenity, and Battle Beyond the Stars, featuring special effects by James Cameron.We all know about the impact of Flash Gordon and The Hidden Fortress on George Lucas when thinking up his own space opera, Star Wars. Dune‘s influence fills out the rest. The Force is akin to Dune‘s own all-encompassing mystic system, and Tatooine is essentially a stand-in for Arrakis. So we’re including A New Hope here, even though you’ve already seen it. We hope.John Carter and Stargate are more in the realm of space fantasies, but the action and arid settings match. Ditto the Earthly, apocalyptic Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome. While there are obviously better movies in the series, it’s inside Thunderdome&nbsp;where Max is sculpted as a messianic figure, the type of imagery central to the Dune arc.If space military operations are more your thing, engage with the sleek Ender’s Game,&nbsp;or violent propaganda satire Starship Troopers. And if you like what Dune dishes on ecological and environmental notions (with a potential side of giant sand critters), eat up the hippie-dippie Silent Running along with Hayao Miyazaki’s early masterpiece Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind.On animation: The medium has long opened eyes to whole new worlds, like Disney’s underseen Treasure Planet. Or the trippy French classic Fantastic Planet. And even the full-length Daft Punk cosmic fantasy Interstella 5555, produced by Leiji Matsumoto, godfather of the animated space opera. His epic movies like Arcadia of My Youth and the two Galaxy Express films don’t have Tomatometers so we didn’t include them, but they’re currently streaming on Amazon Prime.#20The Chronicles of Riddick (2004) 29%#20Adjusted Score: 33.53% Critics Consensus: As an action movie, Riddick offers some thrills, but as a sequel to Pitch Black, it's a disappointment.Synopsis: Vin Diesel returns as the nocturnally gifted antihero Riddick in this sequel to the 2000 cult item Pitch Black.

With that in mind,&nbsp;our list of digital and streming new releases this week includes a&nbsp;fantasy adventure adaptation on Disney+, Spike Lee’s latest joint on Netflix, and a Judd Apatow dramedy on VOD. See below for details.Artemis Fowl (2020)  8%On paper,&nbsp;Artemis Fowl sounds like the kind of film best suited for the big screen: It’s a special effects-driven fantasy spectacle based on a series of popular young adult novels&nbsp;populated by magical creatures, and it was helmed by a big-name director (Kenneth Branagh). And the big screen is exactly where it was headed before the coronavirus pandemic changed everything, so it was probably a bad sign when Disney decided not to reschedule its theatrical debut and delivered it straight to streaming instead. That brings us to this week, as Disney+ subscribers are now able to watch&nbsp;Artemis Fowl from the comfort of their couches, and critics who have seen it say that was probably a smart move by the Mouse House. Newcomer Ferdia Shaw stars as the precocious titular 12-year-old, the genius son of a criminal mastermind (Colin Farrell) who has been abducted and imprisoned by a gang of fairies for his past crimes. With the help of his servant, a dwarf informant, and a fairy police officer he has himself kidnapped, Artemis sets out to rescue his father and take hold of his destiny. This is yet another attempt to capture the Y.A.-based fantasy audience that made the&nbsp;Harry Potter franchise such a hit, but critics say&nbsp;Artemis Fowl is a poor imitation of its source material that completely misses what made it interesting in the first place and chooses the most bland route possible en route to a destination that never arrives. In other words, it feels like a half-hearted attempt to jump-start a franchise, and its lack of soul proves to be its undoing. But hey, if you want to see Dame Judi Dench as an Irish fairy, you’ve come to the right place.Available&nbsp;now on:&nbsp;Disney+Da 5 Bloods (2020)  92%The ongoing protests in the wake of George Floyd’s death echo the concerns African-Americans have been struggling with for decades, if not centuries, and if there’s one modern director who has spent significant screentime examining those concerns from different angles, it’s Spike Lee. With that in mind, it’s exceedingly fitting that this week sees the release of his latest film,&nbsp;Da 5 Bloods, an action-drama that couches a heist adventure within an earnest exploration of the Black&nbsp;experience in America. The film stars Delroy Lindo, Clarke Peters, Norm Lewis, and Isiah Whitlock Jr. as four aging Vietnam veterans who return to the country both to retrieve the remains of their fallen squad leader (Chadwick Boseman)&nbsp;and to reclaim a stash of hidden gold for themselves. Their journey takes unexpected turns, of course, and the old friends are forced to reckon not only with their collective past, but also with the kinds of men America and the war has made them. Critics say&nbsp;Da 5 Bloods is a remarkably timely effort that makes some interesting choices and drives home the perpetual urgency of its message, but it also takes a few unexpected turns along the way.&nbsp;On top of all that, most agree that Lindo delivers a&nbsp;standout performance here,&nbsp;inspiring&nbsp;some&nbsp;of the first awards-season chatter of the year.Available now&nbsp;on:&nbsp;NetflixThe King of Staten Island (2020)  75%Saturday Night Live star Pete Davidson is known for often candidly referencing his own personal struggles and relationship troubles in his comedy, so it’s not surprising that he mined his own life experiences to co-write&nbsp;The King of Staten Island with director Judd Apatow. At the same time, Apatow himself is no stranger to stories of arrested development, which makes him a great fit here. The story revolves around a 24-year-old layabout named Scott (Davidson) whose father — like Davidson’s — was a firefighter who died in the line of duty during the 9/11 attacks. Suffering from the trauma of that memory, Scott still lives at home with his mother and spends most of his time getting high with his stoner buddies, but when mom starts dating another firefighter,&nbsp;he’s suddenly forced to reckon with his past and maybe, finally, move on. Critics say&nbsp;The King of Staten Island is a fairly effective vehicle for Davidson, who showcases a lot of heart and emotion in a role that, for obvious reasons, comes quite naturally to him. Some feel that Apatow’s more indulgent tendencies — like the film’s bloated running time — only serve to undermine the story’s dramatic impact, but overall, it’s still generates a lot of laughs and features a stellar supporting cast that includes Marisa Tomei, Bill Burr, Steven Buscemi, Bel Powley, among others.Available now&nbsp;on:&nbsp;FandangoNOW,&nbsp;Vudu,&nbsp;Amazon,&nbsp;Google Play,&nbsp;iTunesThumbnail image by&nbsp;Disney+","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"Festival, Martial, King, shows, deadpool","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/12031948/Artemis_Fowl_CC_Rep.jpg","slug":"artemis-fowl-da-5-bloods-and-the-king-of-staten-island-hit-digital-release-this-week"},{"id":"47508965235054","title":"Definitive Sandra Bullock Movies","content":"Total Recallvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Definitive Sandra Bullock MoviesIn this week's Total Recall, we take a look at the films that helped define the career of the Our Brand Is Crisis Starby Jeff Giles | October 28, 2015 |  CommentsHer rise to fame in the mid 1990s was followed by a box office drought so profound that it was hard not to wonder if she’d ever find her way out of it – but the 21st century has been pretty good to Sandra Bullock so far, granting her successes both commercial (Miss Congeniality, The Proposal)&nbsp;and critical (Crash, Gravity). To celebrate that resurgence, as well as the arrival of her latest release, the political dramedy Our Brand Is Crisis, we decided to devote this week’s Total Recall to a look back at 10 of Ms. Bullock’s most essential films!Demolition Man (1993)  60%The year before Speed&nbsp;turned her into a household name, Sandra Bullock scored a supporting role in Demolition Man, a future-set, Joel Silver-produced action extravaganza that pitted Sylvester Stallone against Wesley Snipes in a battle so big that even Sting showed up for the soundtrack. (Possibly just for the opportunity to repurpose an old Police tune as a solo track, but still.) As corrections officer Lenina Huxley, Bullock gave Stallone his most adorably diminutive co-star since Estelle Getty in Stop! Or My Mom Will Shoot&nbsp;— and her character’s fascination with icky 20th-century culture helped inject a touch of relatability (and, let’s face it, sex appeal) into what would otherwise have been just your garden-variety blockbuster about two impossibly built dudes blowing stuff up as they try to kill each other with the fate of the world hanging in the balance. While not a classic by any stretch, Demolition Man&nbsp;lived up to the mayhem implied in its title, increased Bullock’s profile at the box office, and earned begrudging approval from critics like Chris Hicks of the Deseret News, who wrote, “with Snipes giving his role everything he’s got — a considerable amount by any measure — and with some amusing bits tying together the action scenes, there is plenty of eye candy at work here, which should satisfy action fans.”Watch TrailerSpeed (1994)  94%It shouldn’t have worked, really. Six years after Die Hard, audiences had been subjected to variations of its wildly successful theme that transplanted the action everywhere from a boat (Under Siege) to a mountain (Cliffhanger), and by the time Speed&nbsp;came along, the news that it was “Die Hard&nbsp;on a bus” should have kept moviegoers away in droves. But a funny thing happened instead: Speed&nbsp;turned out to be a lot of fun, not only for the audiences who bought $350 million in tickets, but most critics, too. One of the year’s most successful films, Speed&nbsp;acted as a cinematic coming-out party for Bullock, who stars as a bus passenger roped into helping SWAT explosives expert Jack Traven (Keanu Reeves) figure out how to outwit a maniac (Dennis Hopper) who has wired the vehicle with a bomb that will detonate if the bus dips below 50 mph. Though not a few critics were quick to point out the film’s various plot holes, the direction (courtesy of Die Hard&nbsp;cinematographer Jan de Bont) and script (featuring work from an uncredited Joss Whedon) were set to run with such mechanical precision that the movie only needed a pair of charismatic leads to make it work. Reeves and Bullock worked so well together that the leftover goodwill they generated was enough to sell over $100 million in tickets to The Lake House&nbsp;eight years later — but instead of blaming them for that mess, let’s focus on the words of Peter Travers, who counted himself as an early Bullock supporter in his review of Speed: “The smart and sassy Bullock is a knockout. She makes us believe the impossible things Annie is doing and, better, makes us care.”Watch TrailerWhile You Were Sleeping (1995)  80%When you’re hot, you’re hot — and in the mid 1990s, Sandra Bullock was on a roll, going from 1994’s Speed&nbsp;to While You Were Sleeping&nbsp;in 1995, and vaulting herself into something like Meg Ryan/Julia Roberts status in the America’s Sweetheart sweepstakes. Though many of the script choices she’d make immediately following this period slowed her career momentum considerably, Sleeping&nbsp;was an enjoyably frothy, perfectly timed scoop of romantic comedy that did such a fine job of highlighting Bullock’s strengths that it might as well have been written for her. Though critics hastened to point out the relatively mindless nature of the script (Janet Maslin of the New York Times murmured that it “has the kind of good cheer and fine tuning that occasionally give slickness a good name”), Bullock’s winsome turn as a lovelorn fare collector on the Chicago el was too much for them to resist — even when packaged with the silly plot and oh-so-Hollywood happy ending. As the Chicago Reader’s Jonathan Rosenbaum put it, “The film’s casual warmth may make you tolerate some of the shortcomings — especially since Bullock seems to be having such a fine time with her first starring role.”Watch TrailerA Time to Kill (1996)  68%Bullock was given top billing in this 1996 adaptation of John Grisham’s first novel, but that was just a ruse; the film’s true star, future noted bongo enthusiast Matthew McConaughey, was a virtual unknown when he was cast, and although a mountain of buzz piled up around him before A Time to Kill&nbsp;was released, it’s easy to understand why Warner Bros. chose to emphasize Bullock and Samuel L. Jackson in the movie’s marketing materials. And okay, so Sandra Bullock isn’t really the star of A Time to Kill, but she is rather integral to the plot; she does, after all, play the young, passionate law student who strong-arms McConaughey’s character into letting her help him represent Samuel L. Jackson against the double murder charges he faces after gunning down his daughter’s rapists in the county courthouse — and it’s her character’s predilection for wearing relatively immodest garb that gives Kill&nbsp;a little distaff eye candy to supplement McConaughey’s baby blues and toned pecs. It’s a pretty good movie, too, at least according to 67 percent of Tomatometer critics; though the praise wasn’t universal (TV Guide called it “craven offal”), for the most part, Kill&nbsp;fared better with scribes than you’d expect for a Grisham adaptation. Despite a racially charged premise that some found troublesome (or even offensive), the movie’s sheer entertainment value was prized by writers like the New York Times’ Janet Maslin, who wrote, “if the film doesn’t add up to a cogent legal argument, neither does it have trouble delivering 2 hours and 20 minutes’ worth of sturdy, highly charged drama.”Watch TrailerMiss Congeniality (2000)  41%The late 1990s weren’t particularly kind to Sandra Bullock’s filmography. Although many of her movies made money, critical praise proved increasingly hard to come by as she wavered between big-budget misfires like Speed 2&nbsp;and well-meaning failures like 28 Days, and when she signed on for Miss Congeniality&nbsp;to play an FBI agent who infiltrates a beauty pageant in order to bust up a bomb threat, it seemed like she might have finally reached her nadir. But in the capable hands of Mystic Pizza&nbsp;director Donald Petrie — and bolstered by a generally impeccable cast that also included Michael Caine and Candice Bergen — the final product proved just the sort of well-assembled, cheerfully undemanding fare that audiences were looking for over the Christmas holiday in 2000. Miss Congeniality&nbsp;wasn’t exactly a critical hit, but it earned more than $200 million at the box office and netted Bullock a Golden Globe, signaling that while the pundits weren’t always on her side, she was very much still a star. “Sandra Bullock is in a class of her own and it’s only partly a matter of beauty,” wrote Jules Brenner for Cinema Signals. “Perhaps the larger part is that shining, irresistible personality that lights a room, a runway, a silver screen. She can get you interested in the phone directory.”Watch TrailerCrash (2004)  74%A decade after rising to prominence as the adorably perky star of perfectly undemanding action movies and romantic comedies, Sandra Bullock tested her dramatic mettle as a member of the ensemble cast of Paul Haggis’ Crash, a drama whose depiction of race relations in 21st-century Los Angeles sparked almost as many debates as it won awards. Hopscotching between seemingly disparate storylines, Haggis utilized a long list of actors — some of whom were familiar to fans of thought-probing indie fare (Don Cheadle, Terrence Howard), and some who… weren’t. Landing squarely on the latter list was Bullock, who appeared as the racially prejudiced wife of the L.A. district attorney (played by Brendan Fraser). It would ultimately go down as one of the more controversial Best Picture winners in Oscar history, but before all the awards and the controversy, Crash&nbsp;helped Bullock break out of a long career rut — and helped prove she was still capable of holding her own against thespians known more for their acting than their ability to provide a pleasant distraction on date night. Though many critics were less than impressed with Crash&nbsp;(Andrew Sarris waved it off as “too facile”), the majority opinion was echoed by Roger Ebert, who wrote, “Haggis writes with such directness and such a good ear for everyday speech that the characters seem real and plausible after only a few words. His cast is uniformly strong; the actors sidestep cliches and make their characters particular.”Watch TrailerInfamous (2006)  74%Like Volcano&nbsp;and Deep Impact&nbsp;before it, Douglas McGrath’s Truman Capote biopic Infamous&nbsp;suffered from poor timing, arriving in the shadow of a better-known film about the same subject. The better-known film, in this case, was Capote, which had already earned Philip Seymour Hoffman a Best Actor Academy Award by the time Infamous debuted in the fall of 2006 — and since both films told roughly the same story, revisiting Capote’s relationship with accused murderer Perry Smith, critics were more or less bound to compare the two. On that front, it’s safe to say Capote&nbsp;emerged the victor, earning a 90 percent Tomatometer rating to Infamous‘ 73 percent — but Infamous&nbsp;collected plenty of positive reviews of its own, including a number that compared the cast favorably to its Capote counterparts. Christy Lemire of the Deseret News singled out Bullock in particular, calling her “the real discovery here — or rather, the rediscovery,” while the Wall Street Journal’s Joe Morgenstern went further, writing that “the film benefits from three splendid performances: Toby Jones as Capote, an aggressively gay elf exuding a tosspot charm; Sandra Bullock as Nelle Harper Lee, a novelist who uses spoken words with quiet precision, and Daniel Craig as Perry.”Watch TrailerThe Blind Side (2009)  66%Make movies long enough, and you’ll get your shot at starring in an inspirational sports drama; with 2009’s The Blind Side, Bullock took that ball and ran with it all the way to more than $300 million at the box office — as well as an Oscar, a Golden Globe, and a SAG Award. Inspired by Michael Lewis’ nonfiction book about the evolution of the offensive left tackle position — particularly the portion focusing on future NFL player Michael Oher’s poverty-stricken upbringing and subsequent adoption by a married couple who helped him along the way — The Blind Side&nbsp;overcame generally lukewarm reviews while snowballing into a relatively slow-building word-of-mouth success that shattered records for football films, sports dramas, and movies toplined by a sole female star, definitively opening a new chapter in Bullock’s career along the way. While its real-life accuracy has been called into question, and the overall narrative hews uncomfortably close to “white savior” stereotypes for many viewers, The Blind Side&nbsp;wields its formula as expertly as any movie in the genre; as J.R. Jones argued for the Chicago Reader, “As a fable about the power of giving, it hits pretty hard.”Watch TrailerThe Heat (2013)  66%We’ve seen so many buddy-cop comedies that it’s easy to assume there are no longer any fresh twists for filmmakers to wring out of the concept, but with 2013’s The Heat, director Paul Feig added a veneer of originality by performing a gender swap on the traditionally male-dominated genre. Of course, any buddy-cop adventure is only as good as its buddies, and Feig had a couple of ringers — The Heat&nbsp;paired Bullock (playing the uptight, by-the-book partner) with Melissa McCarthy (playing the loudmouthed slob she’s saddled with), creating what looked on paper like it had to be the mismatched comedy duo of the year. That stellar casting, coupled with the welcome distaff twist, may have cursed the movie with unreasonable expectations; although most critics enjoyed the end result, many couldn’t help wishing for more subversive laughs and a little less formula. “There’s no getting away from the fact that The Heat&nbsp;is lightweight and derivative, but its formulas have been freshened just enough to make it fun,” wrote Forrest Hartman for the Reno Gazette-Journal. “With Melissa McCarthy and Sandra Bullock on board, that’s enough.”Watch TrailerGravity (2013)  95%It takes incredible amounts of luck, hard work, and talent to land a starring role in a movie. To score a gig where you’re pretty much alone on screen for the duration of the film? That’s really&nbsp;special. Bullock entered that elite club with Alfonso Cuarón’s Gravity, playing an astronaut who finds herself horrifyingly marooned in space after a series of mishaps sends her mission spiraling further and further out of control — a role that allowed her the opportunity to deliver a masterclass in solo dramatic acting while serving as the audience’s constant companion in a film that runs the gamut from big-budget visual thrills to quiet moments of one-on-one (or one-on-none) drama. A critical and commercial smash, Gravity&nbsp;earned almost universal acclaim while racking up more than $700 million at the box office — and an impressive 10 Oscar nominations (including Best Actress for Bullock). Wherever her career goes from here, Bullock can stay secure in the knowledge that she was offered an incredible chance to carry a film almost completely on her shoulders, and she pulled it off with aplomb. “Believe the hype,” wrote Christy Lemire, adding, “Gravity&nbsp;is as jaw-droppingly spectacular as you’ve heard — magnificent from a technical perspective but also a marvel of controlled acting and precise tone.”Watch Trailer","section":"Total Recall","tags":"Trophy, Vudu, e., australia, Christmas, football, BBC, comedy, Swim","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/28223000/SandraBullock.jpg","slug":"total-recall-sandra-bullocks-best-movies"},{"id":"47508859034021","title":"Five Favorite Films with Werner Herzog","content":"Five Favorite Filmsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Five Favorite Films with Werner HerzogThe director of Bad Lieutenant: Port of Call New Orleans talks about his wild career.by Tim Ryan | November 17, 2009 |  CommentsDuring his remarkable 40-year career, Werner Herzog has made some of world cinema’s boldest films — including Aguirre, the Wrath of God, Stroszek, Fitzcaraldo, and a remake of Nosferatu. In recent years, he’s approached mainstream success in the United States, with the eccentric documentary Grizzly Man and the Vietnam war film Rescue Dawn, which starred Christian Bale. His latest, Bad Lieutenant: Port of Call New Orleans, features Nicolas Cage and Eva Mendes in the tale of a cop who tries to solve a brutal murder and keep his grip on reality while battling drug addiction, gambling debts, and familial woes.It’s not just the quality of Herzog’s films that’s made him a favorite of movie buffs; Herzog has become legendary for his exploits both on and off the set. He once promised to eat his shoe if Errol Morris ever finished his documentary Gates of Heaven, and followed up on the bet when filming was completed. He was shot by an air rifle on the grounds of his home while doing an interview with the BBC. During the making of Fitzcarraldo, filming was interrupted by a border dispute between Ecuador and Peru; two members of his crew survived plane crashes; his original leading man, Jason Robards, was hospitalized halfway through shooting, and Robards’ replacement, the legendary Klaus Kinski, was so combative on the set that a group of native extras asked Herzog if they could kill him (these and other tales are detailed in Herzog’s documentary, My Best Fiend), and engineers told him it was impossible to pull a steamship over the side of a hill with the system of ropes and pulleys he was using — and Herzog proved them wrong. Even his latest release has generated its share of controversy: Abel Ferrara, the director of the original Bad Lieutenant, said he hoped the makers of Port of Call: New Orleans would die in an explosion — despite the fact that Herzog says the film is not a remake, since he’s never seen Ferrara’s movie.In an interview with Rotten Tomatoes, Herzog shared some of his favorite films, and discussed his attraction to film noir, how his films are “secretly mainstream,” and the differences between working with Nicolas Cage and Klaus Kinski.&nbsp;Freaks (1932,95% Tomatometer)One might be Freaks by Tod Browning. Oh, you just have to look at it. It’s just formidable, it’s phenomenal. You’ve gotta see it. It would take me an hour to explain.Intolerance (1916,95% Tomatometer)Everything that [D.W.] Griffith made: Broken Blossoms, Intolerance, Birth of a Nation, you just name it. Everything. He’s the Shakespeare of cinema. Period. Watch his films and you’ll know instantly.Where Is the Friend’s Home (1989,100% Tomatometer)Some Iranian films, like Where Is the Friend’s Home by Abbas Kiarostami. There’s quite a lot of [great Iranian] films.Rashomon (1950,100% Tomatometer)It is probably the only film that I’ve ever seen which has something like a perfect balance, which does not occur in filmmaking very often. You sense it sometimes in great music, but I haven’t experienced it in cinema, and it’s mind boggling. I don’t know how [Akira] Kurosawa did it. It’s still a mystery to me. That’s greatness.Nosferatu (1922,98% Tomatometer)RT: I wanted to let you know that Rotten Tomatoes released our list of the best reviewed vampire films of all time, and your version of Nosferatu was number three.Werner Herzog: Ah, and which is number one and two?The original Nosferatu…Oh yeah, that has to be number one, of course.…and Let the Right One In.It’s okay. I do not need to occupy number two, three, four, and five.What was the impulse to remake Nosferatu?Well, I needed to connect to the great films of the grandfather generation, because our parents, our father generation, was a complete disaster and many of them sided with the barbarism of the Nazis. Somehow, you can only really make films embedded in the history of your own culture, and history was disrupted dramatically by the most barbaric regime you can ever find anywhere. So for me it was important to get some solid ground under my feet, connect with the grandfathers, connect with the greatest of them, and in my opinion, the greatest of great films is Nosferatu by [F.W.] Murnau, which I should include in the greatest five films of all time.Next, Herzog talks about creating working with Nicolas Cage vs. working with Klaus Kinski, and what he thinks of critics.RT: What initially attracted you to Bad Lieutenant: Port of Call New Orleans?Werner Herzog: Well, it’s funny because I think Rotten Tomatoes was only for audiences venting their anger and their disgust. [laughs] I’m surprised that you’re asking serious questions. No, I can make it short. Number one, shooting in New Orleans. Working with Nicolas Cage, I think it can’t get any better. It was clear very, very quickly that we would do this soon together.While I was watching the film, I couldn’t help but think that Nicolas Cage had some of the same intensity, the sullen eyes, of Klaus Kinski. Was that intentional?No, no. They had nothing to do with each other. Kinski’s so different, we can only say very few in film history who have this kind of presence on the screen and this kind of intensity. Maybe early Marlon Brando, Nicolas Cage, Kinski, and you’re almost at the end of naming others. But, you see, Kinski never had any humor; in Bad Lieutenant: Port of Call New Orleans, it is absolutely hilarious. He’s so vile and so debased that it really connects with an audience, and there’s a very dark humor about it. It’s the most hilarious film you can ever see. When you see Kinski, it’s never hilarious; he’s just driven by whatever. And Nicolas Cage, I told him there’s such a thing as the bliss of evil; that’s what we are heading for.Are you uncomfortable with comparisons between your new work and your older work?No, but what sort of insight would it give us?So you think that each film should be taken on its own.No, not necessarily, because of course, when you look at the films i have made… I just had a big retrospective in Paris as the Centre Pompidou; they showed 56 or so of my films, and all of a sudden you get the feeling that yes, they all belong together somehow. In which way, I don’t know; it’s still mysterious to me. But it’s obvious they belong together.[rtimage]MapID=1209562&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=5&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]You’ve answered a lot of questions about whether or not Bad Lieutenant: Port of Call New Orleans is a remake. Obviously, other than some underlying themes, there aren’t a whole lot of similarities with Abel Ferrara’s film.It’s not a remake. It was simply that one of the producers had the rights to the title, and they hoped for a franchise. I’ve never seen Abel Ferrara’s film, but what is wonderful about moviemaking is that he came out swinging. [laughs] He’s quite a character, apparently. And I enjoy a baseball game where the benches clear and the manager of the team rushes up to the umpire and yells at him from five inches apart, and then steps back and kicks dust — well, you see, that’s baseball, and I love baseball for it. I hardly understand the game, and I hardly follow who is winning and why, but those are the moments that are the greatest joy you can have in a ballpark. And I think it’s similar with show business, with movies. We are into moviemaking, and that’s wonderful — and of course, Ferrara by now apparently has seen the film and has been reconciled. But, whatever, I’ve never met him.So you didn’t take it personally when he came out swinging.No, no, no, because I knew it had nothing to do with his film. But now everybody knows it.Obviously there’s a film noir-ish element to this movie.It’s a real noir, but it’s a new step in film noir.How so?I think film noir, when you look at the late 1940s, early 1950s — Humphrey Bogart and Edward G. Robinson, whom I love, and others, James Cagney — the abyss of the human soul is always something oppressive, oppressive on human beings, oppressive on society, something really dark. And here, there’s a lighter touch to it, something that gets so bad, so debased, so vile, that it’s just completely hilarious. The joy of doing evil. [laughs] And not the feelings of guilt to do evil, and not feeling oppressed by the evil.Your last couple of films have been slightly more Hollywood, or at least within the system to a greater degree. Has that changed your filmmaking process at all?No, I’ve always made mainstream movies. Some of them have been, as I call it, “secretly mainstream.” Let’s say, like Aguirre, the Wrath of God — it’s a film I made in 1971 — that was probably at a time when the parents of those accessing Rotten Tomatoes just left high school, and nobody wanted to see the film at the time. Today, it’s sort of a household name, and it has reached very wide audiences worldwide. So in a way, I think I’ve always been mainstream, and some of the big Hollywood movies seem to me bizarre and marginal in contrast to me, as if I were the center and they were all bizarre and marginal.Bad Lieutenant is a noir, and your next movie, My Son, My Son, What Have Ye Done is a horror film. Are you now trying to play with cinematic form?No, no. You see I never planned a career like others would do. [Movie projects] are coming at me like burglars in the night — uninvited guests, home invasion.[rtimage]MapID=1147830&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=3&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]So making a horror film isn’t some sort of next step. It’s just sort of how it develops.Well, My Son, My Son is based on a long-dormant screenplay that I wrote together with a friend, and the time was right to do it right away, so I made — actually in the last 11 months, I’ve made three films, and I’ve staged an opera in Spain, and I started my Rogue Film School, and I released the English version of Conquest of the Useless, my book [about the making of Fitzcarraldo]. Anyway, so I’m not hectic; I just work steadily and I love what I do. But while we are talking, five or six other films are pushing me already, and I don’t know how to deal with it quickly enough.So what else are you working on?Give me two hours and I’ll tell you. No, there’s quite a few projects pushing me already.Is your approach any different when you’re making a feature film and when you’re making a documentary?In some cases, yes, but let’s face it: Many of my documentaries are feature films in disguise.I’m sure people have asked you this before, but do you ever ask yourself, “Why did this crazy stuff happen while I was making this movie?” Do you think a certain amount of risk is part of the process?Well, if there is a project where you know certain risks are involved, whatever is thrown at you, you have to deal with it, and you have to have the nerve and the courage to do it. But, for example, a film like Bad Lieutenant, I always work like it’s open heart surgery: very focused, very quiet, very quick — as a matter of fact, most of my shooting days were over in the early afternoon, because I only shoot what I really need showing on the screen, so I do not cover all angles and all those kinds of things. But in some projects, of course, I have attracted disasters that were not made or not self-inflicted. When you run into a border war between Peru and Ecuador, you cannot foresee it; nobody foresaw it in my camp that I had built for 1,100 people — mostly native extras — that were attacked and burnt to the ground. And I had two plane crashes. You see, you do not plan a plane crash, and then I had two. For example, I shot the film halfway, and my leading actor became ill, had to be flown out to the United States, and his doctors wouldn’t allow him to return, so we had to start all over again from scratch. So these are things which happen, but you have to cope with it and you have to have the perseverance and the courage to start all over again and finish it anyway. You see, I’m one of those who works and delivers, and I’ve never complained.So there wasn’t any sort of wacky stuff on the set of this one, then. This was a relatively laid back experience.Wacky stuff — you love to hear about these things, I know that. You’re Rotten Tomatoes, and you want to dig into the rotten apple. [laughs] No, I’m joking. What can I say? No, I have done films that had a certain ambition. If you have to put a huge steamboat over a mountain in the Amazon jungle, you know this is going to be complicated, there will be difficulties, there will be technical setbacks, there will be whatever. But once you are going for it, there is a point of no return. You have to take on whatever is going to come at you.[rtimage]MapID=1169393&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=25&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]What did the shoe taste like?I do not remember. I only remember that we stuffed it with a lot of garlic, and since I cooked it in duck fat, which was the main course at Chez Panisse, this famous restaurant in the Bay Area, but the duck fat actually heats at much higher temperatures than water when it boils, but it made the leather shrink, and it became tougher and tougher, and I could only eat it by cutting it in little pieces with a pair of poultry shears. So in order to swallow it down, I think I had at least or more than a six pack of beer to gulp it down. I only remember that I was pretty drunk after this whole thing, and I don’t remember much of the taste. The actual taste was more beer than anything.Do you ever miss working with Kinski?No. We made five films and as I said quite a few times, every grey hair on my head I call Kinski. [chuckles] No, it was also wonderful to work with him, even though he was the biggest of all pestilences, and I mean borderline paranoid, and throwing hysterical tantrums three, four, five times a day. But I always knew it was worthwhile, because he was such a tremendously gifted man. He had the grace of God upon him. Nicolas Cage is one of those who has some sort of grace upon him, and you don’t know where it comes from. There are few people who have it.You’ve never had much of a use for the academic or critical side of cinema, right?No, no, no. Of course not. Why should I? It doesn’t make a film better or worse. A good review doesn’t make a film better, and a bad review doesn’t make it into a bad film if it has substance, you see. Aguirre, the Wrath of God was voted the worst film of the decade in Germany. Back then I had the feeling, “They’re all wrong! They’re idiots! They’re all wrong!” But I’ve really never worried. I don’t worry about being exposed to the vitriolic sort of attacks upon me. I’m ready to take them on.The film critic Lotte Eisner told you to keep going after some of your early films didn’t get the love you’d hoped for…It wasn’t love. They were utterly, completely, desperately ignored, and nobody ever came! So she was a really encouraging voice. She kept me going for a decade by making a strong statement. And I travelled on foot from Munich to Paris when she was dying — I wouldn’t allow her to die. I walked, like, in a pilgrimage, and when I arrived she was out of the hospital. She lived another eight years until she was almost 90!I know I’m not the first, and I won’t be the last, to ask you about some of these things that have happened to you. Do you ever tire of telling these old stories?No, I haven’t spoken about Lotte Eisner for at least a decade. It just came to mind.

We hear it all the time, but George Clooney is living proof that perseverance pays off: Despite the inauspicious beginnings of a career that threatened to pigeonhole him as a Ted McGinley-style supporting player on fading sitcoms, he’s risen to the ranks of Hollywood’s highest-paid actors, and has appeared in some of the last decade’s most critically and commercially successful films. This fall, Clooney surfaces in three major releases: Wes Anderson’s Fantastic Mr. Fox, Jason Reitman’s Up in the Air, and The Men Who Stare at Goats, opening this weekend. If that kind of star power doesn’t deserve the Total Recall treatment, what does?[tomatometer]MuzeID=1153345[/tomatometer]10. SyrianaIt’s always fashionable to lament the lack of imagination and depth in mainstream Hollywood fare — and, quite often, it’s easy to understand why. But every so often, someone manages to slip something demanding into the release schedule. Case in point: 2007’s Syriana, a twisty political thriller that takes an impossibly intricate script (written by Stephen Gaghan, also making his directorial debut), adds a top-notch ensemble cast, and wraps the whole thing up in 128 minutes of espionage and intrigue with equal parts visceral and intellectual appeal. As Robert Barnes, the CIA operative who becomes an unwilling expert in the painful side effects of shifting Middle Eastern alliances, Clooney was only one part of a cast that included Matt Damon, Jeffrey Wright, Chris Cooper, and William Hurt — but as one of the film’s executive producers, he was a crucial element of a movie that overcame its heady themes to earn almost $100 million worldwide. Lauding Syriana as “a film that treats its audience as adults,” Channel 4 Film’s James Mottram wrote, “this is an extremely rewarding work that handsomely pays off the concentration required to watch it.”[tomatometer]MuzeID=1126178[/tomatometer]9. Intolerable CrueltyWhat do you get when you cross the Coen brothers with the tired old romantic comedy genre? 2003’s Intolerable Cruelty, in which the directing/screenwriting duo turns its deep black humor on the sexy screwball laffers of the ’30s, putting Clooney and Catherine Zeta-Jones in the center of a story with enough twists, turns, and double-crosses for a hundred Kate Hudson movies. The plot, which pits a brilliant but bored divorce attorney (Clooney) in a battle of the sexes against one of his former clients’ spouses (Zeta-Jones), isn’t terribly original, but the script has plenty of zingers — and the leads threw enough sparks to charm even many of the critics who came away from Cruelty disappointed with the Coens’ surprisingly mainstream shift. In the words of the Globe and Mail’s Liam Lacey, “If Intolerable Cruelty establishes one thing, it’s that George Clooney is the closest thing that contemporary Hollywood has to an old-fashioned matinee idol.”[tomatometer]MuzeID=1189944[/tomatometer]8. Burn After ReadingAfter tunneling deep into the dark underbelly of human nature with their adaptation of Cormac McCarthy’s No Country for Old Men, the Coen brothers decided to beat a lighthearted retreat for its follow-up, 2008’s Burn After Reading — and, in the process, reunite with one of their favorite leading men. For his third project with the Coens, Clooney took on the role of Harry Pfarrer, a Treasury agent whose romantic exploits are as unfortunate as they are prolific. Conducting an adulterous affair with Katie Cox (Tilda Swinton) while simultaneously fooling around with Linda Litzke (Frances McDormand), Pfarrer is hilariously unaware that both women are involved in some way in the botched extortion scheme that’s about to send his life spinning off its axis. Though Burn represented a substantial critical comedown for the Coens after the award-hogging No Country, it was a hit with most scribes, including Armond White of the New York Press, who wrote, “Lesser artists would have followed a critical smash like No Country with another noir, courting audience favor through familiarity. But Burn After Reading, though shocking, is simply the flipside of the Coens’ existential dread.”[tomatometer]MuzeID=1102021[/tomatometer]7. O Brother, Where Art Thou?In lesser hands, a broadly comic, Depression-era update on the Odyssey could have been the most embarrassing thing George Clooney would be associated with since Return of the Killer Tomatoes, but the Coen brothers made it work — and how: Between its $71 million gross and a soundtrack so popular it spawned its own documentary, O Brother, Where Art Thou? was one of 2000’s cinematic sensations (albeit one whose impact was more cultural than financial; ranking 60th on the annual box office results, it was just a shade less successful than Dude, Where’s My Car?). Despite some South Park vocal cameos and his noteworthy late-series run on The Facts of Life, Clooney’s comedic gift remained largely undiscovered until the Coens turned him loose to ham it up as Ulysses Everett McGill, the fast-talking escaped con whose quest for ill-gotten gains leads him to an accidental career as a member of an old-time music trio. Sound like a loopy plot? Well, toss in some Klansmen, a floating cow, and John Goodman in an eyepatch, and you can understand why Eugene Novikov of Film Blather said “O Brother, Where Art Thou? is the Being John Malkovich of the year 2000,” adding, “The most remarkable thing about it is just how any sane studio executive agreed to back it.”[tomatometer]MuzeID=1119033[/tomatometer]6. Confessions of a Dangerous MindIt’s one of Hollywood’s most oft-repeated jokes that what actors really want to do is direct — but when they do get their first shot behind the cameras, very few actors take the opportunity to create something as wonderfully strange as Confessions of a Dangerous Mind. Adapted by Charlie Kaufman from the Chuck Barris memoir that may or may not have included giant chunks of complete fiction, Confessions introduces the viewer to a world in which noted television producer Barris (played by Sam Rockwell) is recruited by a CIA agent (Clooney) to carry out secret political assassinations — and it gets even weirder from there. Arriving in theaters years after Barris’ TV heyday, Confessions never really had a prayer of catching on at the box office, but it — and Clooney — earned the admiration of critics like Glenn Lovell of the San Jose Mercury News, who wrote, “Clooney, who on the basis of this movie has a big career ahead of him behind the camera, demonstrates a real flair for visual comedy.”[tomatometer]MuzeID=1111152[/tomatometer]5. Ocean’s ElevenGlamour is a big part of what used to make going to the movies so much fun — and thanks to a variety of factors, not least the rising tide of paparazzi journalism, the wonderful spectacle of Hollywood’s brightest stars has lost a great deal of its wattage over the last decade and change. Steven Soderbergh managed to turn back the clock a little with his 2001 remake of the minor 1960 Rat Pack classic, lining up a cast of heavyweights so impressive that even the most jaded filmgoers couldn’t help but give in to the spectacle. Critics were suitably dazzled, too, noting that the fun being had onscreen by Clooney (as the titular Danny Ocean) and his luminous co-stars (including Matt Damon, Brad Pitt, and Julia Roberts) was too infectious to resist. Writing for the Philadelphia Weekly, Sean Burns applauded, “It’s a giant ice-cream cake of a movie that tickles the pleasure centers of your brain — restoring the good name of large-scale, old-fashioned Hollywood entertainment.”[tomatometer]MuzeID=1183692[/tomatometer]4. Michael ClaytonLike a lot of actors with pretty faces, Clooney has toyed with his looks at various points, either by scruffing them up (O Brother, Where Art Thou?) or puffing them out (Syriana). For 2007’s Michael Clayton, however, he put them arguably to their best use by playing a guy whose suavity has helped him build a pretty flashy career as a corporate legal fixer — but behind the façade lies a burned-out shell of a man whose poor decisions have boxed him into a seemingly inescapable corner. Offering one of his most nuanced performances behind a script (courtesy of writer/director Tony Gilroy) that evoked the classic paranoid thrillers of the ’70s, Clooney helped Clayton become one of the year’s best-reviewed films — and, with a $92 million gross, one of its smarter box office hits. Paul Byrnes of the Sydney Morning Herald paid it some of its highest praise when he called it “an enveloping thriller with a cool intelligence, the kind of film Redford or Newman would have jumped at 15 or 20 years ago.”[tomatometer]MuzeID=1083436[/tomatometer]3. Out of SightLesser actors have seen their careers destroyed by failures as profound as the putrid, fluorescent stink bomb that was 1997’s Batman &amp; Robin — but Clooney dusted himself off, locked himself in a trunk with Jennifer Lopez, and emerged with the smoldering Out of Sight. While not a huge commercial success, Sight — adapted by Scott Frank from the Elmore Leonard novel — proved Clooney had more to offer than he’d been able to show in disappointing duds like One Fine Day and The Peacemaker. More importantly, it kicked off a partnership with director Steven Soderbergh that would become arguably the defining professional association of Clooney’s career. And did we mention that Out of Sight is a lot of fun to watch? As Andrew Sarris of the New York Observer noted, “From the first shot to the last, Mr. Clooney is in complete command of the screen in the assured manner of the biggest stars in the past, and he doesn’t need a ton of special effects and digital enhancement to generate excitement.”[tomatometer]MuzeID=1093801[/tomatometer]2. Three KingsAmerican audiences tend to tune out movies that take place in the deserts of the Middle East, and 1999’s Three Kings was no exception — the David O. Russell-written/directed effort failed to recoup its budget despite overwhelmingly positive reviews and a cast toplined by Clooney, Mark Wahlberg, and a pre-Are We There Yet? Ice Cube. Kings‘ following has grown in the decade since it tanked in theaters, though, and it’s easy to see why — though it was dogged by a series of embarrassing controversies, including a lawsuit from screenwriter John Ridley and an on-set brawl between Clooney and Russell, none of the behind-the-scenes drama manifests itself in this visually distinctive, effortlessly entertaining Gulf War satire, which puts the three stars in the center of a gold heist while bitterly lampooning the bloody aftermath of the 1991 conflict. Though its political subtext is unmistakably strident, Kings works as a gripping action flick, too; as Reeling Reviews’ Robin Clifford wrote, “Go see it for the effects, action and treasure hunt story, but enjoy the intelligence, too.”[tomatometer]MuzeID=1152019[/tomatometer]1. Good Night, and Good LuckHis first directorial effort was a flight of fancy, but for his follow-up, George Clooney took a decidedly more serious tack, dramatizing the efforts of legendary journalist Edward R. Murrow to thwart Joseph McCarthy’s Communist witch hunt. Inspired by the increasingly vituperative political atmosphere of the early aughts, Clooney laid more than his career capital on the line for Good Night, and Good Luck — not only did he forsake his usual salary, collecting a dollar apiece for his directorial, screenwriting, and starring roles, but he also went so far as to mortgage his home as collateral. (Well, one of his homes, anyway. But still.) This black-and-white plea for journalistic ethics was a film out of time in the 24-hour cable news era, even with a stellar cast that included Clooney, David Strathairn, Robert Downey, Jr., Patricia Clarkson, and Frank Langella — but it still had enough Luck to rack up six Academy Award nominations and an impressive $54 million worldwide gross, not to mention raves from critics like the Daily Mirror’s David Edwards, who wrote, “George Clooney is emerging as one of America’s bravest, boldest filmmakers. And with this highly-charged political thriller, he’s also emerging as one of its very best.”Take a look through Clooney’s complete filmography, as well as the rest of our Total Recall archives.

And if you were a tween or an early teenager in the late 1980s, Dana Carvey really was the funniest person in the world. There was something about his persona that appealed particularly to small children, a goofy, man-sprite playfulness that implicitly conveyed that while Carvey may look like a grown-up (albeit an&nbsp;eternally boyish one), inside he was the class clown every Saturday Night Live fan wished they sat next to.Carvey was known for his political impressions, but even these had a distinctly child-like sensibility. Carvey didn’t impersonate the real George H.W. Bush — a Connecticut war hero who ran the CIA before spawning a political dynasty and becoming the most powerful man in the world — but rather embodied a child’s broad conception of this strange man as a funny-talking goober spouting catchphrases.Then Carvey’s fans got older and the beloved Saturday Night Live cut-up more or less disappeared from the world of television and film, following the failure of his brilliant and uncharacteristically edgy and dark sketch comedy vehicle The Dana Carvey Show. The zeitgeist-capturing success of Wayne’s World —&nbsp;a film Mike Myers famously tried to cut the then- more popular Carvey out of — and its sequel notwithstanding, Carvey made a couple of limp vehicles (Clean Slate, Opportunity Knocks) and co-starred in some disastrously received studio films like The Road To Wellville and Trapped In Paradise.&nbsp;Aside from cameos in The Shot, Little Nicky, and the documentary Fire On The Track: The Steve Prefontaine Story, Carvey did not appear in a movie between his costarring role in 1994’s Trapped In Paradise and 2002’s The Master Of Disguise, which he also co-wrote with Harris Goldberg.“The Master Of Disguise isn’t&nbsp;just pitched towards children; it feels like it was made by children as well.”Partially out of childhood nostalgia and partially out of fondness for the Carvey era of Saturday Night Live, I had casually been looking forward to Carvey’s return, but The Master Of Disguise taught me and a generation that grew up on Carvey’s comedy to be careful what we wished for. The Master Of Disguise isn’t&nbsp;just a comedy very overtly pitched towards children; it feels throughout like it was made by children as well.The fact that The Master Of Disguise is a children’s film does not render it any less perverse. If anything, the bizarre friction between the never-ending stream of weird sexual innuendos and self-indulgent references to R-rated movies released&nbsp;decades before the film’s core audience was born makes it even weirder.&nbsp;Most Hollywood executives might have a problem with creepy sexual content in a kid’s movie, but The Master Of Disguise feels like it was greenlit and overseen not by Joe Roth, the head of Revolution Studios, but rather by Sir Mix-A-Lot, who has always been refreshingly honest about his sexual preferences.One of the film’s running jokes, for example, is that protagonist Pistachio Disguisey (Carvey) is sexually attracted to women with enormous posteriors that remind him of his beloved Mama’s (Edie McClurg, the original Edie McClurg type) zaftig rump. This is no one-off gag. On the contrary, it appears over and over again throughout the course of the film. In the most appalling instance, Pistachio and his grandfather (the great character actor Harold Gould) stare longingly at the big ass of a long-haired stranger walking away from them and are so shocked to discover the plus-sized bottom belongs to a dude that the ice cream cones they are conveniently snacking upon rocket straight into their mouths. It looks disconcertingly like two butt-obsessed men are performing oral sex on frozen treats — a rare example of a double gay panic joke in a PG-rated children’s film.Early in The Master Of Disguise, Pistachio’s father (James Brolin) makes a getaway by pretending to be not just Bo Derek but specifically 10-era Bo Derek.&nbsp;That might seem like an awfully adult reference for a movie that would need to drink from a sippy cup if it were a human being, but The Master Of Disguise outdoes the 10 reference for jarringly inappropriate adult content by paying reverent homage to such beloved favorites of the pre-school set as The Exorcist, Scarface (Carvey spends an endless scene imitating Tony Montana as alter-ego “Mr. Peru”) and Jaws, which is lovingly resurrected by Carvey when he performs what appears to be Robert Shaw’s entire role late in the film.Just about the only reference children might actually get is an unexpectedly melancholy moment when&nbsp;Pistachio tries to impress a little boy (whose mother ultimately becomes&nbsp;his assistant and love interest) by imitating Shrek, a movie whose primary voice is provided by a man famous for his troubled and tension-filled relationship with Carvey.But before The Master Of Disguise can be glaringly, gallingly inappropriate, it first establishes an elaborate mythology for its title character, who we learn is part of a clan that has furtively protected society for ages through its uncanny gift for impersonation. The legacy of the Disguiseys has been kept a secret from Pistachio, who works in the family restaurant and, like Jerry Lewis long after his prime, is a grown-ass man in his forties who dresses and behaves like a mentally challenged child.&nbsp;Pistachio is a blinkered innocent, but during stressful situations he enters something of a fugue state where he can’t help but impersonate whoever he’s with.“No one who ever sees one of his horrifying get-ups is ever likely to forget the trauma.”Then one day, bad guy Devlin Bowman (Brent Spiner) shows up — he has an unfortunate predilection for laughing so hard and sinisterly at his evil plans that he unleashes explosive flatulence (because when you’re making a movie for kids you’ve got to explore the comic possibilities of both butts and farts to their full potential). Bowman kidnaps Pistachio’s parents and forces his father to use his uncanny powers of impersonation to steal priceless artifacts like the U.S Constitution.&nbsp;This is when Pistachio lazily lurches into action under the guidance of his grandfather to try to find his missing parents and thwart Devlin’s evil plan to sell beloved artifacts on a black market Ebay.Now the purpose of a disguise, generally, is to fit into your surroundings so thoroughly that you are unnoticeable and can go about your important business uninterrupted, but Pistachio Disguisey pursues an antithetical strategy. Instead of blending in so well that he becomes borderline invisible human camouflage, able to swarm in and out of dangers inconspicuously, Pistachio makes such a bizarre, surreal spectacle of himself that not only is he destined to be noticed, but no one who ever sees one of his horrifying get-ups is ever likely to forget the trauma.This extends to the audience. In The Master Of Disguise‘s signature scene —&nbsp;the reason the film has attracted such a strangely loyal following — Pistachio decides that the best way to go undercover at an exclusive enclave known as the Turtle Club is to disguise himself as a bald, turtle-shaped, amphibian-man hybrid who croaks “Turtle!” to no one in particular in a strangled voice redolent of deep mental illness and unimaginable damage.Though&nbsp;he is presented&nbsp;as a lovably eccentric nut, Pistachio frequently&nbsp;comes across more like a deeply disturbed man who has suffered a definitive break from reality and lives in an insane world of his own imagining. His&nbsp;rampaging madness insists than an institution called the Turtle Club could only have acquired that name because it caters to&nbsp;a clientele&nbsp;of freakish man-animals who look and act like turtles, screeching the word “turtle” for no discernible reason&nbsp;when they aren’t retreating into a homemade shell (i.e. a turtle-shaped suit so enormous Pistachio is able to hide within&nbsp;it when threatened).&nbsp;“Am I not turtle-y enough for the Turtle Club?” Pistachio inquires aggressively — words I am ashamed to admit I will remember long after I forget the birthdays of my wife and son.The turtle scene is at once the film’s nadir and its apex. Once seen, it cannot be unseen. It signals a shift from spectacularly stupid slapstick silliness to something that borders on avant-garde. The Master Of Disguise doesn’t have&nbsp;much use for a plot, but after the Turtle Club it all but abandons logic and linear storytelling altogether. The half-assed narrative becomes simply an excuse for Carvey to cycle through a series of characters that he obviously adores playing but which make very little sense within the context of the film, like a Tony Montana doppelgänger who also possesses the grace and moves of a ballet dancer.The other actors in The Master Of Disguise don’t act with Carvey so much as they respond to his mugging and over-the-top shenanigans. This is particularly true of Jennifer Esposito, whose role is a never-ending assault on her dignity (at one point, Pistachio and his grandfather obsess about her “scrawny” posterior and how it fails to measure up to McClurg’s butt) but&nbsp;it’s&nbsp;also spectacularly unchallenging. All she really has to do is be attractive and seem appropriately embarrassed to be in the company of someone like Pistachio Disguisey, which is definitely within her wheelhouse.“The turtle scene is at once the film’s nadir and its apex. Once seen, it cannot be unseen.”The Master Of Disguise wraps up what little story it has around the 71-minute mark. This renders it barely feature-length, so the filmmakers eke another 10&nbsp;minutes or so out of this nonsense with an endless series of outtakes and bloopers. What’s fascinating about this is that many of them are clearly from deleted scenes. Wikipedia lists fictional politician Mayor Maynot, real-life painter Bob Ross, a vampire, legendary ventriloquist dummy Charlie McCarthy, Groucho Marx, Gluteus Maximus (a parody of the protagonist of Gladiator), Forrest Gump, and a caveman as characters Carvey plays in the end credits but not in the film itself.This raises the horrifying and fascinating prospect that the filmmakers shot way more footage than they ended up using (not difficult to imagine when the end credits show up&nbsp;shortly&nbsp;after an hour has passed) and that there were scenes that were written, costumed, and filmed but were edited out because they did not work as well as The Turtle Club scene or the one when Pistachio and his grandfather ogle the man’s ass.I like to imagine that there is a four hour cut of The Master Of Disguise with every scene and character and costume included, but that anyone who watches it would go stark raving mad, and the people behind the film could not have that on their conscience. I would totally watch this fabled, probably theoretical cut because I find the film so hypnotically terrible and so joyously, wonderfully devoid of logic and sanity. It really feels like Carvey got an opportunity to realize every bad idea he’d ever had as a writer or performer and shoehorn them into one crazily overstuffed, overstuffed-with-crazy, impossible-to-forget extravaganza.Though&nbsp;The Master Of Disguise is&nbsp;a commercial success that I imagine also did well on cable and home video, Carvey has not written or starred in a movie in the 13&nbsp;years since the film was released. In a weird way, he doesn’t have to, because it feels like he did everything he ever wanted to do, film-wise, with The Master Of Disguise. It&nbsp;represents a strong, uncompromising vision no less fascinating for being insane and just barely a movie, rather than an extended highlight reel for the even longer film the end credits threaten.My Original Certification:&nbsp;RottenMy Re-Certification:&nbsp;FreshTomatometer:&nbsp;One percentFollow Nathan Rabin on Twitter: @NathanRabin","section":"Sub-Cult","tags":"best, Grant, guild","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/17025813/MasterOfDisguise.jpg","slug":"does-the-master-of-disguise-deserve-cult-status"},{"id":"47508880116317","title":"Lethal Weapon, Carrie, Dazed and Confused, and More Certified Fresh Movies on Netflix and Amazon Prime","content":"Now Streamingvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Lethal Weapon, Carrie, Dazed and Confused, and More Certified Fresh Movies on Netflix and Amazon Primeby RT Staff | October 4, 2016 |  CommentsIt’s the first streaming column of the month, and you know what that means: subscription services have rolled out a ton of new selections.

Here are a few other shows and movies to follow that binge.by RT Staff | May 12, 2020 |  CommentsNetflix may have it’s fair share of coming-of-age comedies, but Never Have I Ever definitely brings a fresh perspective to the genre. Inspired by show creator Mindy Kaling’s own childhood, the show focuses on the life of a modern first-generation Indian American teenage girl. And critics and fans alike have fallen head over heels for the young cast, including charming newcomer Maitreyi Ramakrishnan as Devi, an overachieving high school sophomore who has a short fuse that gets her into difficult situations. And since Never Have I Ever is as easy to binge at is to become obsessed with, Rotten Tomatoes has thankfully gathered five more titles that will give you many of the same feels, and gently remind you that your own high school experience could be, or could have been, much worse.&nbsp;Join correspondent Naz Perez and get ready to binge.Never Have I Ever (2020) 97%#1Synopsis: A coming-of-age comedy series about the life of a modern first-generation Indian American teenage girl, inspired by Mindy Kaling's own...

Check this list of the new shows and movies on Disney+ this month, including Artemis Fowl, Tarzan, and more behind-the-scenes looks at The Mandalorian.by RT Staff | May 28, 2020 |  CommentsThe latest movies,&nbsp;new&nbsp;original series,&nbsp;and&nbsp;other new releases coming to&nbsp;Disney’s streaming service this month include&nbsp;a healthy mix of family content that’s sure to appeal to viewers of all ages, from animated classics like&nbsp;Tarzan and&nbsp;Schoolhouse Rock! to nature series like&nbsp;Howie Mandel’s Animals Doing Things to continuing episodes of the behind-the-scenes docuseries&nbsp;Disney Gallery: Star Wars: The Mandalorian.Plus, there’s also 2010’s&nbsp;Percy Jackson &amp; the Olympians: The Lightning Thief and the live-action remake of&nbsp;101 Dalmatians, and last but certainly not least, the world premiere of&nbsp;Artemis Fowl, which makes its way to Disney+ in lieu of a previously scheduled theatrical release.Read on for the full list of titles, starting with a few recommendations to look out for&nbsp;at the top.HIGHLIGHTSArtemis Fowl (2020)  8%Description:&nbsp;Director Kenneth Branagh brings the popular children’s fantasy book series to life in this adaptation, which stars newcomer Ferdia Shaw as the title character, a 12-year-old criminal genius who kidnaps a fairy and forces it to help him locate his missing father (Colin Farrell). The supporting ensemble cast includes Judi Dench, Josh Gad, Hong Chau, Nonso Anozie, and more, and the film moved to Disney+ after it was initially pulled from its theatrical release due to the coronavirus pandemic, so expect big-screen action and special effects.Premiere Date:&nbsp;Friday, June 12, 2020Tarzan (1999)  89%Description:&nbsp;The last film of the so-called Disney Renaissance of animated features that began in 1989,&nbsp;Tarzan retells the classic Edgar Rice Burroughs story about a human child who was raised in the jungle by a family of gorillas and ultimately must find his place in the world when he encounters a group of explorers. Tony Goldwyn voices Tarzan, Minnie Driver is Jane, and Glenn Glose, Lance Henriksen, and Rosie O’Donnell play supporting roles. Meanwhile, Phil Collins’ soundtrack for the film became a success, and co-director Chris Buck&nbsp;would later go on to stamp his name on another little Disney hit called&nbsp;Frozen.Critics Consensus:&nbsp;Disney’s Tarzan takes the well-known story to a new level with spirited animation, a brisk pace, and some thrilling action set-pieces.Premiere Date:&nbsp;Friday, June 26, 2020101 Dalmatians (1996)  41%Description:&nbsp;Before Johnny Depp became the Mad Hatter, before Angelina Jolie humanized a misunderstood sorceress, and before Will Smith went blue to play a genie, Glenn Close perfectly embodied Cruella De Vil in 1996’s&nbsp;101 Dalmatians, which was only Disney’s second attempt at a live-action remake of one of their classic animated films. Critics largely may not have responded so positively to the rest of the film, but Close’s performance as the iconic villain who wants nothing more than a spotted coat made of dog fur is memorably delicious. With Emma Stone set to take on the same role in a new,&nbsp;Maleficent-styled adaptation, it’s a great time to catch up on Disney’s first shot at it.Critics Consensus:&nbsp;Neat performance from Glenn Close aside, 101 Dalmatians is a bland, pointless remake.Premiere Date:&nbsp;Friday, June 19, 2020Available 6/5Alaska’s Grizzly Gauntlet: Season 1America’s Greatest AnimalsChasing the EquinoxHowie Mandel's Animals Doing Things : Season 1-2Secrets of Wild India: Season 1The Greeks: Season 1Weird but True!: Season 1-2Wild Hawaii: Season 1Women of Impact: Changing the World (2019) Be Our Chef: Season 1 (2020)  – “The Spectacular Finale”Disney Gallery: Star Wars: The Mandalorian: Season 1 (2020)  100% – “Visualization”Disney Family Sundays: Season 1 (2019)  – “101 Dalmatians: Onesie”One Day at Disney: Season 1 (2019)  – “George Montano: Plasterer”It's A Dog's Life With Bill Farmer: Season 1 (2020)  –&nbsp;“Disaster Rescue Dogs &amp; A Dog Mayor”Disney Insider: Season 1 – “Artemis Adventure, Taste of Disney, Runaway Railway”Available 6/12Mighty Med: Seasons 1-2The Liberty StoryThe Story of the Animated DrawingWalt &amp; El GrupoArtemis Fowl (2020)  8%Disney Gallery: Star Wars: The Mandalorian: Season 1 (2020)  100% – “Score”It's A Dog's Life With Bill Farmer: Season 1 (2020)  – “The Surfing Corgi &amp; Bee Dogs”Disney Family Sundays: Season 1 (2019)  –&nbsp;“Winnie the Pooh: Bag Toss”One Day at Disney: Season 1 (2019)  – “Scot Drake: Imagineering Creative”Available 6/19101 Dalmatians (1996)  41%Big Sur: Wild CaliforniaMuppet Babies Play Date: Season 1Schoolhouse Rock!: Season 1 (1973)  100%Tinker Bell and the Pirate FairyDisney Gallery: Star Wars: The Mandalorian: Season 1 (2020)  100% – “Connections”It's A Dog's Life With Bill Farmer: Season 1 (2020)  – “Stunt Dogs &amp; Water Rescue Dogs”Disney Family Sundays: Season 1 (2019)  – “Monsters, Inc.

It explains how the foursome — Skipper, Kowalski, Rico and Private — became globetrotting super spies, and it follows them on an all-new adventure. John Malkovich provides the rich voice of the shape-shifting villain who’s their target: an angry octopus who’s pretending to be a mad scientist. He kidnaps penguins from zoos and aquariums around the world and plans to zap them with a serum that will turn them into monstrous versions of themselves. His hope is that they’ll seem less adorable and appealing to the masses, but what they become is more silly than frightening. The penguins find themselves in several perilous situations but always manage to escape. There’s a lot of playful spanking among the animals as well as some fart jokes and double entendres about flatulence, but it’s the kind of harmless, puerile humor that routinely cracks kids up. Nothing here is shocking or inappropriate. Fine for all ages, although a lot of the pop-culture references are purely for adults.New On DVD:The Giver 35%Rating: PG-13, for mature thematic image and some sci-fi action/violence.Mature tweens and older are probably the appropriate audience for this sci-fi drama/thriller — yet another based on a Young Adult novel set in a rigidly structured, post-war future. Brenton Thwaites stars as Jonas, the obligatory, plucky teen who dares to rise up and shake up the status quo. Jonas is chosen as the keeper of all memory in this sterile, black-and-white community; Jeff Bridges is the giver of the film’s title, who passes along the information he’s been storing. This includes color, music and love but also violence, war and hatred, with a series of harrowing images flashing through the young man’s mind as he receives them. Jonas and his girlfriend, Fiona (Odeya Rush), find themselves in danger when it becomes clear to the elders (led by Meryl Streep, of all people) that they’ve started thinking for themselves. There’s also a disturbing subplot involving the killing of infants who don’t meet the community’s precise standards.Tyler Perry’s A Madea Christmas 20%Rating: PG-13, for sexual references, crude humor and language.Nearly a year after it arrived in theaters, this raunchy and racially tinged Christmas comedy is coming out on DVD. Think of it as a lump of cinematic coal in your stocking. But if you’re home flipping channels after a long day of shopping and it pops up, or if it happens to be on television at a holiday party, there’s nothing here that will permanently scar your children. It’s just sloppily made, as all Tyler Perry movies tend to be. This time, Perry climbs back into the sassy drag of his Madea persona, a crass and wacky old lady with no internal censor. Most of the stuff she babbles about will go over kids’ heads: references to lingerie, drugs andstrippers, for starters. Larry the Cable Guy shows up and amps up the vulgarity with some sexual innuendos — which, again, probably won’t register with young viewers. There’s also a massively contrived car crash and explosion that might have been slightly suspenseful in the hands of someone, you know, capable.","section":"Parental Guidance","tags":"talk, Yoda, ID, blockbuster","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Penguins.jpg","slug":"parental-guidance-penguins-of-madagascar"},{"id":"47615186390357","title":"Rotten Tomatoes’ Ridiculously Early Oscar Predictions: Best Actor","content":"Newsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Rotten Tomatoes' Ridiculously Early Oscar Predictions: Best ActorLeonardo DiCaprio, Robert De Niro, Daniel Kaluuya, Joaquin Phoenix, Antonio Banderas and more lead early buzz for this year's awards season.by Jacqueline Coley | August 8, 2019 |  Comments(Photo by © A24)Continuing our series of “Ridiculously Early Oscar Predictions,” we now move on to the gentlemen. As noted when we released our Ridiculously Early Best Actress predictions, it might seem ludicrous to start guesstimating contenders so soon, but the “Oscar movie” calendar is starting earlier and earlier – as is awards season itself –&nbsp;and the very notion of an “Oscar movie” is changing.Our early Best Actor predictions list is supersized because we might be facing the most competitive race in the category in decades. The upcoming season&nbsp;could even&nbsp;dethrone 1993, which is considered by many to be the most competitive year ever when it comes to Best Actor: Al Pacino&nbsp;(Scent of Woman) won&nbsp;the award over Robert Downey Jr. (Chaplin), Clint Eastwood (Unforgiven), Stephen Rea (The Crying Game), and Denzel Washington (Malcolm X).The same storm of fierce competition is a-brewing for 2020. How do we know?&nbsp;A&nbsp;number&nbsp;of the films&nbsp;likely to be in the conversation have already screened at festivals and earned Tomatometer scores, and pundits are already singling out the major standout performances in them. There are also others&nbsp;that nobody has yet seen, but for which early pre-release buzz&nbsp;and expectations are high. With that said, some on this list may end up in the Supporting Actor&nbsp;category, and we’ve omitted names like Tom Hanks, who plays Mr Rogers in&nbsp;A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood,&nbsp;because&nbsp;we&nbsp;believe he’ll be in that Supporting race.Whether we like it or not, the campaigns are quietly underway, the conversation has started, and we’re now ready to join it. If&nbsp;history and basic math tell us anything, it is that most of these names won’t make it to Oscar night, but we’re pretty confident many of them will be right up there in the awards chatter. So read on as we break down our ridiculously early&nbsp;picks for 2020 Best Actor contenders.Don’t agree with our picks? Have at us in the comments.Daniel Kaluuya,&nbsp;Queen &amp; Slim (2019)  83%This fresh take on Bonnie and Clyde&nbsp;came from the mind of Lena Waithe and is based on a story by James Frey. (Yes, it’s the “I lied to Oprah” James Frey, but try not to&nbsp;hold that against the film.) In the debut feature film from&nbsp;Melina Matsoukas (director of Beyonce’s “Formation” music video), we follow Queen and Slim, two strangers who end up on the run together and maybe fall in love. RT was lucky enough to screen a few minutes of the film, and what&nbsp;we saw was enough to make two bold predictions:&nbsp;Queen and Slim&nbsp;might be in the awards conversation, and Daniel Kaluuya could very well pull another Oscar nod. With&nbsp;Get Out and&nbsp;Widows, the British&nbsp;actor&nbsp;has quietly morphed into one of the hottest young talents&nbsp;working; what he is able to to do in one conversation with co-star Jodie Turner-Smith is nothing short of spectacular.Adam Driver, Marriage Story (2019)  94%(Photo by Netflix)Noah Baumbach was at one time&nbsp;less than thrilled that his 2017 release The Meyerowitz Stories (New and Selected) was picked up by streaming giant Netflix; he had been&nbsp;very much hoping for a traditional studio run. However, those ill feelings have seemingly subsided, as he chose to produce his latest film entirely under the Netflix banner. (He’s in good company at the streamer, with&nbsp;Ava DuVernay, Martin Scorsese, and Steven Soderbergh all releasing projects there.) We have already singled out Scarlett Johansson’s Marriage Story performance as one that could&nbsp;go the distance, and her co-star Adam Driver is rumored to be equally impressive. The movie tells the story of a bicoastal breakup and has&nbsp;been described as a modern-day Ordinary People mixed with a dash of&nbsp;Kramer vs. Kramer; it’s said&nbsp;to be&nbsp;poignant, intimate, and – like so many other&nbsp;Baumbach films – full of big laughs and tears. Speaking to IndieWire&nbsp;in July, the&nbsp;While We’re Young director confessed the film defies categorization: “[Marriage Story] is&nbsp;a hidden thriller, a procedural, a romantic comedy, a tragic love story. I felt like this was a subject that could handle all those things.”Matt Damon and Christian Bale,&nbsp;Ford v Ferrari (2019)  92%A&nbsp;post-Fox merger world could provide Walt Disney&nbsp;Studios with some chances at Best Actor trophies and, more importantly, something they’ve never been able to get:&nbsp;a Best Picture Academy Award.&nbsp;You read that correctly: Disney has never won an Academy Award for Best Picture. Just let that sink in. With the Fox merger,&nbsp;Disney&nbsp;now has a host of titles that will give it&nbsp;a competitive edge for awards, one of the biggest being Ford v. Ferrari. The movie tells the true-life tale of how the Ford Motor Company&nbsp;worked tirelessly to build a car that could beat racing powerhouse Ferrari at the 24 Hours of Le Mans race in 1966. Starring Matt Damon as famed Ford car designer Carroll Shelby and Christian Bale as racing&nbsp;legend&nbsp;Ken Miles, the film’s trailer promises a funny, fast-paced adventure. Both lead actors are coming off recent nominations – Bale for Vice and Damon for The Martian – and&nbsp;with Logan and Walk the Line director James Mangold behind the camera, the odds are very much in their favor.Adam Sandler,&nbsp;Uncut Gems (2019)  91%(Photo by ©A24)When Adam Sandler released his comedy special 100% Fresh earlier this year, everyone here at RT had to crack a smile. Though the comedian’s filmography,&nbsp;which is featured heavily in our upcoming book Rotten Movies We Love,&nbsp;is beloved by many, he has not been much of critical darling, especially lately. That being said, when Sandler teams up with indie directors, good things happen.&nbsp;The aforementioned The Meyerowitz Stories (New and Selected) earned the former SNL star his best reviews in years, and Paul Thomas Anderson’s indie darling Punch Drunk Love&nbsp;scored Sandler his&nbsp;first Golden Globe nomination. In Uncut Gems, the New York native plays a celebrity jeweler from New York’s famed “Diamond District” who is suddenly thrust into a race-against-the-clock-thriller to get back his merchandise or pay off his debts when one of his couriers is robbed. Robert Pattinson banged around the indie circuit with&nbsp;some strong&nbsp;roles during and after his Twilight years, but&nbsp;it was his frantic performance as a bank robber in the Safdie Brother’s Good Time that finally resurrected&nbsp;him in the minds of many critics. It’s no wonder Sandler signed on to take the lead in their follow-up film.Robert Pattinson and Willem Dafoe,&nbsp;The Lighthouse (2019)  90%Our new Batman – and in this house, we do say&nbsp;Battinson&nbsp;– owes much to the Safdie Brothers’&nbsp;Good Time for rehabbing his image in the minds of non-Twilight&nbsp;fans. (OK, and Claire Denis and David Cronenberg and other great indie directors he’s been working with.) A supremely talented actor, he has&nbsp;fought hard to do the kinds of roles that inspire him.&nbsp;Back in 2017 at the Savannah&nbsp;Film Festival he said, “I like finding directors who haven’t been fully realized by the wider world yet.” The Lighthouse, which&nbsp;won the Cannes Critics Award, was one of the best-reviewed films of the&nbsp;French film festival. Those lucky enough to catch a screening have dubbed the story of two men trapped in an 1800s lighthouse a gothic horror masterpiece. Willem Dafoe, who last year pulled a nomination for&nbsp;the Vincent van Gogh biopic At Eternity’s Gate,&nbsp;is an Academy favorite with five career nominations, and as of today both he and R. Patz are&nbsp;right in the mix to score a nomination. First&nbsp;reviews out of the Cannes Film Festival predicted as much, and nothing has changed since then to slow down either’s momentum.Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci, and Al Pacino,&nbsp;The Irishman (2019)  95%Last year, during the Oscars ceremony, as Netflix was racking up multiple wins from its&nbsp;15 nominations, the studio opted to play a teaser&nbsp;for Martin Scorsese’s upcoming and long-awaited film The Irishman. It was a mic drop moment to be sure, and while the trailer&nbsp;showed&nbsp;no footage or even an official image, the names plastered on the screen were enough:&nbsp;Robert De Niro,&nbsp;Al Pacino, Joe Pesci, Harvey Keitel, Martin Scorsese. In a script by Steven Zaillian, The Irishman follows Jimmy Hoffa and a cast of mob characters that includes his former bodyguard, who later confessed to murdering him. Recently, Netflix dropped the teaser trailer, providing a sneak peek of&nbsp;The Irishman&nbsp;that showed off its notorious use of&nbsp;CGI technology to de-age&nbsp;the older cast to their thirties, forties, and fifties.&nbsp;Using technology completely foreign to what we’ve seen in the&nbsp;MCU, or will see in Ang Lee’s&nbsp;The Gemini Man starring Will Smith, The Irishman has positioned itself for multiple, possible double-digit nominations in technical and above-the-line categories, including possible nominations for its three leads. There is&nbsp;a tendency with “awards films” to categorize supporting performances as leads and vice-versa – we’re looking you Alicia Vikander – but from what we saw, De Niro was firmly in the lead category, with question marks for&nbsp;the rest.Taron Egerton,&nbsp;Rocketman (2019)  89%When&nbsp;Taron Egerton sat down with us earlier this&nbsp;year and broke down how he&nbsp;became Elton John,&nbsp;he confessed it was a transformative experience, nothing short of life-changing.&nbsp;It was something like that for many who watched it, too.&nbsp;The film premiered to acclaim at the&nbsp;Cannes Film Festival earlier this year, and&nbsp;both Egerton and his co-star Jamie Bell were singled out for their memorable performances. In an ultra-crowded field,&nbsp;Egerton&nbsp;has a harder road to get to Oscar night than, say, Rami Malek had last year. His performance has the goods, but as our exhaustive list of lead and potential lead performances suggests, this year is going to be a murderers’ row of talent.Joaquin Phoenix,&nbsp;Joker (2019)  68%If Joaquin Phoenix can pull off another Oscar nomination for his upcoming role in Todd Phillips’&nbsp;The Joker, he will officially be in Meryl Streep territory.&nbsp;Not to say he equals Streep in&nbsp;accomplishments, but whenever he takes a role there’s a safe bet he’s going to be in the conversation – even if it’s a comic-book movie. It’s one of the reasons why we’re giving his performance in Todd Phillips’ take on the iconic Batman villain a chance.&nbsp;We don’t know much about the film itself, which will debut at the Venice Film Festival, but we’ve detailed what we do&nbsp;know about the upcoming feature here. One thing we know for sure is that this is a complete departure from the DCEU. Phoenix takes the lead as the titular villain, giving us a detailed backstory to Batman’s greatest rival; and while many predict it&nbsp;will borrow heavily from the comics, it remains&nbsp;independent&nbsp;from any previous origin story. The Gladiator star, who&nbsp;fell short of an Oscar nomination in 2018 for Lynne Ramsay’s You Were Never Really Here, looks to have dived headfirst into this new iteration of the character. And though Phillips is mostly known for comedies, he does seem to get the best out of his actors. After all, Bradley Cooper didn’t show up for the Hangover III because he was bored.Brad Pitt and&nbsp;Leonardo DiCaprio,&nbsp;Once Upon a Time In Hollywood (2019)  85%Star power could be the thing that differentiates these two performances in a crowded field. Because, well, they’re&nbsp;LEO AND BRAD!&nbsp;Even if the duo doesn’t campaign hard, their starry sheen and pedigree&nbsp;could be enough to earn nominations. Also, they gave two of the most universally acclaimed performances of the year – even if the movie they were featured in has divided some critics.&nbsp;DiCaprio is brilliant as the hapless, self-absorbed, aging TV star Rick Dalton, and Pitt’s quiet confidence and cocksure smile as strong and silent stuntman Cliff Booth have charmed both critics and audiences alike. They’re dynamite together, too.&nbsp;Add in the fact that&nbsp;both&nbsp;stars – and co-star Margot Robbie – are staples on the awards circuit, with recent nominations (and a couple of wins), and you’d be hard-pressed argue against either&nbsp;of them making the cut.Antonio Banderas Pain and Glory (Dolor y gloria) (2019)  96%If you had told us, after&nbsp;seeing his breakthrough performance in Robert Rodriguez’s&nbsp;Desperado, that Antonio Banderas would&nbsp;be the frontrunner for a Best Actor prize some day, we would have said: Of course! He may have been a rarity in awards chatter&nbsp;over the past few decades, but Banderas has&nbsp;always had the chops. Action, romance, comedy, drama:&nbsp;The&nbsp;Mask of Zorro&nbsp;star has excelled in all. This year, however, his eighth collaboration with director Pedro Almodóvar could very well be his time. In a semi-autobiographical story about a filmmaker who struggles with pain and melancholy, partly inspired in part by 8 1/2,&nbsp;Banderas is vulnerable, heartbreaking, and captivating to watch. Since the film premiered at Cannes, Banderas has been getting buzz as –&nbsp;believe it or not – one of the few frontrunners who could unseat the likes of De Niro, DiCaprio, Pesci, or Pitt. A foreign language film is not the safest bet for an acting nomination stats-wise, but after Alfonso&nbsp;Cuarón won Best Director for&nbsp;Roma, anything is possible.Also in contention:&nbsp;Timothée Chalamet (Little Women, The King)Anthony Hopkins (The Pope)Kelvin Harrison, Jr. (Luce)Jonathan Pryce&nbsp;(The Pope)Noah Jupe&nbsp;(Honey Boy)Eddie Murphy (Dolemite Is My Name)Like this?

A sequel has now topped the box office for seven consecutive weekends.Reviews were mixed, but were better than for its predecessor which was critically panned. The sequel brought back director Tim Story along with the four main cast members Ioan Gruffudd, Jessica Alba, Chris Evans, and Michael Chiklis. However, the iconic Marvel Comics character Silver Surfer was prominently added to the film, and even to its title, to help bring back comic fans who may have had a bad taste after the first \"Fantastic\" pic. Laurence Fishburne provided the voice for the computer-generated space traveler.The latest summer sequel kicked off the weekend on Friday with $22M, dipped an understandable 11% to $19.6M on Saturday, and is projected to drop by another 19% on Sunday to $15.8M. Fox also reported that \"Rise of the Silver Surfer\" opened in 32 overseas markets with a combined $25.4M this weekend although most were minor territories. Russia, Italy, and the United Kingdom were among the only major international markets that launched this frame with more to come in the weeks ahead.\"Ocean’s Thirteen\" enjoyed a good hold in its second weekend dropping only 47% to an estimated $19.1M in its sophomore frame. Warner Bros. has now made off with $69.8M in ten days. Threequels often drop by 55% or more and \"Ocean’s Twelve\" even fell by 54% in its second try. That caper sequel grossed $18.1M in its second weekend and bagged a similar $68.5M worth of loot in its first ten days. \"Thirteen,\" which will not benefit from holidays like Christmas and New Year’s prolonging its run, could be on track to finish with $105-110M domestically which would still be the lowest in the \"Ocean’s\" series.Universal’s sleeper hit \"Knocked Up\" continued to capitalize on strong word-of-mouth and held onto third place with an estimated $14.5M, off only 26%, for a $90.5M cume. The R-rated smash will join the century club next weekend making it the studio’s first $100M hit since its last June romantic comedy offering \"The Break-Up.\"Disney’s \"Pirates of the Caribbean: At World’s End\" followed dropping 43% to an estimated $12M in its fourth adventure. Cume stands at $273.8M which is up 31% from 2003’s \"Curse of the Black Pearl\" after its fourth weekend, but down 24% from last summer’s \"Dead Man’s Chest\" at the same point. \"At World’s End\" did manage to rise to number 32 on the all-time domestic blockbusters list sailing past the $267.7M of 2001’s \"Shrek.\"A trio of kidpics followed. The animated penguin movie \"Surf’s Up\" sank 47% in its second weekend to an estimated $9.3M giving Sony a not-so-cool $34.7M after ten days. A final gross of about $60M could result. \"Shrek the Third\" landed in sixth place with an estimated $9M, off 41%, for a $297.2M total. Knocking on the triple-century mark, the Paramount release now stands at number 24 on the all-time list just behind the first \"Pirates\" film which banked $305.4M four years ago.Moviegoers passed on solving a mystery with \"Nancy Drew\" which opened poorly in seventh with only $7.1M, accoridng to estimates. Averaging a weak $2,732 from 2,612 theaters, the PG-rated film starring Emma Roberts failed to make a dent in the summer box office this weekend. \"Nancy\" opened in the same neighborhood as other films aimed at tween girls like \"Ice Princess,\" \"Little Black Book,\" and \"Aquamarine\" which all bowed to roughly $7M a piece.Lionsgate saw its horror sequel \"Hostel Part II\" tumble 64% after its weak opening to an estimated $3M this weekend. With only $14.2M taken in thus far, the torture pic should finish with just under $20M, or less than half of the $47.3M of the first \"Hostel\" flick from last year. MGM’s \"Mr. Brooks\" grossed an estimated $2.8M, off 43%, pushing the cume to only $23.4M for the Kevin Costner thriller.\"Spider-Man 3\" rounded out the top ten with an estimated $2.5M falling 42% from last weekend. With $330M after its seventh frame, the Sony sequel climbed to number 15 on the list of all-time domestic blockbusters right behind \"Finding Nemo\" which took in $339.7M in 2003.Opening dead on arrival was the new actioner \"D.O.A.: Dead or Alive\" which bowed to an estimated $232,000 from 505 theaters for a pathetic $460 average. The Weinstein Co. title was released with little fanfare and should see most of its business on DVD.A pair of hits fell from the top ten over the weekend. Fox Searchlight’s indie darling \"Waitress\" grossed an estimated $1.3M, down only 21%, for a $14.1M cume to date. A final tally of $17-20M from a limited national release is likely. Paramount’s Shia LaBeouf thriller \"Disturbia\" collected an estimated $250,000 in its tenth frame pushing the stellar cume to $78.3M. Look for a $79M final which will serve as an appetizer to the studio’s next Shia offering — \"Transformers\" opening July 3.The top ten films grossed an estimated $136.8M which was down 2% from last year when \"Cars\" remained at number one with $33.7M; but up 8% from 2005 when \"Batman Begins\" debuted in the top spot with $48.7M over three days.Author: Gitesh Pandya, www.BoxOfficeGuru.com","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"X-Men, DC, Photos, Premiere, Tour, children's","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-Fantastic-Four-Clobbers-Box-Office-Foes"},{"id":"47509102063201","title":"Dory Finds Herself at #1 For the Third Straight Week","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Dory Finds Herself at #1 For the Third Straight WeekThe Legend of Tarzan and The Purge: Election Year round out the top three.by Gitesh Pandya | July 3, 2016 |  CommentsThe Independence Day frame was ruled by the smash hit sequel Finding Dory which remained on top for a third time grossing an estimated $41.9M over the Friday-to-Sunday period. The Disney-Pixar juggernaut declined by 43% and boosted its domestic total to a stellar $372.3M. It hopes to crush the quadruple century mark by the end of the week. Global stands at a mammoth $538M with many top markets still to come.Leading the new releases with a strong start was the adventure film The Legend of Tarzan with an estimated $38.1M opening weekend over three days. Warner Bros. averaged a muscular $10,709 from 3,561 theaters and drew in audiences despite lackluster reviews from critics. It was also based on a property that is not all that much in demand right now. But Tarzan carries a hefty production cost so a strong global performance will be needed.Studio data showed that the PG-13 film had great cross-gender appeal as the male/female split was nearly even at 49/51. 10% of the gross came from IMAX screens and a good A- CinemaScore bodes well for the road ahead.The Purge: Election Year also displayed strength during its opening session bowing in third place with an estimated $30.9M which is three times its $10M production budget. The R-rated sequel averaged a sturdy $11,041 from 2,796 locations. Universal kept interest alive for the third chapter in the lucrative series as the debut for Election Year was about even with the opening of the last pic, Anarchy, which premiered to $29.8M two years ago in July. Studio data showed that the audience this weekend was 65% under 25, 75% non-white, and 53% female.Opening to weaker results, but carrying a much larger budget, was Steven Spielberg’s The BFG with an estimated $19.6M from 3,357 sites for a decent $5,834 average. Consumer interest was not too high for this PG-rated offering and the marketplace is already filled with other options for kids. July features more kidpics so the path ahead will be challenging even though those who see the film are liking it. Low-brow often beats high-brow when it comes to kid movies over summer vacation.Tumbling 60% to an estimated $16.5M in its second weekend was Independence Day: Resurgence which clearly was not one of the top choices for moviegoers over the Fourth of July holiday this year. Fox has banked $72.7M to date and could be headed for a $110-120M finish which would be less than half the gross of its 1996 predecessor despite tickets costing twice as much today.The action-comedy Central Intelligence dropped only 32% to an estimated $12.3M for a cume of $91.8M for Warner Bros. It should cross the century mark next weekend. The shark attack hit The Shallows followed with an estimated $9M in its second weekend, off 46%, for a $35.3M sum. Sony’s $17M pic should end at about $55-60M.Down 45% in its sophomore frame was the slave drama Free State of Jones with an estimated $4.1M. STX has grossed only $15.2M and is heading to a final of around $25M. Scary movies have been quite popular this summer and the hit sequel The Conjuring 2 placed ninth with an estimated $3.9M, down 50%, for a $95.3M cume for Warner Bros. Rounding out the top ten was fellow sequel Now You See Me 2 which fell 47% to an estimated $3M putting Lionsgate at $58.7M.The top ten films grossed an estimated $179.3M which was up 41% from last year when Inside Out rose to number one with $29.8M in its third weekend; and up 55% from 2014 when Transformers: Age of Extinction stayed in the top spot with $37.1M.Follow Gitesh on Twitter.","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"adventure, TV, FX, Black, telelvision, watch, Out, Lifetime, Poppins, christmas, new","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/03123956/600finding.jpg","slug":"box-office-dory-finds-top-spot-again"},{"id":"47509235709765","title":"Weekly Ketchup: Anchorman 2, Dracula: Year Zero, Twilight Zone and Much More","content":"\n\n                                            Weekly Ketchup\n                                        \n                        \n                        \n                            var mps=mps||{}; mps._queue=mps._queue||{}; mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[];\n                            mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function() {\n                                mps.rt.insertlogo('#article_sponsorship_ad', 'ploc=articlesponsorship');\n                            });\n                        \n                    \n                    \n                        Weekly Ketchup: Anchorman 2, Dracula: Year Zero, Twilight Zone and Much More\n                        Plus: Rocky Horror warps time and Robocop goes to a farther future\n                        by Greg Dean Schmitz | July 25, 2008                          | \n                          \n                              Comments\n                          \n                     \n\n                     \n\n                     \n                       \n                         \n                           \n                         \n                           \n                         \n                           \n                         \n                           \n                       \n                     \n\n                    \n                                                In this week’s Weekly Ketchup we’ve got the latest on plenty of remakes and sequels coming your way. Plus, check back Monday for an extra special edition of the Ketchup, in which we’ll give you all the hot news out of Comic-Con.\n\n#1 ANCHORMAN 2: RETURN TO WHORE ISLAND?\nDirector Adam McKay (Stepbrothers) told EW this week that he and Will Ferrell have indeed started work on an Anchorman sequel, which would show us what TV newsman Ron Burgundy was up to in the 1980s.  Hopefully, they can get most of the original cast together, and come up with as many instantly classic lines as “I love lamp” and “Great Odin’s Raven!”\n\n\n#2 LET’S PLEASE NOT DO THE TIME WARP AGAIN…\nNormally, I don’t cover made-for-cable movies in this column, but I’m making an exception in this case, because this one is particularly alarming, I think.  MTV has announced plans to remake The Rocky Horror Picture Show, using the original script, but possibly new music.  By taking was definitively a *live* experience (midnight shows all over the world packed with fans shouting things back at the screen) and putting it on M-T-“freaking”-V, there is no chance this can be anything but a disaster, and an insult to 30 years of Rocky Horror nights.  \n\n\n#3 IT WAS GREAT WHEN IT ALL BEGAN, I WAS A REGULAR VLADDY FAN…\nTalking to AICN, Dark City director Alex Proyas revealed that his likely next project after Knowing (starring Nicolas Cage) will be Dracula: Year Zero, an origin story about the Romanian prince, Vlad the Impaler, who sold his soul to the devil to protect his family and country from the threat of the Turks in the 15th century.  Alex Proyas is, I think, a great choice to direct a project like this, because he has a really great visual style, especially when he’s allowed to delve into really dark imagery.\n\n\n#4 LEONARDO DICAPRIO WANTS TO TAKE YOU TO THE TWILIGHT ZONE\nLeonardo DiCaprio‘s Appian Way production company is putting out feelers looking for pitches based upon episodes of the original Rod Serling-produced run of The Twilight Zone.  Unlike the 1983 film, Dicaprio’s version would be a series of feature length standalone films, with his eye towards potentially making more than one film.  There are really great concepts in the original series, and M. Night Shyamalan has basically built his career on feature films that feel like Twilight Zone episodes.  And Leonardo DiCaprio is actually an appropriate person to produce these movies, because I could see him stepping into Rod Serling’s shoes, and narrating and/or introducing each movie himself, just like Rod.\n\n\n#5 IF JOHN TRAVOLTA HAS TO PRETEND TO BE DIVINE AGAIN, WHY CAN’T IT BE A PINK FLAMINGOS REMAKE?\nWhat is left of New Line Cinema has hired director John Waters to write a treatment for a sequel to the musical remake of his original film, Hairspray.  If you want to follow the twisted cinematic genealogy here: John Waters made a movie, it became a broadway musical, which was adapted as a feature film starring ","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"Out, on, ABC, Dead, elm, halloween, jones","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Weekly-Ketchup-Anchorman-2-Dracula-Year-Zero-Twilight-Zone-and-Much-More"},{"id":"47509223237337","title":"Weekly Ketchup: Ron Howard takes on The Dark Tower","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Weekly Ketchup: Ron Howard takes on The Dark TowerPlus, Machete &amp; Ronald Reagan will return to theaters (not together)by Greg Dean Schmitz | September 10, 2010 |  CommentsLike last week, this shortened post-Labor Day week was a slow one for Hollywood, with many movers and shakers either taking even more time off or busy at festivals like Telluride, Venice and Toronto. The movies that did however get press this week include Universal’s ambitious plans to adapt Stephen King’s The Dark Tower, possible casting news for The Hobbit, sequel news for Machete and news of a Ronald Reagan biopic.THIS WEEK’S TOP STORYUNIVERSAL AND NBC REVEAL THEIR COMPLEX AND EPIC PLANS FOR THE DARK TOWERIn April, the news broke that Ron Howard, Imagine Entertainment and Universal Pictures were in negotiations about adapting Stephen King’s The Dark Tower series of novels into both a movie and a TV series. This week, Universal made their official announcement about The Dark Tower, and most of the news was stuff that was already revealed back in April. However, this is a really slow news week following Labor Day, so this story is still the week’s biggest news item (even if it’s not really news to fans who follow movie news consistently). Here’s what is news: the TV series will air on NBC, and it will supplement three feature films. Ron Howard (The Da Vinci Code, A Beautiful Mind) will be directing both the first movie and the first season (every episode?) of the TV series. Coproducer Akiva Goldsman (Batman &amp; Robin; cowriter of I, Robot, I Am Legend) will also write the first movie and the first season of the TV series. The first movie will be “immediately followed” by the TV series, which will serve as a bridge to the second film. After the second film, the TV series will then go back and follow Roland as a young man, which will likewise lead up to the third film “and beyond.” It’s unknown which of the seven novels will be adapted as the three movies, and likewise, which parts of the massive story will only be shown in the TV series. Stephen King also has plans for an eighth Dark Tower book tentatively titled The Wind Through the Keyhole, but that book was not mentioned in Universal/NBC’s announcement. As for what The Dark Tower is actually about, it’s a sprawling epic about the last member of an order of “gunslingers” that combines the American Old West with magical elements, in addition to alternate realities. The choice to adapt The Dark Tower as both three feature films and an ongoing TV series is a reflection of how lengthy and complex Stephen King’s seven books (to date) are, with a massive cast of characters and a complex fantasy narrative.FRESH DEVELOPMENTS THIS WEEK#1 WILL BILBO BAGGINS BE A HITCHHIKING OFFICE WORKER?Although the future of the two planned movie adaptations of J.R.R. Tolkien’s The Hobbit remains cloudy due to MGM’s financial problems, that studio and New Line Cinema are apparently still acting like they might still happen, and soon. The studios are reportedly talking to British actor Martin Freeman about starring as Bilbo Baggins (played in Lord of the Rings by Ian Holm). Martin Freeman is not a household name in the U.S., but he might be recognizable as Arthur Dent in The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy, and supporting roles in Hot Fuzz and Love, Actually, and for the U.K. version of The Office. Martin Freeman also now costars as Dr. Watson in the BBC series Sherlock, but MGM and New Line have proposed a schedule that would work around that television commitment. Of course, considering how far off filming of The Hobbit might just be, that’s probably not much of a difficult thing to accomplish. There’s also no firm word as to who will direct The Hobbit, but it appears that there is still a good chance that Peter Jackson will indeed continue making Tolkien movies, replacing Guillermo del Toro as director.#2 MACHETE WILL KILL AND KILL AGAINMachete got its start as a (then) fake trailer in the double feature movie Grindhouse, so fans might understandly have thought that (spoiler!) the teasers for Machete Kills and Machete Kills Again were just jokes to end the movie (see also: Mel Brooks’ History of the World Part II). “Machete don’t joke,” says producer and codirector Robert Rodriguez, promising that he already has ideas for the two sequels. Although 66-year-old Danny Trejo might be in his 70s by the time the third movie is released, the frequent Rodriguez costar is indeed expected to return for the sequels as the former Mexican Federale out for bloody vengeance. Rodriguez doesn’t say what Machete Kills might be specifically about, but does say that he already has a trailer (filmed, or just an idea, we don’t know), and the story idea. Whether Machete Kills actually gets made will depend upon how Machete does at the box office and on DVD/Blu Ray, but with a $11.4 million opening, the signs are good. Of course, the real obstacle to the Machete sequels getting made is Rodriguez’s already crowded development slate, which include the long-awaited Sin City 2. Robert Rodriguez’s next film will be Spy Kids 4: All the Time in the World (something that Rodriguez definitely does not have in order to make all the movies he’s promised).#3 KEANU REEVES IS A MEMBER OF GENERATION UMKeanu Reeves is best known now as an A-list star who stars in big-budget movies like the Matrix trilogy, Constantine and The Day the Earth Stood Still. So, it’s possibly easy to forget that Keanu’s roots include a fair number of indie-style movies like River’s Edge, Feeling Minnesota, and My Own Private Idaho (regardless of whether or not those movies were technically “indies”). More recently, Keanu has appeared in small roles in Thumbsucker, Ellie Parker and The Private Lives of Pippa Lee, and is also starring in the upcoming Henry’s Crime. Keanu’s latest indie movie is called Generation Um, and it also features Bojana Novakovic (Edge of Darkness) and Adelaide Clemens (currently unknown but she’s got an upcoming role in Mad Max: Fury Road). Keanu Reeves will star with those two young actresses in Generation Um as a man who spends a day immersing himself in “sex, drugs and indecision.” Generation Um was written by and will be directed by Mark L. Mann, whose only feature length film to date is the documentary Finishing Heaven about a man trying to finish filming the movie he started 37 years earlier. Filming of Generation Um started in New York City this week on September 9th.#4 HAWKEYE AND GRETEL?Classic children’s stories and fairy tales are hot commodities in Hollywood right now following the success of Alice in Wonderland. One of those is the Brothers Grimm’s Hansel and Gretel, which is the subject of two competing projects. Michael Bay is producing Hansel and Gretel in 3D, which is scheduled to start filming in Germany in the spring of 2011. This week’s news concerns the other film: Paramount Pictures’ Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters, a horror comedy which takes place 15 years after the incident at the gingerbread house, as Hansel and Gretel are now bounty hunters on the chase after wicked witches. While speaking to Norwegian press, Jeremy Renner (The Hurt Locker) revealed that he is in talks to star in the movie, along with Noomi Rapace, the star of the Swedish versions of The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo and the other two movies in the Millennium Trilogy. Soon after that news hit the web however, Renner’s “rep” contacted Entertainment Weekly to clarify that although there have been discussions, there are as yet no negotiations and certainly no deals. Which is basically what Renner had said (talks=discussions). Jeremy Renner does have a bit of a full schedule in the near future, as he will be starring in both the fourth Mission: Impossible movie and playing Hawkeye in The Avengers. It’s interesting to note that both of those movies are also Paramount productions, so his Hansel and Gretel “discussions” appear to be part of the studio holding onto the star as much as they can. Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters will be directed by Tommy Wirkola, the director of the Nazi zombie movie Dead Snow.#5 DANNY MCBRIDE AND THE OLYMPIC-SIZED MARQUEE-CHALLENGING TITLEWhen Meet the Fockers was released, that sequel’s title was something of a challenge for Universal to market, as the title was obviously very close to one of those words you can’t say on (regular) TV. Danny McBride (Pineapple Express) and Aziz Ansari (Human Giant, Funny People), who are currently filming 30 Minutes or Less in Michigan, have another new movie in the works with a title that is even edgier. The title of that comedy is Olympic-Sized Asshole, which MTV in reporting the title just lists as Olympic-Sized A–hole. The comedy is being written by Aziz Ansari and 30 Rock writer Matt Hubbard. Here’s how Danny McBride described the premise, “It’s about this Olympic athlete who comes back to his hometown and he bangs mine and Aziz’s girlfriends. So we go on this mission to destroy his Olympic life.”ROTTEN IDEAS OF THE WEEK#4 EVEN SAM PECKINPAH’S LEGACY IS VULNERABLE TO REMAKE FEVER: THE OSTERMAN WEEKENDSam Peckinpah directed just fourteen movies in his 1961-1983 film career, but his filmography, which includes The Wild Bunch, Straw Dogs, The Getaway and Bring Me the Head of Alfredo Garcia is beloved by movie fans. Peckinpah died in 1984, and his last film was the 1983 adaptation of the Robert Ludlum novel The Osterman Weekend, starring Rutger Hauer, John Hurt, Burt Lancaster and Craig T. Nelson. Rutger Hauer starred as a TV reporter who is recruited by the CIA to encourage known KGB agents to defect, which is a plan that (not surprisingly) doesn’t turn out that well for everyone involved. Following the success of the Jason Bourne films, the books by the late Robert Ludlum are a hot commodity in Hollywood, with adaptations of The Chancellor Manuscript and The Matarese Circle in development along with plans for a fourth Bourne movie. And now, Summit Entertainment is developing a new adaptation of The Osterman Weekend. Jesse Wigotow (It Runs in the Family) has been hired to adapt The Osterman Weekend. Wigutow worked (uncredited) on the Eminem movie 8 Mile and is currently adapting F. Scott Fitzgerald’s Tender is the Night and a Steve McQueen biopic called Divorcees. Although Peckinpah’s The Osterman Weekend was met with mixed critical reviews (43% on the Tomatometer), the criticism was mostly about the movie’s narrative style. Although “flawed” movies are often good candidates for remakes, this is still one of this week’s Rotten Ideas because this new adaptation will have an uphill struggle to match the legacy of Sam Peckinpah, even if The Osterman Weekend wasn’t one of his strongest movies.#3 A PRESIDENT ISN’T TRULY FAMOUS UNTIL HOLLYWOOD MAKES A BIOPIC: REAGAN GETS HISHollywood loves making biopics, but one career choice that is relatively uncovered (in comparison to say, musicians, athletes and painters) is acting itself. An actor who appears close to breaking that barrier is Ronald Reagan, who played the Gipper in Knute Rockne: All American, almost got the lead role in Casablanca and costarred with a chimpanzee in Bedtime for Bonzo. If that’s all Reagan ever did, he probably wouldn’t be getting his own biopic, unless he had died mysteriously perhaps like Bob Crane (Auto Focus) or George Reeves (Hollywoodland). Nope, Reagan is actually (obviously) more famous for what he left Hollywood for in 1964: politics. First-time producer Mark Joseph is teaming up with producer Ralph Winter (the X-Men franchise, Star Trek III-VI) on a $30 million biopic called Reagan which they hope to get done in time for a late 2011 release. Reagan will be based upon the biographies The Crusader and God and Ronald Reagan (both by Paul Kengor), and is being adapted by screenwriter Jonas McCord (The Body). Mark Joseph has been outspoken about his negative opinion of the 2003 Showtime miniseries The Reagans, so it is unlikely that Reagan will be similar to Oliver Stone’s W. In addition to the two careers that Reagan is most famous for, this quote from McCord suggests that the film will also focus on Reagan’s early life, which he says was, “a surreal Norman Rockwell painting with his alcoholic Catholic father, devout Christian mother, Catholic brother and ever-changing boarders the family took in.” This story also describes the movie as starting with the 1981 assassination attempt by John Hinckley (an unhinged fan trying to impress Jodie Foster), and then tell Reagan’s story leading up to his presidency through flashbacks. There’s no word yet as to who will be cast as Ronald Reagan, but the Hollywood Reporter has a casting poll up in which the front runners are currently Chris Pine and Zac Efron(!) Reagan is one of this week’s Rotten Ideas not because of Ronald Reagan himself, but mostly because the creative people involved don’t have the sort of filmographies one would normally associate with a high-profile biopic. Of course, that prediction could be turned around if a talented director is hired.#2 MULAN RETURNS TO BATTLE IN LIVE ACTIONDutch action director Jan de Bont started his film career off with two big hits (Speed, Twister), but his subsequent movies were less successful (Speed 2: Cruise Control, The Haunting and Tomb Raider: The Cradle of Life). Now, over seven years since the release of his last film, Jan de Bont is preparing to return with an adaptation of the Chinese 6th century tale of Hua-Mulan, a young girl who joined an all-male army and helped lead them to victory. The story of Hua-Mulan has most famously been previously adapted to film as the 1998 Disney animated movie Mulan, but there was also a Chinese live-action movie last year starring Zhao Wei. Jan de Bont’s Mulan will film this fall outside Shanghai, but it will also be in English and star Zhang Ziyi, who is familiar to Western audiences for her roles in Rush Hour 2, Hero, Memoirs of a Geisha and Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. The Mulan script has been adapted by newcomer screenwriter John Blickstead. Mulan is one of this week’s Rotten Ideas not because of the story itself (which is indeed a classic), but for Jan de Bont’s involvement as director. De Bont quickly established a reputation for “over the top” action sequences and also an over reliance on CGI in movies like The Haunting and Tomb Raider: The Cradle of Life.#1 LIAM NEESON AND MICHAEL CAINE CASH BIG CHECKS FOR BIG, (PROBABLY) DUMB MOVIESAlthough there weren’t that many movie news stories this week, two of the biggest announcements have a common theme, and so they are being run together here as the week’s most Rotten Idea(s). The common thread here is that of excellent older actors taking on roles that appear to be all about cashing massive checks to costar in movies that appear to otherwise be quite likely “rotten.” It’s far from a new phenomenon for well-respected actors to take roles like these, but that it continues to happen doesn’t make any more of a good idea. Instead, whenever a fine actor appears in a big budget movie, it just seems more often than not sort of like a cash grab. Of course, both of the actors in question this week have done this sort of thing before. First up, there’s Liam Neeson, who will be costarring as Admiral Shane in Universal’s adaptation of the board game Battleship. The movie about naval forces fighting off an alien invasion also stars Taylor Kitsch (Gambit in X-Men Origins: Wolverine) as Neeson’s future son-in-law, newcomer Brooklyn Decker as Neeson’s daughter, Alexander Skarsgard (True Blood) and singer Rihanna as a “weapons analyst.” Peter Berg (Hancock, The Rundown) is directing from a script by Jon and Erich Hoeber (cowriters of Whiteout and next month’s Red). Universal Pictures has scheduled Battleship for a big summer release date of May 18, 2012. Previous movies where Liam Neeson arguably starred in similar “cash grab” movies include Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace and the Clash of the Titans remake (where he played Zeus, following Sir Laurence Olivier’s similar “cash grab” appearance in the original movie).Also supplementing his retirement savings account this week is Sir Michael Caine, who will be playing the grandfather role in Journey 2: The Mysterious Island, the sequel to Journey to the Center of the Earth, loosely based upon another book by Jules Verne. The New Line Cinema sequel stars Josh Hutcherson (reprising his role from the first movie), along with Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson as his mom’s boyfriend. Hutcherson and Johnson’s characters will be going to a strange tropical island looking for Caine’s character, where the mysteries of the island include a massive hive of giant bees, which were not in Verne’s novel, but were included in the previous 1961 movie, animated by monster legend Ray Harryhausen. Journey 2: The Mysterious Island is being directed by Brad Peyton (Cats &amp; Dogs: The Revenge of Kitty Galore) from a script by Richard Outten (Pet Sematary II) and Bryan and Mark Gunn (cowriters of the direct-to-video Bring It On Again). Sir Michael Caine’s most infamous “cash grab” movie is definitely Jaws: The Revenge, which he was so busy filming that he had to film his Oscar acceptance speech for Hannah and Her Sisters from a remote filming location in the Bahamas. Here’s hoping that when Liam Neeson and Sir Michael Caine finish filming these big budget movies, they will be able to take some more roles in smaller movies that won’t so easily be labelled “Rotten Ideas.”For more Weekly Ketchup columns by Greg Dean Schmitz, check out the WK archive, and you can contact GDS via a RT forum message.","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"laika, 93rd, in, Golden, Worst, Grammys, festival, The, Family, Hallmark, video, Rocky, movies, 2019","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Weekly-Ketchup-Ron-Howard-takes-on-The-Dark-Tower"},{"id":"47508824296534","title":"Aubrey Plaza’s Five Favorite (Nun) Films","content":"Five Favorite Filmsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Aubrey Plaza's Five Favorite (Nun) Filmsby RT Staff | June 30, 2017 |  Comments(Photo by Priscilla Grant/Everett Collection)Best known for her dry, sometimes dark wit as April Ludgate on the hit NBC workplace comedy Parks and Recreation, Aubrey Plaza has successfully built an impressive résumé with several subsequent projects on film and television, including an acclaimed dramatic turn recently on FX’s&nbsp;Legion. This week, she stars alongside Kate Micucci and another NBC alum,&nbsp;Community‘s Alison Brie, in&nbsp;The Little Hours, a period comedy about a trio of nuns whose convent is turned upside down by the arrival of a handsome new hired hand (Dave Franco).

Plus, cult TV classic Freaks and Geeks is finally available to stream.by Jean Bentley | February 2, 2021 |  CommentsFebruary’s a short month, so&nbsp;it was no surprise when Hulu dropped a major release&nbsp;a few days early: Cult favorite one-season series Freaks and Geeks&nbsp;— created by Paul Feig, executive produced by Judd Apatow, and starring James Franco, Seth Rogen, Jason Segel, Linda Cardellini, and Busy Philipps, among others — headed to streaming on Monday, Janary 25.Set at a Midwestern high school in 1980, it took years&nbsp;to get&nbsp;even a DVD release thanks to its pricey music rights (for songs by the Grateful Dead, Billy Joel, Joan Jett, the Who, Rush, Styx, and more) — so its new streaming home is great news for fans of the 18-episode, 100% Certified Fresh dramedy.Other new TV highlights include a new two-episode documentary series on FX, Hip Hop Uncovered; the first installment of Into the Dark’s season 3, “Tentacles”; and an intriguing new episode of FX’s non-fiction New York Times Presents, “Framing Britney Spears,”&nbsp;a reexamination of the singer’s rise to fame, her career, and&nbsp;her controversial&nbsp;court-mandated conservatorship.Two Oscar-friendly films will debut on Hulu this month:&nbsp;Chloé Zhao’s Nomadland, starring Frances McDormand, and Lee Daniels’ Billie Holiday biopic&nbsp;The United States vs. Billie Holiday, starring Andra Day. Some&nbsp;theatrical releases&nbsp;hitting Hulu include Logan Lucky starring Channing Tatum, Adam Driver, and Daniel Craig; Possessor: Uncut from&nbsp;Brandon Cronenberg; and Guillermo del Toro’s Best Picture Oscar-winner The Shape of Water.Read on to find out what else is headed to the&nbsp;streaming service and what’s leaving in February, with a few highlights at the top.HIGHLIGHTSFreaks and Geeks: Season 1 (1999) 100%Description: High school students cope with life at a Michigan high school in 1980. Stories focused on sophomore Lindsay (Linda Cardellini), who discards her straight-A image to hang with the burnout crowd and her freshman brother Sam (John Francis Daley), who’s tormented by bullies but gets moral support from his nerdy pals.Critics Consensus:&nbsp;Freaks and Geeks lampoons real-life adolescence while affectionately embracing every growing pain along the way with refreshing honesty.Premiere Date:&nbsp;January 25The New York Times Presents: Season 1 (2020) - -&nbsp;“Framing Britney Spears”Description: The meteoric rise and disturbing fall of Britney Spears has devolved into a Kafkaesque court battle that has reawakened her fandom and raised pressing questions about mental health and an individuals’ rights. A re- examination of her career and a new assessment of the movement rallying against her court-mandated conservatorship capture the unsavory dimensions of the American pop-star machine.Premiere Date:&nbsp;February&nbsp;5Logan Lucky (2017) 92%Description: West Virginia family man Jimmy Logan teams up with his one-armed brother Clyde and sister Mellie to steal money from the Charlotte Motor Speedway in North Carolina. Jimmy also recruits demolition expert Joe Bang to help them break into the track’s underground system. Complications arise when a mix-up forces the crew to pull off the heist during a popular NASCAR race while also trying to dodge a relentless FBI agent.Critics Consensus:&nbsp;High-octane fun that’s smartly assembled without putting on airs, Logan Lucky marks a welcome end to Steven Soderbergh’s retirement — and proves he hasn’t lost his ability to entertain.Premiere Date:&nbsp;February&nbsp;17Nomadland (2021) 94%Description: Following the economic collapse of a company town in rural Nevada, Fern (Frances McDormand) packs her van and sets off on the road exploring a life outside of conventional society as a modern-day nomad. The third feature film from director Chloé Zhao, Nomadland features real nomads Linda May, Swankie and Bob Wells as Fern’s mentors and comrades in her exploration through the vast landscape of the American West.Critics Consensus:&nbsp;A poetic character study on the forgotten and downtrodden,&nbsp;Nomadland&nbsp;beautifully captures the restlessness left in the wake of the Great Recession.Premiere Date:&nbsp;February&nbsp;19The United States vs. Billie Holiday (2021) 56%Description: Billie Holiday, one of the greatest jazz musicians of all time, spent much of her career being adored by fans across the globe. Beginning in the 1940’s in New York City, the federal government targeted Holiday in a growing effort to escalate and racialize the war on drugs, ultimately aiming to stop her from singing her controversial and heart-wrenching ballad “Strange Fruit.”Premiere Date:&nbsp;February&nbsp;26Full List of Shows and Movies Coming to Hulu This MonthAvailable 2/1Series - - 60 Days In: Season 6 (2020) - - Abducted: The Mary Stauffer Story (2019) - - Ancient Aliens: Season 14 (2019) - - Mommy is a Murderer (2020) - - Pawn Stars: Season 11 (2015) - - Pawn Stars: Season 12 (2015) - - Tempted By Danger (2020)Bride &amp; Prejudice: Forbidden Love: Complete Season 2 (Lifetime)Forged in Fire: Beat the Judges: Complete Season 1 (History)Kings of Pain: Complete Season 1 (History)Married At First Sight: Complete Season 10 (Lifetime)The Secret of Skinwalker Ranch: Complete Season 1 (History)The UnXplained with William Shatner: Complete Season 2 (History)Movies 83% 9 to 5 (1980) 88% Affliction (1997) 69% American Psycho (2000) 0% American Psycho II: All American Girl (2002) 70% The Bellboy (1960) 33% Bug (1975) 60% Cinderfella (1960) 12% Did You Hear About the Morgans?

So when we get to this time of the year, there’s really not much in the realm of “movie development news” to discuss. This is especially true in a weekly column which normally includes 10 different stories. So, this week and next, we’re going to instead review 12 of the year’s top stories, presented to you in monthly chronology. The year-in-review begins with the “Fresh Developments” which here also serve (mostly) as the “Top Stories” of the year.&nbsp; Our retrospective begins with one of the year’s biggest stories, which was…Also read: The 12 Most Rotten Hollywood Headlines of 2015Top Story Of the yearSPIDER-MAN JOINS THE MARVEL CINEMATIC UNIVERSEOne of the most confusing things about superhero movies for people not deeply invested in following them is the division between the cinematic adaptations of various Marvel Comics characters. Try explaining explaining why&nbsp;The Avengers, X-Men, Spider-Man, and The Fantastic Four all reside at separate studios. Well, in FEBRUARY, after a few months of rumors and speculation, Marvel Studios and Sony Pictures announced that they had come to a resolution that will bring Spider-Man to the Marvel Cinematic Universe films produced by Marvel Studios. The new version of Spider-Man will debut in Captain America: Civil War on 5/6/16, because Spider-Man was a big part of Civil War in the comics, and also because it’s Marvel’s next big movie. The web-slinger will then star in a new solo movie for Sony Pictures, which Marvel Studios and Kevin Feige will produce and will be scheduled for July 28, 2017. The new Spider-Man was announced in June as 19-year-old Tom Holland, answering a search for an actor who can credibly portray Peter Parker as being an actual teenager still in high school. With Spider-Man now joining the MCU, that also opens the door for various MCU characters (including those not yet introduced) to appear in Sony’s movies, in addition to Marvel’s. As for the money behind all of this, the arrangement is described as being more like a “lease” than a sale, with no money being exchanged, and Sony benefiting from Marvel’s talent, creative supervision, and input, while Marvel obviously benefits from getting a big chunk of their characters back. So, going forward, you only have to explain to your confused uncle how Marvel’s characters are only split in half instead of thirds.JANUARY: MELISSA MCCARTHY HEADLINES NEW ALL-FEMALE GHOSTBUSTERS CREWAdmittedly, we still don’t know whether next summer’s (7/15/16) reboot of Ghostbusters, with an all-female crew of stars, will be Fresh with the critics. But the reveals of the new cast were certainly among the biggest stories of early 2015. It started in January with the news that Melissa McCarthy was in talks for one of the four slots, and she&nbsp;was soon followed by Saturday Night Live alum (and McCarthy’s Bridesmaids costar) Kristen Wiig and two current members of the show’s cast, Kate McKinnon and Leslie Jones. They were joined later in 2015 by various announcements about new roles for original Ghostbusters stars Sigourney Weaver, Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, Ernie Hudson, and Annie Potts. Rick Moranis apparently decided not to join them, and of course, Harold Ramis died on February 24, 2014.MARCH:&nbsp;DISNEY OFFICIALLY ANNOUNCES FROZEN 2When any movie earns over $1.27 billion, it shouldn’t be particularly surprising when the studio eventually announces plans for some sort of sequel or follow-up, but that doesn’t mean it’s still not really, really big news for all of the fans. Such is exactly what happened for the Frozen franchise in March (just as the short film Frozen Fever was premiering in theaters in front of Cinderella that weekend). The announcement wasn’t particularly lengthy, but it did include a few crucial details, such as the return of directors Chris Buck and Jennifer Lee, and voice actor Josh Gad as the voice of Olaf the comic relief snowman. What was specifically missing in the announcement was the rest of the voice cast, including Kristen Bell (Anna) and Idina Menzel (Elsa), but… their omissions were probably just due to continuing negotiations. For example, Idina Menzel has already talked relatively recently about plans for a Frozen sequel. As for when Frozen 2 can be expected in theaters, fans should probably dress snugly, because the wait in Arendelle might be a few years. Walt Disney Animated Features has already scheduled their next three feature films, which Frozen 2 would ostensibly have to follow. The animal comedy Zootopia is scheduled for March 4, 2016; the Pacific Islands adventure Moana is scheduled for November 23, 2016, and the “Jack and the Beanstalk” adventure Giants is scheduled for March 9, 2018. So, it’s probably going to be at least three years yet before Frozen 2 will be ready for release.APRIL:&nbsp;EDDIE REDMAYNE TO STAR IN HARRY POTTER SPINOFFAs Warner Bros prepared to launch its next franchise with J.K. Rowling, one of this year’s critical darlings emerged as the studio’s top choice to star. The spinoff franchise is called Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them (as you may now know since the teaser trailer has gone live since), and the key character in all of it is the book’s “author,” Newt Scamander.&nbsp; The actor that Warner Bros landed as Newt Scamander is Eddie Redmayne, who won the Best Actor Academy Award this year for his portrayal of Stephen Hawking in The Theory of Everything. Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them is seen by Warner Bros as the first of a new franchise of films featuring Newt Scamander in his adventures in the magical New York City of the 1930s. The first movie (11/18/16) will be directed by David Yates, who directed the most recent Harry Potter movies, and also has the Legend of Tarzan coming in 2016 (7/1/16), also with Warner Bros. A trailer for Fantastic Beasts is now already available, and you can watch it here.MAY: X-MEN FRANCHISE EXPANDS WITH SPINOFF THE NEW MUTANTSIt’s been known for a while that 20th Century Fox has had plans for spinoffs of their successful X-Men franchise, including solo movies for Deadpool (2/12/16) and Gambit (10/7/16), and talk of an X-Force team movie. In May, the news broke that one of the potentially most promising spinoffs will indeed be the long-rumored title The New Mutants, which 20th Century Fox has hired director Josh Boone (The Fault in Our Stars) to co-write and direct. In a few ways, The New Mutants might be the most appropriate property 20th Century Fox could have chosen, since, like the planned movie, it was itself Marvel’s first (of many that followed) X-Team spinoff series when it launched in 1982. With The New Mutants, the focus was less on students that moonlighted as superheroes, and more on characters who really were students first and foremost but whose mutant natures also frequently forced them into having adventures, teen romances, and journeys of self-discovery. For the most part, the core team of The New Mutants has not really been featured in Fox’s movies previously, which may have been a clue all along that the studio was planning on someday making the movie. Of course, the question that still lingers is exactly what relationship The New Mutants will have to Fox’s plans for an X-Force movie, since in the comics, the original X-Force team actually grew out of The New Mutants (which suggests that the X-Force movie might indeed be a sequel to The New Mutants).JUNE: CLINT EASTWOOD DIRECTING CAPTAIN SULLENBERGER BIOPICFollowing the surprise runaway success of American Sniper, Clint Eastwood became an unusually hot director (especially for someone 85 years old), and his decades-old studio home at Warner Bros spent a few months trying to find a suitable deal for Eastwood’s next film. Some of the possibilities had included the Richard Jewell biopic (which remains at 20th Century Fox), and the long-in-development next version of A Star is Born (which Bradley Cooper is now believed to be directing instead). Warner Bros began negotiations in June to acquire the rights to Sully, the true story of pilot Chesley “Sully” Sullenberger, who successfully landed a passenger airliner on the Hudson River on January 15, 2009, saving the lives of all 155 passengers and crew on board. The script by Todd Komarnicki (2007’s Perfect Stranger) reportedly delves deeper into “behind the scenes” intrigue that the public was not aware of at the time. Clint Eastwood did eventually sign on to direct Sully, and Tom Hanks later came on to play the good Captain.&nbsp;Sully is now filming, and expected to be one of Warner Bros’ contenders for awards season in late 2016.JULY:&nbsp;HAN SOLO TO GET HIS OWN “SOLO” PREQUELAdmittedly, the second week of July (right before San Diego Comic-Con) had two big movies about characters getting their own solo films, with the first being Ben Affleck’s Batman (which he will also direct). We’re giving the advantage here to the reveal that Star Wars favorite Han Solo will be featured in a prequel that shows one of his early adventures. The Han Solo prequel, showing what the smuggler was doing before he ever met Luke Skywalker, will be directed by the team of Phil Lord and Chris Miller, following their successes with such films as Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs, 21 Jump Street, and The LEGO Movie. This Han Solo movie was written by Lawrence Kasdan, with his son Jon Kasdan. The elder Kasdan’s previous Star Wars screenwriting work includes The Empire Strikes Back, Return of the Jedi, and this year’s Star Wars: The Force Awakens. We don’t know the final title yet, but this Han Solo prequel is scheduled for May 25, 2018. We also don’t know quite yet which young actor will take over from Harrison Ford, but Lucasfilm is certainly being exhaustive in their search. The producers have reportedly met or seen video from over 2,500 young actors, including actors like Aaron Taylor-Johnson, Ansel Elgort, and Dave Franco. We expect to hear who will be the next Han Solo sometime in 2016.AUGUST: LEONARDO DICAPRIO TO MAKE SIXTH MOVIE WITH MARTIN SCORSESEDirector Martin Scorsese has collaborated with Robert De Niro for eight movies now, but Leonardo DiCaprio, who has been in five Scorsese films, is definitely catching up. In August, it was announced that Scorsese and DiCaprio are reuniting for what will be their sixth film working together. That film is the long-in-development adaptation of the Erik Larson non-fiction book, The Devil in the White City: Murder, Magic, and Madness at the Fair That Changed America. There was a studio auction for the rights to this package, and the winner was Paramount Pictures, which is in need of hot properties (as the studio is currently #5 in market share). Leonardo DiCaprio will play one of the most prolific serial killers in American history, Doctor H.H. Holmes, who is believed to have killed anywhere from 27 to over 200 people during Chicago’s World’s Fair of 1893. Holmes constructed “The World’s Fair Hotel,” which he was secretly using to lure his victims to their deaths, in “a haunt that had a gas chamber, crematorium and a dissecting table where Holmes would murder his victims and strip their skeletons to sell for medical and scientific study.”&nbsp;The Devil in the White City is being adapted by screenwriter Billy Ray (Captain Phillips, The Hunger Games).SEPTEMBER: MONSTER MASHUP KING KONG VS GODZILLA IN THE WORKS&nbsp;Years of frustration over situations like the split of Marvel Comics characters between Marvel Studios and Fox have conditioned fans not to expect certain “dream movies” to happen, due to rights and licensing issues. In a surprise deal in September, however, the skies did indeed part, and a potentially “awesome” movie mashup is now possible that previously seemed so unlikely that few fans or pundits ever even thought of it. In 2014, Warner Bros released a successful reboot of the Godzilla franchise, which was produced by Legendary Pictures, a company that then moved to Universal Pictures. At Universal, Legendary has been developing another new monster reboot called Kong: Skull Island, which is currently scheduled for release on March 10, 2017. That film will be directed by Jordan Vogt-Roberts (The Kings of Summer), and will feature a cast including Tom Hiddleston (Marvel’s Loki), Brie Larson (Trainwreck), Samuel L. Jackson, John C. Reilly, and Tom Wilkinson. Now, here’s where things get surprising. Legendary Pictures has announced that Kong: Skull Island (which may get a new title) is moving to Warner Bros, Legendary’s former studio home. All of this is being done with the expectation that the King Kong reboot will be followed by Godzilla 2 (6/8/18) (which is expected to introduce other Toho giant monsters like perhaps Mothra, Rodan or King Ghidorah). Then, both of those movies would be followed by a giant movie that would basically be a reboot of King Kong vs Godzilla, Toho’s original 1962 movie mashup. All of this is possible in large extent because King Kong itself is in the public domain, and because all of this also falls within the legacy of Toho Studios, which remains the source of Legendary’s license to make these big big budget Godzilla reboot movies.OCTOBER:&nbsp;WES ANDERSON GOES TO THE DOGS WITH ANOTHER STOP-MOTION COMEDYFollowing the success of The Grand Budapest Hotel (including four Academy Award wins), director Wes Anderson has decided upon his next film, and it will be a return to one of his most unique directorial styles. For his sixth feature film as director in 2009, Wes Anderson made the unusual decision to direct a stop-motion animated movie called Fantastic Mr. Fox, based on a children’s novel by Roald Dahl. We don’t know the title yet for this new stop-motion comedy, except that it will be about a group of dogs. It didn’t take long for us to find out who the dogs will be voiced by, because the news also came the same week, directly from one of those actors. Jeff Goldblum revealed that he will be joined by Bob Balaban (Best in Show), Bryan Cranston (Breaking Bad), and frequent Wes Anderson collaborator Edward Norton as the voices of the four lead dogs. Goldblum also mentioned that the film will be “Japanese-inspired,” but what exactly that means right now is extremely open to interpretation.NOVEMBER:&nbsp;EDGAR WRIGHT TO DIRECT DREAMWORKS ANIMATION’S ME AND MY SHADOWIf you’re one of those people who regularly follows film development news and have been doing so for a while, you might recall an animated project from a few years ago called Me and My Shadow. The movie first made the news in 2010 as a DreamWorks Animation project that would combine CG and traditional animation in its telling of “Shadow Stan, an incredibly frustrated shadow that yearns for a more dynamic life but happens to be stuck with Stanley Grubb, the world’s most boring human.” In 2010, Me and My Shadow was expected to be released in March of 2013, but obviously, that never happened. As of last month, Me and My Shadow appears to have been given a new chance at actually being released, and it’s via one of online fandom’s most popular directors. Edgar Wright (Shaun of the Dead, Hot Fuzz), who is currently filming his next project, Baby Driver, is now attached to make his animated feature film debut with Me and My Shadow. It’s not yet known if the film will still be a traditional/CGI hybrid, or how far away the film might be from release (but a good guess is that it will be a while yet).DECEMBER: MARVEL LANDS CATE BLANCHETT FOR&nbsp;THOR: RAGNAROKHollywood is increasingly divided into three camps: those who have worked with Marvel, those who have worked with WB/DC, and those who just haven’t landed their opportunity yet. (Though there are at least 15 who have done both, they are still a relative minority.) There are still some major players who have not yet signed on for their turn at a superhero role, but that list grows a little smaller with each big new film that casts up. Earlier this month, we were able to cross Cate Blanchett off that list, as she is now in talks to take an unspecified role in Marvel’s Thor: Ragnarok (11/3/17). Although Blanchett’s role is being kept secret for now, there are at least three major roles that are both likely to be in Thor: Ragnarok and could be played by her. Let’s address them in reverse order of Blanchett’s probability of playing them. First, there’s Brunnhilde the Valkyrie, who has already been semi-confirmed as appearing in Thor: Ragnarok, but who is the most physical of our three guesses, which is not Cate Blanchett’s most obvious wheelhouse. A second possibility is Amora the Enchantress, and although Cate Blanchett has played a sorceress before (in the Lord of the Rings movies), Marvel might be more likely to cast a young actress for the role (Blanchett will turn 48 in 2017). A third possibility is Hela, the ruler of Hel, the Norse afterworld, who in the comics is the daughter of Loki (though being immortals, this point might be more fixable). Thor: Ragnarok will also feature Mark Ruffalo as the Hulk, and will be directed by Taika Waititi (codirector of What We Do in the Shadows).","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"star, dragons, sag, Showtime, Mudbound, video, Summer, Sematary, disaster","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/25164811/SpiderManYearlyKetchup.jpg","slug":"the-12-biggest-hollywood-headlines-of-2015"},{"id":"47508663102077","title":"Your Weekly Binge: Flashing Swords, A Digital Afterlife, And A New Landmark British Laugh Fest","content":"Binge Guidevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Your Weekly Binge: Flashing Swords, A Digital Afterlife, And A New Landmark British Laugh FestWhat's the RT staff watching while stuck at home? We're giving you a new weekly guide to inspire your next big binge.by RT Staff | May 8, 2020 |  CommentsThe Rotten Tomatoes staff is working remotely right now, doing the responsible thing and “social distancing.” And like much of America, and the world, we’re spending a lot of our time – when we’re not working, of course – catching up on the shows and movies waiting for us on our watchlists, and digging around the various streaming services to find previously undiscovered gems. Every week for the next little while,&nbsp;we will be highlighting what our staff members are watching while at home in the hope that we’ll inspire you to discover something new and Fresh, and that you can watch along with us.Check out last week’s Weekly Binge, with&nbsp;Little Fires Everywhere,&nbsp;Merlin,&nbsp;The Plot Against America,&nbsp;Rake, and moreThe Last Kingdom  91%&nbsp;(Netflix)Berserker Vikings fans will likely have already tasted The Last Kingdom, in which Uhtred, the eldest son of the Saxon Lord of Bebbanburg, is taken as a slave by the Viking raiders that killed his father and later returns to his homeland claim his birthright. Alexander Dreymon (American Horror Story) plays the swaggering hero, and season 4 of the one-time BBC America series just premiered on Netflix in April. The cast includes David Dawson as King Alfred the Great, to whom Uhtred pledges his sword as part of a peace treaty and later in return for land and to become an Ealdorman. Ian Hart appears as Uhtred’s priest-confidante Beocca, while Emily McKenna Cox and Tobias Santelmann are the warrior’s adopted siblings Brida and Ragnar. The Last Kingdom, with series Tomatometer score of 91%, makes a fine binge if you miss Vikings and need a jolt of Danish raids, flashing swords, and 9th-century English politics. – Debbie Day, Sr. TV EditorWhere to watch: NetflixCommitment: 31.5 hours (across four seasons)DAVE: Season 1 (2020)  72% (FXX)Dave is a grower. The raunchy FXX comedy, starring Dave “Lil Dicky” Burd as a fictionalized version of himself, does not make the most inviting of first impressions. Rambling with the fretful patter of an adult baby, Burd spends the early going oversharing about his malformed anatomy whenever he isn’t talking up his rapping prowess. Viewers who aren’t charmed by genitalia jokes may dismiss the first few episodes as a successful musician delivering an edgy valentine to himself. Gradually, however, Dave blossoms into something meaningful: It’s about how every success story takes a village. The series makes excellent use of Lil Dicky’s inner circle, each of his friends harboring relatable aspirations and foibles. We come to appreciate this oddball community and the inexplicably talented man-child who binds them all together. By the end of the first season, we truly believe that Licky Dicky has the goods. So does his show. –&nbsp;Rob Fowler, Review CuratorWhere to watch: Stream on FX Networks app or Hulu; buy or rent on FandangoNOW, Vudu, Amazon, or Google Play.Commitment:&nbsp;5 hours (one season)This Country  96% (BBC)This British mockumentary comedy series had completely escaped my attention until I heard Phoebe Waller-Bridge recommending it on a podcast earlier this year, and it turns out – shocking, I know – that Waller-Bridge has good taste. This Country is brilliant, the kind of seemingly out-of-nowhere gem that you know is going to do big things for everyone involved. (Seriously, it has the feel of Spaced or the U.K. version of The Office.) The “everyone involved” here mostly happen to be from the same family; the series was created by siblings Daisy May and Charlie Cooper, who also star in it as&nbsp;Kerry and Kurtan, two&nbsp;cousins&nbsp;from a village in Southwestern England who are the main subjects of a BBC documentary series about disaffected youth in the rural U.K. The duo’s real-life father plays Kerry’s dad, while their uncle plays a local grouch. The cousins wander the village doing s—t-all, dreaming up small schemes and games to pass the time, and it’s all extremely funny. But what makes This Country truly special – and a multiple British Academy Television Awards winner for two years straight – is its heart. The bond between the cousins and the tenderness and empathy with which every character around them is handled make This Country as moving as it is hilarious. –&nbsp;Joel Meares, Editor-in-ChiefWhere to watch:&nbsp;HuluCommitment:&nbsp;Approx. 5 hours (for two seasons; season 3 is not available in the U.S.)Dispatches from Elsewhere: Season 1 (2020)  86%&nbsp;(AMC)Full disclosure: I didn’t actually binge Dispatches from Elsewhere. I watched in real time, as it was happening (by which I mean the next day on the AMC app). That said, Dispatches from Elsewhere is a show you will want to binge. It’s cliché to say, but here I am, typing this sentence: Dispatches From Elsewhere is like no other TV show I have ever seen. It’s like a mysteriously philosophical scavenger hunt full of art and wonder and. The show begins in one place and ends somewhere you would never expect… and I can’t say anything else at risk of ruining the joy of the journey. Jason Segel, Sally Field, André 3000, and the wonderful Eve Lindley are a dream team, and Richard E. Grant’s particular brand of charming intensity is put to great use. It’s a fairly introspective show, and while that might not seem appealing when we’re stuck inside with only our thoughts to keep us company, I promise it’s more comforting than existential dread–inducing.&nbsp;– Haña Lucero-Colin, TV Curation ManagerWhere to watch: AMC, YouTube TV (with subscription), Sling TV; buy on YouTube, iTunes, or AmazonCommitment: 10 hours (one season)Upload: Season 1 (2020)  88% (Amazon Prime)Upload is a charming romantic comedy-mystery drizzled in existential horror. On the verge of death after an accident, Nathan Brown (Robbie Amell) is coerced by his clingy, controlling girlfriend (Allegra Edwards) into forgoing surgery, and having his consciousness uploaded to an idyllic, vacation-like simulation, where a digital version of himself (and, eventually, his girlfriend) will live for eternity. It’s like heaven… if heaven exists in a trillion-dollar conglomerate’s computer servers, you have no privacy, and the wealthy sponsor paying your bills in the living world chooses how comfortably you get to live. With the help of his “Angel,” Nora (Andy Allo), Nathan navigates what it means to die, and whether a perfect afterlife can ever be as satisfying and meaningful as an imperfect regular life. Oh, and someone may have had him killed, so he’s trying to figure that whole thing out, too! If you are looking to explore the meaning of life but need a heavy dose of laughter to do it, Upload just might be for you. –&nbsp;Tyler Lorenz, Media CoordinatorWhere to watch:&nbsp;Amazon PrimeCommitment:&nbsp;4 hours (one season)Outlander  89% (Stars)Based on Diana Gabaldon’s best-selling novels, Outlander is a historical fantasy romance that stars Sam Heughan and Caitriona Balfe as Jaime and Claire Fraser, and the show follows along their passionate and loving journey. It’s a little bit of Pride and Prejudice&nbsp;with some Game of Thrones in there. However, what makes Outlander stand out above its peers is that it’s confident and committed to the stories it wants to tell for both its male and female characters and does so in a uniquely thoughtful and gripping manner. Above all, it is unapologetically entertaining – which is welcome right now. Keep a special eye on Tobias Menzies and Maria Doyle Kennedy, who stand out even among the&nbsp;fantastic ensemble cast. After one episode, you will most certainly be swept off your feet by Jaime and Claire. After two, you’ll never get the gorgeous theme song out of your head. &nbsp;–&nbsp;Daisy&nbsp;Gonzalez, Theatrical Review CuratorWhere to watch: Netflix (seasons 1-3), Starz (seasons 1-5); buy or rent on FandangoNOW, Amazon, or iTunesCommitment:&nbsp;Approx. 100 hours (five seasons)Better Things  97%&nbsp;(FX)It’s totally understandable if the last thing you want to watch &nbsp;is a show about the entertainment industry, especially an actor. But Better Things is less of a “Stars: They’re Just Like Us” and more like a “Stars: I Empathize With and Sometimes Feel Sorry for Them.” Plus, it’s the perfect Mother’s Day binge watch. Pamela Adlon is Sam Fox, an actress who is always hustling from one gig to the next. She’s also a single mother of three daughters, cares for her elderly mother who lives across the street, and doles out alimony to her ex-husband (the only issue I have with the show is that she married this loser in the first place). The show is interspersed with cozy moments of Sam cooking, cuddling on the couch with her family, drinking and trash-talking with friends, and unexpected plot detours. Stars may never be just like us, but you’d be lucky if Sam was just like&nbsp;someone you know. – Sara Ataiiyan, Review CuratorWhere to watch:&nbsp;FXNow, Hulu; rent or buy on FandangoNOW, Vudu, iTunes, or Google PlayCommitment:&nbsp;17.5 hours (four seasons)Check out our regular May Binge Guide.&nbsp;Thumbnail image:&nbsp;Jessica Kourkounis/AMC,&nbsp;Adrienn Szabo/Netflix, BBC","section":"Binge Guide","tags":"know, Ovation, Go, slashers, Tarantino, space, TV, Mudbound, Arts","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/07155149/Weekly-Binge.jpg","slug":"your-weekly-binge-flashing-swords-a-digital-afterlife-and-a-new-landmark-british-laugh-fest"},{"id":"47509015879505","title":"Star Jacob Latimore and Executive Producers Lena Waithe, Common Talk The Chi","content":"Video Interviewsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Star Jacob Latimore and Executive Producers Lena Waithe, Common Talk The Chiby RT Staff | March 16, 2018 |  CommentsRotten Tomatoes’ Jacqueline Coley&nbsp;talked&nbsp;The Chi&nbsp;with star&nbsp;Jacob Latimore, who plays Emmett Washington, and&nbsp;executive producers Lena Waithe and Common,&nbsp;who also appears as Rafiq in the Showtime series, at South by Southwest 2018 in Austin, Texas.

Reilly Reunite to Play Holmes and Watson, Plus More Movie NewsJared Leto joins the Blade Runner sequel, John Turturro takes on a Big Lebowski spinoff, Spider-Man: Homecoming has its new Mary Jane, and Clue is getting remade.by Greg Dean Schmitz | August 19, 2016 |  CommentsThis week’s Ketchup brings you another ten headlines from the world of film development news (those stories about what movies Hollywood is working on for you next). Included in the mix this time around are stories about such titles as The Little Mermaid, the Blade Runner sequel, and remakes of both Clue and Witness for the Prosecution.This WEEK’S TOP STORYFERRELL AND REILLY TO REUNITE AS SLEUTHS HOLMES AND WATSONAugust 4th, 2016 marked the 10th anniversary of the release of Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby, starring Will Ferrell and John C. Reilly, who also costarred together in 2008’s Step Brothers. Over the last eight years, Ferrell and Reilly have considered other projects to&nbsp;be their third movie together (including the possibility of a Step Brothers sequel), but none of them have come to fruition yet. Based on the language in this week’s announcement, it’s sounding like that third Ferrell/Reilly movie will be a detective comedy called Holmes and Watson. As the title suggests, Holmes and Watson will be based upon the characters Sherlock Holmes and Doctor John Watson, as created by Arthur Conan Doyle, and as previously adapted to film dozens of times. John C. Reilly is actually replacing Sacha Baron Cohen (Borat, The Dictator), who had previously been attached to costar as Watson. In addition to starring, Ferrell is also producing via his Gary Sanchez production company for Sony Pictures, and filming&nbsp;is expected to start later this year after the Thanksgiving holiday. It’s not yet known if Holmes and Watson will retain the 19th century setting of Doyle’s stories, or if the characters will still be British (Ferrell and Reilly are both Americans, but so is Robert Downey Jr). There’s no release date for Holmes and Watson yet, but Warner Bros may give it competition relatively soon, as Robert Downey Jr, Jude Law, and director Guy Ritchie have been talking about making a third Sherlock Holmes movie for a few years now.&nbsp; On TV, the fourth season of the contemporary Sherlock, starring Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman, is expected to air on BBC and PBS in 2017.&nbsp;Holmes and Watson will be directed by Etan Cohen (Get Hard) from his own screenplay (Cohen also previously wrote Men in Black 3, and cowrote Idiocracy, Tropic Thunder, and Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa).Fresh Developments1.&nbsp;BEN AFFLECK TO REMAKE 1957 CLASSIC WITNESS FOR THE PROSECUTIONEven as yet another remake (Ben-Hur) goes into the weekend with a Rotten Tomatometer score and low box office expectations, Hollywood is still developing new remakes of classic late-1950s movies. Within the larger trend of remakes, this particular story is part of a more specific group at 20th Century Fox, which has&nbsp;committed to remaking movies based on Agatha Christie mysteries (the first such film being next year’s Murder on the Orient Express, scheduled for November 22, 2017). The 1974 Murder on the Orient Express was nominated for six Academy Awards (and won one for Ingrid Bergman), and this week’s news concerns a remake of another film which was also nominated for six Academy Awards. 20th Century Fox is reportedly finalizing negotiations with their former Daredevil star Ben Affleck to direct and star in a remake of 1957’s Witness for the Prosecution. Although the prospect of a remake of Witness for the Prosecution doesn’t otherwise seem particularly Fresh, Affleck is currently 3-for-3 as a director (Gone Baby Gone, The Town, and Argo are all Certified Fresh).&nbsp;Witness for the Prosection is a legal mystery drama about a man accused of murder whose wife is called to testify against him because she was already married to someone else (making their marriage illegal, and thus, removing the marital legal protections). Sir Charles Laughton played the attorney in the original film, and Tyrone Power (in his last role) played the accused, but it’s not yet known which character Ben Affleck might be playing. Affleck’s next film as director will be Live by Night (1/13/16), and he is also expected to direct the next solo Batman movie (release date TBD), so it may be a while yet before Witness for the Prosecution gets remade.2. JARED LETO JOINING HARRISON FORD IN BLADE RUNNER SEQUELIf you only saw one thing in your social networking feed(s) this week about actor Jared Leto, it might have had something to do with his recent supervillain adventure, Suicide Squad. Specifically, at a fan event for his band Thirty Seconds to Mars, Leto was quoted (and caught on video) saying that he felt “tricked” into appearing in the film as the Joker, dropping an “F bomb” directed at his studio employers. All of that may eventually require Ben Affleck and Warner Bros to find a new actor to play the Joker in the solo Batman movie (a la Mark Ruffalo replacing Edward Norton as Banner/Hulk), but that remains to be seen. In the meantime, Jared Leto has joined the cast of the sequel to Blade Runner, which already included Harrison Ford, Ryan Gosling, Barkhad Abdi, Dave Bautista, Mackenzie Davis, and Robin Wright. (Back in 2014, there had been rumors that Gosling might have played the Joker in Suicide Squad before Jared Leto signed on.) Whatever this Blade Runner sequel ends up being called, it will be directed Denis Villeneuve (Sicario, The Arrival) and it is scheduled for release on October 6, 2017.3. JOHN “JESUS” TURTURRO TO STAR IN A BIG LEBOWSKI SPINOFFIn the 18 years since the Coen brothers directed The Big Lebowski, the film —&nbsp; starring Jeff Bridges as “The Dude” —&nbsp;has taken on a new life as one of the few true cult films of the last 20 years, including festivals devoted specifically to the film, and so, so, so much merchandising. Joel and Ethan Coen wrote, directed, and produced The Big Lebowski based on their own characters, so this week’s news comes as quite a surprise. The Coens have apparently given John Turturro their approval to write, direct, and star in a spinoff of The Big Lebowski, focused on Turturro’s “Jesus Quintana” bowling enthusiast. The independent film in question is called Going Places, and it is also an English language remake of the 1974 French sex comedy Les Valseuses (which is French slang for testicles). John Turturro is already filming Going Places, and other cast members include Bobby Cannavale, Audrey Tautou, and Susan Sarandon. It appears that Turturro is playing the character originally played by Gerard Depardieu in the sex/crime comedy about two criminals on the run who compete for the “romantic” affections of Tautou’s character (with Sarandon playing an ex-con recently out of prison). Although the original has a Fresh Tomatometer score, not all critics agreed; Roger Ebert gave it a score of just 1 star out of 5, writing that it was “the most misogynistic movie I can remember; its hatred of women is palpable and embarrassing.” John Turturro’s remake is a tentative “Fresh Development” based on the Tomatometer score for both Les Valseuses and the Coens’ fan favorite, The Big Lebowski.4. HAMILTON STAR LIN-MANUEL MIRANDA TO WRITE NEW SONGS FOR THE LITTLE MERMAIDThe 1989 animated Disney musical The Little Mermaid is widely beloved (and credited for Waking Sleeping Beauty), so it was probably inevitable that the studio’s “live action fairy tale” plans would eventually include The Little Mermaid. We heard as much earlier this year, but this week brought the first substantial news that the studio is actively developing their new Little Mermaid. Walt Disney Pictures has hired longtime Disney composer Alan Menken (whose credits include, yes, The Little Mermaid) and Hamilton star Lin-Manuel Miranda to start work on new songs for the live-action remake. Miranda will also be producing the new film (though it’s unconfirmed whether he will also costar), and it will be&nbsp;the third major project at Disney for him, as he also wrote all of the songs for this year’s Moana, and he will also star in the sequel Mary Poppins Returns. British actor Ben Whishaw (the most recent “Q” from the James Bond movies) also made the news this week because he is now in talks with Disney to costar in Mary Poppins Returns as the adult version of Michael Banks. The sequel is set 25 years later after the movie starring Julie Andrews, with Emily Blunt signed to play the nanny the second time around. Walt Disney Pictures has scheduled Mary Poppins Returns for release on December 25, 2018.5. KEIRA KNIGHTLEY CAST AS THE SUGAR PLUM FAIRY IN DISNEY’S THE NUTCRACKER AND THE FOUR REALMSWhen Disney releases Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales next year (5/26/17), Johnny Depp, Orlando Bloom, and Geoffrey Rush are all expected to return, but one costar of the first film who will not is Keira Knightley. That doesn’t mean, however, that Knightley is any sort of persona non grata at Disney, since&nbsp;the actress made some pretty big casting news at the Mouse House this week. Knightley has signed with Disney to costar in The Nutcracker and the Four Realms, the studio’s live action adaptation of the 1816 fairy tale by E.T.A. Hoffman, The Nutcracker and the Mouse King. Knightley will be playing the Sugar Plum Fairy, and she will join the already cast Mackenzie Foy (as Clara), Morgan Freeman, and Misty Copeland as the lead toy dancing ballerina. Keira Knightley also made the news this week for negotiations&nbsp;to star in an adaptation of the bestselling novel The Aftermath, as one half of a British couple staying in the ruins of Hamburg, Germany, as the rebuilding effort begins in 1946. Alexander Skarsgard (The Legend of Tarzan) is also in talks to star in The Aftermath, as is Jason Clarke (Zero Dark Thirty, Terminator: Genisys).6.&nbsp;CUE THE INTERNET OUTRAGE: ZENDAYA TO PLAY (SPOILER?) IN SPIDER-MAN: HOMECOMINGFirst, we should note that this week’s news is almost certainly not a spoiler for next summer’s Spider-Man: Homecoming, as it seems extremely unlikely that the trailers wouldn’t be pretty clear about which character we’re talking about. Having said that, since Sony Pictures and Marvel Studios referred to the character in question as “Michelle” (not really her name), we want to respect whatever secrecy they’re striving for. The movie blog The Wrap has confirmed through two sources in the know that the character 19-year-old Disney star Zendaya will be playing in Spider-Man: Homecoming is none other than future romantic interest Mary Jane Watson, a&nbsp;role previously played by Kirsten Dunst in Sam Raimi’s trilogy. As for the expected “internet outrage,” as Devin Faraci of Birth.Movies.Death puts it, “You thought the internet got upset when they cast people with the wrong hair color, imagine how Reddit is gonna react to this.” Mary Jane Watson will not be the only traditionally white character who will be played in Spider-Man: Homecoming by an actor of a different race, as Zendaya’s costars include Tony Revolori (Flash Thompson), Jacob Batalon (Ned Leeds), and Laura Harrier (Liz Allan). Marvel and Sony have scheduled Spider-Man: Homecoming for release on July 7, 2017.7.&nbsp;BAM! POW! WEST! WARD! NEWMAR! BATMAN: RETURN OF THE CAPED CRUSADERS!After the two “grimdark” films directed by Zack Snyder (Man of Steel&nbsp;–&nbsp;55 percent Rotten, and Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice&nbsp; – 27 percent Rotten), Warner Bros and DC Comics recently gave us another grimdark film (with a few more jokes) in Suicide Squad,&nbsp;and critics gave it the lowest scores of the three. The verdict is (obviously) still out on the next few DC Comics movies (next year’s Wonder Woman and Justice League), but Warner Bros gave a brief theatrical release to their latest animated movie, and it was also critically ill-received. Despite its title — borrowed from Alan Moore’s 1980s story —&nbsp;Batman: The Killing Joke had very little humor and a tacked-on first half hour which drifted far afield from Moore’s version, and critics gave it a Rotten 48 percent score. So, since the dark and serious thing doesn’t appear to be working (at least not critically) for Warner Bros and DC Comics, perhaps that’s why the studio made the surprise announcement this week that their next animated film will see a drastic return to arguably the most lighthearted version of Batman ever. Adam West, Burt Ward, and Julie Newmar will be providing their voices for&nbsp;Batman: Return of the Caped Crusaders, a new feature length animated adventure which will revive the 1960s TV versions of Batman, Robin, and Catwoman (with other newer actors voicing characters like the Joker, the Penguin, and the Riddler).&nbsp;&nbsp; This decidedly lighter&nbsp;animated movie will premiere on digital HD on October 11th and on Blu-ray on November 1, 2016. It is not yet known if Warner Bros plans on giving Batman: Return of the Caped Crusaders a theatrical release, but we didn’t expect one for Batman: The Killing Joke either when it was first announced.ROTTEN IDEAS&nbsp;OF THE WEEK2.&nbsp;MOVIE PROJECTS PERRY MASON AND JACK RYAN BOTH BECOMING TV SHOWS INSTEADSometimes when we set out to say movie news stories are Fresh or Rotten, it’s not exactly that simple. For example, what might be “bad” for the movie might be “good” in other ways. We’re wrapping the column this week with two announcements about projects that were formerly “movies” which will now be going to television instead (and who knows, they might be great TV shows).&nbsp; The spin we’re going to put on both is that if you’re a fan who was really looking forward to seeing these as movies, then it’s bad news for you (and potentially good news for other people). First up, there’s the long-in-development adaptation of the TV series Perry Mason, which Robert Downey Jr is&nbsp;producing and will&nbsp;star in. It’s now sounding like RDJ’s Perry Mason project will instead be developed as a series for HBO, and not as a theatrical film. The first step is to write and produce a pilot for HBO, and that’s what Downey’s partners are now working on, it seems. A similar project (which is further along) concerns the future of Tom Clancy’s Jack Ryan, after the relatively recent movie starring Chris Pine was something of a box office bomb. Amazon has given the greenlight to a 10-episode season of Jack Ryan, with John Krasinski the latest actor to try his hand at going where the likes of Harrison Ford, Alec Baldwin, and Ben Affleck have been in the past.1. BOARD GAME CLUE TO GET ANOTHER MOVIE ADAPTATIONBack in 2008, Universal Pictures and Hasbro (the toy/game company) announced an ambitious development slate which included Monopoly, Candyland, Magic: The Gathering, Stretch Armstrong&nbsp;(all of which didn’t happen), and&nbsp;Battleship&nbsp;and Ouija (both of which&nbsp;did happen). Among the listed projects&nbsp;was also a new movie based on the board game Clue, following the popular 1985 film starring Tim Curry, Christopher Lloyd, Madeline Kahn, and several others. A few years later, however, Universal Pictures put the Clue movie into turnaround (which basically means other studios can pick up the rights, sometimes at a discount). It took a few more years, but this week, it was revealed that another studio is indeed now developing a new Clue movie. The rights to Clue have landed at Fox, but the details about what they’re planning make it difficult to exactly call their Clue a “remake.” Instead of centering on&nbsp;a murder mystery at a mansion (which the first movie did as a fairly direct adaptation of the game), this new project will be a “worldwide mystery… with action-adventure elements, potentially setting up a possible franchise that could play well internationally.” Put another way, this sounds like a Clue movie which is not really a Clue movie, in which the real mystery would be why it’s even called Clue.","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"Family, Dark, game, monsters, Watching, VICE, movies, National, Countdown","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/19144011/Ferrell-Reilly-Ketchup.jpg","slug":"will-ferrell-and-john-c-reilly-reunite-to-play-holmes-and-watson-plus-more-movie-news"},{"id":"47613083766166","title":"RT on DVD & Blu-Ray: Source Code and Dylan Dog","content":"RT on DVDvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})RT on DVD &amp; Blu-Ray: Source Code and Dylan DogPlus, a couple of well-received indies and a new Kurosawa Blu-ray.by Ryan Fujitani | July 26, 2011 |  CommentsThis week on home video, the dearth of quality releases continues with just a few notables to mention and some real stinkers peppered throughout. We won’t bother to mention the feature adaptation of the video game The King of Fighters (oops, I guess we just did), but we will say that if you’re a big John Belushi fan, you might be interested to know that both The Blues Brothers and Animal House debut on Blu-ray this week. Otherwise, we’ve got Duncan Jones’s critically acclaimed follow-up to Moon, a Certified Fresh Dutch film about World War II, a highly unsuccessful comic book adaptation, and more. See below for the full list!Source Code 92%Aside from being the son of famed rock legend David Bowie, Duncan Jones also happens to be a pretty solid filmmaker. Jones debuted with a bang back in 2009 with the indie sci-fi thriller Moon, which earned rave reviews and marked him as a director to watch. As such, many were curious to see how he would follow up that success, and with this year’s Source Code, Jones outperformed his first film in all respects. Delving once again into mindbending science fiction, Source Code stars Jake Gyllenhaal as Colter Stevens, a decorated war hero who inexplicably awakes and finds himself in the body of another man aboard a commuter train. He eventually discovers he’s part of a larger plan initiated by a secret government agency to identify the perpetrator of a bombing aboard the train, and Stevens must relive the last 8 minutes of his surrogate’s life repeatedly until he unravels the mystery. Critics and audiences both responded well to Source Code, earning it over $121 million at the box office and a Certified Fresh 91% Tomatometer. The film is smart, packed with action, and propelled by a distinctly human story at its core, making it one of the early winners of 2011.Dylan Dog: Dead of Night 7%At the other end of the spectrum, far away from Source Code, is Dylan Dog: Dead of Night. Based on a popular Italian comic series begun in the 1980s, Dylan Dog stars Brandon Routh (Superman Returns) as the titular hero, a private investigator working out of New Orleans who specializes in affairs dealing with the undead (you know, vampires, werewolves, and zombies). When a new case is presented to him that might spell doom for mankind, he must do his part to ensure a war between the undead factions never breaks out. This film attempts to capitalize on the recent popularity of its supernatural subject matter, as well as the burgeoning genre of horror-comedy, but by almost all accounts (it only has one Fresh review), it fails miserably. Hampered by bad special effects, acting performances that fall flat, and aggressively derivative concepts, Dylan Dog takes its place among the worst-reviewed films of 2011 thus far with a dismal 3% Tomatometer score. But in the off chance you might find it “so bad, it’s good,” you can check it out this week on home video.Winter in Wartime 74%Unless you’re a ravenous connoisseur of foreign cinema, there’s a good chance you’ve not heard of Winter in Wartime, a Dutch thriller set in Holland at the end of World War II. Though it was originally released in its home country in back in 2008, it only made it to the US back in March of this year and received a very limited release (no more than 26 theaters in the country). Based on the 1972 Dutch novel of the same name, the film centers around a young teen named Michiel living in Nazi-occupied Holland who happens upon a wounded British paratrooper and decides to help. As Michiel, whose father is the mayor of his town, is increasingly drawn to the cause of the resistance, he becomes engulfed by the political allegiances that exist among his townspeople, and he must decide where his loyalties lie. Certified Fresh at 77%, Winter in Wartime was shortlisted for the Best Foreign Language Film at the Academy Awards (though it ultimately didn’t make the cut), and back in its native Holland, the film outgrossed blockbusters like Twilight and The Dark Knight. A solid film with some historical context, it should make for a pretty good time for those who are interested.Trust 79%How exactly does one transition from starring in one of history’s most popular television sitcoms to… whatever comes afterwards? None of the male stars of Friends really found the kind of success that Jennifer Aniston or even Courteney Cox did, but it looks like David Schwimmer knows what he wants to do. After making his feature film directorial debut with Run Fatboy Run, which got mixed reviews, he changed things up a little bit and, for his second feature, went with hard-hitting family drama in Trust. Starring Clive Owen and Catherine Keener as parents of two teens, Trust follows their 14-year-old daughter Annie (Liana Liberato), who suffers sexual abuse at the hands of a thirty-something man posing as a teen boy on the internet. Both the police and Annie’s father begin their own investigations, which lead to heartache and pain for the whole family. While Run Fatboy Run received middling reviews, Schwimmer seems to have proven himself with Trust, which earned praise from critics to the tune of a Certified Fresh 78% tomatometer. Don’t let its “after-school special” vibe fool you; there are some outstanding actors involved, and Schwimmer does a fine job, so it might be worth your time to check out.Ironclad 42%Movies about medieval swordplay will never go out of style; there’s just something fascinating about that period of European history and the clash between barbarism and civility. That said, it can be rather difficult to craft an effective period film set in that era, as one must strike a fine balance between the action and the storytelling. Unfortunately, Ironclad focused just a tad too much on the former, and not enough on the latter, according to critics. The film is a dramatization of King John’s siege of Rochester Castle in 1215, during which a group of rebels withstood the army of the King, who had refused to abide by the Magna Carta. Ironclad features a respectable cast, including Paul Giamatti, Brian Cox, James Purefoy, and Kate Mara, but many critics found the film to be too focused on the blood and gore for their liking. As a result, it sports a mediocre 43% on the Tomatometer, but if this sort of period action is your thing, you may still get a good, bloody kick out of it.Life During Wartime – Criterion Collection 68%It’s pure coincidence that two movies with the word “wartime” in the title are coming out this week on home video, and they are quite different from each other. Here we have the latest from Todd Solondz, a director known for exploring the seedier parts of everyday life through ensemble films; Life During Wartime, a sort of unofficial sequel to his 1998 film Happiness, which had an entirely different cast playing the same characters, is more of the same. This time around, the film focuses on the three sisters first portrayed in Happiness as they continue struggling through life with various personal problems and familial issues. Solondz’s brand of comic satire is decidedly dark and uncomfortable, and as such, his films inevitably rub some the wrong way; since his 1995 critical hit Welcome to the Dollhouse, his movies have received progressively lower Tomatometer scores, with Life During Wartime marking a welcome return to Fresh territory. But if nothing else can be said for Solondz’s body of work, it is certainly thought-provoking, and it’s normally a surefire bet that you won’t walk away from a Todd Solondz film unchanged. His latest is one of the few contemporary films to get the Criterion treatment right off the bat, and it includes an audio Q&amp;A with Solondz and a making-of featurette.High and Low – Criterion Collection Blu-ray 95%We’ve written at length on multiple occasions about the influence and masterful skill of Japanese director Akira Kurosawa, so we won’t bother with those details again; if you don’t know who he is, suffice it to say you owe it to yourself to check out some of his many masterpieces. That said, we’d also like to point out that period samurai flicks aren’t all that he made, as evidenced by this classic film from 1963. Starring longtime Kurosawa collaborator Toshiro Mifune and based on an “87th Precinct” police procedural novel by Ed McBain called King’s Ransom, High and Low explores the moral conflict endured by a wealthy executive named Kingo Gondo (Mifune) when his chauffeur’s son is mistaken for his own and abducted for ransom. Already caught in the middle of a corporate struggle between two competing factions in his company, Gondo must decide whether or not to pay the ransom, which could spell financial ruin for his family. This week, the Criterion Collection releases a Blu-ray restoration of the film, which already exists in the collection in DVD format, and it includes an audio commentary by Kurosawa scholar Stephen Price, a 37-minute making-of documentary, video interviews with cast members, and more.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"TV, Universal, Sony, drama, LGBT, TruTV, streaming, E3, books, Fantasy","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"rt-on-dvd-and-blu-ray-source-code-and-dylan-dog"},{"id":"47614755964058","title":"Pre- (and Re-) \"Departed\"?","content":"var mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Pre- (and Re-) \"Departed\"?by Jeff Giles | January 22, 2007 |  CommentsMartin Scorsese’s \"The Departed\" is nearing the end of its successful box-office run, and already rumors have started that not one, but two films may be appended to the director’s latest effort.\"The Departed\" was, of course, a remake of \"Infernal Affairs,\" a Hong Kong classic which eventually became part of a trilogy; now, IGN Movies reports, \"Departed\" co-star Mark Wahlberg has informed MTV.com that audiences may see sequels, prequels, or some combination thereof:Scorsese (left) already talking sequel(s)?\"We may do another one because it’s based on a Hong Kong film, and there is a trilogy.

Beyond that, we’ve got a handful of notable smaller movies, as well as two excellent choices from the Criterion Collection. Read on for details:Rio 2 48%Jesse Eisenberg and Anne Hathaway reprise their voice roles as Blu and Jewel, the pair of blue macaws who found love in Fox’s 2011 animated film Rio, in this sequel, which follows them as they pursue the trail of another recently spotted macaw. Along the way, Blu, Jewel, and their three kids clash with an illegal logging operation in the Amazon, reunite with Jewel’s family, and run into some trouble in the form of an old nemesis. Unfortunately, critics weren’t as smitten by the colorful couple’s antics this time around, saying Rio 2 felt simply like a bigger, busier retread of its predecessor and rewarding its efforts with a 46 percent on the Tomatometer. Nevertheless, it may serve as a colorful distraction for your little ones, especially considering the special features include an extensive playlist of both sing-along and dance-along songs, among other things.Under the Skin 84%Those of you looking to hunker down with a copy of Under the Skin this week purely because “it’s the movie where Scarlett Johansson gets naked” might end up with more than you bargained for (don’t worry; we know that’s not really why you’re watching it). Jonathan Glazer’s (Sexy Beast) third film, an adaptation of Michel Faber’s eponymous sci-fi novel, is the stylized account of an alien who takes the form of a woman (Johansson) to seduce men and, ultimately, absorb their innards. Over time, the alien’s predatory instincts give way to curious observation, but to what end? Critics mostly agreed that Under the Skin‘s visual themes and narrative ambiguity might not be accessible to all viewers, but they also praised Johansson’s performance and the film’s haunting, heady ideas, making the film Certified Fresh at 86 percent. Available on DVD and Blu-ray this week, special features include a little over 42 minutes’ worth of featurettes on topics ranging from the casting and music to the production design and visual effects.Orphan Black – Season TwoBBC America’s hit sci-fi series has been a coming out party for its star, Tatiana Maslany, who acts opposite herself in multiple roles and has earned a Golden Globe nomination for her efforts (no Emmy nom, though, much to the dismay of fans). After a first season that slowly drew an increasingly larger audience by word of mouth, Orphan Black returned for its second season back in April, expanding its narrative to include more characters, more twists, and more evidence why Maslany deserves the lion’s share of the credit for the show’s Certified Fresh 97 percent Tomatometer. For those of you looking for some extra clone goodness, the season two Blu-ray that hits shelves this week includes a number of making-of featurettes, including an extended version of the four-clone scene (dance party, woohoo!) and clone character profiles.Also available this week:Wrinkles (96 percent), an animated film about life in a retirement home, with voice work from Martin Sheen and Matthew Modine.Israeli import Bethlehem (77 percent), a Certified Fresh drama exploring the complex relationship between an Israeli Secret Service agent and his Palestinian informant.Road to Paloma (70 percent), a road movie about a Native American who flees across the country after he avenges his mother’s murder, starring, written by, and directed by Jason Momoa.The Face of Love (42 percent), starring Ed Harris and Annette Bening in a dramedy about a widow who meets and falls in love with a man who looks exactly like her deceased husband.Season three of Hell on Wheels, starring Anson Mount in a Western drama about a former Confederate soldier who becomes a foreman in the construction of the first Transcontinental Railroad.And of course, two more choices from the Criterion Collection: David Cronenberg’s breakout 1981 thriller Scanners (79 percent) is available in a first-time Criterion edition, and Robert Bresson’s 1959 classic Pickpocket (97 percent) is available in a new DVD edition and a DVD/Blu-ray combo pack.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"Day, Family, blockbusters, of, movies, Freeform, Month, Drama, Superheroe, Chilling, Oscars","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"new-on-dvd-and-blu-ray-rio-2-under-the-skin-and-orphan-black"},{"id":"47509047755874","title":"Video: Dame Judi Dench Dances","content":"Video Interviewsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Video: Dame Judi Dench Dancesby Grae Drake | March 5, 2015 |  CommentsThe Second Best Exotic Marigold Hotel revisits Sonny’s home for the “elderly and beautiful,” and stars Dame Judi Dench, Lillete Dubey, Tina Desai, and Celia Imrie.

For the first time since Halloween, no film managed to generate $20M in weekend box office.Focus opened to an estimated $19.1M from 3,323 locations averaging a not-so-impressive $5,748 per site. The con man flick was a rare move into R-rated territory for the actor and represented his second worst debut from the past 13 years. Only 2008’s Seven Pounds opened worse at $14.9M. Plus Focus was only Smith’s second number one hit over the past six years joining the tentpole sequel Men in Black 3 from 2012.Reviews were mixed, Smith’s starpower has faded, and the film’s plot was not effectively communicated in its trailer and TV spots. Plus there was no help from any other stars or brand to pull in crowds. A big studio marketing push did what it could for a product that failed to excite anyone.Audiences who did come out were only moderately pleased as evidenced by the film’s B CinemaScore. Smith boasts over 76 million likes on Facebook and used his social media platform heavily to sell his latest project, but that didn’t do much to make cash registers ring. Sometimes, people just don’t want to see a particular movie.Focus skewed older with studio data indicating that the crowd was 88% over 25 with females making up 53%. IMAX was offered in 351 locations and those screens contributed $2.1M, or 11% of the weekend take. With mixed audience buzz, the road ahead could be a bit rocky for Warner Bros.Holding steady at number two for a third straight weekend was the action flick Kingsman: The Secret Service which fell 36% to an estimated $11.8M giving Fox a solid $85.7M to date. The Colin Firth spy pic is on its way to becoming 2015’s first $100M+ hit to never reach the number one spot.Close behind with an estimated $11.2M was Paramount’s hit toon The SpongeBob Movie which was off only 32% and continues to benefit from a lack of competition. Cume to date is $140.3M domestic with the global tally up to $236.6M.Two-time champ Fifty Shades of Grey fell to third place losing 51% of its business. With an estimated $10.9M, the Universal smash pushed its domestic total to $147.8M and its worldwide haul to a stellar $486.2M. It’s the number one global blockbuster of 2015 to date.The new fright flick The Lazarus Effect saw mild results in fifth place opening to an estimated $10.6M. Relativity’s horror entry averaged a decent $3,976 from 2,666 sites and connected with the usual crowd for this genre, though not in any impressive way. Kevin Costner’s latest film McFarland, USA dipped only 29% to an estimated $7.8M in its second weekend. The Disney release has banked $22M and may end up with about $40M.Oscar winner American Sniper followed closely with an estimated $7.7M, off 23%, for a new cume of $331.1M for Warner Bros. It now sits at number 33 on the list of all-time domestic blockbusters and by next weekend will pass both Guardians of the Galaxy and The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 1 to become the highest grossing domestic hit to come out of 2014. Global is a Clint best $470.2M.High school comedy The DUFF fared well in its sophomore session slipping only 34% to an estimated $7.2M for $20.1M to date. Still Alice, which earned Julianne Moore the Oscar for Best Actress, expanded and rose 24% to an estimated $2.7M putting it in the top ten for the first time. Sony Classics has banked $12M to date. The comedy sequel Hot Tub Time Machine 2 tumbled 60% to an estimated $2.4M giving the flop $10.3M overall.Other Oscar winners capitalized on their wins by expanding their runs. The big champ Birdman tripled its run from 407 to 1,213 locations and saw its weekend take soar 125% to an estimated $2M giving Fox Searchlight $40.3M overall. Whiplash rose 19% to an estimated $677,000 with $12.3M for Sony Classics. The Theory of Everything climbed 17% to an estimated $649,000 with $35.1M to date for Focus.

But, hey, that just left room for two different remakes of Jean-Claude Van Damme movies, as well as remakes of The Butterfly Effect, and a Rocky spinoff focusing on Apollo Creed’s grandson.  Every thing old is new again.\n\n\n\nThis Week’s Top Story\n\t\nFROM FRUITVALE STATION TO GETTING THE EYE OF THE TIGER BACK: THE ROCKY SPINOFF CREED\n\nFor several years now, MGM has been the studio most regarded as something of a remake factory. MGM has the rights to many classic films, and rather than sequelizing them (which wouldn’t be lauded much either), MGM does lots and lots of remakes. Fame, The Taking of Pelham 123, and the upcoming Carrie, RoboCop and Poltergeist remakes… That’s all MGM.  This story, however, sees the studio reviving one of their biggest franchises (possibly second only to their continuing James Bond franchise), but not as a remake or a true sequel.  The Rocky franchise is getting a spinoff movie called Creed, about the boxing career of the grandson of Rocky and Rocky II opponent Apollo Creed. MGM is in early talks with both director Ryan Coogler — currently in theaters with his debut film, the true story of Fruitvale Station — and, for the title character, with that film’s star, Michael B. Jordan, who appeared last year in Chronicle, and is rumored to be in talks to play the new Johnny Storm in the 2015 reboot of The Fantastic Four. Sylvester Stallone is also expected to reprise his role as Rocky Balboa as the new Creed’s trainer. For reasons obvious to anyone who ever saw Rocky IV, Carl Weathers is probably less likely to appear in the new Creed. Ryan Coogler will cowrite Creed with Aaron Covington, but which Aaron Covington it will be is anyone’s guess (who knew there were so many in Hollywood?).\n\n\n\nFresh Developments This Week\n\t\n#1 ROSAMUND PIKE LANDS TITLE ROLE IN DAVID FINCHER’S GONE GIRL\n\nAfter Ben Affleck was cast as the male lead in director David Fincher’s next film, the Gillian Flynn novel adaptation Gone Girl, the next obvious step was casting the title character.  That process reportedly included consideration of Charlize Theron, Natalie Portman, Emily Blunt, Abbie Cornish, and Olivia Wilde.  This week, we learned that the actress to actually land the role was Rosamund Pike, who isn’t a household name yet in the USA, but has been seen in a variety of films, including Die Another Day, Wrath of the Titans, and last year’s Jack Reacher.  Rosamund Pike will play a woman who disappears on her fifth wedding anniversary, leading to suspicion of her husband (Ben Affleck). Neil Patrick Harris and Tyler Perry are also being considered for other roles. Filming starts in September. Director David Fincher (Fight Club, Zodiac) chose Gone Girl as his next film after deals fell apart on some of his other projects, including the Disney action remake 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea and the sequel The Girl Who Played with Fire.\n\n\n\t\n#2 BEN FOSTER TO CYCLE INTO THEATERS AS LANCE ARMSTRONG\n\nIt’s fairly typical for a hot button subject to inspire various projects from competing studios and producers, and in most cases, whichever one actually starts filming first “wins” the race, such as it were. (It’s less common that one of the projects keeps going regardless, but that obviously also happens, as Olympus Has Fallen and White House Down most recently demonstrated). In the months after the revelations of Lance Armstrong’s doping came out, his story quickly became one such hot project.  Previously, most of the news has gone to projects from J.J. Abrams’ Bad Robot and Paramount (which Bradley Cooper may have been in talks for), and another from Recount and Game Change director Jay Roach.  Today, we learned that the dark horse contender that may actually “win the race” is one from British production company Working Title.  Stephen Frears (The Queen, High Fidelity) is attached to direct, with American actor Ben Foster in final talks to play Lance Armstrong.  Ben Foster has built up a strong list of supporting roles, including playing a baddie in the remake of 3:10 to Yuma, and roles in the Marvel movies X-Men: The Last Stand (as Angel) and The Punisher (as Spacker Dave). Presumably, Ben Foster also knows how to ride a bike.  Working Title expects to start filming their untitled Lance Armstrong movie this fall.\n\n\n\t\n#3 MELISSA MCCARTHY TO REUNITE WITH BRIDESMAIDS/THE HEAT DIRECTOR FOR SPY COMEDY SUSAN COOPER\n\nMelissa McCarthy is in talks to make a third movie with director Paul Feig after their first two movies together (Bridesmaids and The Heat) were both critical and box office hits (the first more than the second, but still). Their third movie together will be a spy comedy called Susan Cooper, which is being compared to the 2006 James Bond reboot Casino Royale.  One has to presume they mean if there was already a successful movie franchise about a heavy set female spy (or maybe that they’re pretending that there is, and that’s half of the joke).\n\n\n\t\n#4 GWYNETH PALTROW AND EWAN MCGREGOR MAY JOIN JOHNNY DEPP IN MORTDECAI\n\nAfter contract disputes caused the Whitey Bulger biopic Black Mass to stall, Johnny Depp recently moved on to star in the novel adaptation Mortdecai instead, which will be directed by David Koepp (Secret Window, Premium Rush).  This week, we learned that Gwyneth Paltrow and Ewan McGregor are also now in talks to join Johnny Depp in the film.  The story of Mortdecai will depict “an antihero art dealer and rogue who is in a race to recover a stolen painting rumored to contain the code to a lost bank account filled with Nazi gold.”\n\n\n\nRotten Ideas of the Week\n\t\n#5 JAMES MCAVOY TO PLAY FRANKENSTEIN TO DANIEL RADCLIFFE’S IGOR\n\nOne has to wonder if James McAvoy knows what he just got himself into, now having to spend years of his life explaining for the umpteenth time the difference between Frankenstein and Frankenstein’s Monster.  He’ll just have to console himself with the swimming pool he can probably afford to fill with cash from paychecks for movies like this week’s news and X-Men: First Class.  Anyway, yes, James McAvoy is in talks with 20th Century Fox to play the title character, Dr. Victor Von Frankenstein, in their modern reboot of Frankenstein. Daniel Radcliffe has already been attached for a few months to costar as the scientist’s assistant Igor. Frankenstein will be directed by Paul McGuigan (Push, Wicker Park, Lucky Number Slevin), whose mostly “Rotten” RT Tomatometer page is really the reason this movie remains a “Rotten Idea” whenever new stories break.\n\n\n\t\n#4 THE BUTTERFLY EFFECT REMAKE TO PROBABLY CHANGE MORE THAN JUST ONE LITTLE THING\n\nLike basically any year (ever), there will be many anniversaries “celebrated” in 2014. One that most people probably wouldn’t think of is the tenth anniversary of the release of The Butterfly Effect.  Then again, most people aren’t the producers of The Butterfly Effect, like the Benderspink production company do.  So, Benderspink has announced plans to reunite with writer-director Eric Bress on a “reboot” of The Butterfly Effect, once again telling the story of a young man who is able to travel back in time within his own past, and make changes that have unexpected impacts on his present. Yes, that’s right, just like Alanis Morrissette’s “Ironic”, The Butterfly Effect wasn’t really about “The Butterfly Effect” at all. Although Eric Bress is on board the project, he won’t himself be directing the reboot, but we don’t yet know exactly will get to relive his experience.\n\n\n\n#3 SONY DEVELOPS GRAN TURISMO VIDEOGAME ADAPTATION MOVIE\n\nAs the Fast and the Furious franchise continues to bring in huge box office numbers with each new release, the other studios that are not Universal Pictures are developing their own fast cars properties.  This week, apparently, someone at Sony Pictures realized that SOE owns the rights to the Gran Turismo videogame franchise.  In the games, which have pretty much no narrative structure at all, players pick real life cars and then drive them around realistic looking race tracks and other racing settings. A true adaptation of Gran Turismo would probably be a ninety minute IMAX documentary of a faceless driver taking a series of cars through scenic races. Instead, Sony has set the producers of the upcoming mommie-soft-porn adaptation Fifty Shades of Grey to see about getting Gran Turismo going as an actual movie, with a script and actors and everything. Disney’s Touchstone Pictures will be release their own racing videogame adaptation Need for Speed on March 14, 2014.\n\n\n\t\n#2 THIS WEEK IN JEAN-CLAUDE VAN DAMME REMAKES: BLOODSPORT AND KICKBOXER\n\nI’m clearly not a Hollywood producer.  I would never get up in the morning, and say, “Hey, you know what the world needs?  Another Kickboxer.”  And this is why I don’t have a job at Radar Pictures, the company behind movies like The Last Samurai and Riddick, which is now developing a new version of that one movie with Jean-Claude Van Damme where he provides the future inspiration for a running joke on Community.  The Kickboxer remake project will be directed by Stephen Fung, whose Tai Chi Zero was a recent Chinese box office hit.  Most weeks, one Jean-Claude Van Damme remake would be enough (actually, more than enough), but no, the week of July 22-July 26, 2013 just had to take it to that extra special extreme.   And so, this was the week that we learned that the (previously announced) reboot of Bloodsport is also moving ahead, with director James McTeigue (V for Vendetta, Ninja Assassin) now attached to the project.\n\n\n\t\n#1 R.I.P. DENNIS FARINA (1944-2013)\n\nIf there was ever someone who proved F. Scott Fitzgerald wrong about second acts in American lives, it was Dennis Farina. Dennis Farina had a long, twenty year career as a Chicago cop before ever getting into show business, starting with a small role in the 1981 Michael Mann movie Thief.  This led to a supporting role on Miami Vice, and two seasons as one of the leads in the innovative 1986-1988 TV series Crime Story (serialized storytelling spanning entire seasons? crazy talk!).  Dennis Farina also went on, later in his career, to basically play Lennie Briscoe’s replacement for two seasons on Law &amp; Order after the 2004 death of Jerry Orbach. For the purpose of this column and site, however, we should specifically remember Dennis Farina’s film career.  Although his TV career was bookmarked by two lead roles, in movies, Dennis Farina was more of the colorfully rough supporting character type.  From a classic phone conversation in Midnight Run to the awesome closing line of Guy Ritchie’s Snatch, Dennis Farina was frequently quotable. Farina’s other memorable roles included movies like Out of Sight, Get Shorty, and Manhunter.  Our movie journey with Dennis Farina came to an end this week with his death in Scottsdale, Arizona of a blood clot on the lung.  Dennis Farina was 69.\n\n\nFor more Weekly Ketchup columns by Greg Dean Schmitz, check out the WK archive, and you can contact GDS via ","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"television","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Weekly-Ketchup-Fruitvale-Station-Director-and-Star-Sought-for-Rocky-Spinoff-Creed"},{"id":"47509064372446","title":"Video: What Makes Andrew Garfield Cry?","content":"Video Interviewsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Video: What Makes Andrew Garfield Cry?by Grae Drake | May 2, 2014 |  CommentsThe Amazing Spider-Man 2 stars Andrew Garfield, Emma Stone, Jamie Foxx, and Dane DeHaan in the second installment of Marc Webb’s reboot of the classic franchise.

It was short-lived, but it kicked off a long love of voice acting work, which would flourish in the 1990s and the decades following when he landed the role of the Joker in&nbsp;Batman: The Animated Series. For the Comic-Con crowd, the role would define him almost as much as his work in the&nbsp;Star Wars&nbsp;franchise; like Jack Nicholson and Heath Ledger, he put his on stamp on the character, which he calls the Hamlet of villain roles for a comic fan. As Hamill prepares to put his spin on another iconic villain – the murderous doll, Chucky, in director Lars Klevberg’s reboot of&nbsp;Child’s Play –&nbsp;Rotten Tomatoes sat down with the actor&nbsp;for an exclusive and extended deep dive on his voice work. Here, he talks about finding the Joker’s laugh, and molding the character to different stories (from&nbsp;The Killing Joke&nbsp;to the&nbsp;Arkham Asylum&nbsp;video game); dubbing two classic Miyazaki films; his prediction that&nbsp;Avatar: The Last Airbender&nbsp;was simply too smart, and too good, to succeed; and how his new Chucky differs from Brad Dourif’s beloved take on the character.Child’s Play&nbsp;is in theaters June 21.Like this?

Well, in this sequel to the 2004 cult comedy Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy, Will Ferrell’s buffoonish newsman and his equally inept pals smoke crack on the air, cavort with women in awkwardly lustful ways and engage in an ever bigger all-out battle with rival TV news teams. Much thumping and thrashing and wielding of weird weapons ensue. There’s also a ton of risqué word play as well as a shark that may not be a kid’s playmate after all. It’s an incredibly silly comedy — scattered and slapped together even by the loose standards of this genre — but for older kids with a taste for slapstick, it should be fine.New On DVD:The Lone Ranger 30%Rating: PG-13, for sequences of intense action and violence, and some suggestive material.A bloated, overlong and awkward blend of action, humor, romance mysticism and history lesson, connected by massive, effects-laden set pieces. This is a Lone Ranger origin story from Tonto’s perspective, brought to you by the key people behind the Pirates of the Caribbean movies, which are not exactly known for their subtlety: producer Jerry Bruckheimer, director Gore Verbinski and star Johnny Depp. Kids might actually feel overwhelmed and/or bored by the running time of 2 ½ hours as well as the enormity and confusion at play here. As for what might be inappropriate for young viewers: a ton of Western-style gunplay, a cannibal carving out a guy’s heart and eating it and a brothel sequence. Also: a sight gag involving horse poop. ‘Cause that’s hilarious.One Direction: This is Us 63%Rating: PG, for mild language.I’m actually not even sure why this movie deserves a PG rating. An extended infomercial for the British boy-band juggernaut, it’s exceedingly wholesome and harmless. Director Morgan Spurlock follows the fivesome around on their world tour but completely sanitizes their antics: no groupies, no partying, no infighting, not even a sneaked cigarette. On stage and behind the scenes, Harry, Zayn, Niall, Liam and Louis are as bland and boring as can be – and with the exception of Harry, who’s trying very hard to channel a young Mick Jagger, they’re essentially interchangeable. Suitable for fans of all ages, and tolerable for adults who may be stuck in the living room watching it along with them.Percy Jackon: Sea of Monsters 42%Rating: PG, for fantasy action violence, some scary images and mild language.This poor-man’s Harry Potter carries a PG rating but it contains some images and action sequences that could be seriously scary for younger kids. The sequel to 2010’s Percy Jackson &amp; the Olympians: The Lightning Thief opens with monsters killing a young girl. A massive robot bull storms the forest community that Poseidon’s son, Percy (Logan Lerman), and his pals call home, trying to trample, gore and shoot fire at anyone and everyone. Among the other adventures, Percy and his friends must take on a frightening Cyclops as well as the enormous, child-eating Titan Kronos. The theater where I saw it was full of families, though, so maybe this is OK for kids around 7 or 8 and up.","section":"Parental Guidance","tags":"singing, jamie, Reality, composers, Universal, A&E, french, Trailer, Network, Pet, Disney+, comedy, 2018","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"parental-guidance-anchorman-2-the-legend-continues-plus-the-lone-ranger-one-direction-this-is-us-and-percy-jackson-sea-of-monsters"},{"id":"47508632683881","title":"What Were The 24 Best-Reviewed Movies of 1977?","content":"24 Framesgoogletag.cmd.push(function(){googletag.unitIds.push(\"article_sponsorship_ad\"),googletag.defineSlot(\"/55153744/rottentomatoes/article/sponsorship\",[[150,80]],\"article_sponsorship_ad\").addService(googletag.pubads())})What Were The 24 Best-Reviewed Movies of 1977?by Alex Vo | August 29, 2017 |  CommentsBox office is hitting the lowest numbers since the red alert days of Glitter. And this weekend doesn’t look to turn things around, unless Tulip Fever draws the Waldenbooks crowd out of hiding and makes $200 million (conservative estimate) by Sunday. Let us avert our eyes then, away from contemporary misery and back to&nbsp;a more joyful era: 1977!&nbsp;The gilded year of Atari 2600s, 65 cent gas, and guillotine executions, when Disco Demolition Night was still but a twinkle in some blue collar slob’s eye…The in-flight movie on our ’77 trip is Close Encounters of the Third Kind, the landmark extraterrestrial drama that’s re-releasing in theaters this week for its 40th anniversary. The Certified Fresh trophy we made from mashed potatoes and sent to Spielberg’s office went unanswered for some reason, so instead we’ll be commemorating the moment&nbsp;with our gallery of the&nbsp;24 best-reviewed movies (with at least 20 reviews) of 1977! How many have you seen?That Obscure Object of Desire (100%)That Obscure Object of Desire is a frequently unsettling treatise on the quixotic nature of lust and love.Annie Hall (97%)Filled with poignant performances and devastating humor, Annie Hall represents a quantum leap for Woody Allen and remains an American classic.3 Women (96%)3 Women is a strange, eerie portrait of late-’70s womanhood that upends and then defies all expectations.Close Encounters of the Third Kind (96%)Close Encounters of the Third Kind is deeply humane sci-fi exploring male obsession, cosmic mysticism, and music.Star Wars (93%)A legendarily expansive and ambitious start to the sci-fi saga, George Lucas opened our eyes to the possibilities of blockbuster filmmaking and things have never been the same.Suspiria (93%)The blood pours freely in Argento’s classic Suspiria, a giallo horror as grandiose and glossy as it is gory.Pumping Iron (92%)In addition to offering an enlightening early look into the world of future star/politician Arnold Schwarzenegger, Pumping Iron provides a witty and insightful overview of competitive bodybuilding.Opening Night (92%)Opening Night is as dense and difficult as one would expect from John Cassavetes, but even the director’s detractors will be unable to deny the power of Gena Rowlands’ performance.Eraserhead (81%)David Lynch’s surreal Eraserhead uses detailed visuals and a creepy score to create a bizarre and disturbing look into a man’s fear of parenthood.A Grin Without a Cat (91%)Grin Without a Cat is a 4-hour mash-up doc on civil disobedience and revolution that collides together with the same power of its recorded subjects.The Duellists (91%)Rich, stylized visuals work with effective performances in Ridley Scott’s take on Joseph Conrad’s Napoleonic story, resulting in an impressive feature film debut for the director.The American Friend (90%)The American Friend is a slow burning existential thriller that does justice to the Patricia Highsmith source novel.House (90%)House is a gleefully demented collage of grand guginol guffaws and bizarre sequences.Martin (90%)George A. Romero’s contribution to vampire lore contains the expected gore and social satire — but it’s also surprisingly thoughtful, and boasts a whopper of a final act.Saturday Night Fever (87%)Boasting a smart, poignant story, a classic soundtrack, and a starmaking performance from John Travolta, Saturday Night Fever ranks among the finest dramas of the 1970s.The Rescuers (83%)Featuring superlative animation, off-kilter characters, and affectionate voice work by Bob Newhart and Eva Gabor, The Rescuers represents a bright spot in Disney’s post-golden age.The Gauntlet (81%)Eastwood has a good time playing a dolt in the surprisingly funny Gauntlet, which otherwise has the typical Clint trappings.Slap Shot (81%)Raunchy, violent, and very funny, Slap Shot is ultimately set apart by a wonderful comic performance by Paul Newman.Smokey and the Bandit (81%)Not much in the head but plenty beneath the hood, Smokey and the Bandit is infectious fun with plenty of car wrecks to keep your eyes glued.Sorcerer (80%)Sorcerer, which obstinately motors along on its unpredictable speed, features ambitious sequences of insane white-knuckle tension.The Kentucky Fried Movie (80%)The now obscure pop culture references and spoofed commercials add to Kentucky Fried Movie‘s anarchic, anything-goes spirit and wit.The Spy Who Loved Me (79%)Though it hints at the absurdity to come in later installments, The Spy Who Loved Me‘s sleek style, menacing villains, and sly wit make it the best of the Roger Moore era.Looking for Mr. Goodbar (77%)Diane Keaton gives an absolutely fearless performance in a sexual thriller whose ending will leave audiences trembling.High Anxiety (75%)Uneven but hilarious when it hits, this spoof of Hitchcock movies is a minor classic in the Mel Brooks canon.","section":"24 Frames","tags":"Paramount, Vudu, e., stop, black, spider-man, poppins, CNN, rom-coms, movies, live, Seed","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/29160846/600StarWars1.jpg","slug":"what-are-the-24-best-reviewed-movies-of-1977"},{"id":"47508635977097","title":"24 Best &amp; Worst Part 6s","content":"24 Framesgoogletag.cmd.push(function(){googletag.unitIds.push(\"article_sponsorship_ad\"),googletag.defineSlot(\"/55153744/rottentomatoes/article/sponsorship\",[[150,80]],\"article_sponsorship_ad\").addService(googletag.pubads())})24 Best &amp; Worst Part 6sby Alex Vo | January 24, 2017 |  CommentsTime flies when you’re watching a franchise spiral into the crazy nebula: We are now approaching the sixth Resident Evil&nbsp;movie, mercifully dubbed&nbsp;The Final Chapter,&nbsp;none of which have ever been fully embraced by critics. But, hey, just because a franchise is long in the tooth doesn’t mean it’s rotten at the root! There’s plenty of Fresh movies in this week’s gallery: 24 best and worst Part 6s in movie history!Marvel’s The Avengers (2012, 92%)The 6th stepping stone in Marvel’s Cinematic Universe is the 2nd highest-rated of the series, just behind progenitor Iron Man‘s 94%.Son of Frankenstein (1939, 91%)The original cinematic universe: a collection of cross-shoving Universal Monsters like Dracula, The Wolf Man, and yes, Frankenstein’s classic monster and his varied genetic hangers-on.42 UP (1999, 89%)Michael Apted’s documentary series captures the lives of 14 British citizens from age seven, every seven years; 42 Up sees the still-willing participants at middle age.Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country (1991, 84%)The final movie starring the original crew, and the last ST voyage creator Gene Roddenberry saw before shuffling off for the undiscovered country hisself.Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (2009, 84%)The third highest-rated movie of the series, behind Deathly Hallows – Part 2 (96%) and Prisoner of Azkaban (91%).The Revenge of the Pink Panther (1978, 82%)Peter Sellers’ final performance in the Inspector Clouseau role; the PP series would crash into rotten/reboot/re-purposed unused footage category.On Her Majesty’s Secret Service (1969, 82%)Not counting 1967 joke smorgsboard Casino Royale, the 6th 007 movie is the first to star George Lazenby. It’s also the only: Sean Connery would return two years later for Diamonds Are Forever.Curse of Chucky (2013, 81%)After a nine-year timeout post-Seed of Chucky, character creator Dan Mancini spanked the comedy out of the series, delivering Curse to a series-high Tomatometer score.Star Wars: Episode VI – Return of the Jedi (1983, 80%)Though this Ewok-tastic, Sarlacc-ilicious romp got the lowest rating of the original trilogy, it would remain the best-reviewed SW movie until The Force Awakens 32 years later.Rocky Balboa (2006, 76%)After the Italian Stallion got the worst reviews and lowest box office of his movie career, Sylvester Stallone bid his time before resurrecting the champ in this successful comeback bout.The Wolverine (2013, 69%)Already an improvement over X-Men Origins: Wolverine by not being completely horrible, The Wolverine convinced studio heads to re-hire James Mangold to guide Hugh Jackman in his final X-Man performance through this year’s Logan.Fast &amp; Furious 6 (2013, 69%)6 did well enough foritself, despite lacking Fast Five‘s novelty of being an F&amp;F movie that was finally good, and the emotional wallop of Paul Walker’s 7 sendoff.Muppets From Space (1999, 63%)The Matrix, a new Star Wars, and, uh, Muppets — it was a big year for science-fiction.Friday the 13th Part VI: Jason Lives (1986, 52%)After the blood-red herring that was A New Beginning, Jason lived another undead day to dispatch everyone in his lumbering unfortunate path.Saw VI (2009, 36%)Saw VI demonstrated the machinations of Jigsaw were simultaneously running out of steam and overly convoluted, forcing Lionsgate to wrap up several more planned movies into 2010’s Saw 3D.Survival of the Dead (2010, 29%)George A. Romero rebooted the original zombie apocalypse into modern times with Diary of the Dead, with some characters carried over into this little-seen sequel.Leprechaun: Back 2 Tha Hood (2003, 25%)Wait, there’s a movie called Leprechaun: Back 2 tha Hood and it doesn’t have a single-digit Tomatometer score? Nor an embarrassed and desperate Jennifer Aniston?Freddy’s Dead: The Final Nightmare (1991, 20%)Indeed the last klassic Krueger kut-up before Freddy’s IRL trip in New Nightmare, crossing blades with Voorhees in Freddy vs. Jason, and the bad 2010 reboot.Alien vs Predator: Requiem (2007, 12%)The first two movies are classics, but 3 and Resurrection were such facehugs of mediocrity that the xenomorphs deserved to slum it with the Predator series.Leonard Part 6 (1987, 9%)So awful, it erased the first five movies out of existence, while closing off a future timeline where Part 7 beats Freejack for Best Picture in 1992.Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers (1995, 6%)The one-time hallowed series continues its descent into shrill unwatchability with Curse, before redeeming itself with…nope, this series never got good again.Police Academy 6: City Under Siege (1989, 0%)The worst-reviewed series ever: City Under Siege‘s score is just one of the four zero-percents the Police Academy movies have been ticketed.Children of the Corn 666: Isaac’s Return (1999, 0%)Because a franchise about kids who peddle veggies to cloud monsters needs continuity, John Franklin returns after 15 years as the murderous cult’s once-leader.Hellraiser: Hellseeker (2002, 0%)The Hellraiser movies were never critical darlings, but the first one to not star Doug Bradley as Pinhead got the bottom-worst reviews. Let’s stick with what barely works here, folks.","section":"24 Frames","tags":"of, BBC","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/24152950/600ReturnOfTheJedi.jpg","slug":"24-best-worst-part-6s"},{"id":"47508638807458","title":"History of Fox Animation in 24 Movies and Shows","content":"24 Framesgoogletag.cmd.push(function(){googletag.unitIds.push(\"article_sponsorship_ad\"),googletag.defineSlot(\"/55153744/rottentomatoes/article/sponsorship\",[[150,80]],\"article_sponsorship_ad\").addService(googletag.pubads())})History of Fox Animation in 24 Movies and Showsby Alex Vo | July 19, 2016 |  CommentsFox’s got a new Ice Age&nbsp;and it’s set on collision course for theaters this Friday. Animation at the studio has weaved a winding line through Saturday morning cartoons, adult fare, and studio closures before lifting Fox as one of Hollywood’s major animated players decades later, alongside Disney/Pixar and Dreamworks. In this week’s gallery, we look at 24 films and TV shows highlighting the history of Fox Animation.Return to the Planet of the ApesYear: 1975During the 1960s and ’70s, 20th Century Fox Television gave the Saturday morning treatment to popular films out of their studio stable, including Fantastic Voyage and Journey to the Center of the Earth.WizardsYear: 1977Tomatometer: 61%Fox distrubited a half-dozen animated movies to theaters starting in 1977 (with two from Ralph Bakshi, including this and 1983’s Fire and Ice) up until establishing their own in-house theatrical process during the ’90s.The SimpsonsYear: 1989-presentThree years after launching their flagship network channel, Fox premiered America’s greatest dysfunctional family, changing the sitcom and TV animation landscape for decades to come.FernGullyYear: 1992Tomatometer: 71%FernGully,which commodified enviromentalism as was de riuguer during the ’90s, was Fox’s only notable financial success during their time as feature animation distributor.The PagemasterYear: 1994Tomatometer: 18%This live-action/traditional animation hybrid starring Macaulay Culkin and extolling the virtues of reading (blech) was the last film Fox would distribute before founding their own animation studio the same year.AnastasiaYear: 1997Tomatometer: 85%Fox Animation Studios, continuing the same auteur-type collaboration that the larger studio began with Bakshi in the ’70s, hired Don Bluth (The Secret of N.I.M.H., The Land Before Time) to create this opulent musical torn from Russian history.King of the HillYear: 1997-2010The Simpsons not only helped put Fox network on the map (and eased the painful task of scheduling content between X-Files and 300 hours of Cops every week), but also transformed Sundays into a haven for new realms of American animated comedy…that were always under threat of being preempted by the Cowboys.Family GuyYear: 1999-presentThe most influential animated comedy since The Simpsons with its fast timing and absurdist cutaways, creating a mini-Seth MacFarlane empire that included American Dad! and The Cleveland Show.FuturamaYear: 1999-2013Matt Groening and David X. Cohen took the overeducated, nerd humor that always existed on the fringes of The Simpsons and gave it its own show.Titan A.E.Year: 2000Tomatometer: 52%Traditional animation was already falling out of favor when Bluth’s Titan A.E. dropped into a market that would sink other similar sci-fi products (WB’s Iron Giant, and Disney’s Atlantis and Treasure Planet). Fox Animation Studios would close soon after, six years after its inception.Ice AgeYear: 2002Tomatometer: 77%In 1997 Fox bought Blue Sky Studios, whose employees had been cutting their teeth on commercials and visual effects since Tron. Ice Age was a global hit (finally establishing Fox Animation as a key player) and the third movie to become a franchise (following Toy Story and Shrek) in the once brave new world of CG animation. And the rest is history.RobotsYear: 2005Tomatometer: 64%Critics Consensus: Robots delights on a visual level, but the story feels like it came off an assembly line.Ice Age: The MeltdownYear: 2006Tomatometer: 57%Critics Consensus: Despite its impressive animation and the hilarious antics of the saber-toothed squirrel Scrat, The Meltdown comes up short on the storytelling front.The Simpsons MovieYear: 2007Tomatometer: 88%Critics Consensus: The Simpsons Movie contains the hearty laughs, biting satire, and honest portrayal of an American family that makes the show so popular.Horton Hears a Who!Year: 2008Tomatometer: 79%Critics Consensus: Horton Hears A Who! is both whimsical and heartwarming, and is the rare Dr. Seuss adaptation that stays true to the spirit of the source material.Ice Age: Dawn of the DinosaursYear: 2009Tomatometer: 45%Critics Consensus: Dawn of the Dinosaurs boasts some excellent animation — in particular, the dinosaurs are wonderfully realized — but its story is tired and monotonous.Fantastic Mr. FoxYear: 2009Tomatometer: 92%Critics Consensus: Fantastic Mr. Fox is a delightfully funny feast for the eyes with multi-generational appeal — and it shows Wes Anderson has a knack for animation.RioYear: 2011Tomatometer: 72%Critics Consensus: This straightforward movie reaches great heights thanks to its colorful visual palette, catchy music, and funny vocal performances.Ice Age: Continental DriftYear: 2012Tomatometer: 37%Critics Consensus: Ice Age: Continental Drift 3D has moments of charm and witty slapstick, but it often seems content to recycle ideas from the previous films.EpicYear: 2013Tomatometer: 64%Critics Consensus: Though its narrative themes are all too familiar, Epic is beautifully animated and crafted with just enough flair to make for solid family entertainment.Rio 2Year: 2014Tomatometer: 47%Critics Consensus: Like most sequels, Rio 2 takes its predecessor’s basic template and tries to make it bigger — which means it’s even busier, more colorful, and ultimately more exhausting for viewers outside the youthful target demographic.The Book of LifeYear: 2014Tomatometer: 82%Critics Consensus: The Book of Life‘s gorgeous animation is a treat.The Peanuts MovieYear: 2015Tomatometer: 87%Critics Consensus: The Peanuts Movie offers a colorful gateway into the world of its classic characters and a sweetly nostalgic — if relatively unambitious — treat for the adults who grew up with them.FerdinandYear: 2017Blue Sky Studio’s next offering arrives this upcoming July, the story of a flora-sniffing bull based on the children’s book of nearly the same name.","section":"24 Frames","tags":"Video, Emmy, Television, mockumentary, romance, Exclusive, shows, Avengers, Mirror, comedies, trailers, on","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/19165650/600FoxAnimation.jpg","slug":"history-of-fox-animation-in-24-movies-and-tv-shows"},{"id":"47508638791071","title":"24 Certified Fresh Historical Epics","content":"24 Framesgoogletag.cmd.push(function(){googletag.unitIds.push(\"article_sponsorship_ad\"),googletag.defineSlot(\"/55153744/rottentomatoes/article/sponsorship\",[[150,80]],\"article_sponsorship_ad\").addService(googletag.pubads())})24 Certified Fresh Historical Epicsby Alex Vo | August 16, 2016 |  CommentsSumptuous costuming. Sweeping story. Production value&nbsp;by the barrelful. All&nbsp;of these we associate with&nbsp;the historical epic, and it’s what we’re&nbsp;expecting from&nbsp;this week’s Ben-Hur, a new take on the classic 1st century&nbsp;tale of betrayal, redemption, and sparkly chariots. This week’s gallery&nbsp;presents 24 Certified Fresh historical epics, historical as in nothing set within the past 100 years (so World War I and anything before is fair game).The RevenantYear: 2015Tomatometer: 82%Critics Consensus: As starkly beautiful as it is harshly uncompromising, The Revenant uses Leonardo DiCaprio’s committed performance as fuel for an absorbing drama that offers punishing challenges — and rich rewards.Red CliffYear: 2009Tomatometer: 89%Critics Consensus: Featuring some impressively grand battlefield action, John Woo returns to Asia and returns to form in the process for this lavish and slick historical epic.HeroYear: 2004Tomatometer: 95%Critics Consensus: With death-defying action sequences and epic historic sweep, Hero offers everything a martial arts fan could ask for.Master and Commander: The Far Side of the WorldYear: 2003Tomatometer: 85%Critics Consensus: Russell Crowe’s rough charm is put to good use in this masterful adaptation of Patrick O’Brian’s novel.Gangs of New YorkYear: 2002Tomatometer: 75%Critics Consensus: Though flawed, the sprawling, messy Gangs of New York is redeemed by impressive production design and Day-Lewis’s electrifying performance.GladiatorYear: 2000Tomatometer: 76%Critics Consensus: Ridley Scott and an excellent cast successfully convey the intensity of Roman gladitorial combat as well as the political intrigue brewing beneath.Les MiserablesYear: 1998Tomatometer: 74%Critics Consensus: This intelligent, handsomely crafted adaptation of Victor Hugo’s classic novel condenses the story’s developments without blunting its emotional impact.KundunYear: 1997Tomatometer: 76%Critics Consensus:Hallucinatory but lacking in characterization, Kundun is a young Dalai Lama portrait presented as a feast of sight and sound.ElizabethYear: 1998Tomatometer: 82%Critics Consensus: No mere historical drama, Elizabeth is a rich, suspenseful journey into the heart of British Royal politics, and features a typically outstanding performance from Cate Blanchett.TitanicYear: 1997Tomatometer: 88%Critics Consensus: A mostly unqualified triumph for James Cameron, who offers a dizzying blend of spectacular visuals and old-fashioned melodrama.BraveheartYear: 1995Tomatometer: 78%Critics Consensus: Distractingly violent and historically dodgy, Mel Gibson’s Braveheart justifies its epic length by delivering enough sweeping action, drama, and romance to match its ambition.Dances With WolvesYear: 1990Tomatometer: 82%Critics Consensus: A grand, sweeping epic with inarguably noble intentions and arresting cinematography, but one whose center, arguably, is not as weighty as it should be.GloryYear: 1989Tomatometer: 93%Critics Consensus: Bolstered by exceptional cinematography, powerful storytelling, and an Oscar-winning performance by Denzel Washington, Glory remains one of the finest Civil War movies ever made.The Last EmperorYear: 1987Tomatometer: 92%Critics Consensus: While decidedly imperfect, Bernardo Bertolucci’s epic is still a feast for the eyes.RanYear: 1985Tomatometer: 96%Critics Consensus: Akira Kurosawa’s sprawling, epic take on King Lear should be required viewing for fans of westerns, war movies, or period films in general.GandhiYear: 1982Tomatometer: 88%Critics Consensus: Director Richard Attenborough is typically sympathetic and sure-handed, but it’s Ben Kingsley’s magnetic performance that acts as the linchpin for this sprawling, lengthy biopic.Barry LyndonYear: 1975Tomatometer: 97%Critics Consensus: Cynical, ironic, and suffused with seductive natural lighting, Barry Lyndon is a complex character piece of a hapless man doomed by Georgian society.Aguirre, Wrath of GodYear: 1972Tomatometer: 98%Critics Consensus: A haunting journey of natural wonder and tangible danger, Aguirre transcends epic genre trappings and becomes mythological by its own right.Doctor ZhivagoYear: 1965Tomatometer: 81%Critics Consensus: It may not be the best of David Lean’s epics, but Dr. Zhivago is still brilliantly photographed and sweepingly romantic.The LeopardYear: 1963Tomatometer: 100%Critics Consensus: Lavish and wistful, The Leopard features epic battles, sumptuous costumes, and a ballroom waltz that competes for most beautiful sequence committed to film.Lawrence of ArabiaYear: 1962Tomatometer: 97%Critics Consensus: The epic of all epics, Lawrence of Arabia cements director David Lean’s status in the filmmaking pantheon with nearly four hours of grand scope, brilliant performances, and beautiful cinematography.SpartacusYear: 1960Tomatometer: 96%Critics Consensus: Featuring terrific performances and epic action, Kubrick’s restored swords-and-sandals epic is a true classic.Ben-HurYear: 1959Tomatometer: 88%Critics Consensus: Uneven, but in terms of epic scope and grand spectacle, Ben-Hur still ranks among Hollywood’s finest examples of pure entertainment.Gone With the WindYear: 1939Tomatometer: 94%Critics Consensus: Filmed and presented on a scale not seen in modern productions, Gone with the Wind is, if not the definitive Hollywood film, then certainly near the top of the list.","section":"24 Frames","tags":"Emmy, Arts, NBC,

Box Office: The Lion King Brings The July Heat With Record $185 MillionLet's just say Disney had a very good weekend.by Erik Childress | July 21, 2019 |  CommentsLast week the yearly box office fell behind the past four years with a margin of 9.1% down from the record-breaking year of 2018. Well, like Jurassic World before it, never count out the nostalgia of new parents and never count out the box office when it comes to big spectacles like The Lion King.&nbsp;It&nbsp;just became the biggest July opener of all-time and this weekend’s top 10 represents one of the best July weekends in box office history.The Lion King of the Crop: $185 Million Grubbed Up(Photo by Disney)Tracking services hit&nbsp;it right on the nose as Lion King&nbsp;hauled in $185 million. That is the 9th highest opening weekend in film history and the best ever in the month of July beating the 2011 record set by the $169.1 million of the final Harry Potter chapter. Disney now owns 12 of the top 13 openings of all-time with that pesky Jurassic World stuck right in the middle of their cash buffet. None of those 12 other films grossed less than $400 million and The Lion King is not going anywhere anytime soon.Audiences appear to love it while critics are pretty split with a 55% on the Tomatometer. Even if they do have LARF (Live-Action-Reimagining-Fatigue) in a year that has already seen Dumbo (46%) and Aladdin (56%), these are the same critics who gave Jon Favreau’s CGI-enhanced remake of The Jungle Book a 94%. So it’s still all in the execution. But it will be left up to moviegoers across the world to determine whether it can make the $1.347 billion necessary to earn a spot in the all-time top 10. After three days of domestic release and 10 globally, The Lion King has grossed $531 million so far, the 7th best total of 2019.The Record Has Fallen:&nbsp;Avengers: Endgame&nbsp;Beats&nbsp;Avatar(Photo by Marvel Studios)In 1975 it was Steven Spielberg and Jaws. Two years later it was George Lucas and Star Wars. 1982 comes along and Spielberg regains the throne with E.T.&nbsp; In 1993 Spielberg replaces himself with Jurassic Park. The next phenomenon in 1997-98 was Titanic. Cameron then pulled a Spielberg and Avatar bested Titanic in 2009-10. Three directors have held the box office record for 44 years. This weekend two more joined the fray as Anthony and Joe Russo’s Avengers: Endgame passed Avatar as the highest grossing film in the world of all time. The film was $37 million away from the record when Endgame was re-issued into theaters with some additional material. The final numbers were not out this weekend when Kevin Feige made the announcement that there was a new no. 1 during Marvel’s panel at the San Diego Comic-Con Saturday night. As of Sunday, Avengers: Endgame has grossed an estimated $854.21 million domestic and $2.790 billion worldwide. When the final estimates come in on Monday, Avengers: Endgame will officially take its place in history.Top 10 and Beyond:&nbsp;Far From Home&nbsp;Close To Record(Photo by © Columbia Pictures / © Marvel Studios/ Courtesy Everett Collection)Spider-Man: Far From Home made $21 million over the weekend, and is&nbsp;estimated to be at $319.7 million overall. That’s&nbsp;$24 million ahead of the pace of Sam Raimi’s 2002 origin tale, which is still the only Spider-Man film to cross the $400 million line.&nbsp;Far From Home&nbsp;has grossed $889.5 million worldwide, over $9 million more than Spider-Man: Homecoming made in its entire run and less than $2 million behind Spider-Man 3 which is the highest-grossing&nbsp;Spidey film ever. Until Monday.Toy Story 4 is at $374.3 million as of Sunday after a $13.4 million weekend. One full month into release. That is the 20th highest in history, just ahead of Captain Marvel’s $373.8 million.&nbsp;Disney’s Aladdin also just passed the 1994 Lion King for its spot on the all-time worldwide chart after this weekend’s $3.8 million weekend. It is now 40th all-time with $988 million with a billion dollars in its sights.As for last week’s releases, Crawl looks like it will outgross Lake Placid’s 1999 haul of $31.7 million,&nbsp;suggesting a final haul around $35-$38 million. That along with a few international dollars will be enough to get the $13.5 million production into profit. The same cannot be said for Stuber which is actually on about the same track as Midsommar, both between $15.9 and $16.1 million after 10 days. Midsommar is up to $22.48 million in its third weekend and both are headed in the realm of $25 million each. Danny Boyle’s Yesterday&nbsp;could now be headed north of $70 million, after this weekend’s&nbsp;haul of $5.1 million.Keeping an eye on what has potential to be the indie success story of the summer, Lulu Wang’s The Farewell was expanded into 35 theaters by A24 and grossed $1.17 million. That puts the film in league with The Kids Are All Right ($1.06 million / 38 theaters), The Favourite ($1.07 / 34), Boyhood ($1.17 / 34), and Lady Bird ($1.19 / 37).This Time Last Year: Sequels….Here We Go Again!(Photo by © Sony Pictures Releasing)There was a close race for the top spot at the box office but Denzel Washington in The Equalizer 2 edged out Mamma Mia!: Here We Go Again $36.01 to $34.95 million. Another sequel, Unfriended: Dark Web, barely made the&nbsp;top 10, making $3.65 million for a ninth-place finish. Even the race for the middle was decided by less than a million between Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom ($11.26 million), Skyscraper ($11.36 million), and Incredibles 2 ($11.89 million).

Nelson), some of Hollywood’s funniest fellows trying to touch one another without permission (Tag, starring&nbsp;Ed Helms,&nbsp;Jeremy Renner, and Jon Hamm), and a remade blast from the blaxploitation past (Superfly, starring Trevor Jackson&nbsp;and Jason Mitchell).&nbsp;What are the critics saying?Incredibles 2 (2018)  93%If you’re going to try and follow up an acclaimed blockbuster, you might as well take your time getting the sequel right — and in animation, where time can stand still forever, you have the added benefit of not needing to rush your cast back in front of the camera. Still, after waiting nearly 15 years for a second installment of The Incredibles, fans can be forgiven a certain amount of impatience; while the creative teams at formerly franchise-averse Pixar dreamed up new stories for the characters in Toy Story, Cars, Finding Nemo, and Monsters Inc., the ability to return to theaters continued to elude the superpowered Parr family. All that waiting has finally paid off with Incredibles 2, which reunites the original voice cast for a new adventure serving up more of the domestic turmoil, superhero satire, and brilliantly animated action that made the first one such a hit. It’d be tough to improve on the original Incredibles, and critics say that while this sequel doesn’t quite pull off that feat, it comes impressively close, adding yet another acclaimed entry to Pixar’s already estimable filmography. If you were a kid when The Incredibles&nbsp;came out, you might have kids of your own now — and like all the best stuff the studio has put out, the whole family can look forward to enjoying Incredibles 2.Tag (2018)  56%On one hand, it’s easy to believe Hollywood has long since exhausted most of the reasonable possibilities for comedy that exist in movies about grown men acting like boys. On the other, when you’ve got the Wall Street Journal writing about a real-life group of guys who take a month off every year to continue the game of tag they’ve been playing since they were kids, well, it’s awfully hard to resist the temptation to turn that into a film. Enter the descriptively titled Tag, starring Hannibal Buress, Jon Hamm, Ed Helms, Jake Johnson, and Jeremy Renner as the fellows in question — a talented bunch whose commitment to the story was reflected in the set injury Renner sustained, breaking both of his arms and necessitating some last-minute CGI limb replacements in post-production. It would be wonderful to report that Renner’s suffering came in service of one of the year’s best-reviewed action comedies; alas, the truth is that critics are kinda meh on Tag, which reviews describe as funny and engaging in fits and starts, but ultimately not consistent or committed enough to fully deliver on its premise. Still, this is one talented cast, and even the critical pans say the movie isn’t without its moments, so if you’re in the mood for some arrested development laughs, you may want to check your local listings.Superfly (2018)  51%Released in 1972, the original Superfly&nbsp;helped lead the blaxploitation wave with a thoughtful Harlem-set drama about a drug dealer looking for one last big score; the movie’s trappings may look somewhat dated today, but thanks to Ron O’Neal‘s performance as main character Youngblood Priest — not to mention a killer Curtis Mayfield soundtrack — it still feels fresh. It’s easy to understand why music video veteran Director X wanted to take a shot at updating the story, and its themes are just as relevant as they were more than 45 years ago; unfortunately, critics say those themes have mostly been lost in this new version, which is far more focused on style than substance. Starring Trevor Jackson as Priest, the 2018 edition moves the action to Atlanta, but the basic contours of the story remain the same — which is part of why a number of reviews have outlined pundits’ disappointment with the lost social subtext. This Superfly&nbsp;will make its fortune by and by, thanks to Director X’s way with an artfully arranged scene or set piece, but as is so often the case with remakes, the original still reigns supreme.What’s New on TVThe Bold Type: Season 2 (2018)  100%The Bold Type presents an aspirational yet refreshingly realistic portrait of young women’s careers, friendships and love lives in a big city.Strange Angel: Season 1 (2018)  71%A beautiful slow burn, Strange Angel shoots for the stars, but gets a little lost in its own orbit.Also&nbsp;Opening This Week In Limited Release Eating Animals (2018) , a documentary about the commercial factory farming industry and its various impacts, is at 100%.

To help out – and calm the stress that you could run out of things to watch (ah!) – the Rotten Tomatoes team trawled through the streaming service’s movie offerings with one mission: to find some not-so-obvious hidden gems to help keep your watchlist topped up.How did we define “hidden gems”? A little broadly, we’ll admit. The collection below is made up of movies with impressive&nbsp;Tomatometer scores that have gone criminally under-seen (Slow West,&nbsp;I Don’t Feel At Home In This World Anymore.,&nbsp;Under the Shadow); movies that made a splash when they debuted but which you may have forgotten since (1922,&nbsp;My Life As A Zucchini,&nbsp;Obvious Child); under-appreciated gems – according to the RT staff (Can’t Hardly Wait,&nbsp;The Foreigner); and some bigger movies you may be surprised to see are available on Netflix.

Bio also packs the laughs (and heart) in thanks to its supporters played by industry vets like Patton Oswalt and Paula Pell and new-coming scene-stealers filling out his high school classroom. Season 3 premieres Sept. 3 on Peacock.Where to watch: Amazon,&nbsp;FandangoNOW,&nbsp;Google Play,&nbsp;Microsoft, Peacock,&nbsp;VuduCommitment: Approx. 9 hours (for the first two seasons) 81% Power (Starz)What it is:&nbsp;With the&nbsp;highly anticipated spinoff from showrunner Courtney Kemp hitting this month, a&nbsp;Power binge is in order. Omari Hardwick stars in the original series as&nbsp;New York City nightclub owner James “Ghost” St. Patrick, who doubles as a drug kingpin to an elite clientele.Why you should watch it: We’ve written before of this series’ addictive brand of soapy&nbsp;melodrama, and we expect more of the glorious same this outing. The new series, Power Book II: Ghost picks up just days after the action of the series finale earlier this year, and&nbsp;Michael Rainey Jr. continues his star-making turn villain-turned-hero Tariq St. Patrick, who’s still living in the shadow of his father’s legacy. Co-starring Naturi Naughton, the new series also invites franchise newcomer&nbsp;Mary J. Blige&nbsp;to join in the fun,&nbsp;who we’re thrilled to see&nbsp;again after her 2017 double Oscar nomination.&nbsp;To better know the characters we’re dealing with in the spinoff, we recommend you watch all of Power beforehand. Power Book II: Ghost premieres Sept. 6.Where to watch: Amazon,&nbsp;FandangoNOW,&nbsp;Google Play,&nbsp;Hulu,&nbsp;Microsoft,&nbsp;VuduCommitment: 52.5 hours (for all six seasons of Power) 90% The Boys (Amazon Prime)What it is: What would happen if&nbsp;superheroes, instead of for good, used their powers for self-serving purposes, power, and greed? That’s the irreverent-but-relevant twist The Boys presented in its first season as things kicked off with the rise of a vigilante group that decides to put the “heroes” back in their place.Why you should watch it: You know you’re in good hands with Seth Rogen and oft-creative collaborator Evan Goldberg. Pair them with sci-fi TV veteran Eric Kripke (Supernatural, Timeless, Revolution as co-creators, and The Boys was off to a roaring start upon its premiere last year. Its turning of well-worn&nbsp;comic book tropes on their head, all enacted by a stellar cast of veterans like Karl Urban and up-and-comers, that’ll keep you coming back for more. Season 2 premieres Sept. 4 on Amazon Prime Video.Where to watch it:&nbsp;Amazon, FandangoNow, Microsoft, VuduCommitment: Approx. 8 hours (for the first season) 90% Archer (FXX)What it is: Even the sleekest of action-packed espionage thrillers have an air of cartoonish hyperbole to them, but FXX’s Archer does away with that suspension of disbelief by making the whole thing a cartoon to begin with. The half-hour comedy from creator Adam Reed can land a joke as deftly as its titular man-child spy can land a punch, so expect to be thrilled while laughing yourself silly.Why you should watch it: Over 10&nbsp;hit seasons, Archer has never shied away from genre experimentation. Season 8’s Dreamland and 9’s Danger Island were particularly high-concept highlights, with season 10 following suit with 1999, which sees Archer not as the ass-kicking spy of ISIS we know from earlier incarnations, but a futuristic explorer of space on the M/V Seamus alongside our longstanding favorite characters and the voice actors behind them. Season 11 marks the spies much-anticipated return to reality after he wakes up from his coma and does away with those bottle-themed seasons — and we can’t wait. Season 11 premieres Sept. 16 on FXX.Where to watch it: Amazon, FandangoNow, Google Play, Hulu, Microsoft, VuduCommitment: Approx. 42 hours (for the first 10 seasons) 97% PEN15 (Hulu)What it is: You’ve never seen a coming-of-age comedy like this. The premise is simple: Two best friends, Maya Ishii-Peters and Anna Kone, are new to middle school and learn a lot about their friendship, their bodies, their families, and the world they live in along the way — all to laugh-out-loud&nbsp;effect.Why you should watch it: In talking about Pen15, everyone is always quick to mention how incredible the illusion of 30-something creators Maya Erskine and Anna Konkle playing tweens of the early aughts is, but it really is good enough to mention yet again! It’s not an physical illusion (these actors still very much look like grown women playing half their age), but their performances (both comic and emotive) and the world-building of sets and costumes around them honestly make for one of the most transporting comedies on TV. And that means we’re cringing in adolescent awkwardness right alongside them. Season 2 premieres Sept. 18 on Hulu.Where to watch: Amazon, Google Play,&nbsp;Hulu,&nbsp;MicrosoftCommitment: Approx. 5 hours (for the first season) 93% Fargo (FX)What it is: Based on the Coen brothers film of the same name, FX’s anthology miniseries explores new characters, new crimes, and new eras tangentially related to the film each season, deftly adapting the trademark Coen brothers mix of violence, dark humor, and compelling characters for the small screen. Season 4 shifts gears to 1950s Kansas City, Missouri, as two crime syndicates (one a group of Black Americans fleeing the Jim Crow south (led by Chris Rock as Loy Cannon), the other the city’s resident mafia) duke it out for power.Why you should watch it: What do Chris Rock, Jason Schwartzman, Ben Whishaw, Timothy Olyphant, Kirsten Dunst, Billy Bob Thornton, Ewan McGregor, Jesse Plemons, Carrie Coon, Jean Smart, Bob Odenkirk, Martin Freeman, Patrick Wilson, and (phew) Jim Gaffigan all have in common? They’ve all starred (or come season 4, will star) in the small-screen adaptation of Fargo, and that impressive cast alone makes it worth watching. FX and Noah Hawley’s Fargo, which debuted all the way back in 2014, is at least in part to blame for the rise and saturation of prestige miniseries and limited series, and for good reason. An ingenious blend of humor — both silly and gallows — and enrapturing crime mystery, the series succeeds in translating its Oscar-winning source material into Emmy-winning must-see TV. After a three-year break (and a delay due to the novel coronavirus pandemic), Fargo finally returns with its fourth season Sept. 27 on FX.Where to watch: Amazon, FandangoNow, Google Play,&nbsp;Hulu,&nbsp;Microsoft, VuduCommitment: About 27 hours (for the first three seasons)","section":"Binge Guide","tags":"Pet, Century, comic, Peacock, Film, Comics, TV, History, Adult","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/01205658/BINGE_GUIDE_september-2020-600X314.jpg","slug":"tv-shows-you-should-binge-watch-this-september-2020"},{"id":"47508661510774","title":"Binge Guide: 5 Titles to Watch If You Love Stargirl","content":"Binge Guidevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Binge Guide: 5 Titles to Watch If You Love StargirlIf you love the newest superhero on DC Universe and The CW, here are some other shows and films you might also enjoy.by RT Staff | June 1, 2020 |  CommentsJust three episodes in, Stargirl is just getting started on DC Universe/The CW&nbsp;with a Certified Fresh first season.

Successful titles like&nbsp;The Vault of Horror also became a lightning rod in the decade’s juvenile delinquency scare. A Senate sub-committee was formed to determine of horror comics were poisoning the youth of America and rumblings of government intervention scared the comic book industry as a whole. DC Comics, Marvel, and Archie Comics (and a few other now-defunct publishers) forestalled any sort of regulation by agreeing to form their own self-censoring body, the Comics Code Authority. Though intended to ensure “wholesome” reading for youngsters, the CCA had a second, potentially more sinister purpose: preventing EC Comics from publishing&nbsp;horror comics. As EC publisher Bill Gaines put it in the documentary Comic Book Confidential, the CCA’s first act was to ban almost every word used in EC’s titles.Of course, the code also meant DC, Marvel, and Archie would avoid horror elements in their comics as well. But this restriction became less of a concern for the CCA in the early 1970s (well after EC became known for Mad Magazine). Marvel quickly introduced Morbius this Living Vampire in the pages of Spider-Man and began publishing The Tomb of Dracula. The series introduced the prominent horror figure into its comic universe and marked the debut of the day-walking vampire hunter Blade. Soon, Ghost Rider and other horror-tinged characters appeared in the Marvel universe. Anticipating the code changes, DC revived House of Secrets as a horror title in 1969 and spun off its recurring Swamp Thing feature in 1972. These titles represented a marriage of horror and the superhero which continues to this day. They would also inspire the horror titles of the 1990s independent market which never faced the Comics Code Authority or its restrictions.And as television continues to mine comics for inspiration, horror characters (and horror titles) are finally making their mark on networks and streaming services. Some lean into the graphic nastiness of horror conventions, while others go for more subtle terrors. But which are the most successful? Let’s take a look at the five scariest comic book characters to grace the screen so far and see how they bring elements of horror to the comic book show subgenre.Ghost Rider | Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.  95%Burning an indelible impression into S.H.I.E.L.D.’s fourth season, Ghost Rider (Gabriel Luna) first appeared to Daisy (Chloe Bennet) as Robbie Reyes, a kid with car and a sense of justice. But when she pressed the issue of his apparent vigilantism, she met the Rider. Bursting forth from Robbie’s skull, the character had an aspect body horror about him. Later, viewers grasped the real terror as Robbie slowly let Daisy and Coulson (Clark Gregg) know the truth: the previous Rider – who may or may not have been Johnny Blaze – saved Robbie from a car wreck and passed the Rider onto him. Once bonded, the Spirit of Vengeance learned the accident was meant as a reprisal against Robbie’s uncle Eli (José Zuñiga), a would-be crime lord attempting to use the mystical Darkhold to further his plans. The Rider and Robbie formed an uneasy alliance as they became protectors of East L.A. Nonetheless, the Rider’s interest in serving vengeance on Eli meant their partnership was always uneasy.Subsequent terrors included the Rider’s possession of Mack (Henry Simmons), the moment he finally dragged Eli to Hell, and his haunting deal with Coulson.The basic horror element here is, of course, demonic possession. And while more gruesome and graphic scenes were downplayed (this is still ABC after all), the terror of the Rider comes not just from his look, but from the way people feel when he inhabits them and the last traumatic effects. The series played him properly as supernatural force even the seasoned S.H.I.E.L.D. agents found terrifying.The Walkers&nbsp;| The Walking Dead  80%,&nbsp;Fear the Walking Dead  75%, and the Upcoming Third Walking Dead Series(Photo by AMC)How can we have a list of the scariest comic book characters on television without mentioning the Walkers of AMC’s various Walking Dead programs. Even if none of the shows use the word, they still trade in the existential horror of zombies — the notion that your body will be absorbed into some mindless mass of flesh after you die. Beyond that, zombie fiction also comes with a healthy dose of claustrophobia and the absolute terror of potential killing your own loved-ones once they turned. Also, because everyone in The Walking Dead world is a bad day from becoming a Walker, death takes on a second, awful meaning.But beyond the intellectual horrors of the zombie concept, the Walkers are incredible special effects. For the last decade, Greg Nicotero and his KNB EFX Group have done amazing things on television budgets and schedules to make Walkers ooze, crawl, drip, and gross out viewers. Sure, the Walkers are often just a mass of bodies swarming encampments – and, to be fair, that mass is terrifying – but the featured Walkers realized by KNB will remind viewers just how discussing and terrible zombification would be.Ramsey Rosso and His “Blood Brothers”&nbsp;| The Flash  89%The most recent entry on the list takes some of its cues from the Walkers, but offers the classic image of the zombie a superhero upgrade thanks to dark matter and some occasionally dodgy CGI. Debuting in last week’s episode of The Flash, but getting a proper workout this week, the corpses controlled by Ramsey Rosso (Sendhil Ramamurthy) represent a dose of genuine horror movie tropes in the generally bright world of The Flash.Now changed by his strange dark-matter-and-blood substance, Rosso needs to feed on the living to maintain his existence – shades of a vampire there – but must first generate intense fear in them for the blood infusion to be effective. And if those ideas weren’t terrifying enough, he can also control the bodies of his victims in a manner reminiscent of the Walkers before they eventually dissolve into more of that blood-like ooze.The effects work may not be up to par with The Walking Dead, but the ideas are effective and the “blood brothers” oozy ends are particularly gross.Rosso and his blood-kin also represent a new kind of horror – the sort which occurs when your work starts owning you. Rosso is so driven to cure his HLH that he is willing to sacrifice his own humanity – and the humanity of those he meets – to do it. Oh, and one supposes there is an element of egotism there, as well. Call it a critique of late-stage capitalism or the dangers of an out-of-whack work/life balance, but the results are pretty consistent with the sort of themes one finds under the decaying flesh of a zombie.And considering how humdrum the last few Flash villains have been, a horror-tinged adversary like Rosso is a welcome change.Jason Woodrue&nbsp;| Swamp Thing  92%(Photo by DC Universe)One of the great disappointments of DC Universe’s decision to cancel Swamp Thing after one year was that we only had one quick scene with Jason Woodrue (Kevin Durand) as the monstrous Floronic Man. It is a great scene in which Matt Cable (Henderson Wade) walks into the Marais Sherriff’s HQ and discovers all his coworkers dead. The power is out, the shadows are deep, and when Matt can make out distinct images, they are of persistent vegetation. Then he comes upon the Floronic Man, now seemingly driven mad from becoming a plant-based lifeform. The two exchange brief words, but the creature knows what it wants to do – kill anyone it encounters.This post-credit scene is a marvel, but it represent the culmination of the work Durand put into the previous ten episodes of the series establishing Woodrue as one of its great slow-burn menaces. And considering the show’s titular hero is himself a body-slashing figure of horror himself, that is saying something.Invited to Marais by local businessman Avery Sunderland (Will Patton) to investigate why the local swamp is having a bad reaction to his special “accelerant,” Woodrue appears as a man more invested in plants than people. The notable exception: his ailing wife Carolyn (Selena Anduze), who has a form of early onset Alzheimer’s Disease. Woodrue hopes to find a cure for her in the swamp and its reaction to his formula, but his offbeat personality changes into something menacing once he chances a look at Abby Arcane’s (Crystal Reed) sample of Swamp Thing’s (Derek Mears) plant matter. Soon it grows into an obsession and leads him to a place where he is willing to use his wife as a lab rat to prove he can save her.The terror here is, of course, that of a spouse gone wrong. And while it might be on a more operatic scale, the final moments of Woodrue and Carolyn’s relationship could just as easily be a more naturalistic episode of domestic violence. But since this is Swamp Thing, the ideas are heightened and Durand’s performance, already on the edge from the moment he first appears on screen, explodes into something altogether horrifying.The Reverse-Flash&nbsp;| The Flash  89%(Photo by Jordan Nuttall/The CW)While some of Barry Allen’s (Grant Gustin) other Speedster rogues may lean into more obvious horror clichés – Zoom, for one, would be at home in a film in which he slaughters camp counselors by the score – the original Reverse-Flash (Tom Cavanagh) consistently pulled off being the scariest character on comic book television in 2014 and 2015 while wearing a yellow suit.Thanks to his blurred face, crackling red eyes, and his mastery of speed, the character exuded menace and generated terror whenever he zipped into the frame. And to that Cavanagh’s stellar performance (both with and without vocal distortion), he continues to be the benchmark of villainy on that show. Consider his appearance during the 100th episode, in which he generated a season’s worth of chills in just three short scenes and out of costume.But in form of the Reverse-Flash, he is a sight to behold. A vision of terror fused with the generally heroic aspects of The Flash’s own design. The success of that vision made Barry’s own go at being a nightmare of himself — the time remnant known as Savitar — far less successful. Of course, it also proves more is less as the simple methods and motives of the Reverse-Flash still successful engage audiences when villains like The Thinker and Savitar fail to impress.His form of terror may not be as universal as demons or zombies. Indeed, it is very personal to Barry and, oddly enough, Cisco Ramon (Carlos Valdes). But it nevertheless manages to inspire some nightmares for viewers of The Flash. He is that relentless thing looking to tear down your accomplishments and undermine everything you aspire to be and&nbsp;a form of depression personified&nbsp;— with violence, calculation, and Cavanagh’s voice.Which characters do you think are the scariest that have jumped from comic books to television?

With that in mind, you might find yourself increasingly inclined to stay home and catch up on some TV ahead of all the premieres. Here are six shows that might do the trick for you.Transparent  90%What it is: Jeffrey Tambor plays a father who wants to live his life as a woman and needs to tell his adult children.Why you should watch it: Tambor’s turn as Maura is award-worthy, but what is most surprising is how it’s just one facet of this family dramedy. All the members of the Pfefferman clan are struggling with their own demons and each storyline is full and fascinating to follow. It’s a study of faith, family, and dysfunction that is well worth the time it’ll take you to binge-watch it. The third season premieres on Amazon on September 23, so you have some time to get caught up.Where to watch:&nbsp;Amazon (included with Prime), Google Play (S1 only), Microsoft (S1 Only),&nbsp;Playstation Video (S1 only),&nbsp;Vudu (S1 only)Commitment:&nbsp;About 9.5 hoursHow to Get Away With Murder  88%What it is: Annalise Keating (Viola Davis) is a criminal defense attorney and professor teaching law students how to defend the accused, while tangling them up in a real-life murder mystery of their own.Why you should watch it: Viola Davis’ Emmy-nominated performance, mixed with the twisty drama stylings of Shondaland Productions (Scandal, Grey’s Anatomy) will deliver a barrage of riveting mystery right into your lap. A darker tone than Grey’s and Scandal, HTGAWM has surprised audiences with its unrelenting, austere tone, permeated with intense character drama. With the premiere of its third season coming up on September 22, you can get caught up if you burn through the first two seasons now.Where to watch:&nbsp;Amazon, Google Play, Hulu, iTunes, Microsoft, Netflix, Playstation Video,&nbsp;VuduCommitment:&nbsp;About 22 hoursAmerican Horror Story  77%What it is:&nbsp;This ensemble anthology series examines a different aspect of cinematic horror each season, ranging from insane asylums to cursed carnivals to haunted hotels.Why you should watch it:&nbsp;Each&nbsp;season feels like creators Ryan Murphy and Brad Falchuk made a list of things you can’t show on network television for fear of sending ladies scrambling for their fainting couches, and then found a story to fit them. Beautifully shot, with fantastic production value in sets and costumes, and a talented cast to rival that of any other cable show, AHS feels like a modern continuation of Hammer horror films instead of just a cheap rip-off. We don’t know what the theme of season six — premiering on September 14 — will be, but since every season is a self-contained story, you can catch up on old episodes and watch the new ones at the same time!Where to watch:&nbsp;Amazon, Google Play, Hulu,&nbsp;iTunes, Microsoft, Netflix,&nbsp;Playstation Video,&nbsp;VuduCommitment:&nbsp;About 48&nbsp;hoursGotham  77%What it is: In this Batman prequel set in the corruption of Gotham City, Detectives Jim Gordon (Benjamin McKenzie) and Harvey Bullock (Donal Logue) investigate the murder of Bruce Wayne’s parents, while running up against a number of villains from the Batman universe.Why you should watch it: If the DC branding and Batman-as-a-kid angle isn’t enough to hook you immediately, we understand; it sounds a little gimmicky. But trust us: it’s an effective police procedural with solid acting that manages to work a little comic book fun into its storytelling, which makes for an eminently watchable near-hour of pulpy TV. The third season premieres on September 10, so it’ll be tough to catch up now, but if you’re a little behind, you’ve got some time before the first episode airs.Where to watch: Amazon, Google Play, Hulu,&nbsp;iTunes, Microsoft, Netflix,&nbsp;Playstation Video,&nbsp;VuduCommitment:&nbsp;About 32 hoursGrey's Anatomy  84%What it is: Surgical interns and residents at&nbsp;a Seattle hospital&nbsp;save lives and perform unconventional surgeries as they gossip and sleep their way to the top of the medical industry.Why you should watch it: The huge ensemble cast is one of the most talented in recent years, and the show is excellent at transitioning smoothly from old characters to new ones. Grey’s tugs at the heart in virtually every episode, and it’s so fervidly charged that it might drain you of emotion by the time its hour is up, but showrunner Shonda Rhimes knows you can’t cry with someone unless you’ve also laughed with them, so the show’s not without a sense of humor. September 22 is the premiere of the show’s 13th season, so godspeed to you if you’re looking to get caught up from the beginning.Where to watch: Amazon, Google Play, Hulu,&nbsp;iTunes, Microsoft, Netflix,&nbsp;Playstation Video, and&nbsp;VuduCommitment:&nbsp;About 196.5 hours (so get cracking!)The Blacklist  91%What it is: James Spader stars in this NBC drama about a high profile criminal who agrees to help the FBI track down other criminals in exchange for his freedom.Why you should watch it: James Spader’s critically acclaimed performance as cop-to-criminal Raymond “Red” Reddington has been the central force behind The Blacklist. But over the last three seasons, audiences have found themselves gripped by&nbsp;the the relationship between Red and Officer Liz Keen (Megan Boone). The ensuing storyline has found the two in need of each other’s help, making for more intense thrills and intriguing character work.Where to watch: Amazon, Google Play, iTunes, Microsoft, Netflix,&nbsp;Playstation Video, and&nbsp;VuduCommitment:&nbsp;About 47 hours","section":"Binge Guide","tags":"TCA, Mindy, Countdown, USA, Tyler, theme, Movies, jamie, foreign, of, Family, streaming","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/06143322/American-Horror-Story-Binge-September.jpg","slug":"6-tv-shows-you-should-binge-watch-this-september"},{"id":"47508674103014","title":"Weekly Binge: Broad City","content":"Binge Guidevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Weekly Binge: Broad Cityby Shira Levine | December 17, 2014 |  CommentsOnce a cult hit web series and now a critically acclaimed TV series, Comedy Central’s Broad City is the perfect “sick day” binge. We won’t tell you what you should be doing while watching Abbi and Ilana’s totally raunchy, completely hilarious misadventures in New York City, but we will tell you how to find it and why it’s worth watching them clean toilets and score dime bags.Broad CityWhat’s the premise? Abbi (Abbi Jacobson) and Ilana (Ilana Glazer), two broke girls (who aren’t those two broke girls), awkwardly yet hilariously she-bone their way around Gotham City ISO of love, fun, work, money, lost cellphones, missed opportunities, pseudo-sophistication, and weed.What’s it like? Imagine if the entire cast of Girls weren’t the daughters of well-connected famous folk but instead, were less privileged, more vulgar, and had way less ambition. Or take the fairy tale lifestyle fabulously depicted by Sex and the City 15 years ago and toss it in the gutter. Rather than Dior, de Montparnasse, and de la Renta, Abbi and Ilana rock the Sevigny look by stumbling out in something of an American Apparel and Urban Outfitters tornado of lycra and crop tops paired with Beacon’s Closet secondhand “finds.” And it’s all in the glorious name of feeling fly versus actually looking fabulous. “Gym, tan, laundry” may be the mantra for Jersey Shore, but “high, laid, and paid” is the Ilana and Abbi trifecta.Where can I see it? Season one is included with an Amazon Prime membership or can be downloaded from iTunes, Google Play, Vudu, or Amazon Instant Video. You can also log into ComedyCentral.com with your cable provider and watch all ten episodes online, or check out the DVD, available as of this month.How long will it take? With just 10 episodes at 22 minutes apiece, season one can be done in one blur of a day.What do the critics think? Critics are definitely on board with Broad City. Season one is Certified Fresh at 95 percent on the Tomatometer, with Caroline Framke of AV Club writing, “Ilana Glazer and Abbi Jacobsen are worth watching. Trust me.” Karen Valby of Entertainment Weekly called Broad City a “deeply weird, weirdly sweet, and completely hilarious comedy,” while Lori Rackl of the Chicago Sun-Times said “This outgrowth of a cult-hit web series is a lighter, wackier and often funnier version of HBO’s Girls.”Why should I watch this? While Ilanna and Abbi audaciously dive head-first into things few even dare to joke about, the show is what some might call “sneak attack feminism.” Their hilarious, frenetically spoken stream of consciousness covers everything from fears to fetishes and plays out like a show Jerry Seinfeld would say is about nothing — but the broads emphatically show is about everything. “If you watch one of our episodes, there’s not a big message,” Jacobson told The Wall Street Journal. “But if you watch all of them, I think they’re empowering to women.” Plus, they have upped the ante from first season guesties like Amy Poehler and Janeane Garofalo to Seth Rogen and Curb Your Enthusiasm‘s Susie Essman in season two. Also, two words: Hannibal Buress. Hannibal Buress. Hannibal Buress. (Okay, six words.) The comedian plays Ilanna’s super-patient and adorably loving friend-with-benefits-dentist-not-quite-boyfriend.What’s my next step? If you’re obsessed with Broad City like most die-hard fans, then you’ll likely love Kroll Show, Inside Amy Schumer, Key &amp; Peele, Drunk History, The Birthday Boys, and pretty much everything by executive producer Amy Poehler.

Often times, the original material casts a long shadow, and a lot of remakes never get a chance to establish their own identity. But every once in a while, you get that rarest of gems: a remake that almost completely eclipses its original inspiration. The “re-imagined” Battlestar Galactica was one of those rare gems.Battlestar GalacticaWhat’s the premise? In a distant star system, the whole of humanity now numbers less than 50,000 after a genocidal attack by the robotic Cylons. The survivors have banded together, fleeing their home worlds in a mismatched collection of passenger liners, cargo ships, and an old, obsolete warship with a second-rate crew, named Galactica. These refugees need a new home, and they pin all their hopes on the finding a legendary lost world called Earth. But the Cylons are still out there, on the hunt. And some of them look just like humans.What’s it like? Battlestar Galactica tells a long-ranging story full of twists and turns, similar to Lost or Game of Thrones. The original series was meant to capitalize on the hunger for anything that looked like Star Wars (at least from a network standpoint) and so that meant it was relatively kid-friendly. The updated show isn’t; there are a lot of adult themes here and we never see the kid and the robot-dog who were central to the old show. Instead we get the sexiest androids this side of Blade Runner. And, although this is a sci-fi show about spaceships and robots, it’s also deeply philosophical. At its best, sci-fi raises questions about society, religion, or what it means to be human, and the writers of Battlestar Galactica embraced those opportunities. The show isn’t afraid to tackle a lot of the complicated issues that came up in the US in the wake of the 9/11 attacks — most notably, the balance of security versus democracy.Where can I see it? There are some pretty comprehensive DVD and Blu-ray box sets available, or you can purchase episodes on Amazon Instant Video, iTunes, Google Play, and Vudu.How long will it take? If you go all-in with the original mini-series and TV movies, you’re looking at almost 80 hours of viewing. So if you were to do nothing but watch TV all day, you could finish this in a week. To be clear, we don’t recommend this. Like most of us, you’ll have to balance annoyances like a job and a social life, so watching all of Battlestar Galactica will likely take a least a couple of months.What do the critics think? The critics were very impressed with the introductory mini-series and the first two seasons of the show. In her review for the Los Angeles Times, Mary McNamara called it “not just a cult hit but a significant piece of television.” Maureen Ryan of the Chicago Tribune praised the series for being “full of political allegories and fascinating, multifaceted characters.” But for some critics, the love didn’t last. Some said that the show started to lose its way in the third season. Charlie Jane Anders of io9.com wrote, “By the time the show ended, its mystique was somewhat tarnished, and its ending remains controversial to this day.”Why should I watch this? Battlestar Galactica did something very unusual; Ronald D. Moore and his creative team took a cult favorite and made it better. The basic mythology from the original show is here, but it’s only a jumping-off point. If you know the old show, you’ll recognize some of the character names but the writers have their own spin. Sure, Apollo’s still the straight-arrow son of the Commander, and Starbuck is still the rowdy gambler, but recasting Starbuck as a female drastically changes the dynamic of their friendship. Adama, Tigh, Baltar, and Boomer all get updates, and frankly it makes the show a lot richer than the source material. The cast is anchored by veteran actors Edward James Olmos and Mary McDonnell, with the rest of the cast rounded out mostly by relative newcomers. We’ve continued to see Katee Sackhoff, Jamie Bamber, James Callis, Tricia Helfer, and Grace Park in movies or TV shows, and BSG is what put them on the map. Battlestar Galactica was telling smarter stories and featured better developed characters than almost anything on TV at the time, and it was one of the few shows to take a frank (and almost real-time) look at how the War on Terror was playing out after 9/11. And though the later seasons of the show were disappointing, emotional investment in the characters kept many fans coming back to the very end.What’s my next step? There’s a fair amount of material set in the BSG universe. After Battlestar Galactica wrapped, Moore created a prequel series called Caprica, set almost 60 years before the events of Galactica. In spite of critical acclaim, the show didn’t find enough of an audience to get a second season. But if you want some more back story in that universe, Caprica fits the bill. There is also a prequel movie called Blood &amp; Chrome, which covers an early mission for a young William Adama. And of course there’s the original 1979 series (which holds up okay) and Galactica 1980 (which doesn’t hold up well at all). On the other hand, if you find you like Ron Moore’s writing, he’s currently involved with Helix on SyFy and Outlander on Starz. And you might consider giving his Star Trek work a try. As a writer, Moore cut his teeth on Star Trek: The Next Generation and had an increasing level of supervision over Star Trek: Deep Space Nine, starting in that show’s third season.Are you ready to catch up on Battlestar Galactica?

Without the pregnant pause between episodes, you’ll be caught up in no time!&nbsp;Call the MidwifeWhat’s the premise? The show chronicles the stories of a young midwife in the 1950s as she joins an order of nursing nuns at Nonnatus House, a clinic in London’s East End. With an assignment she wasn’t expecting, Nurse Jenny Lee jumps in with both feet (and many receiving blankets), attending to destitute mothers and parents-to-be within harrowing surroundings.What’s it like? Referred to as a show to fill the void when Downton Abbey‘s popularity began waning, Call the Midwife is a period piece with heart. The stories we see, based on the real-life memoirs of Jennifer Worth, vary from saddening to joyous, and from charming to disturbing. Some of the topics confronted are not only extreme taboos for the time period (such as, inter-racial adultery), but are also taboo today (for example, sibling incest). Serious issues are handled with care and humor. For instance, Sister Monica Joan (Judy Parfitt) gets laughs for her often funny yet sensitively handled bouts of dementia. She blurts out random profundities such as, “Dogs look up to us; cats look down on us; pigs treat us as equals” and “Once a thing is known, it can never be unknown.” One thing that is known: the characters in Midwife are too endearing to ignore, especially when thrust into ghastly predicaments. And don’t discredit this show in the special effects category, because some of these births are vivid and even gruesome.Where can I see it? Episodes of Call the Midwife can be seen on Amazon Instant Video, Vudu, iTunes and Netflix. Seasons one and two are available on DVD/Blu-Ray and you can usually find episodes on your local cable provider website. Season three is currently airing on the PBS website and new episodes are posted there once they’ve aired.How long will it take? We are currently at the beginning of season three. Seasons one and two are made up of fourteen episodes combined, along with two holiday specials. So 17 episodes, each about 50 minutes, adds up to around 14 hours — easily accomplished in one weekend, if you are committed. And no need for an epidural because those hours will pass quickly, especially as the series progresses into the nitty-gritty.What do the critics think? Call the Midwife is one of the best shows that you (and even many critics) are not watching. Season one is Certified Fresh at 95%. Seasons two and three are both 80 percent on the Tomatometer, but there are very few reviews of each. The reviews that do exist are mostly raves. Of season one, TV Guide’s Matt Roush says, “The heart-tugging Call the Midwife is a delight to watch” and Rob Owen of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette says, “Midwife offers a similar mix of warm drama with moments of character comedy that should appeal to Downton Abbey fans.” PopMatters’ J.M. Suarez says of season two: “Call the Midwife continues to be a highly enjoyable story about a very specific and underrepresented group of women in a time when their independence and skill was the exception.” And for season three, Kristi Turnquist of the Oregonian explains, “What makes Call the Midwife special is how the stories grip us on a human level.”Why should I watch this? Vanessa Redgrave hooks you immediately as the narrator, an elder version of Jenny Lee. What keeps us on that hook are the midwives, who do amazing, life-changing work without recognition. Also, Call the Midwife has riveting surprises. You might not expect such terrible, visceral moments in what first appears as a charming, low-key drama. When those things happen, it’s extra exciting to remember that these stories are based on true memoirs. (It’s also interesting to note that each episode of season three is directed by a woman.) If you are looking for an engaging period presentation with lighthearted humor and heavyhearted drama, Midwife delivers!What’s my next step? The Complete Call the Midwife Stories: True Stories of the East End in the 1950s by Jennifer Worth, the memoirs from which the series was created, is a great place to start. The subject of last week’s Weekly Binge, Nurse Jackie, is a more contemporary nursing show that might interest Midwife fans. Midwife also drew multiple comparisons to Downton Abbey. Nip/Tuck is another medical drama (albeit a bit more twisted and sensational) that exploits gripping medical visual effects. M*A*S*H*, both the film and television series might gratify, as might episodes of Quincy M.E., which also tackled controversial medical topics. For fun, you may enjoy such comedies about childbirth as Junior, For Keeps and especially Baby Boom with Diane Keaton.What do you like about Call the Midwife? How would you explain it to a newborn?

With it, some questions about the Marvel Cinematic Universe have been answered, but perhaps more importantly, Loki Laufeyson (Tom Hiddleston) has a new lease on life and a new perspective. Although, it remains to be seen if the setting of the series or Loki’s actions will prove more important in the long run. And though the first episode may have revelled in the sort of “talkie-talkie” the God of Mischief enjoys, there is still plenty to discuss about the series debut. So let’s dive into the premiere and see what we can glean from Loki’s opening hour, “Glorious Purpose.”Spoiler Alert: The following reveals details of the premiere episode of Loki season 1. Stop here if you have not watched “Glorious Purpose.”Loki’s “Glorious Purpose” Kills Free Will(Photo by Marvel Studios)Considering all the pain unleashed during the Infinity Saga, it is interesting to see this variant Loki discover the Infinity Stones are no more than paperweights in the realm of the Time Variance Authority. It puts our recent tracking of the Stones in a different light as the Time-Keepers clearly molded the search for them in a very specific way. And, yeah, we have reached the point where it probably is time to joke about them and, at least in a meta-narrative sense, de-power them. But that speaks to an interesting set-up for the TVA as a function of the MCU and the real conflict playing out in Loki.As explained in the episode, the TVA grew out of a multiversal war that saw the Time-Keepers emerge and reshape it into a single, “sacred” timeline. That explanation suggests the sort of parallel worlds seen in the DC Multiverse do not exist here. Instead, there are divergent timelines the TVA prune and reset before they can become proper alternate worlds.The quashing of timeline-branching&nbsp;is interesting because of a philosophical element inherent to the very concept of multiverses: they prove the existence of free will. If choice is more than an illusion, then every consequence of that choice must exist outside the perception of the one making the choice. The simplest example:&nbsp;A driver turning right ends up in a crash, while the same driver turning left arrives at work on time. The notion that both outcomes exist simultaneously is a key part of real quantum theory and an element of the multiverse concept well before DC or Marvel incorporated the idea into their storytelling.But within the confines of Loki, we discover another wrinkle: The Avengers were always meant to go on the Time Heist, while Loki’s escape from Stark Tower is an aberration to the Sacred Timeline. This suggests free will, at least in the MCU, is an illusion. Three all-powerful “space lizards” dictate the proper flow of time and the choices we’ve seen play out in the Marvel movies (and the two Disney+ series thus far) were predetermined long before Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) built the Mark I Iron Man suit in a cave using scraps.Also, there is an interesting meta-narrative going on here as Marvel Studios president Kevin Feige, head writer Michael Waldron, and director Kate Herron effectively act as the Time-Keepers of this series. Truly, Loki’s actions are not his own.Loki Confronts the Lie of FreedomOur current understanding of the TVA puts Loki’s journey in a new light. His stated ambition to rule was always to order people away from what calls the “lie of freedom.” Sure, there are also the sore feelings he carries around for Odin (Anthony Hopkins) and Thor (Chris Hemsworth), but the family squabble underscores the way Loki wanted to organize the universe into a realm under his direction.Curious, then, that a variant of Loki would learn that ambition was never really his and that his life was carefully curated by space lizards to be a villain. One thing actors who play villains always note is that the characters never see themselves as the bad guy. So Loki actually learning he is a villain is a revolutionary moment for the MCU. The antagonists generally have a seemingly reasonable purpose to their actions; whether that be Ego’s (Kurt Russell) basic need to procreate or Thanos’ (Josh Brolin) grim calculus. But for Loki, his mischief no longer serves the burden of glorious purpose he perceived in his life. He is finally exposed to the truth that he is the bad guy.Granted, Loki is such a scamp that we never want to see him reduced to so simple a thing, so the series will likely disprove the determination of the Time-Keepers.Also, Loki fighting against (or giving into) his nature will likely be an ongoing internal conflict for the character. Released from the timeline and unburdened by his purpose, will he attempt to gain control of the TVA or will he be transformed by the experiences he will face? While the Loki of the prime timeline proved to have heroic qualities, will this variant find his way to the same path? Maybe witnessing a truly villainous Loki Laufeyson will push him in that direction.A&nbsp;Variant Darkly:&nbsp;Loki&nbsp;Has Endless Potential&nbsp;— For Now AnywayAlthough Marvel Studios often mentioned the series would feature Loki chasing himself, actually hearing Mobius M. Mobius (Owen Wilson) say Loki is the variant he needs Loki’s help to stop tilts everything we presumed about the show.For one thing, we always assumed Loki would cause some chaos with the Tesseract before the TVA caught up with him and forced him to undo his mischief. Now, we see there’s a much more dangerous Loki variant running around capable of actually hurting TVA agents. The first question we have to ask about this variant is fairly obvious: From when in the Sacred Timeline did they spring? There are a handful of tantalizing moments in history to consider. One option, this is the Loki who grew up in Jotunheim under the tutelage of his true father, Laufey. Another option: This Loki successfully collected the Infinity Stones for himself and upended all of space of time. It is also possible the dangerous Loki variant is from the multiversal war; predating the Time-Keepers could explain why the variant presents a real threat to the TVA.Then there’s the motive to consider. We’re told that at each of the attacks, the dangerous variant steals the reset charges. From what we’ve so far, these charges undo any effects of a breach to the timeline; the French child forgets meeting Mobius&nbsp;and the Kablooie candy&nbsp;the dangerous variant gave him, for example. If Loki is collecting charges, are they looking to reset something on a colossal scale?If the variant is from that multiversal war, they might be looking to undo the TVA entirely and, as Miss Minutes (Tara Strong) put it, return to the Multiverse of Madness. Also, we couldn’t help but notice those words were in close proximity during her presentation or the fact Waldron rewrote Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness for director Sam Raimi. The connection must be ordained by the Time-Keepers of our reality. That, or the reference to the upcoming film is just a joke. Loki is a funny show after all.Read Also: “Marvel’s Kevin Feige on The Falcon and The Winter Soldier, WandaVision, and Which MCU Shows Could Get Second Seasons“The Coulson Question: Was He Revived in the MCU?(Photo by ©Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures/courtesy Everett Collection)The prominent appearance of Phil Coulson (Clark Gregg, pictured) in Mobius’s recap of Loki’s life once again puts the question of the agent’s survival in play. To recap: When he was killed in The Avengers, plans for the Marvel’s Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. television series were already underway. Though Coulson was meant to be the person the team was literally avenging, his future was ordained.He went to T.A.H.I.T.I. It’s a magical place.Initially, the series was meant to be connected to the movies —just like the Disney+ series are now — and that seemed to be the case through the program’s second season; Coulson even gives Maria Hill (Cobie Smulders, also pictured) the location of the Hydra base in Sokovia,&nbsp;and the information sets off the events of Avengers: Age of Ultron. Despite the connection, the Avengers never learned that Coulson was alive. Eventually, the series’ pilot director suggested it took place in an alternate timeline where Coulson was revived, while the films continued on in a reality where he died. And, ultimately, real-world considerations pushed the series and the movies further apart to the point where its final two seasons simply cannot be canon.(Photo by Marvel Studios)So was Phil Coulson revived in the MCU? That ambiguity plays nicely into Loki‘s themes and a concept like the TVA could offer S.H.I.E.L.D. some form of canonicity — if even just to declare the entire series part of an divergent timeline. But there is also a broader S.H.I.E.L.D. question to consider, as WandaVision head writer Jac Schaeffer avoided any comment on the organization’s status, and The Falcon and the Winter Soldier made a mention of Sharon Carter’s (Emily VanCamp) “old division” starting up again. If S.H.I.E.L.D. re-emerges in, say, Secret Invasion, Marvel Studios needs to make a definite choice about Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. and its stories.Also, Loki discovering he couldn’t even kill Phil Coulson would be another great way to deflate his glorious purpose. Or, perhaps, it is the pivotal event the dangerous variant is trying to reset. But time will tell if any of these conjectures prove to be the case.

Based on the acclaimed comic book series by Joe Hill and Gabriel Rodriguez, it tells the tale of a family shattered by tragedy who move to Lovecraft, Massachusetts, only to discover their ancestral home is a place of magic, demons, and unresolved history. Published from 2008 to 2013, it was a smash for publisher IDW and quickly earned the interest of television producers.In 2011, a pilot was produced for the Fox broadcast network which failed to go to series, but was warmly received when it screened at Comic-Con International: San Diego. After that, it spent some time as a feature film project before executive producer Carlton Cuse (Lost) got a hold of it in 2017. A pilot episode, produced for Hulu in 2018, would receive the same fate as the Fox pilot. The project soon moved to Netflix, where The Haunting of Hill House’s Meredith Averill came on board as a co-showrunner, and a third pilot was filmed. But as Cuse told Rotten Tomatoes, the program needed that near-decade in development to strike the right tone even as the material inspired him to keep at it.“The impetus to continue to work on this just came from a love of the comic,” he said. Reading it when first it first debuted in 2008,&nbsp;Locke &amp; Key quickly became one of his favorite comics ever. “[Joe and Gabriel] pulled off the near impossible, which was to do something that was emotional and heartfelt but also really genre. And it felt fresh. It didn’t feel like it was the derivative of like 20 other things, which they very easily could have done.”The mix of genres and tones made it something special and something worth shepherding through two development cycles and two streaming platforms.“There’s horror, there’s fantasy, there’s magical keys, there’s a murder mystery, there’s teen drama. And trying to sort those all out and kind of calibrate them and put them all together and make them all work together was something that’s hard to do,” Cuse said.“It doesn’t fit into a box,”&nbsp;Averill added, “which I think is what’s made it difficult and a challenge to adapt, but also what makes it so special and unique.”Cuse credited Averill with helping him “finding a shared vision for how we wanted to do the show.” At the same time, he considers the long development something akin to the way many TV shows begin.“Just in the same way that if you make a pilot, you’ve made calibrations and readjustments [for its eventual series], we tried to learn lessons from the previous iterations,” Cuse said.Those lessons led Cuse and Averill away from the more grotesque horror elements – though some of that still occurs – into a series which leans more into the family and fantasy aspects of the comic book. Averill said it was a conscious decision to avoid the graphic horror because “once you go there, there’s sort of no going back once you’ve set that tone.” Also, she noted the material does not have to be gory to be scary.“There are other ways to get there,” she said.And the other ways the television series gets to some of Locke &amp; Key’s ideas may surprise readers of the comic the most. Elements barely hinted at in the initial two stories become important touch points in the program’s first season. Character relationships are refocused and, perhaps most unsettling for some fans of the comic, the town of Lovecraft is now Matheson – a reference to horror and sci-fi writer Richard Matheson, who also worked in television and saw his stories adapted into films like I Am Legend and The Box.(Photo by Christos Kalohoridis/Netflix)As both producers pointed out, bringing a comic book to television is an exercise in “adaptation, not translation.”“I think that we were so fortunate to get the freedom to remix from Joe Hill himself,” Cuse revealed. “I mean Joe was an active participant in our creative process. He co-authored the pilot. We had a lot of conversations with him all along the way. And his comment was, ‘Just doing a literal adaptation of my comic would be boring.’ And so he liberated us to not be afraid to really follow our creative instincts and desires.”Those instincts often led the team to bring ideas from later in the comic into the forefront of the show for the sake of clearly delineating character ambitions. In the case of Dodge (Laysla De Oliveira, pictured), whose motivations are a mystery for some time in the book, Averill felt it was important to reveal the character’s true nature and objective as soon as possible. She was also pleased by the way it dovetailed into stories of the Locke family in Matheson.“I think it’s a really nice reveal for our kids when they discover that what’s happening to them now has to do [with Dodge],” she said.Other changes, like the Locke family initially living in Seattle instead of San Francisco were for “aesthetic” reasons and often suggested by Hill himself, who Cuse said was fascinated with the process and used the opportunity to make changes to his world. This is also the underlying reason Lovecraft became Matheson.“He just wanted to pay homage to Richard Matheson who had died recently,” Cuse explained.Connor Jessup, who plays oldest Locke son Tyler – and who came to the series with the Netflix iteration – felt the long development and remixing of ideas aided the show it getting to the core spirit of the comic.“I think [it’s] about growing up through trauma, essentially,” he said.As a result, the show feels more of like a fantasy adventure to him than the gothic horror he saw in the comics when he sat down to read them.But part of Locke &amp; Key’s magic, both as a comic book and as a television show, revolves around the way it transforms into different genres with each scene and combination of characters. This was part of the appeal for Darby Stanchfield, who plays the grieving Locke matriarch Nina.“It’s almost like three different layers wrapped up in one,” she said.Of those layers – the fantasy, the mystery, and the family – Stanchfield felt from talking with Cuse and Averill that the family aspect was the most important. The Lockes have been thought a lot when we first meet them and their first few months in Matheson are no easier. Nevertheless, the Lockes’ bond endures and, to Stanchfield, forms the heart of the show.“Which to me really extended to the heart of the kids and their high school friends,” she added.In perhaps one of the bigger departures from the initial comic book storylines, a group of high school kids called “The Savini Squad” — in honor of horror effects make-up legend Tom Savini — become prominent in the story very quickly, which was another one of Hill’s ideas for the show. Cuse said their appeal became apparent thanks to the iteration process.“It just seemed like, OK, this is going to be a big part of the show,” he said. “We should meet them in the pilot, we should get going with this.”The group, which quickly adopts Kinsey Locke (Emilia Jones) into their number, will no doubt become fan favorites.No matter how the show will be perceived, though, its curious production history will always be a part of its story. For Stanchfield and Jessup, taking over roles cast twice previously was something akin to taking over a part on stage. Nevertheless, there was some trepidation about watching the earlier versions.“At one point someone asked me if I would be interested in seeing the Hulu version of it, which was the previous version. And it unlocked like an enormous terror in me,” Jessup said. “I mean I’m sure they did a beautiful job, but the thought of seeing someone else in the same situations still makes my skin — I feel so uncomfortable about it.”Stanchfield also avoided the other pilots, but part of her decision to do so was on instruction from Averill and Cuse (pictured), who saw through her initial performance as Nina a new way to develop the character.“We like your approach and we want you to just go with that,” she recalled them saying.That difference in the character will be immediately apparent to readers of the comic, but Nina’s underling problems will eventually surface.In fact, the unexpected way Locke &amp; Key utilizes its source material may earn it a special place in viewers hearts — provided fans of the comic see the value in the ways it is not a literal translation.“I hope the people who like the comics also like our show and that they are open to the changes and that they’re excited by and surprised by some of the things that we do differently,” Jessup said. “For me it’s always more exciting [that way]. I mean, I love the comics too, and I wouldn’t want the show to try and be a cheap shadow imitation of it. I think it’s better for the comics and for the show if it tries and finds its own language.”Locke &amp; Key launches Friday, February 7 on Netflix.Like this?

All Rights Reserved.)Warning: The below contains spoilers for WandaVision episode 5.After last week’s episode of WandaVision returned to the Marvel Cinematic Universe, Episode 5’s attempt to go back to the TV format feels unconvincing. This is, of course, by design, as even Vision (Paul Bettany) is starting to see the artifice involved in his own television show. But does it mean Wanda (Elizabeth Olsen) is losing control of it all?Also, will a certain knock at the door change the MCU forever?Let’s take a look at the family ties involved in Episode 5 and what it could mean for the health of Wanda’s relationship.Clues Lie in the Aspect Ratio, And the Floor Plan(Photo by Chuck Zlotnick. ©Marvel Studios 2021. All Rights Reserved.)As we noted last week, Westview had so-far been presented in the old, boxy TV frame, while the world outside its city limits was shown in the MCU’s widescreen aspect ratio. This week, though, Westview’s take on 1980s family sitcoms contained a striking difference from shows of the era like Family Ties: it was framed in the modern dimensions of television. For those keeping track of the technical details, that’s the 16:9 frame of current flat-screen TVs or the 1.78:1 aspect ratio.That framing is important. With a few exceptions, television would not adopt the wider aspect ratio until the early part of the 21st century – it was a change enforced by the US government’s decision to abandon the old analog TV wavelength that Wanda is using and in deference to the proliferation of high definition flat screens. But as Wanda is using Family Ties as the source of 2800’s look this week – and this week’s sappy opening credits sequence – the wider framing is our first indication that she may be losing her grip on Westview.The recreation of the 1980s TV is not as accurate as the previous decades seen on the show. Besides the width of the frame, camera set-ups, lightning, and even performances all strike a more modern feel. See also: Wanda’s appropriation of the Keaton Family home. On Family Ties, their house is oriented in the exact opposite layout of 2800. The kitchen is to the far left of the stage and the front door stands at the back of the living room on the far-right. As head writer Jac Schaeffer told us recently, a certain level of consistency in the 2800 set was intentional and though the interior finishings greatly resemble those seen in the Keaton house – it has enough wood paneling to rival the Brady house – we’re beginning to believe the fairly consistent layout of 2800 is the true shape of the New Jersey home Wanda is using in her fantasy.And, as we’ve suspected all along, WandaVision wants us to believe this is all Wanda’s doing.The Sokovian Accent Returns(Photo by Chuck Zlotnick. ©Marvel Studios 2021. All Rights Reserved.)The most damning piece of evidence in the case against Wanda finally arrived this week when she emerged from Westview – or “the Hex” as Dr. Darcy Lewis (Kat Dennings) is calling it – to confront S.W.O.R.D. in an attempt to get them off her back. She seems fully aware of what’s happening and why. The scene also comes with one of the most unexpected returns: Wanda’s Sokovian accent.Though it was present in Avengers: Age of Ultron, Wanda appeared to have trained herself to speak in a more generic American accent by the time of Captain America: Civil War. But in her anger against S.W.O.R.D., she appeared more foreign than she has in nearly a decade. Just about anyone masking their native accent would do the same in a stressful situation, yet it is unclear if it was just her anger leading to Eastern European vowels and syntax. Even in her white-hot rage against Thanos (Josh Brolin), her accent didn’t break, so why allow the Sokovian part of her to be exposed now? It may be another sign that her control of the situation is weakening. It also suggests to us that her American accent was an early sign of her reality-warping ability.Or, it could be something we have not considered until now: Wanda may still under the influence of Hydra.S.W.O.R.D. Director Hayward (Josh Stamberg) was pretty quick to consider her an enemy combatant and the accent slip could be an indication of a personality buried in Wanda’s psyche which is still loyal to Hydra; although, in both the MCU and Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. realities, the organization is complete defunct. Even the commercials would seem to agree with this, although, as this week’s product prominently featured Lagos, it would also seem the ads are accounting for the worst events of Wanda’s life.As it happens, Monica’s (Teyonah Parris) testimony about the energy around Westview seems to confirm our suspicious about what is really going on. As she put it, the barrier felt like grief and considering the way she stormed the facility housing Vision’s corpse, we’re inclined to belief her inability to grieve anything is the true source of the Hex.The Vision Thing and What It (Might) Mean(Photo by Chuck Zlotnick. ©Marvel Studios 2021. All Rights Reserved.)Then again, it is possible her grief-stricken psyche is beginning to heal – if one wants to be charitable in their interpretation of events. For one thing, she’s less interested in hiding her powers, producing a dog collar from thin air in full view of Agnes (Kathryn Hahn). For another, her control over Vision is weakening and she did nothing to edit out his suspicions about their situation. (If you want to be less charitable, Vision’s increasing independence and understanding of his situation could also be another sign of Wanda losing control in every conceivable sense.)Also, there is the fact that Wanda is clearly forcing him and everyone in town to play these sitcom roles. And as Vision saw with Norm (Asif Ali), it is causing everyone harm. Like Vis, we’re inclined to believe Wanda doesn’t mean to be hurting anyone, but kidnapping thousands of people to live out the shallow lives of TV characters is pretty twisted. In fact, it’s a plan worthy of Marvel Comics characters like Arcade or Mojo.Not that we’re suggesting either is behind this – at least, not seriously at this point. The story is more compelling if it really is all Wanda’s doing. Doubly so if it turns out much of the Westview Anomaly is unintended consequences she will eventually have to answer for.Then again, for those hoping for a certain devilish detail to emerge, it is interesting to note her powers do not work on the twins. Also interesting: the look on Agnes’s face when Wanda tells the boys she cannot raise the dead. Despite S.W.O.R.D. behaving as though the citizens of Westview are alive, we still think it’s possible Wanda is reanimating a whole lot of deceased New Jersey residents.“No, More Mutants!” and The Knock At the Door That Could Change the MCU Forever(Photo by Chuck Zlotnick. ©Marvel Studios 2021. All Rights Reserved.)But the absolute most shocking moment this week was the return of Pietro Maximoff, played by X-Men: Days of Future Past‘s Evan Peters. As Dr. Lewis noted, Wanda has recast her brother.The joke is about as meta as you can get. Pietro, as a character, appeared in both X-Men: Days of Future Past and Age of Ultron under a special arrangement between Marvel Studios and 20th Century Fox. At the time, the two studios were completely separate entities and the film rights to Pietro were cloudy. Although Pietro and Wanda are better affiliated with the Avengers, they first appeared in X-Men comics as villains. As it happens, the studios agreed to share the character as long as Fox made no mention of the Avengers and Marvel made no mention Pietro’s (and Wanda’s) Mutant father.In Age of Ultron, he was played by Aaron Taylor-Johnson and expressly not a Mutant. As Hayward reminded us in this week’s episode, both Pietro and Wanda’s powers are a result of Hydra’s experiments with the Mind Stone. Also, the Taylor-Johnson version of Pietro died at the end of the film (a point we keep bringing up as we believe Wanda never grieved for him). Peters, meanwhile, would continue to appear as the character in two subsequent X-Men films.(Photo by ©Marvel Studios 2021. All Rights Reserved.)And then, in a terrifying display of power, Disney bought 20th Century Fox and handed control of the X-Men film property to Marvel Studios.Speculation on a new film and a new Wolverine occurred even before the merger was official, but there was also the possibility the arrival of Mutants into the MCU would be more subtle. By bringing Peters into WandaVision — something that had been rumored for some time – Marvel has seemingly introduced its first Mutant.For fans of comic-book Wanda, this is a big deal as she banished most of mutantkind in a 2005 miniseries called House of M. The effect of her decision was so widespread, X-Men comics are still restoring powers to the mutants she altered even today. As it happens, her reality warp went into effect when she uttered “No more Mutants” – a directive Marvel Entertainment’s chairman and CEO emeritus Ike Perlmutter would follow up on in subsequent years. As Marvel Studios began to make a foothold at the box office, he became increasingly annoyed with the small royalty the company received from Fox’s X-Men films. An attempt was made to bury the characters, although, he was more successful taking The Fantastic Four – a film property also controlled by Fox – out of the Marvel Comics limelight for a time.So, it is only fitting that we, as many fans have done already, take comic book Wanda’s infamous statement and apply the Lionel Hutz red pen to it by saying, “No, more Mutants!”Of course, it remains to be seen if this is how it will play out. Peters’ character may just be another New Jersey resident press-ganged into playing the part of Pietro Maximoff. It is also possible he really is the Pietro of the X-Men film reality. If so, he is incontrovertibly a Mutant and that changes the fabric of the MCU in a fundamental way.Then there’s the topic of his father, but that’s a discussion for another day.In the meantime, it would seem WandaVision will deliver us a pretty full house at 2800 next week – although, the presence of Pietro may force the series off course from the 1990s and its TGIF programing block. In its place will no doubt be something to make us still look forward to Friday.New episodes of&nbsp;WandaVision&nbsp;premiere on Fridays on&nbsp;Disney+.On an Apple device?

Though based on the Marvel Comics family of characters, the show definitely has more in common with The Exorcist than, say, Marvel’s Runaways. And as we learned while touring the large asylum set — including a padded cell set aside for Victoria Helstrom — and speaking to the cast, there is something different about the show, a difference which may be inspired by the comics themselves. Elizabeth Marvel, who plays Victoria, even went as far as to call the Helstrom stories an “artisanal Marvel comic.”So join us for an exploration of Helstrom and the five things you need to know before diving into the series.1. Helstrom&nbsp;Is Based on Marvel’s Son of Satan(Photo by Marvel Comics)Click image to view full cover in another browser window.In the early 1970s, Marvel began to toy with horror comics — a genre it actively opposed 15 years earlier — with The Tomb of Dracula and Ghost Rider. Sensing the phenomenon could be repeated, Stan Lee suggested a title called “The Mark of Satan,” but editor Roy Thomas talked him down. He believed even the hip Marvel audience of the time would balk at a story in which the hero was the Prince of Darkness. Lee then suggested something else, a story centering on the son of Satan, leaving Thomas and artist Gary Friedrich to dream up the rest during an initial run in Marvel Spotlight.Born Daimon Hellstrom (or Helstrom depending on the decade) to mother Victoria and, well, the Devil, Daimon learned upon her death the true nature of his family. Armed with the ability to command hellfire, a pentagram etched into his chest, and a pitchfork, the character aimed to give Satan a lot of trouble. Complicating matters, though, was his more outwardly demonic sister, Satana and the increasing number of horrors subsequent creative teams added to the Marvel canon.And to take one look at the son of Satan, you might wonder why he would be a good anchor for a television show. As executive producer Paul Zbyszewski told Rotten Tomatoes in a Zoom call some months after our visit, the emotional story of the Helstrom family is ripe for TV, and it is there from Daimon’s first story.“It was one specific panel in Marvel Spotlight #13 … where Daimon is reading his mother’s journal, and he’s in his full-on cape and bare chest with the pentagram and everything,” he recalled. “And he’s crying because he’s reading the story of his mother and how the mother met the father and sort of who the father really is … and that’s a lot of emotion. That’s a lot of baggage.”Zbyszewski, growing up in the Catholic tradition while reading the early Helstrom appearances, became enamored with the baggage.“This was a very emotional story about a couple of kids who had the worst dad ever,” he said. Plus, the thrill of reading about the son of Satan offered his comic book diet a sense of the taboo and danger. “You go, ‘Ooh, that’s dark.’ And then when you pick it up and you’re a little bit older, you’re like, ‘Oh, OK. I kind of see this [emotional tale].’”The sense of cool and the family underpinnings made Helstrom a must-make concept.2. Helstrom Is An Unlikely Family Drama(Photo by Katie Yu/Hulu)Though the series begins with Daimon (Tom Austen) and Ana (Satana renamed for television) having spent years apart and estranged, the show leans into the notion of family very quickly thanks to the unique dynamic between Ana (Sydney Lemmon) and Chris Yen (Alain Uy).“[My] chosen family is Chris Yen,”&nbsp;Lemmon said during our time in Vancouver. “We met in the foster care system and just fused and became best friends. [He] became almost more of a brother to me than Daimon and then down the road, business partners.”Chris and Ana are introduced with a peek at their lavish life, including San Francisco apartments and a thriving antiquities dealership. To Uy, that clean, ordered world is the best place for Chris. The character is “a very in-control type of person and likes things in a specific way. Some ways that is the yin into Ana’s yang,” Uy explained.That yang includes a handful of supernatural abilities Chris may or may not be aware of — “I think he’s got some knowledge,” Uy teased.“The night you meet her, she is hosting a huge auction and you encounter a powerful business lady,” Lemmon said. “Then everything goes sideways, and she gets pulled away from everything and has to deal with her past, which is something that she’s been running from.”(Photo by Katie Yu/Hulu)Which leads us back to Daimon.“[We’re] ripped apart at a young age,” Lemmon explained. “So we’ve led completely separate lives and have totally different bags of trauma, and when we come together, it’s really, really hard to find the common ground.”Perhaps the siblings can find common ground with their mother, Victoria, who is still alive in this version of the story, but not entirely herself. Marvel — whose name did not get her the job, by the way&nbsp;— tackles a difficult mix of mental illness and not being alone in her head.She called the work “actor’s candy,” adding “this landscape of the Marvel universe, and the powers and the things that they’re wrestling with, they’re so huge. But as theater artists, we do the Greek [plays], and we do Shakespeare, and we are used to taking these massive cosmic issues and domesticating them. And that’s something that I think we get to do very interestingly in this Marvel Universe.”From what we’ve seen of the show, these cosmic issues will lead Daimon and Ana back to the pain caused by their home life with Victoria and their father.3. The Show Can Deviate From the Comics(Photo by Bettina Strauss/Hulu)Like Victoria’s continuing presence in the mental ward of a Portland area hospital, Helstrom takes certain liberties with the comics. Ana, for instance, is quite different from her curvaceous and horn-headed comic book counterpart – Lemmon recalled thinking “Oh! OK, um, so we’re going to be using wigs, prosthetic body parts apparently” when she first saw art of Satana – and a couple of the characters more tied to Ghost Rider comics add a generational aspect to the show.In the series, both Caretaker (Robert Wisdom) and Dr. Louise Hastings (June Carryl) have been involved with the Helstrom kids for a long time. Dr. Hastings essentially raised Daimon while Caretaker looked after Ana from afar. Their roles here are quite a departure from Marvel lore — Hastings is a fairly obscure name from an early ’90s comic book series — but Zbyszewski viewed them as different ways Marvel characters can be used in a television adaptation. Caretaker, who is part of a secret society holding the line against evil in the comics, featured “a natural element in the original storytelling” the producer knew could fit into his plan for Helstrom.For his part, Wisdom views the character as a cross between “Nick Fury and Indiana Jones” and thinks Marvel fans familiar with the character will be surprised by how much he cares for Ana.“They’re going to be taken with the relationship,” he said. “She’s like a bolt of lightning, and I’m trying to wrestle with [that].”Wisdom&nbsp;referred to it as a “dance” which may, in the end, lead to a surprising change in Caretaker himself, but&nbsp;also teased, “Who knows what Caretaker’s real motivation is?”(Photo by Katie Yu/Hulu)Dr. Hastings “fit in a little bit differently” according to Zbyszewski.“Sometimes the backstories in the comics are not deep enough or rich enough to mine to give your characters arcs,” he explained.As a result, Dr. Hastings benefited from a major expansion, although elaborating might constitute a spoiler. We can say she is the head of the hospital’s psychology department and one of the few people Daimon trusts.“There’s a practicality to Louise that I think gets a workout,” Carryl said back in February. “When something kind of goes off the rails and into another realm, there’s a ‘Huh. OK. I’m going to have to put that in the hopper, and it’s going to pop for a [moment], and we’ll deal with it later.”As a result, the character lends the show an added sense of reality. When we asked Carryl about that aspect of Dr. Hastings more recently, she said the supernatural is “not old hat yet” to the character despite raising a child who can summon hellfire.4. Daimon Helstrom Knows His Abilities(Photo by Katie Yu/Hulu)In one of the more obvious departures from other Marvel television shows, Daimon and is quite accustomed to his powers.“He has the ability to control energy from what we call the ‘shadow side,’” Austen explained. “So he has the ability to manipulate the energy that is on the other side that we don’t see and bring it into this world.”It makes him both a telekinetic and, naturally, able to ignite a blaze whenever he needs it. He can also “remove energies that have taken over people from the shadow side” and send them back. It plays into an interesting aspect of the series teased during the show’s New York Comic Con panel: Daimon’s adversaries are merely thwarted by what we’ll call an exorcism. They can return with new powers and tricks.Austen and the rest of the crew in Vancouver played very coy about the character’s signature branding, cloak, and pitchfork, of course. The pentagram, or something like it, appears in a handful of the show’s teasers, and Austen jokingly said the cloak is “a wax green barber jacket that has very limited billowing.” While perhaps less theatrical than his comic book counterpart, Austen felt this version of Daimon would pare things down to “a decent pair of boots, a coat, and some comfy jeans” as a more contained sense of fashion suits the major aspects of his life.(Photo by Bettina Strauss/Hulu)During the day, Daimon spends his days as a college professor. But the night sees him acting as an exorcist in concert with the Church. Joining him in that effort as the series begins is Gabriella Rosetti (Ariana Guerra), a new take on Marvel’s Gabriel the Devil Hunter, who appears here as a novice nun fresh from the Regina Apostolorum. She is quite well-read in regards to the horrors Daimon faces, but is less ready for the man himself.“I don’t think anyone can prepare you for Daimon Helstrom. There’s no textbook for that,” Guerra said, adding that&nbsp;their earlier interactions are “very tense.”“I feel like he is not trusting of me, and I’m skeptical because of what I’ve been told about him,” she said.Nonetheless, their rapport builds and plays into one of the program’s greatest strengths.5. Snark Is&nbsp;a Superpower(Photo by Katie Yu/Hulu)From everything we heard and saw in Vancouver, it was safe to assume Helstrom might be one of the darker shows debuting this month. But, as Zbyszewski put it, “it wouldn’t be Marvel” without some snark. Despite the evil and the deep personal wounds the Helstroms and their surrogate families will face, they counter it with cutting remarks and some satisfyingly snappy banter.“You need humor,” Zbyszewski explained. “Humor makes it more real because we are humorous in our daily lives. We have the ability to look at something and go, ‘Well, that’s f—ed up’ … we all have that component in our personalities. And so, we did try to give all our characters a little bit of levity at times.”He was quick to credit his writing staff as the source of the series funniest barbs: “I stole from them whenever I could … because snark is not the strongest tool in my toolbox.”Lemmon added, “The snark is alive in our show, and I am to blame for a lot of that.”Uy and the others agreed having a balance between the horror and the snark is “integral” to a series like Helstrom.“I’m British, so I just brought mine with me,” Austen said, adding that the banter plays into the major theme of the series. “[Daimon and Ana] have been through some dark, messed up stuff, but they are ultimately brother and sister. They fought as kids, they fight as adults,” he said.Helstrom is now streaming on Hulu.Like this?

But considering what we now know about Westview, can we safely say this is all Wanda’s doing?Let’s try to decode the puzzle of television history to see what becoming a family sitcom means to WandaVision.Spoiler Alert: This feature reveals details from WandaVision episode 3 “Now In Color.” Stop here if you have not watched the episode.&nbsp;From Bewitched to The Brady Bunch: WandaVision Advances Its&nbsp;Family-Sitcom Aesthetic(Photo by ©Marvel Studios 2021. All Rights Reserved.)As we mentioned last week, the television series Bewitched began its life in black-and-white. It also started its run by focusing on newlyweds Samantha and Darren. Season 1 stories included Samantha meeting Darren’s parents&nbsp;— it was a whirlwind courtship — and Darren trying to keep Samantha from revealing her witchy powers to his boss or the neighbors. The parallels to last week’s WandaVision are obvious.Continuing the parallel, to an extent anyway, is the switch to color and Wanda’s pregnancy&nbsp;— both a child and color filming would come to Bewitched by its third year. But it’s clear from&nbsp;episode 3’s Partridge Family–inspired credit sequence and The Brady Bunch–style set alterations that WandaVision is moving away from the Bewitched format into the late 1960s or early 1970s and the large-family sitcoms of that era.The Brady Bunch, launching in September 1969, told stories about a blended family of six children — three girls from wife Carol’s previous marriage and three boys fathered by widower Mike Brady — coping with their new living arrangement. Though it would last only&nbsp;five&nbsp;seasons, endless re-runs through the ’80s and ’90s (and four attempts to continue the series in new forms) made it iconic and a clear go-to as Wanda anticipates her soon-to-be family.Although, it could be argued&nbsp;The Brady Bunch‘s most iconic element is its late ’60s decor, given a loving tribute on WandaVision via the multi-colored frosted glass feature above the entrance in this week’s episode. The sudden appearance of brickwork throughout the house, the step down from the foyer to the living space, and certain elements in the kitchen — note the island and oven — also evoke the look of the classic sitcom.(Photo by ©Marvel Studios 2021. All Rights Reserved.)But as with the stylistic callbacks to ’50s sitcoms in the first episode, episode 3’s commitment to the Brady aesthetic extends outside the home. Both the backyard and front areas are realized with sets (and an obvious painted flat for Herb’s home), fake grass, and a few other visual cues which both honor the Bradys’ on-set backyard and call attention to the artificiality of the situation.In the previous episodes, the front of the house was shot on location (or a studio backlot) with natural sunlight. Here, Vision’s talk with Herb (David Payton) and, later, with Agnes (Kathryn Hahn) extend the set-bound feel of the Maximoff-Vision home, which we’ll refer to from here on out by its address number of 2800. For careful watchers, the change of production technique should offer a sense of foreboding well before Vision notices Herb cutting through the cement wall with a edge trimmer.But to come back to The Brady Bunch for a moment, the set-bound feel was not absolute. Production often went outside to shoot exterior scenes at the kids’ schools (an administration building on the Paramount lot in Los Angeles), neighborhood streets, and family vacations. Which means WandaVision’s choice to be so set-bound this week means something.It’s just too bad Vision loses his train of thought before he could sense that meaning.Geraldine’s&nbsp;Otherness&nbsp;Begins to Unnerve Wanda(Photo by Suzanne Tenner. ©Marvel Studios 2021. All Rights Reserved.)And while Vision is contained on the sound stage “exteriors,” Wanda is left to deal with early contractions and the unexpected arrival of Geraldine (Teyonah Parris). By the sound of the story she tells Wanda about her day at work, it&nbsp;seems like she’s the star of her own sitcom. As it happens, the first sitcom to feature an African-American woman in a career role (as opposed to a maid) was Julia, which ran more or less concurrently with the early seasons of The Brady Bunch. It starred Diahann Caroll as a widowed single mother working for a doctor at an aerospace company. And though the story Geraldine tells Wanda about getting a job at an ad agency takes us in a different direction, single mothers and aerospace lead us toward Geraldine’s true identity.We also point out the feeling of her star power and the possible connections to Julia because the emerging sense that she doesn’t belong in Westview has a connotation we don’t think WandaVision intends, but is nonetheless present and an aspect of TV history. For the purposes of this episode, Geraldine is a black woman in 1968 breaking into the advertising world, and both Agnes and Herb find her “strange.” Agnes’s suggestion to Vision that Geraldine is wrong for the town would give offense if not for other non-white faces like Herb and Norm (Asif Ali).This week’s commercial, with its mixed family and direct reference to Hydra, could be making a point about the values Strucker wanted Wanda and her brother to believe in. Could Hydra have purposely fed her a diet of classic sitcoms to instill their notion of a “proper” society?(Photo by Chuck Zlotnick. ©Marvel Studios 2021. All Rights Reserved.)In the series text, though, Geraldine’s otherness comes to light as she tries to get Wanda to talk more about her brother Pietro (Aaron Taylor-Johnson). It seems, for the moment anyway, that she’s forgotten about his death. Or, at least, the circumstances of his demise in Avengers: Age of Ultron. But Geraldine’s knowledge of events and her attempts to coax it out reveal one important detail to Wanda: Geraldine’s really not from around here.Of course, as we’ve all known for quite some time thanks to Marvel’s publicity machine, Geraldine is really Monica Rambeau, the grown-up daughter of Captain Marvel’s Maria Rambeau (Lashana Lynch), a fighter pilot and single mother. Also, thanks to Wanda’s rejection of her presence in Westview, we also know the town is a physical location somewhere on Earth surrounded by an energy field&nbsp;that resembles the Red-Green-Blue of a cathode-ray tube television. It is also surrounded by some sort of government agency. We’re going to assume it is S.W.O.R.D.Wanda and Vision’s On-Screen Twins Parallel a Comics Plotline(Photo by ©Marvel Studios 2021. All Rights Reserved.)The Westview revelation might be the biggest reveal on any other show, but for WandaVision, it is merely a counterpoint to the arrival of Billy and Tommy, Wanda’s miraculous twins.Back in the comics, the existence of the twins was a point of debate for many years. Originally presented as Wanda and Vision’s children — via magical means — it later turned out to be a grand deception involving various demons and mystical entities. The twins were gone for a time, but currently exist as flesh-and-blood beings and members of the Young Avengers.It seems clear WandaVision wants to play with this tension because, even at this point, Wanda may be the real power behind everything. This week’s evidence comes in the way she forcibly removes Monica from town and&nbsp;her edit to Vision’s line of thinking when he starts to note all the oddities in Westview. If she is causing all of this, then the point was to create a family with children. Two children were ultimately required because Wanda was herself a twin, and we’re willing to bet she never dealt with the loss of Pietro; in fact, it is possible Wanda entered into her relationship with Vision to avoid her grief.All of that is assuming, of course, that Wanda is causing all of this. There is another suspect, though: Agnes. At this point, all we really have is her status as the nosy neighbor and the way she voiced her suspicions about Geraldine. It is also possible to interpret her interest in Wanda’s life and the way she called her “the star of the show” in episode 2 as indications that she is aware of more than she lets on. Then, of course, there are the internet rumors suggesting she is really Agatha Harkness, the ancient sorceress who tutored Wanda in magic and revealed to her the true nature of Billy and Tommy in the comics.We’re not entirely convinced of that yet. For one thing, Harkness is typically an ally of the Avengers and the Fantastic Four.&nbsp;Since we’re still leaning toward Wanda being behind all of this, we’re inclined to believe Agnes is just another resident of Westview who has been press-ganged into being part of the TV fantasy. Since Westview is a real place, it seems likely all the people we’ve met up until now are real as well and straining against these sitcom roles and characterizations.Maybe this is why Mrs. Hart (Debra Jo Rupp) pointedly asked Wanda to “stop it” in episode 1.The Kitchen Review(Photo by ©Marvel Studios 2021. All Rights Reserved.)As we noted last week, the evolution of 2800 came with remarkable recreations of the kitchen sets from The Dick Van Dyke Show and Bewitched. But with the arrival of the late-’60s and early-’70s aesthetic, the kitchen set has stopped changing as drastically between episodes. The kitchen’s place in the overall layout of the home and the partition separating it from the dining area remain from the earlier episodes. Instead of replicating the Brady’s iconic kitchen color scheme exactly, it merely evokes the aesthetic with Vision’s comic book colors. Also, those looking closely will see the center island and the double oven are overt quotes of the Brady house.We think the changes to the kitchen are meaningful. In terms of TV history, mother characters were relegated to the kitchen on shows like Lassie and Dennis the Menace. It is also the place both Darren Stevens on Bewitched and Ricky Ricardo on I Love Lucy would’ve preferred their wives to stay while they went to work. Even on The Brady Bunch, the kitchen was the place Carol was expected to be despite live-in housekeeper Alice.(Photo by ©Marvel Studios 2021. All Rights Reserved.)Going into next week, it will be interesting to see how the kitchen evolves again. From trailers, we know it will eventually mimic the Family Ties kitchen, but will a late-’70s sitcom inspire the decor before the ’80s arrive in Westview, or are we already headed to Reagan Era just four episodes in?New episodes of&nbsp;WandaVision&nbsp;premiere on Fridays on&nbsp;Disney+.On an Apple device?

At one point, it seemed as though Watchmen was designed to be a one-season event, with executive producer&nbsp;Damon Lindelof saying&nbsp;the season represents “everything” he has in mind for the&nbsp;Watchmen&nbsp;world. HBO has since walked back his comments, though, as it likes to have dependable programs come back year after year.The season ended on a similar ambiguity: Did Dr. Manhattan (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II) have the time to transfer his abilities into that last remaining egg? His conversation with Adrian Veidt (Jeremy Irons) and the use of&nbsp; that “I Am the Eggman” cover would suggest this is the case. But as Watchmen leaves us wondering if Angela Abar (Regina King) stuck the landing, any thought of a second season story is predicated on the answer to that question, which leads to two major options.Assuming a season 2 happens, of course, but more on that later.Angela Sticks the Landing(Photo by Mark Hill/HBO)Presuming Angela receives the Manhattan powers, she faces the unenviable position of not just living every moment of her life simultaneously, but answering up to her grandfather Will’s (Louis Gossett Jr.) belief that Jon Osterman (Dr. Manhattan’s civilian name) could have done more with his powers.Indeed, that is a central topic in the Watchmen comic book series by Alan Moore, Dave Gibbons, and John Higgins. Jon’s increasing distance from human issues makes it difficult for him to care — particularly after the Vietnam invasion — or willing to do much of anything to help until his perception of humanity changes. True, his apparent omniscience indicates to him that interfering in history is impossible, but it leaves a lot of innocent people brutalized or killed during his lifetime.For Angela, this could easily become the central moral conflict of the season. She is predisposed to Will’s morality and would jump at the chance to put the racial hatreds that have dominated her life to an end, which includes the tension back in Vietnam. But is a such a thing even possible, and would her sudden omniscience hold her back?Beyond those questions is the acting challenge for King. Angela has been such a passionate and sympathetic protagonist — ready with the barb or well-timed expletive — that turning her into a “Dr. Saigon” would be a major departure. Granted, it wouldn’t happen all at once, but the slipping away of her humanity would be an awesome thing for King to play. It terms of story, it would be a major shift as the protagonist is, essentially, a god. The writing challenge there would be incredible.Provided, of course, Angela sticks that landing.Angela Plunges into the Pool(Photo by Mark Hill/HBO)So let’s say Watchmen returns with Angela falling into the water and Jon getting one last laugh in at her expense. She is still faced with rebuilding her life in the wake of his death and the revelation that her mentor was a Klansman. Presumably, the Tulsa Police will also be reorganized into a more traditional — and maskless — organization. Will she be able to go back to that? Or will events force Sister Night become a vigilante?Alternatively, there is always the possibility Laurie Blake (Jean Smart) will offer her a place in the FBI’s anti-vigilante taskforce. Despite their differences, the two characters have a few key things in common — including their relationships with Jon. They also had a natural rapport in the first season that could serve them well. Add Agent Dale Petey (Dustin Ingram) and Wade (Tim Blake Nelson) into the mix, and we could see a second season of Watchmen ripping apart the idea of costumed identities utterly, starting, perhaps, with the mysterious Lube Man (whom many fans believe to be Petey). But Angela’s new position could be threatened when Topher (Dylan Schombing), inspired by Angela’s time as Sister Night, decides he wants to put on a mask.Of course, that premise lacks the astonishing ambition of the first season. While Watchmen’s dalliance with the Klan ended in something very swift (and very cathartic), spending so much screen time on historic racism in the United States (via the Watchmen lens) set it apart as a Big Idea show. It makes continuing stories with these characters feel smaller somehow. Unless of course, one turns around and uses Will’s belief that Jon should’ve done better to ask a large question: can those with greater economic and political power genuinely do better? In the context of the show, the characters could face that question in a variety of ways.And, as it happens, there is plenty of economic disparity in U.S. history for the capes and technology of Watchmen to examine.The Real Trial of Adrian Veidt(Photo by Mark Hill/HBO)Whether or not Angela breaks the pool’s surface tension — or even whether or not the show continues — &nbsp;it is clear Adrian will finally be brought to justice as the architect of the 1985 squid attack on Manhattan. And unlike his phony trial on Europa, he cannot fart his way out of this one. Well, maybe he can. He is the smartest person on Earth again.Nonetheless, a trial could allow Irons to perform his role in an essentially separate production once again. Which would no doubt keep him interested and keep us watching his fascinating, if odd, take on Ozymandias. It would also put his thinking behind the attack in the forefront – is it OK to kill 3 million people if it will save 6 billion lives?Also, the trial would, presumably, force Robert Redford out of office. His replacement could be a compelling source of background details or, perhaps, a new central storyline. Imagine what would happen to Laurie’s task force if the new president was sympathetic to vigilantes or a mask themselves. Would it allow Dan Dreiberg a reprieve from his prison sentence?And while we’re at it, Bian’s (Jolie Hoang-Rappaport) survival could lead to a Free Vietnam movement.Again, this might feel a little bit pedestrian, but now that the series has blown the roof off a 2019 in the Watchmen world, its 2020s must follow up on some these ideas.Watchmen 2020?(Photo by Boris Martin/HBO)Of course, we’re presuming the series can quickly remount with traditional network speed. As a matter of history, HBO famously let The Sopranos take 18 months off and gave the last season of Game of Thrones the time it needed to complete effects work on extra-long episodes. Besides the postponed release of The Hunt, Lindelof has no publicly announced projects on his docket in the near future. This would suggest a plan to continue with Watchmen even if he needs a year or two to put it together. Then again, he once said he would not be interested in continuing to make Watchmen, favoring to hand it off to someone else to dream it all up again.“Watchmen is not mine,”&nbsp;Lindelof told Collider in October. “Someone else can take the reins in the way that, for comic book fans, of which I consider myself one first and foremost, the idea that Alan Moore himself came to Swamp Thing in the early 1980s and he basically completely and totally reinvented that character, but that character was not his creation.”He added he would consider returning should the right idea appear, but as of that interview, claimed no such idea was in the frame.&nbsp;That said, he subsequently told LADbible that he and his writing staff planned to “take a breath over the holidays” and “seeing where to go from there.”King and Irons have no long-term commitments in the upcoming year, while Smart is currently shooting a television pilot. Gossett has a number of projects in various stages of development and Nelson has a handful of films. Their combined relative availability suggests they are, at the very least, in holding contracts should HBO quickly decide to order another season. Granted, that is a standard contractual obligation on a show like this and the entire cast could be released from their contracts by Wednesday.And much like the original Watchmen’s limited run, there is something to be said for the television show to come to its conclusion here, with Angela on the precipice. As with the comic book’s final moment, it leaves viewers with a question they can debate until the next format prepares itself for Watchmen. Maybe its next iteration will put you behind Angela’s eyes and face the questions of godhood in a VR simulator. Imagine the slightest movement taking you to random parts of her existence.So even if this iteration of Watchmen is seemingly at an end, it is wise to keep Dr. Manhattan’s words in mind: “Nothing ever ends.”","section":"Comics on TV","tags":"President, universe, Signature, 20th, Hallmark, Mudbound, Red, police","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/15224031/watchmen-s1ep9-teaser-screencap-Yahya-Abdul-Mateen-II-600x314.jpg","slug":"what-could-be-in-store-for-watchmen-season-2-if-there-is-one"},{"id":"47508693520282","title":"6 Things We Learned About HBO’s Watchmen Series From Damon Lindelof’s Letter","content":"Comics On TVvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})6 Things We Learned About HBO's Watchmen Series From Damon Lindelof's LetterIs The Leftovers creator himself a hero for taking on a TV adaptation of Alan Moore's graphic novel or guilty of heresy?by Erik Amaya | May 23, 2018 |  Comments(Photo by Warner Bros./courtesy Everett Collection)For fans of Watchmen, a “proper” screen adaptation of the landmark 12-issue maxiseries by writer Alan Moore, artist Dave Gibbons, and colorist John Higgins is both a fond wish and a great heresy. Like so many of the great books, people want it dramatized, which is the natural order of storytelling itself. And yet that progression is something Moore considers incorrect. In his eyes, Watchmen is specifically composed for the medium of comics. Making it into a play, film, television show, or action figure breaks the magic around it — to say nothing of cheapening his artistic intent. His thoughts on the matter only intensified as his dealings with Hollywood took a sour turn, and Warner Bros. Pictures moved forward with the 2009 Zack Snyder&nbsp;feature film adaptation of his best-known work.And it is happening again.The Leftovers‘ Damon Lindelof is supervising an HBO television pilot based on Watchmen&nbsp;— the format and outlet that people less inclined to hear Moore’s wishes always thought was the natural venue for the adaptation. Regina King, Don Johnson, Tim Blake Nelson, Louis Gossett Jr., Adelaide Clemens, and Andrew Howard are set to star.And as always happens when Watchmen development news breaks, the cries go up from fans about all of the issues: Moore’s shabby treatment at the hands of DC Comics, the inability of a film medium to encompass the scope and literary merit of the original work, and even the complaint that Moore himself is in no position to claim absolute ownership, as the Watchmen characters are based on old Charlton Comics characters DC purchased in 1983.Ironically, Lindelof counts himself among those fans confused, devastated, and yet hopeful about Watchmen on TV. He said as much in a five-page missive on his Instagram account. The letter, addressed to Watchmen fans of all stripes, offers some intriguing clues to the nature of the show and, perhaps more importantly, his deeply held feelings on committing the great heresy itself.Read on to learn about a few of the things Lindelof revealed and some important context surrounding the new information.1. He Turned It Down Twice(Photo by Alberto E. Rodriguez/Getty Images for Disney)In the early part of the letter, which appropriates Dr. Manhattan’s trip though his own memories in issue #4, Lindelof makes it clear he turned down opportunities to adapt the comic book for television twice before. Once in 2010, less than a year after the feature film was released, and again in 2011 or 2012. In both instances, his respect for the original work outweighed any interest he might otherwise have. Three years later, a third overture “cracked the door,” as he put it before adding, “now I’m a hypocrite too.”His extended metaphor of conversion to Orthodox Judaism&nbsp;— in which a person hoping to convert must ask three times&nbsp;— does not reveal how this third attempt made him see the project in a different light, though. Perhaps he finally realized it is better to be the fan in charge of the heresy than watching it happen anyway. That is the rationalization anyone who involves themselves with further Watchmen projects must ultimately make if they hope to reconcile their love of Alan Moore’s work and their own creative interests in Watchmen.2. Alan Moore Has Been Forgotten(Photo by Kevin Nixon/SFX Magazine via Getty Images)In the midst of describing the second Watchmen development offer, Lindelof recalls explaining Moore’s vision and concerns to an unnamed television executive. The response: “Who’s Alan Moore?”The devastating truth in Watchmen’s behind-the-scenes drama is Moore’s deletion from the story as the cantankerous Northampton, England, native’s relationship with the masterwork is poisoned by its success. Originally envisioned as a swan-song for Charlton Comics characters like the Question and Judomaster, the eventual series featured new characters like Rorschach and Ozymandias, who certainly bare similarities to their Charlton counterparts. Consequently, Moore and Gibbons’ contract gave them control of the new creations once the series went out of print, a thing which always happened to comics at the time. Watchmen’s outstanding quality and popularity meant DC was in a position to publish collected editions of the series in perpetuity. A point which left Moore angrier as the years rolled on.Not helping matters were film adaptations of his other works, like From Hell and V for Vendetta, which took great liberties with their sources or DC Comics’ attempt to get him to validate a Watchmen action-figure line in 2000 and a 15th Anniversary hardcover release of the series just as then-publisher Paul Levitz was pulping an issue of Moore’s League of Extraordinary Gentlemen because it contained a vintage 1890s ad for a douche syringe manufactured by the “Marvel Company.”After being deposed for a lawsuit regarding the League of Extraordinary Gentlemen film – in which he was accused of being a hired gun for 20th Century Fox by creating the comic book – and V for Vendetta producer Joel Silver claiming he was “excited” about the film during a meeting he maintained never took place, Moore refused credit and royalties on any future adaptations of his work. He assigned his portion of the money to his collaborators and when Watchmen debuted, the source work credit read “Based on the graphic novel co-created and illustrated by Dave Gibbons and published by DC Comics.” When another disputed Moore work, Marvelman, was set to be reprinted by Marvel in 2013, Moore declined to participate. His writing credit on the series was changed to “The Original Author” – a nom de plume which also seems fitting for his relationship to Watchmen.And, again, confirming every fan’s greatest fear, Lindelof’s letter reveals at least one TV executive has no idea who The Original Author really is or why his thoughts on a television adaptation should matter.3. It Will Not Adapt Watchmen Directly(Photo by Warner Bros./courtesy Everett Collection)In outlining his creative intentions, Lindelof makes it clear the series will not adapt the story told in the Watchmen maxiseries. Calling the original comic books “sacred ground” and comparing it to the Old Testament, he said the material will not be “retread, nor recreated nor reproduced nor rebooted.”Nonetheless, the comic books are considered canon and those events will be “just the way” they were depicted in the 12 issues of Watchmen. This, at the very least, means fans will not have to worry about how the Tales of the Black Freighter comic strip will be realized in the series. It also means no choice will be made regarding Ozymandias’s squid monster. It happened.But Lindelof writes enigmatically that the series will not be a sequel either. “This story will be set in the world its creators painstakingly built,” he explains. “But in the tradition of the work that inspired it, this new story must be original.” Like Moore’s remixing of the Charlton characters, it appears Lindelof is setting out to do the same with Watchmen. But he also writes that the show must “ask new questions and explore the world through a fresh lens.” It will also be a contemporary take with the president, British Prime Minister Theresa May, and Russian leader Vladimir Putin taking the place of Ronald Regan and 1980s British PM Margaret Thatcher in its critique of power.He also promises “new faces” and “new masks” while a “surprising, yet familiar set of eyes” takes a look back the 20th-century heroes. This, he writes, comprises the project’s “greatest risks.” The obvious identity behind those familiar eyes would be Dr. Manhattan (played by Billy Crudup, pictured, in the film), but bringing him back lacks the risk that Lindelof characterizes with the possibility that his body might “shatter upon impact” once his full plan is revealed to the world.If nothing else, it is a great teaser for those compelled to look at the project while intending to look away in respect of Moore.4. Lindelof’s Father Cared About Watchmen(Photo by Warner Bros./courtesy Everett Collection)On a more personal note, Lindelof described how his father gave him the first two issues of Watchmen while a boy and their personal journey with the series over the course of their lives. He recalled being 15 years old and watching his father “haggle with a man in a wheelchair” at a New York comic book convention for a supposed screenplay of a Watchmen feature adaptation. He also recalled his father’s dismay as he read the script, which featured “‘The Watchmen’ battle terrorists at The Statue of Liberty.”Despite its title, there is no group called “The Watchmen” within the story. Among the many possible heresies in adapting Watchmen, calling the group of heroes by the book title is high on the list.A further memory detailed Lindelof’s father buying him a new deluxe edition of Watchmen despite his knowledge of the continuing clash between Moore and DC. Lindelof called him out as a hypocrite, to which his father replied, “But it’s so goddamned good.”He also recalled with vivid detail the last moments of his father’s life, indicating just how personal this all is. And while he accuses himself of using his father’s death as a cheap appeal to the fans, it also reveals how deeply he feels about Watchmen.&nbsp;It is not just another superhero comic book to him; it is a life-changer. That sentiment definitely rings familiar to readers of the series.5. The Production Staff Is Inclusive(Photo by Warner Bros./courtesy Everett Collection)While trying to avoid the term “disruption,” Lindelof claims he wants to see what happens when Watchmen becomes the purview of a diverse set of writers and production staff. “In [the writers’] room,” he explains, “Hetero White Men like myself are in the minority.”“Understanding its potential through the perspectives of women, people of color, and the LGBTQ community has been eye-opening and exhilarating,” he continues. That sense of diversity will exist “in front of and behind the camera” as production on the pilot nears.As a writer, Moore is sensitive to issues facing women and minority groups, but a fair criticism of his work is its treatment of women; particularly in Watchmen, in which Laurie&nbsp;Juspeczyk (played by Malin Akerman, pictured, in the film) can be viewed as a prize to be won with little-to-no agency for herself.But in considering Lindelof’s comments about the leaders of the First-World powers elsewhere in the letter, it makes sense that the viewpoints of those outside comic’s traditional straight-white-male readership would come into consideration just as Moore’s work in the 1980s confronted the abuses and corruptions inherent in Thatcher’s government. And while certain debates will be sparked by Lindelof’s choice here, the iconography and themes of Watchmen are well suited to discuss the issues.6. Lindelof Used His First Nash Bridges Paycheck To Buy A Replica Joe Namath Jersey(Photo by Warner Bros./courtesy Everett Collection)In admitting it is the right of the fan to decry developments in the things they love, Lindelof makes a tacit admission that he once shouted at the top of his lungs “You suck!” at the New York Jets while wearing a replica of legendary Jets quarterback Joe Namath’s jersey. The price of the jersey, so he claims, was his “entire first paycheck” from the Don Johnson CBS drama Nash Bridges. The outlay of cash, the passion and his critique of the Jets’ performance will be familiar to fans of any sports team, TV show, film, or comic book.That passionate devotion is also at the core of fan’s concerns about another Watchmen adaptation. Why do this again? Why sully further what spin-off comics, the feature film, and various action-figure lines have already marred? At the same time, many fans still want an adaptation of the quality and distinction the original 12-issue maxiseries now carries. Some want it in spite of Moore’s objections and their own concerns about creators’ rights while others are burned out, preferring to ignore the project entirely.Based on the letter, Lindelof appears to understand those feelings because he is a fan – and if he’s not, the letter is the most amazing work of fakery ever written. The concerns, emotions, and conflicts just about any Watchmen fan may have about the potential series are all right there in the letter.And, as he mentions, this is still just a pilot. HBO may view the completed episode and pass. Development on Watchmen may end for a good long while after that. Or, it could be a rousing creative success. But if nothing else, Lindelof’s letter proves somebody who cares about Watchmen is in charge. That he can write passionately about the conflict in adapting the comic book is just a bonus.Day 140.A post shared by Damon (@damonlindelof) on May 22, 2018 at 11:00am PDT","section":"Comics on TV","tags":"streaming, Hallmark, The, Alien, See, Sci-Fi","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/23135417/watchmen-rorschach-graphic-novel-damon-lindelof-inset-600x314.jpg","slug":"things-we-learned-about-hbo-watchmen-series-from-damon-lindelof-letter"},{"id":"47508693517209","title":"Summer’s Supercharged Superhero TV: What’s Worth Watching","content":"Comics On TVvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Summer's Supercharged Superhero TV: What's Worth WatchingFrom Marvel's Luke Cage and Cloak &amp; Dagger to the return of Preacher, it's a big season for super characters on the small screen.by Erik Amaya | June 4, 2018 |  CommentsAs the superheroes, embattled agents, corrupt cops, and troubled teens of the networks’ comic book–inspired television shows take their summer hiatuses, cable outlets and streaming services will offer a number of diverse programs based on both classic and cult comic book series over the next few months.The summer is a place where comics on TV prove to be stranger, wilder, and in a class outside the traditional superheroes – think reluctant teens with mutant-like powers or a man holding literal demons at bay. Join us as we take a look at the new and returning comic-inspired television shows coming to a cable outlet or streaming platform near you.Marvel's Cloak &amp; Dagger: Season 1 (2018)  89% (Freeform)Premieres: June 7Based On: The Marvel Comics duo created by Bill Mantlo and Ed Hannigan.Premise: Tyrone (Aubrey Joseph) and Tandy (Olivia Holt) are two teenagers in New Orleans facing a terrible dilemma. When they were younger, both survived the destruction of a Roxxon Corp off-shore lab during a hurricane. Now, the effects of that night are manifesting in the form of superpowers&nbsp;that become stronger when they are together. Tandy can emit light daggers, while Tyrone can engulf others in darkness. Described as “two people who found the person who understands them” by executive producer Joe Pokaski, Tandy and Tyrone set out to understand their powers, find out why they work better in tandem, and whether or not they will be more than friends with complementary abilities.Chances It Will Be&nbsp;a Hit: Early reviews suggest the series will bring something fresh to both the Marvel landscape and Freeform’s young audience. The series currently has a 100% score on the Tomatometer and people are excited to see it. The peril, as with all Marvel TV shows, is the pace. Will the two prove to have winning chemistry before the audience grows impatient?Big Hero 6: Season 1 (2018)  (DisneyXD)(Photo by ©Disney XD )Premieres: June 9Based On: The Marvel Comics superhero team created by Steven T. Seagle and Duncan Rouleau.Premise: Continuing from the 2014 animated film Big Hero 6, Hiro Hamada (voiced by a returning Ryan Potter) attempts to balance his course load at the San Fransokyo Institute of Technology with his continuing adventures as a superhero. Luckily, he still has Baymax (Scott Adsit, also returning) by his side. As with many Disney television series based on their features, some details of the film’s ending have been smoothed over to make the premise work in episodic form, but the key charm of the film, Baymax, remains in tact.Chances It Will Be&nbsp;a Hit: The original film scored an 89% on the Tomatometer, and Baymax was the most beloved Disney robot until BB-8 made his debut the next year. But with its 2-D style, the series looks different from its feature film counterpart. Luckily, returning voices like Potter and Adsit provide some continuity for families returning to the concept four years later. Disney already commissioned a second season, so they seem pretty confident in its continued success.Marvel's Luke Cage: Season 2 (2018)  85% (Netflix)Returns: June 22Based On: The Luke Cage character created by Roy Thomas, Archie Goodwin, and John Romita Sr. for Marvel Comics.Premise: The bulletproof Luke Cage (Mike Colter) has embraced his newfound fame as the Defender of the Harlem, but taking on the Hand – and dealing with threats like Cottonmouth and Diamondback – means he is as much a target as he is a superhero. Luke’s life is quickly upended as a man known around Harlem as Bushmaster (Mustafa Shakir) beats him up in rather public way. He also faces the continued machinations of Mariah Dillard (Alfre Woodard) and the arrival of “downtown mob figure” Rosalie Carbone (Annabella Sciorra). Meanwhile, Luke’s associate on the NYPD, Misty Knight (Simone Missick), debuts her new robotic arm after losing a limb in Marvel’s Defenders.Chances It Will Be&nbsp;a Hit: Luke Cage’s first season was a critical darling (94% on the Tomatometer) and the most confident of the Marvel series on Netflix. Of course, it also lost some of its appeal when Mahershala Ali made an early exit. And, as the second seasons of Daredevil and Jessica Jones proved, a strong opening may not indicate continued critical success – both series saw a decline in their Tomatometer scores with their second seasons.Preacher: Season 3 (2018)  92% (AMC)Returns: June 24Based On: The Vertigo comic book series created by Garth Ennis and Steve Dillon.Premise: Former Annville reverend Jesse Custer (Dominic Cooper) experienced a close encounter with a being&nbsp;that is part demon and part angel and sent the Lord fleeing from Heaven. When Jesse learns that God abdicated his throne, he vows to find the Almighty and give him a piece of his mind. In the third season, Jesse’s search for God takes him to Angelville, the town in which he grew up, for a fateful meeting with is Gran’ma Marie L’Angell (Betty Buckley). Meanwhile, Allfather D’Aronique of the Grail (Jonny Coyne) and Herr Starr (Pip Torrens) butt heads over the best way to deal with Jesse and how to install the Grail’s preferred leader onto the world stage.Chances It Will Be a Hit: Getting out of the first season location of Annville helped the series favorably with a&nbsp;1-percent uptick on the Tomatometer to a score of 90% for season 2. But the second season still had pacing issues with everyone stuck in New Orleans for far too long. Nonetheless, the series is about to depict some of the comic book’s funniest moments and most outré concepts. Depending on how faithfully Preacher adapts the Angelville and Allfather story lines, viewers may be surprised by shocking scenes – even for Preacher – and a further increase in quality.Wynonna Earp: Season 3 (2018)  100% (Syfy)Returns: July 20Based On: The Wynonna Earp character and comic book created by Beau Smith.Premise: Wynonna (Melanie Scrofano) is the heir to a curse laid upon Wyatt Earp and his family by the demon Bulshar. She must kill Revenants composed of the 77 men Wyatt killed in his lifetime before they kill her. It might seem simple, but none of Wyatt’s descendants have been able to end the Revenant curse. Making matters worse, Bulshar has risen from his century of slumber and hopes to end the Earp line entirely. Meanwhile, the Revenants hope his return will allow them to escape from the Ghost River Triangle and spread their backwoods brand of demonic evil across the world. As for Wynonna, she’s still reeling from sending her daughter with Doc Holiday (Tim Rozon) into hiding. Maybe her mother (Megan Follows) can help her process all of this and finish Bulshar for keeps.Chances It Will Be&nbsp;a Hit: The show had a 78% Tomatometer for its first year, and leapt to 100% in its second, indicating a substantial increase in quality after Syfy and the fans gave it tons of support. Those fans, by the way, are very dedicated to securing the show’s fourth season. Of course, getting a fourth year on Syfy is something of a challenge – perhaps one even more difficult than vanquishing Bulshar. But if anyone can do it, it’s Wynonna.Outcast: Season 2 (2018)  (Cinemax)Returns: July 20Based On: The Image Comics title by Robert Kirkman and Paul AzacetaPremise: Kyle Barnes (Patrick Fugit) lives with the harrowing memory of being possessed by a demon as a child. It ruined his marriage, frayed his relationship with his daughter, and left him living a pretty rough life at his mother’s dilapidated home. But local reverend John Anderson (Philip Glenister) notices Kyle’s experience makes him the perfect assistant as the demon returns to Rome, West Virginia. Together, they face the evil even as the citizens come under its sway. The second season finds Kyle learning the possessions are far more widespread than he or Anderson ever imagined. Anderson, meanwhile, attempts to cope with his guilt.Chances It Will Be&nbsp;a Hit: The first season, which aired two years ago, topped out at 79% on the Tomatometer. The second season was quickly commissioned, but held back in the U.S. while it aired in international markets over the course of 2017. It is still unclear why Cinemax delayed its return, but it would seem its days are numbered no matter how well it performs over the course of the summer.","section":"Comics on TV","tags":"shows, Book, Awards, TV, Britbox, television, Comics, nightmare, thriller, green, Food","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/04144922/Luke-cgae-2.jpg","slug":"summers-supercharged-superhero-tv-whats-worth-watching"},{"id":"47508764038660","title":"Critics Consensus: Project Almanac is Fun but Uneven","content":"Critics Consensusvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Critics Consensus: Project Almanac is Fun but UnevenPlus, Black or White is well-meaning but contrived, and The Americans is Certified Fresh.by Tim Ryan | January 29, 2015 |  CommentsThis week at the movies, we’ve got time-traveling teens (Project Almanac, starring Jonny Weston and Sofia Black D’Elia), squabbling families (Black or White, starring Kevin Costner and Octavia Spencer), and philandering friends (The Loft, starring James Marsden and Karl Urban). What do the critics have to say?Project Almanac 37%Project Almanac is unlikely to replace Back to the Future or Bill and Ted’s Excellent Adventure in the popular imagination. Still, critics say this time-travel thriller is stylish and smart, even if it eventually runs out of steam and the found-footage gimmick doesn’t quite work. David (Jonny Weston) is a high school science wiz who builds a time machine based on a model developed by his late father. But when he and his friends journey into the past, they end up messing up the present in unforeseen ways. The pundits say Project Almanac is reasonably fun, but the film never quite lives up to its intriguing premise. (Watch our video interview with the stars.)Black or White 38%Heartfelt intentions and great actors do not a successful film make. Case in point: Black or White, which critics say saddles its stellar cast with a contrived story that only touches on the weightiness to which it aspires. Kevin Costner plays Elliot, a hard drinking attorney who finds himself caring for his orphaned granddaughter after his wife dies. But Rowena (Octavia Spencer), her paternal grandmother, thinks he’s not up to the task, and soon she and Elliot are involved in an emotional custody battle. The pundits say Black or White is a noble attempt to address issues of race and family, but the contrived plot undercuts both the film’s lofty aims and its nuanced performances. (Check out this week’s Total Recall, in which we count down Costner’s best-reviewed movies.)The Loft 14%It’s been nearly four years since The Loft was filmed, and now it hits theaters without being screened for critics. Neither of those facts are encouraging. It’s the story of five married guys who rent an apartment for extracurricular activities. When they discover a dead woman in the loft, each of them is a suspect. Guess the Tomatometer!What’s Hot On TV:Critics say that tamily-driven drama and psychological themes propel The Americans (Certified Fresh at 100 percent) which will dispence thrills of a different ilk this season.The critics say the action and sex in Sons of Liberty (58 percent) is certainly titillating, but not enough to compensate for the show’s bland, historically inaccurate story.Also opening this week in limited release:Hard to be a God, an epic Russian sci-fi film about a scientist sent to planet whose inhabitants have regressed into the dark ages, is at 100 percent.Timbuktu, a drama about everyday life in the famed Malian city after its takeover by religious fundamentalists, is at 97 percent.Girlhood, a drama about a teenager with a troubled home life who finds solace with a group of street kids, is at 82 percent.Above and Beyond, a documentary about a group of American pilots who fought in the Israeli War of Independence, is at 80 percent.Amira &amp; Sam, a romantic dramedy about the relationship between an American soldier and an Iraqi woman, is at 75 percent.

When Rotten Tomatoes spoke with him earlier this week, he even mentioned the metatextual content has “been my obsession for a long time now.”“Probably, too much,” he added. “They probably just go, ‘Oh, please, stop with the meta.’”And yet the humor — which extends from the situations superhero The Tick (Peter Serafinowicz in his current manifestation) and Arthur (Griffin Newman in the new series) find themselves in to commentary on celebrity autobiographies, superhero television shows and comic book clichés — helps keep the concept alive and allows it to keep evolving across three separate programs. First, there was the Fox Kids animated series, which aired from 1994 to 1996&nbsp;and popularized The Tick’s battle cry of “Spoon!”; then there was Fox’s live action series from 2001; and now the new Amazon Prime series which debuted last August, but returns Friday to wrap up its first season on the streaming platform.For Edlund, the new show is a sort of “synthesis” of his favorite parts of the previous versions.“The cartoon had such a great omnivorous diet for visuals and for scope,” he explained. “And the [earlier] live action had a kind of graduation of language and certain ideas, but it just couldn’t go to the places that a superhero narrative wanted to go.”And while the new show mixes those extremes and injects heart into the story, he said there is “part of the cartoon thing that just sort of still lives inside this.”With that in mind, Edlund discussed a couple of his favorite moments from the various Tick series. Though by no means complete overview of the various Tick incarnations, it may offer newer viewers insight into The Tick’s brand of humor as the new series completes what Edlund called “the first book” of current Tick iteration.1. Chairface Chippendale Carves “Cha” Into the MoonIn the animated series’s second episode “The Tick vs. Chairface Chippendale,” The Tick faces a mobster with a chair for a head known, appropriately enough, as Chairface Chippendale (Tony Jay). Gathering The City’s super-villain community together to celebrate his birthday, Chairface also decides the world deserves a lasting memory of his greatness: his name emblazoned upon the Moon in giant letters. The Tick (Townsend Coleman), Arthur (Rob Paulsen), and American Maid (Kay Lenz) stop him before he could complete his interplanetary autograph. Nonetheless, Chairface’s scheme is partially successful, though, as “Cha” remained etched upon the moon for the rest of the animated series.In hindsight, Edlund questioned if Chairface really thought out all the angles.“I don’t know, he expected it to rotate or something. He was writing pretty big,” Edlund said. “I would’ve used two lines [on the Moon].”2. Danger Boat Mixes His Own Theme SongWith a handful of clever retorts and few concerned words, Danger Boat (voiced by Alan Tudyk) quickly became a fan favorite when the Amazon series debuted. A reproduction of the heroic vehicle even appeared at New York Comic Con last fall. But part of the character’s instant appeal was the theme song he was putting together as Overkill (Scott Speiser) climbed aboard him for the first time. Within seconds, the character had a following.“The voice [in the song] is one of our editors who just put that on the scratch track to begin with, and that was the voice we went with,” Edlund said of theme, which went through a surprising number of iterations for the simple and somewhat incomplete tune. “Danger Boat as a composer of garage bands,” is how Edlund put it.Danger Boat will continue to be presence in the second half of the first season and possibly beyond. While musing on the character, Edlund offered an enigmatic “stay tuned.”3. The Tick Becomes BroccoliEdlund’s favorite moment from the animated series concerns The Tick’s existential crisis at becoming a literal vegetable. In “The Tick vs. El Seed,” The City’s superhero community manages to foil El Seed’s initial attack on the park. But in the battle, El Seed sprays The Tick with an elixir&nbsp;that is meant to accelerate plant growth. While the heroes – including the Carpeted Man and Die Fledermaus (Cam Clarke) — wait for treatment in the ER, The Tick keeps sprouting various veggies on his head, shoulders, and underarms, including broccoli.“So, he’s growing into broccoli, and then he’s saying, you know, ‘I hate broccoli, but in a certain sense, I am broccoli.’” Edlund recalled. “And for whatever reason, I enjoyed that.”Part of the line’s power, of course, comes from the intonations of Coleman and his incarnation of The Tick.Coleman continues to be a presence in The Tick meta-verse, giving his voice to the Amazon series character Midnight, the canine member of the Flag Five who survived The Terror’s (Jackie Earle Haley) attack and became a noted author.“He’s beautiful, he’s great, and I really love what he’s doing with that,” Edlund said of the performance.Midnight has more to do beyond the talk show circuit in the second half of the season, of which the creator teased, “He’s a better author than he is a person, and that’s saying a lot about a dog.”4. The Tick Realizes the Finality of DeathIt is one of the most prominent clips you’ll find from the first live-action series out on the Internet and one of the most memorable moments in that iteration of The Tick overall. In “The Funeral,” The Tick (Patrick Warburton) is overjoyed to meet The Immortal, an author and overall swell guy. But upon arriving in town, The Immortal dies, leaving The Tick and Arthur (David Burke) to deal with the arrangements and the body.In the scene, The Tick has a hard time processing the notion of death and Arthur hits him with the cold truth: It happens to everyone and it can happen at any moment, just like it did to The Immortal.&nbsp;Until that moment, Tick thought death only happens to “dead people.”“Patrick was amazing,” said Edlund of the first live-action series’s star. “The cast of the first live action [had] gorgeous sorts of expressions. They were great.”Like Coleman, Warbuton also remains in the fold as a producer on the Amazon series, though it remains to be seen if the three Ticks will ever share a scene together.5. The Tick and Arthur HugThough the absurdity of The Tick looms large in his mind, one of Edlund’s favorite moments in the Amazon series comes from the second episode when The Tick and Arthur embrace.“It sort of lives as a good expression of that recurring element of their abiding affection in each one of these [iterations,]” he explained. “This is a recurring dream. I have a recurring dream about a blue man that menaces an accountant.”Though, in this version, the two are more openly concerned about one another’s emotional and physical well-being. A notion which gets its first retention during the hug with “that sort of swinging like 360 around the hug, the shot, and the music.”“Yeah, I really enjoy that because that’s not really something that’s happening in a lot of the other superhero shows,” he said. “I believe that Jessica Jones (Krysten Ritter) and Luke Cage (Mike Colter) hugged, but then I think it went further than that, and then it was just different.”As Edlund noted, the previous versions tended to joke around with the material, with the earlier live-action series going for a Police Academy&nbsp;tone more often than not, blunting the emotional stakes.“We were making a joke of everything, and that’s one way of going,” Edlund said. “But you don’t get to have real relationship stuff, which we do have [in the current series] and which we have to protect.“So there’s a certain life and death element that needs to be let into the universe. Blood has to be shed,” he continued. “All these things, in one world, were antithetical to a [previous] expression of The Tick. So we’re pulling The Tick through a portal into this world where those things happen, and he has to adjust to that, and that’s part of the arc over time.”The results so far have been great as the current Tick mixes its absurdist past with a deeper emotional core, which will no doubt lead to a new list of memorable Tick moments in the seasons to come.The Tick season 1 returns to Amazon Prime on Friday, February 23.","section":"Comics on TV","tags":"movie, aliens, Awards, strong, Opinion, movies, live, Teen, DC, comedy, and","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/22143839/amazon-prime-pilot-the-tick-Tick_101_600x314.jpg","slug":"the-tick-creator-ben-edlund-5-favorite-moments-across-all-3-series"},{"id":"47508694862757","title":"5 Reasons Jessica Jones Is the Superhero Everyone Needs Right Now","content":"Comics On TVvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})5 Reasons Jessica Jones Is the Superhero Everyone Needs Right NowKrysten Ritter's superhero is a flawed, hard-drinking, plain-speaking abuse survivor – and yet she persists.by Erik Amaya | March 7, 2018 |  CommentsMarvel’s Jessica Jones is about to return for its second season on Thursday, and a lot has changed since its first season and Jessica’s (Krysten Ritter) struggle against Kilgrave (David Tennant). It seems&nbsp;following the success of&nbsp;inspiring film&nbsp;Wonder Woman and with the #MeToo and #TimesUp movements shifting the paradigms,&nbsp;people have felt empowered to identify their own personal Kilgrave and, as the saying goes, give him what for.And even though Jessica was (seemingly) successful in her objective, portraying her struggle to process living after that victory sets her apart from so many other fictional heroes. With that in mind – and in honor of International Women’s Day on March 8 – here are five reasons Jessica Jones is the superhero we need right now.1. She Lives in&nbsp;a Realer Superhuman WorldSure, the Marvel Cinematic Universe is a place of aliens, mystical dimensions, and the Hulk, but the Netflix corner of that world is far closer to our own&nbsp;—&nbsp;right down to dismissing Marvel’s The&nbsp;Avengers’ Battle of New York as “The Incident.” And thanks to that street-level view — which is itself a Marvel Comics specialty going back decades — Jessica’s problems are familiar. She struggles to pay bills, stay sober, and face a very specific trauma. Her neighbors know about recovery and pain, and support groups freak her out as much as any ludicrous supervillain; in fact, talking in group may be even more of a challenge.But the show (and showrunner Melissa Rosenberg) smartly rewrote the more outlandish parts of Jessica’s comic-book origins and ongoing struggles into a brutal interior conflict.&nbsp;The series also explicitly called out Kilgrave’s abuse as rape. And while the show still gives him a superpower, the direct mental abuse serves as a parallel for something people around the world deal with every day. The directness of the parallel stands alongside the pulpy plot progression of a comic book, giving it the necessary amount of distance to make it compelling television. While Jessica’s world looks like ours, it always has superhuman abilities to both tell a story of trauma and offer a cathartic punch to the villain’s face.2. She Is Nowhere Near PerfectOf course, Jessica&nbsp;makes unhealthy choices when dealing with grief and trauma. As the series begins, she is rarely sober, gets into fights in the hallway outside of her apartment and uses sex as a way to avoid the really uncomfortable feelings — actions which have very specific parallels to the first few issues of Brian Michael Bendis and Michael Gaydos’s Alias comic book.Other than Trish (Rachael Taylor), she tends to keep people at a blast radius thanks to her powerful wit and equally effective fists. And throughout the first season, we slowly discover most of this is to avoid dealing with the memories of Kilgrave (a story told at the latter end of the Bendis/Gaydos series). But we also learn Jessica’s reticence to engage with people goes deeper. Much of her attitude and paths to addiction were cemented well before her ill-fated attempt at superhero antics and meeting the Purple Man. Also, intimacy of all kinds give her pause, even if she made a good-faith attempt with Luke Cage (Mike Colter).Like the crumbling apartment around her, Jessica cannot face the actual process of healing. But it makes her all the more compelling as we learn more about the traumas in her life and the ways she avoided dealing with them. Which, even if she directly dealt with Kilgrave last season, means she begins the second season still denying things and wavering on the path to recovery.3. She Is Not Shy About ItIn moments of clarity —&nbsp;or, at least, now that she has survived one season of the show and that run-in with New York’s other local heroes in Marvel’s The Defenders&nbsp;— Jessica will&nbsp;admit to some version of&nbsp;her flaws herself. That awareness marks her as distinctly different from, say, a near-perfect God-killer from Themyscira or a lawyer from Hell’s Kitchen with bags full of denial. It took her nearly dying to get there, but understanding why she lashes out may save her in the end.It also means she gets to enjoy things from time to time without the specter of denial hanging over her.Having at least a partial understanding of her impulses means Jessica is in a place where that initial attempt to be a hero can grow into something stronger. For all the anxiety and distrust around her, Jessica is capable of channeling the call to heroics and present to the viewers that survival and recovery is possible. Which might seem like a small idea when compared to the Earth-shattering stakes in the Marvel film epics or even the threat of The Hand in The Defenders, but it is no less important.4. She Forges Strong Bonds (Often in Spite of Her Stated Preference)Also important is the example she sets for those who (consciously or not) isolate themselves. As mentioned earlier, Jessica’s life-long friendship with Trish is one of the best elements of the first year and one which will get a larger focus in the new season. They helped one another through various crises while growing up and continue to help each other out in large and small ways; even if Jessica has a habit of destroying Trish’s stuff. Jessica’s ability to help Trish deal with her mother is one example.But Trish is not the only person who matters to Jessica. Malcolm (Eka Darville) is the sidekick she never asked for, but he is someone she cares about; even if she tries to convince him that she is the greatest threat to his well-being. Between helping him get clean and facing what Kilgrave did to him, the two have more in common than she will admit out loud. It makes them a surprising duo. Well, at least when she will let him into the office.And like many facing a long recovery, Jessica still defaults to old patterns and tries to push these two away despite their stated commitment to her. Their continued efforts to be there for her suggests they see she has a good heart buried under so much pain.5. She Is the Female Defender (Even If She Grouses About It)Thanks to the events of The Defenders, Jessica’s New York now understands the prevalence of super-powered individuals among them. Which means she faces a whole new slew of questions about her identity as the second season of the series begins. It also means she falls back on her favorite tactics to avoid those issues. Nonetheless, Jessica’s biggest question relates right back to the time she and Trish decided she should try to be a hero like those distant Avengers up in the sky.Trauma is not exclusive to Jessica or her corner of Manhattan, but Jessica Jones is the rare program to view these issues from a woman’s perspective and bring the very nature of heroics into question. Sure, she has the powers, but the mental bandwidth required to face the pressures of being a superhero does not come as easy. To a certain extent, this makes her choice to get involved in&nbsp;The Defenders&nbsp;despite the escalating weirdness – and the fact The Hand never targeted her specifically – the most heroic of the four.Now whether or not she is willing to make a choice to defend people like that again anytime soon will be a question for the new season as a serial killer stalks the superpowered community. Also, Trish’s investigation into the origin of her powers forces her to face the interior threat she’d rather drink to forget, but it once again makes Jessica the most humane of the television comic book heroes and the hero we need right now.(Photo by Netflix)Find out what Ritter herself said about the topic in our interview with her, “Jessica Jones’ Krysten Ritter on Her ‘A–hole’ Character, #MeToo, and Missing Her Defenders Buddies.”Marvel’s Jessica Jones season 2 premieres Thursday, March 8 on Netflix.","section":"Comics on TV","tags":"Sci-Fi, elm, TV, Fire, Trivia, Avengers, boxing, Marathons, Dark, television, indie, docudrama","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/27142547/marvels-jessica-jones-krysten-ritter-600x314.jpg","slug":"jessica-jones-is-the-superhero-everyone-needs-right-now"},{"id":"47508707605529","title":"All Martin Scorsese Movies Ranked by Tomatometer","content":"(Photo by Warner Bros/courtesy Everett Collection)All&nbsp;Martin Scorsese Movies Ranked by TomatometerPick any decade since the 1970s American New Wave, reach in to grab some of the best movies of those years, and chances are you’ll be pulling out some Martin Scorsese pictures. Along with Steven Spielberg, George Lucas, and Francis Ford Coppola, Scorsese was among the rabble-rousers who shook filmmaking to its core in the 1970s, when all conventional wisdom (and filming permits) were thrown out the window for a more dangerous yet personal style of cinema. When you think of that decade, what&nbsp;better captures its grit, grime, and freewheeling cynicism than Taxi Driver?He made the 1980s a wash for other directors by releasing his masterpiece as early as possible in the decade, with the transformative Raging Bull, netting star Robert De Niro his second acting Oscar. Scorsese subsequently showed off his lighter side with the media satire The King of Comedy, the Kafka-esque comedy After Hours, and, um, The Last Temptation of Christ. A real knee-slapper!With the 1990s, Scorsese did it again, releasing beloved mob epic Goodfellas in the first year of that decade. While 1995’s Casino works as a companion piece to Goodfellas, Scorsese films also began to have a more specific otherworldly aura, like in the romantic The Age of Innocence and the religious Tibetan biopic Kundun; he then&nbsp;returned to a more hazy, hard-edged spirituality with Bringing Out the Dead, starring Nicolas Cage.Scorsese’s post-Casino material was not warmly received by audiences, and by the 2000s he was on the lookout for a new actor-collaborator in the same vein&nbsp;as De Niro for a comeback. Scorsese found his man in Leonardo DiCaprio, himself looking to shed his Titanic heartthrob image. Gangs of New York and The Aviator proved Scorsese/DiCaprio was serious business, leading the way for the 2000s masterpiece The Departed, which won Best Picture and, at last, got Scorsese the Best Director Oscar.The playful Shutter Island, secret movie history lesson Hugo, and the long-gestating Silence were all befitting his reputation and style, but it might be Scorsese’s latest that will be his defining 2010s statement. 2019’s The Irishman arrived into theaters, all three-plus hours of it, on a massive wave of hype for its promise of bringing De Niro, Pacino, and Joe Pesci together on-screen. Judging by the critical response and Netflix positioning the movie as its grand Thanksgiving offering, Irishman did not disappoint.Scorsese’s next movie is reportedly Killers of the Flower Moon, which will star DiCaprio and De Niro, and explore the 1920s murder of Osage Native Americans over their oil-rich land.

(See him randomly in Krull, The Mission,&nbsp;The Dead Pool, and more, for example.) But after holding his own opposite Patrick Swayze in 1989’s Next of Kin, Neeson was at last upgraded to star for Sam Raimi’s dark superhero movie Darkman…where he spends most of the movie disfigured and fully covered in bandages. Still, Darkman was a financial success, especially for an original superhero IP in this era, and Neeson carried on with lending his baritone gravitas in dramas like the Certified Fresh Husbands and Wives.In 1994, Neeson nabbed his only Oscar acting nomination with the monumental Schindler’s List, which would go on to win Best Picture for producer Steven Spielberg, who of course also got Best Director. Neeson took on another significant title historical role a few years later with Michael Collins, before entering the pop cultural fray as the decidedly unhistorical (though we suppose it depends on who you ask) Qui-Gon Jinn in Star Wars: Episode 1 – The Phantom Menace. And after that, just into the 21st century, Neeson appeared in Gangs of New York, Kingdom of Heaven, and Batman Begins. A resume that includes working with Raimi, Spielberg, Allen, Lucas, Scorsese, Scott, and Nolan? Sounds like that’d be a career peak for most…And yet 2008’s Taken was still to come, which would transform Neeson into the go-to mid-budget action guy, create a cottage industry of similar flicks to follow in its wake. Some were pretty good (Cold Pursuit, A Walk Among The Tombstones), others came out decent (The Commuter, Non-Stop), a few were god-awful (Taken 2, Taken 3), and some were one was amazing (The Grey).We also recently saw&nbsp;Neeson’s softer side&nbsp;resurface with Ordinary Love, his first romantic film since 2003’s Love Actually&nbsp;and one of the best-reviewed films of his career, proving he remains as versatile as ever. To celebrate his birthday, we take a look back on all Liam Neeson movies ranked by Tomatometer!#72The Nut Job (2014) 12%#72Adjusted Score: 15.264% Critics Consensus: Hampered by an unlikable central character and source material stretched too thin to cover its brief running time, The Nut Job will provoke an allergic reaction in all but the least demanding moviegoers.Synopsis: In animated 3D, THE NUT JOB is an action-packed comedy in fictional Oakton that follows the travails of Surly (voiced...

First, she starred in David Fincher’s efficient potboiler Panic Room, then went into space with with Jumanji cinematic universe-adjacent Zathura (directed by pre-Iron Man Jon Faverau), and helped guide a wayward traveler in Into the Wild.Of course, that all seems like pre-history in the wake of&nbsp;Twilight, the romantic fantasy phenomenon that would make unlikely tabloid stars out of Stewart and Robert Pattinson for years to come. Five Twilight movies released annually for a half-decade, and whatever the benefits of becoming household names through them, there was also the very real threat of a post-career forever in the shadow of the vampire.Stewart responded, much like Pattinson, by going indie, as she racked up impressive performances in the likes of Still Alice, Personal Shopper, Clouds of Sils Maria, and Certain Women, working with big arthouse names like Olivier Assayas and Kelly Reichardt. She also completed her unofficial “Co-Starring Jesse Eisenberg” trilogy that started with Adventureland, following through with American Ultra and Cafe Society.Even Stewart’s approach towards mainstream filmmaking come packaged with feminist or revisionist touches, like Charlie’s Angels or Snow White and the Huntsman. She took a dive in Underwater, and ended 2020 on a Happiest Season.

Tuned-in audiences up to that point knew him primarily from the two-season ABC sitcom Bosom Buddies, and just&nbsp;as Hanks’ obvious talent couldn’t be contained to television, it was likewise apparent he wouldn’t always be stuck doing “just” comedies.1992’s A League of Their Own established Hanks as an ally for women and sports, and set up a grand slam in 1993. Sleepless in Seattle fashioned Hanks and Meg Ryan as a rom-com dream team, while Philadelphia represented his first foray into drama, leading straight into a Best Actor Oscar win. More importantly, it gave a harrowing, human face to the AIDS epidemic that American society at large had struggled – or refused – to fully comprehend at that point; during his Oscar acceptance speech, he referenced mentors and peers who were gay and who had influenced his life.The following year, Hanks picked up a consecutive Best Actor Oscar for boomer nostalgia blockbuster Forrest Gump, which would also take Best Picture. With his career in official sky’s-the-limit mode, Hanks went exactly there, blasting off into space for Apollo 13 in 1995. That same year, he voiced Woody in the groundbreaking Toy Story, a role he has returned to over the decades and into the present.Saving Private Ryan in 1998 marked the first time Hanks would work with Steven Spielberg, a fruitful creative partnership that has produced an abundance of critically acclaimed films, including Catch Me If You Can, Bridge of Spies, and The Post. Also, The Terminal.In recent years, much of Hanks’ acclaim and accolades has been directed at his biopics. Think Captain Phillips, Saving Mr. Banks, Sully, and A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood. His latest film were Greyhound, a WWII naval thriller that he co-wrote, and News of the World.

After winning Best Actor for Silence of the Lambs in 1992, and getting nominated every two years after that for The Remains of the Day, Nixon, and then Amistad, the knighted actor would have to wait two decades before The Two Popes would put him officially back in the running for Oscar gold.\nOf course, the awards are just one aspect of a legendary career that is now spanning into its seventh decade, one that started with a major role in 1968’s The Lion in Winter, starring Peter O’Toole and Katharine Hepburn. A Bridge Too Far, Magic, and The Elephant Man would be among Hopkins’ highlights in the years that followed, opening into an epic run in the ’90s, beginning with immortalizing Dr. Hannibal Lecter in Silence of the Lambs. Besides his Oscar-nominated hits, other films of the decade include Howards End, Legend of the Fall, The Mask of Zorro, and Meet Joe Black, guaranteeing Hopkins was inescapable no matter what movies you were into.\nHopkins returned to the Dr. Lecter for Hannibal and Red Dragon. And his most memorable roles in recent years play into his effortless gravitas, like a famed director in Hitchcock, Methuselah in Noah, Odin in the Thor trilogy, and one-half of The Two Popes, for which he was nominated for his latest acting Oscar. For 2021: He’s get Elyse lined up, and The Father, which is already drawing some of the strongest reviews of his career. Also, Hannibal and Silence of the Lambs are celebraring anniversaries this year.

The Rock and a trio of giant animals may have ultimately rallied to take the top spot with a projected $34.5 million, but Rampage only barely outmuscled the word-of-mouth&nbsp;monster that is&nbsp;John Krasinski’s A Quiet Place. Tomorrow, the latter movie will become the fifth film of 2018 to pass $100 million. It looks like it is going to outgross Steven Spielberg’s latest film domestically by next week and go on to become one of the most profitable films of the year.King of the Crop: Loud Word of Mouth&nbsp;Gives A Quiet Place One of Year’s Best Holds(Photo by © Paramount)By all accounts, it should have been an easy victory for Rampage this weekend. Instead, Krasinski’s film had one of the best holds of the year for a film in over 3,000 theaters, falling just 35.1% from its opening week. Only family films Paddington 2 (-27.2%), Peter Rabbit (-30%), and Sherlock Gnomes (-34%) fared better. A Quiet Place’s hold puts it in the category of films like The Martian ($54.2 million opening followed by a -31.9% drop) and Inception ($62.7 million, -32%), both of which had greater than 4x multiples. A Quiet Place has also held well on the Tomatometer, only dropping to 95% from 97% last week as more reviews&nbsp;came&nbsp;in. Given those box office numbers, and the fact that the film is pacing ahead of last year’s Get Out (which had a 15.4% drop after a $33 million start and finished with $176 million), there is a very real chance that A Quiet Place could stretch itself to $200 million domestic. Anything over $20.8 million next weekend (or under a 36.2% drop), and it will remain on that pace. Though the current estimates are more in the $185-$195 million range, it is still an incredible success for Krasinski and Paramount.Rotten(ish) Returns:&nbsp;Rampage&nbsp;Lands on the Lower End of The Rock’s Box Office Scale(Photo by © Warner Bros.)Dwayne Johnson’s first foray into the video game grid, the critically-maligned&nbsp;Doom&nbsp;(19% on the Tomatometer), came up with just $15.4 million on opening weekend, then suffered one of the worst drops and multiples ever with 72.7% and 1.82. Critics were kinder to&nbsp;Rampage, which split them down the middle and has a current Tomatometer score of 50%. That’s somewhere between the 76% that&nbsp;Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle&nbsp;received on its way to over $950 million worldwide, and the 18% that&nbsp;Baywatch&nbsp;scored in 2017. Actually, it matches the 50% that the last Dwayne Johnson/Brad Peyton collaboration,&nbsp;San Andreas, received —&nbsp;but that film opened to $54.5 million when it bowed in May 2015.&nbsp;Rampage’s $34.5 million is less than&nbsp;Central Intelligence’s June 2016 opening of $35.5 million (70% on the Tomatometer) and not much more than July 2014’s&nbsp;Hercules&nbsp;($29.8 million, 59% on the Tomatometer).Looking at films opening in non-Summer/Holiday months with critical scores between 44% and 52% that opened to between $25-$35 million,&nbsp;Rampage&nbsp;joins a list that includes&nbsp;Constantine,&nbsp;The Book of Eli,&nbsp;Percy Jackson &amp; The Olympians,&nbsp;John Carter,&nbsp;Jack the Giant Slayer,&nbsp;Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials, and this year’s&nbsp;Pacific Rim Uprising. (Tomorrowland&nbsp;also had similar numbers in May 2015.) The bad news from that list is that not a single one of them managed a 3x multiple over their opening weekend. The average multiplier of 2.53 between them means we’ll put&nbsp;Rampage’s first domestic estimate at $87-$91 million. There are some signs of hope, though:&nbsp;Infinity War&nbsp;is less than two weeks away, but very little else feels like must-see material until&nbsp;Deadpool 2&nbsp;in mid-May. If word-of-mouth does not bury it,&nbsp;Pacific Rim Uprising-style, the $120 million production can still turn a profit. It has made $114 million internationally to date.&nbsp;San Andreas&nbsp;grossed over $318 million. (More positive signs? It’s on track to be the best reviewed video game movie ever, a fact that has&nbsp;Dwayne Johnson beaming.)Fresh (Not) Surprise: Truth Or Dare Another Win for Blumhouse(Photo by © Universal)It should hardly be a surprise that a Blumhouse production can turn a profit with a healthy opening weekend. When your production cost is $3.5 million, as Truth or Dare’s was, and you can net five times that in three days, things are looking just fine. The $19 million did not match the $20-plus million mark that the last four Blumhouse horror films (Insidious: The Last Key, Happy Death Day, Get Out, Split), but that may have something to do with the quality of the film. Unlike last October’s Happy Death Day, which scored 71% on the Tomatometer, Truth or Dare’s 15% puts it in the bottom quotient of 2018 films, alongside Death Wish (17%), Midnight Sun (16%), Winchester (14%), Fifty Shades Freed, and God’s Not Dead: A Light in Darkness (both 13%). Following a similar path to Happy Death Day would put Truth or Dare’s first estimate at around $41 million total. Not bad for a $3.5 million startup investment.Also New This Week: Beirut,&nbsp;Sgt. Stubby&nbsp;Connect with Critics, But Where Are the Audiences?(Photo by © Bleecker Street Media)Bleecker Street’s Beirut, with Jon Hamm and Rosamund Pike, did well with critics (78%) but has yet to find much of an audience in its 755 theaters. It’s take of $1.65 million meant a per-theater-average of just $2,193. The best-reviewed new release of the weekend was Fun Academy’s Sgt. Stubby: An American Hero (90% so far, from 20 reviews). The animated film made just a million dollars in 1,633 theaters. Amazon Studios expanded Lynne Ramsay’s acclaimed You Were Never Really Here (87% on the Tomatometer) with Joaquin Phoenix into 51 theaters, where it grossed an estimated $324,282 for the fourth-best PTA of the weekend behind A Quiet Place, Rampage and Sony Classics’ The Rider, which boasted a $15,089 average in just three theaters and is Certified Fresh at 96%.This Time Last Year: A Better Weekend for The RockDwayne Johnson had a much better weekend when The Fate of the Furious debuted to $98.7 million. The Boss Baby had just joined the $100 million club going into the weekend and Beauty and the Beast joined the exclusive $450 million club by the end of it. Another man-vs.-giant monster film, Kong: Skull Island, was spending its sixth and final week in the top 10, with a total gross of $161.2 million (on its way to $168 million).On the Vine: Dueling Comedies Before the War Begins(Photo by © STX Entertainment)It’s Pick Your Comedy Poison next weekend. STX’s I Feel Pretty, with Amy Schumer, has the wider launch of the two major comedies opening. Snatched, her follow-up to the $110 million hit, Trainwreck, was a disappointment with just $45 million domestic. Pretty’s more high-concept&nbsp;conceit may prove a stronger draw, and the film is quietly picking up good buzz. It is up against the return of Broken Lizard to its breakthrough roots with Super Troopers 2. Fox Searchlight is hoping enough of its cult audience is ready for another meow-worthy mustache ride. Searchlight has released 41 films that have grossed over $20 million in total. The Broken Lizard crew has yet to release one.The Full Top 10: April 13-151.

But this decade alone has seen Certified Fresh hits like Moonrise Kingdom, The Jungle Book, Grand Budapest Hotel, and St. Vincent.\nThe output compares handsomely even to his ’80s heyday, which saw the likes of Ghostbusters, Stripes, Caddyshack, and Scrooged&nbsp;put into theaters. The ’90s not&nbsp;only had his lead-starring masterpiece Groundhog Day, but also the zany What About Bob?, and his first reinvention as the patron saint of comedic melancholia, Rushmore. All that paved the way for his towering 2000s output, featuring The Royal Tenenbaums, Lost in Translation, his Best Actor-nominated Broken Flowers, and Garfield…which we’re mentioning because it led directly to his inspired cameo in Zombieland.\nHis latest movie The French Dispatch, another collabo with Wes Anderson, has been pandemic-delayed from its original July 2020 release date and into the unknown.

Naturally, our thoughts turned to previous films in which characters were mind-controlled into doing someone else’s lethal bidding, and we decided to dedicate this week’s list accordingly. It’s time for Total Recall!The Manchurian Candidate (1962)  97%A pitch-black manifestation of Cold War political paranoia, John Frankenheimer’s The Manchurian Candidate tapped into the lethal turmoil of the post-WWII global landscape to frame the story of a soldier (Laurence Harvey) who’s captured during the Korean War and, along with his men (including Frank Sinatra), subjected to brainwashing by Communist agents. Back home, Harvey’s a war hero, but his programming — and the machinations of his politically ambitious mother (Angela Lansbury) — threaten to unleash dire consequences. The 2004 remake earned positive reviews, but there’s no substitute for the almost unbearably suspenseful&nbsp;original; wrote Roger Ebert, “Not a moment of The Manchurian Candidate lacks edge and tension and a cynical spin.”Watch TrailerSleeper (1973)  100%After the impressive commercial performance of 1972’s Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex* (*But Were Afraid to Ask), Woody Allen opted for a follow-up with a somewhat larger scale: Sleeper, a futuristic comedy about a health food store owner (Allen) who’s cryogenically frozen after dying during a gall bladder operation, thawed out 200 years later, and manipulated into becoming an unlikely leader in a resistance movement — while falling in love with the woman who briefly thought he was a robot (Diane Keaton) — before being brainwashed into societal compliance and then un-brainwashed back into the resistance. Billed as a “nostalgic look at the future,” Sleeper offered a humorous counterpoint to the dry sci-fi epics of the day, predicting (sadly accurately, some would argue) that technological advancement wouldn’t be able to stem the rising tide of pure human foolishness. Mused Filmcritic’s Christopher Null, “Pound for pound and minute for minute, Sleeper may just have more laughs in it than any other Woody Allen movie.”Watch TrailerThe Parallax View (1974)  89%The Cold War was a sort of golden era for paranoid cinema, and it reached its arguable apex during the years surrounding the American military’s peak involvement with — and eventual withdrawal from — Vietnam. Perhaps no director channeled this period of unrest better than Alan J. Pakula, whose “paranoia trilogy” included 1971’s Klute, 1974’s The Parallax View, and 1976’s All the President’s Men, all of which fidgeted under the creeping certainty that the public was being increasingly manipulated by the unseen and nefarious hand of The Man. With Parallax, Pakula diverged into conspiracy thriller territory, enlisting Warren Beatty to star as a journalist who digs into the murky circumstances surrounding a senator’s assassination after his ex-girlfriend — a witness to the killing — turns up dead. Set apart by an outstanding cast that also included William Daniels and Hume Cronyn, as well as a brainwashing sequence that the audience experiences first-person, it offered a particularly nasty twist to the manufactured-assassin subgenre; the end result, as Tim Brayton argued for Antagony &amp; Ecstasy, stands as “One of the great American films from arguably the finest decade in American filmmaking.”Watch TrailerThe Naked Gun: From the Files of Police Squad! (1988)  88%Political assassination plots aren’t often played for laughs, but that doesn’t mean they can’t be funny — witness 1988’s The Naked Gun: From the Files of Police Squad! in which bumbling Lt. Frank Drebin (Leslie Nielsen), seeking to avenge the brutal shooting of his partner (O.J. Simpson), finds himself unwittingly embroiled in a wealthy shipping magnate’s (Ricardo Montalban) absurd attempt to use a brainwashed Reggie Jackson to kill the Queen of England. If subsequent entries in the series found themselves strongly subject to the law of diminishing returns, perhaps that’s simply because the original hit so many of its targets with near-lethal hilarity. “The Naked Gun is destined to become a cult comedy classic,” predicted Roger Hurlburt of the South Florida Sun-Sentinel. “If the holiday run doesn`t make a bundle, the returns on the video cassette will.”Watch TrailerConspiracy Theory (1997)  57%Julia Roberts is a successful attorney, and Mel Gibson is the cab driver who loves her. In 1997, that may have sounded like the basis for a surefire rom-com hit, but Richard Donner’s Conspiracy Theory offered audiences something different — namely, a paranoid thriller about a guy who seems like a ranting eccentric (Gibson), but who might actually be unwittingly sitting on an explosive secret that connects him to the woman he’s pined for from afar (Roberts). Toss in Patrick Stewart as an unscrupulous government bureaucrat, and you’ve got yourself a fairly sleek ‘90s espionage thriller — and a movie that, while it failed to resonate resoundingly with critics, racked up more than $135 million at the box office during its theatrical run. As Joe Baltake mused for the Sacramento Bee, “There’s nothing quite like a big, handsome, movie-star-driven Hollywood film when it’s done right.”Watch TrailerZoolander (2001)  63%It’s debatable whether American audiences have ever really been in the mood for an absurd parody of the male modeling industry, but they really weren’t in the mood for one on September 28, 2001, when Ben Stiller’s Zoolander — featuring Stiller as a down-on-his-luck model brainwashed into trying to assassinate the prime minister of Malaysia by a fashion mogul, criminal mastermind, and closet keytar player played by Will Ferrell — landed with a thud at the box office. Despite its underwhelming theatrical run and utterly ridiculous premise, Zoolander managed to earn some surprisingly positive reviews, both from critics who appreciated its timing (Rolling Stone’s Peter Travers called it “an oasis of bracing comedy that comes at just the right time”) and its goofy brand of satire (Dennis Lim of the Village Voice praised it as “a freakishly potent farce”). Cult classic status awaited on the home market, where lines like “listen to your friend Billy Zane, he’s a cool dude” reached their full comic potential, and 15 years after the original stiffed, Zoolander 2 is set to continue the saga in February of 2016.Watch TrailerThe Bourne Identity (2002)  83%What happens when you subject a guy to enough mental and physical conditioning to make him a perfect killing machine, but then he ends up surviving a botched mission with near-fatal injuries that leave him with no memory of his former life — yet he conveniently retains the lethal skillset that made him such an asset in the first place? Such is the deliciously entertaining premise that drives the Bourne franchise, which stars Matt Damon as the titular ex-CIA assassin and uses a series of bestselling Robert Ludlum books as grist for a hard-hitting, breakneck-paced saga that asks pointed questions about the cost of espionage while delivering a slew of delightfully staged set pieces that should leave action fans hooting with delight regardless of where they happen to fall on the political spectrum. “While the crunchy fights and unflagging pace ensure this delivers as genre spectacle,” mused Ben Walters for Time Out, “the muddy ethics also make for a pleasing contrast with standard-issue wham-bammery.”Watch TrailerCaptain America: The Winter Soldier (2014)  90%Captain America: The First Avenger was a rip-roaring throwback to classic serials that lovingly tweaked WWII-era U.S. military propaganda while laying the groundwork for subsequent entries in the Marvel Cinematic Universe canon — and it was a pretty good wartime buddy flick in the bargain. As Captain America readers were already aware, our hero Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) had a lifelong pal named Bucky Barnes (Sebastian Stan), who (much like the good Captain) was presumed killed in the war, only to be revived years later and retrained to keep on fighting; the difference, in Bucky’s case, was that he ended up falling into the hands of the other side, who brainwashed him into becoming the ruthless assassin known as the Winter Soldier — and eventually going toe-to-toe with his former best friend. As one might guess given the title, that conflict takes center stage in the Captain America sequel, which pits opposing super-soldiers against each other while the entire post-9/11 intelligence community falls under the shadow of shifting loyalties and high-tech conspiracy theories. The end result, wrote Christopher Orr for the Atlantic, is “a movie that is, in the best sense of the word, a Marvel.”Watch TrailerFinally, here’s a clip from the classic Three Stooges short “Punch Drunks,” which introduced audiences to the fighting machine Curly turns into whenever he hears “Pop Goes the Weasel”:","section":"Total Recall","tags":"movie","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/American-Ultra.jpg","slug":"8-movies-with-brainwashed-assassins"},{"id":"47508673906402","title":"Why and Where to Watch Season One of Looking","content":"Binge Guidevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Why and Where to Watch Season One of LookingCatch up before season two returns this Sunday on HBO.by Benjamin Lindsay | January 6, 2015 |  CommentsPiggybacked on the season three premiere of Girls, Looking‘s debut was slated to be for thirtysomething San Franciscan gays what Lena Dunham’s Hannah Horvath is for fledgling female millennials: a mirror. With its promising slogan, “Find something real,” the series by-and-large succeeded in portraying the contemporary queer experience. Now the boys are back for a second go-round on Sunday, Jan. 11, giving you just enough time to plow through season one and fall for Jonathan Groff’s Patrick Murray all over again.LookingWhat’s the premise? Patrick (Groff) works for a video game developer in San Francisco, navigating the waters of love and sex with bashful earnestness and cringe-inducing naiveté.What’s it like? Looking is a queer series driven not by the provocative and promiscuous glitz of Queer as Folk, nor by the painfully bubbly zeal of The New Normal; rather, Looking finds solace in the sedate subtleties of its leading men’s day-to-day. It’s quiet and introspective, putting conversation and character above all else. Looking‘s unfettered tranquility is the sort of production that unwise viewers meet with a yawn, but we promise it’s worth it. Patrick and his best friends Dom (Murray Bartlett) and Agustín (Frankie J. Alvarez), will soon enough have you empathizing with their maddening missteps and young adult misgivings. Get to know them, and you’ll be begging they stick around longer than their eight-episode allotment.Where can I see it? The full first season is available to stream for HBO subscribers on HBO Go; it is also available on Blu-ray and DVD.How long will it take? Looking has eight 30-minute episodes, so binge season one in about four hours to be caught up for Sunday’s premiere.What do the critics think? As is the case for most series catered to a niche audience, viewers from within that group will often bemoan that this, that, or the other does not reflect their personal experience. Such was the case for a handful of critics upon Looking‘s premiere. With the exception of those apprehensive few, however, Looking was subject to a positive reception and season one is Certified Fresh at 89 percent. In his review, Tim Goodman of The Hollywood Reporter targeted the series’ naysayers specifically, saying that a show does not have to be the truth to be relatable and representative, simply a truth. “Sometimes viewers forget that a television series can be about these people, in this time, living their own stories,” Goodman wrote. “Fortunately, gay audiences have a pretty good track record of realizing that they are too diverse to be covered completely in any one show, even if it’s a show like Looking that does an excellent job of highlighting the contemporary gay experience of three friends in San Francisco.”Why should I watch this? Looking is a series for everyone. It’s easy to put it in its box, slap a big “Gay” sticker on it, and stow it away in the attic, but non-LGBT viewers would be missing out on one of television’s truest gems. You don’t have to hold it to the light to see its refracted rainbows — it certainly wears its pride colors on its sleeve — but more than a gay series, Looking is a human one that happens to be about gay men. In the first eight episodes alone, you’ll run the rounds of love and hate for Patrick, Dom, and Agustín, but that’s because they’re as flawed and frustrating as any other man in your life. It’s not escapist television, but for those who are looking for perspective in their own life and their own relationships. We won’t ruin any of the details here, but be prepared to fall head-over-heels for Richie, Patrick’s season-long love interest who’s heartbreakingly realized by actor Raúl Castillo. And as Dom’s comically candid gal pal Doris, Lauren Weedman gives Jennifer Lawrence a run for her “I-wish-you-were-my-best-friend” money. Plus the series’ frank discussions of sex, race, and class make for fascinatingly authentic moments and dilemmas without being overly preachy or sentimental.What’s my next step? To continue your binge on humanist homosexuality, your next step should be writer-director Andrew Haigh’s 2011 gay indie, Weekend. It’s no coincidence that Haigh was tapped to executive produce Looking alongside showrunner Michael Lannan. For more gay narratives along the lines of Looking, web series like Adam Goldman’s much-loved The Outs will also be right up your alley. Also, HBO scored high marks last year with their original movie, The Normal Heart, which stars Mark Ruffalo, Taylor Kitsch, Matt Bomer, and Julia Roberts and won the Emmy for outstanding TV movie in 2014.Are you ready to look into Looking?

Pictures/courtesy Everett Collection)All Christopher Nolan Movies Ranked by TomatometerChristopher Nolan had such a perfect outsider journey into Hollywood filmmaking, he makes transforming into one of the world’s foremost A-list directors look simple. First, you make your requisite black-and-white feature debut for less than a half-million dollars (Following) in England. Then you come over to America, put together an inventive, almost revolutionary indie (Memento), which gets you invited into the big studio system for Insomnia, where two seasoned pros like Robin Williams and Al Pacino can recognize an up-and-coming talent and agree to star. Then, boom: You’re good to go in your new career as a rising director.For Nolan, the next step up was a surprising move at the time: Resurrecting Bruce Wayne for Batman Begins, whose big-screen reputation had been trashed by Batman &amp; Robin. With&nbsp;The Prestige, he really began to establish himself as a brand and icon whose pictures you can rely on to feature slick-as-ice style, heavy dollops of science fiction, mind-warping concepts and resolutions, and a growing repertoire of actors to fulfill his vision. Inception and Interstellar certainly fit this mold, while The Dark Knight (and its Rises sequel, to an extent) revolutionized comic book movies and pop culture fandom. And lest we think he forgot his roots, Dunkirk was a worthy movie monument to the WWII military evacuation’s inspirational stature within British society.Nolan’s next film is Tenet, whose release has shifted with the sands of time in the ongoing pandemic.

What do the critics have to say?The Great Gatsby 48%Since its publication in 1925, F. Scott Fitzgerald’s The Great Gatsby has beckoned filmmakers like a green light at the end of a pier. Unfortunately, their efforts have tended to be the cinematic equivalent of winning Daisy Buchanan’s heart — lavish exercises in futility. Critics say Baz Luhrmann‘s opulent take on Gatsby continues the trend — it looks fantastic and features a fine lead performance from Leonardo DiCaprio, but it misses the nuanced, melancholy spirit of the novel. In case you slept through English class in high school, here’s the plot: Yale grad and World War I vet Nick Carraway (Tobey Maguire) is drawn into the orbit of Jay Gatsby (DiCaprio), a mysterious millionaire who throws extravagant parties and flaunts the trappings of affluence in an effort to win the heart of Daisy Buchanan (Carey Mulligan), who’s married to a rich jerk. The pundits say The Great Gatsby never lacks for spectacle, but what’s missing is the heart beneath the glitz. (Check out this week’s 24 Frames for a gallery of films based on classic books.)Peeples 38%If you’re going to attempt a Meet the Parents-style comedy, you have to work hard to distinguish yourself. Unfortunately, critics say Peeples is a warm, amiable farce that offers a few chuckles but mostly falls back on predictable plotting and an overwrought message. Grace (Kerry Washington) joins her well-to-do family for a reunion in the Hamptons. Her fiancé, an aspiring musician named Wade (Craig Robinson), crashes the party to announce their impending nuptials and embarrasses himself in an attempt to fit in with the family. The pundits say Robinson and Washington are appealing as always, but there’s only so much they can do with the film’s clichéd script.

She was on the fence until director Shekhar Kapur spun his magic on her.\"I just said no to ‘Elizabeth‘ because I thought I’ve done it, I don’t need to do it again,\" Blanchett said. \"But we had one great conversation, he and Geoffrey [Rush] and I when I suddenly saw it as being something about part of the aging process and taking her to a different level. He wanted to make a film about immortality. So when he talks about it in those broad sweeps, and also a film about holy war, which I thought was very timely.\"The idea of a reunion, and adding some new hunks into the mix helped the sales pitch. \"When he talked about it from that perspective and then he said Clive Owen‘s going to do it and Geoffrey’s going to do it again, I just went, ‘Oh, I’m just churlish if I say no to it.’ So I couldn’t refuse.\"Blanchett and Kapur remain close since making the first film together, so whether another \"Elizabeth\" or something else, they were bound to collaborate again. \"Shekhar and I all during the first one were talking about trying to find something else to do together.

An audacious debut, it set a classic film noir plotline within a contemporary high school setting, and helped establish Joseph Gordon-Levitt as a leading man. Now, Johnson’s back with The Brothers Bloom, a globe-trotting con man movie starring Adrien Brody, Mark Ruffalo, and Rachel Weisz that hits theaters this week. In an interview with RT, Johnson decided to select his five favorite con man movies of all time. He also talked about the script of his sci-fi project Looper, and explained why filmmakers are often con men themselves.Paper Moon (1973, 96% Tomatometer)I’m a film school nerd, so I’ve got about a hundred favorite movies. I’d feel like I was cheating on all of them if I narrowed it down to five movies. But con man movies I can do. In no particular order, I guess the first one I’d name is Paper Moon, which, for me, is just a perfect film. It’s also one of the first con man movies I saw that was less about the mechanics of plot and more about the relationships between the characters, and this father-daughter relationship, which is really beautiful. Just a pretty wonderful movie.RT: At that point in his career, Peter Bogdanovich seemed to be toying with some classical cinematic forms. Obviously, Brick tweaked the noirs of the 1940s, and now you’ve made a con man movie. Do you think that you’re operating along similar lines?I guess so, yeah. That’s the interesting thing about Paper Moon. It’s one of the things I admire about it so much, is that there is this kind of formalism to it, in terms of it mimicking the style, or… Not mimicking; mimicking is the wrong word. That sounds like I’m… Mimicking doesn’t do it justice, but … Absorbing. Using the style of previous films. However, what I admire about it so much is how emotionally authentic it still is. I’m a sucker for anything that can reach for big things stylistically and still connect on a human emotional level, and that’s what that film does so well. You know, they’re doing this crackerjack dialogue, and in some ways it’s very arch, but at the same time it feels completely real.House of Games (1987, 96% Tomatometer)Okay, how about House of Games as kind of the David Mamet representation? You need him in there if you’re gonna talk about con man movies. It’s a movie I love more and more every time I see it. I just think it’s beautifully constructed, and it also really has something on its mind in terms of this kind of dark, sticky psychology of the con and of our human fascination with the con. It’s just a terrific film, and it’s also a lot of fun. I mean, the opening card game scene. That’s got Ricky Jay in it, Joe Mantegna, you know. “I’m from the United States of kiss my a–.” [laughs] It’s one of the all-time great card table scenes in all of cinema, I think.RT: I’ve probably seen that one, at least in bits and pieces, about three times, and it seems like every time I’ve see it, I’m still sort of like, “Okay, what’s going on here?”Yeah, yeah. Yeah, exactly. No, it has a strange… And the whole movie has this very dreamlike quality to it, you know?RT: Everyone’s getting conned.Yeah, absolutely. The most mysterious thing about the film is what’s going on in [Lindsay Crouse’s] head. That’s the real mystery for it. Where’s this woman coming from? And that’s what the very last shot of the film kind of, you know… That’s why the very last shot of the film — that great close-up of her face at the end is the true payoff to the whole thing. For me, at least, that’s the true mystery of the movie.The Man Who Would Be King (1975, 100% Tomatometer)You know, I’m gonna put this one in because it is actually one of my favorite films of all time, although technically it’s probably not a con man movie. The Man Who Would Be King. I did a Festival of Fakery. I did a little mini film festival which I kind of curated at the New Beverly Cinema in Los Angeles, and this was one of the movies that I showed. It’s about these two characters who do kind of go to pull off this con of pretending to be, you know, one of them pretends to be a god so that they can rule this small territory, basically. But as I watched it, it does actually, I don’t know, to me it does kind of play like a con man movie and also has the essential buddy relationship. The two rascals, I guess, standing back to back and fooling the world, which is reflected also in another one of the films in my list. This particular dynamic is probably my favorite.RT: Are you particularly a John Huston fan as well?Oh yeah. I love John Huston. Big, big John Huston fan. Even though this movie is dearly in need of a DVD update — I think the one that I have is still double-sided, actually. I don’t know if they’ve released a proper DVD of this, but he does have this beautiful vintage behind-the-scenes piece that’s got Huston out there on set [mimics John Huston’s voice] “talking about how this is a grand adventure in the true nature of the word. A grand adventure in every way.” It’s fantastic. They really don’t make ’em like they used to when it comes to John Huston. One for the ages.The Sting (1973, 91% Tomatometer)And then, I guess, The Sting is the next one I gotta say. This was for me, and probably for a lot of people, at least of our generation, our first exposure to con men movies was from The Sting. It really holds up. Like a lot of the movies on this list, it holds up because of the central relationship, because of the Newman-Redford thing. Watching those two guys together, even though at this point, plotwise, I would be fairly… Well, I don’t know. I wonder, if someone saw The Sting clean for the first time today, now with all the movies that have imitated it in the years since, whether anyone would actually kind of say “Oh my God” at the end of it. I don’t know, but I don’t know that it would matter, because I think the fun of the film is in the game playing, and specifically in the way that these two guys play off of each other. It seems like something that’s particularly vulnerable, just because of the twist, the nature of the end. But like I said, that’s not really what makes the movie tick, oddly enough. It holds up just as a really fun ride.F for Fake (1976, 87% Tomatometer)I got four, and there’s one more. It’s a biggie. And again, this is one that’s maybe a little bit of a stretch in terms of it being a con man movie, but I actually don’t think so. It’s F for Fake. If I was numbering these, this might be number one. It’s a movie that’s really hard to define. It’s pretty commonly termed a filmic essay by Orson Welles on the subject of fakery, but it’s a lot more than that. It’s so many things. I don’t even know how to start talking about it. At its essence, it is about what we were just talking about. It’s about the charlatans and fakery and the notion of fake versus real, and the notion of the con versus legitimacy, I guess. And he just digs into that pretty deeply. And also in a way that’s so incredibly entertaining. The way that the movie’s cut, also, you would think that, today with our shorter and shorter attention spans and our notions of fast cutting, you would think that the way that Orson Welles, the style in which he cuts this film, would be easily absorbed by us. But I actually… You know, I have friends of mine who are much, much younger than me. You know, it actually took a second viewing to kind of absorb the film. I mean, it really is still pretty insane, the abstract way that Welles cut this whole thing together and made the whole together work. I feel like he’s absolutely self-aware; that’s part of the act. That’s what’s fun. And that’s why that opening sequence in the train station, you see him putting on that character and very much doing the… You know, I think he’s aware of it. I think he’s also aware that it’s kind of funny, that that’s part of the gag, you know, is pretending to be somebody you’re not, putting that on. Putting on that big cape and that big hat, and being that guy. And, you know, if you’re Orson Welles, you can pull it off.&nbsp;Next: Rian Johnson explains why filmmakers are like con men.RT: You said there are hundreds of other movies you love. What are some of the others?RJ: That’s really tough. My mind is like blazing through a thousand right now. Well, I guess, you know, The Treasure of the Sierra Madre is one of my all-time favorites. Also kind of a sentimental favorite of mine because it’s a movie I’ve been watching since I was a kid. It’s one of my dad’s favorites. 8 ½, which probably could have fit in with this list, actually, is another one of those films that I… I don’t have the film contained in my head. I can’t sit down and analyze it. I can’t pull it apart. It’s an experience that completely absorbs every time I watch it. There’s so many of them, though. Pick any Scorsese movie, pick any Kubrick movie, you know? The Coen Brothers’ stuff. We’d be here for an hour. [laughs][rtimage]MapID=1195109&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=22&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]RT: What’s up with your next project, Looper?RJ: It’s kind of a science fiction movie, and it’s almost the exact opposite of Bloom. It’s kind of dark and violent. I’m having a really good time doing something 100 percent different than what I just did. But I’m writing it right now, so I’ll get the script done and we’ll see if we can con somebody into letting us make it.RT: So what is it about con men that you like? I mean, obviously there’s a certain likability there and there’s a camaraderie there, but is that basically what draws you in to that sort of thing?RJ: Well, no, it’s a lot of different things. I mean, I think that there’s an appeal. One of the appeals for me is that the con man, in pulling off these ruses, is basically a storyteller. You know, the things that con men do in order to take a mark are the same things that a storyteller does in order to take in an audience. So that’s very interesting. But also I think there’s an appeal to the idea of the gentleman thief, which is something that the con man has always been. He’s the aristocrat of criminals.RT: You have to be smart and bad.RJ: Exactly. Actually, you have to be much more smart than bad. That’s one of the badges of honor, being a con man, because you don’t use violence. You’re not a common thug. You’re much more of a gentleman when you steal people’s money. [laughs][rtimage]MapID=1195109&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=21&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]RT: You’ve described several filmmakers as con men. Do you think that’s part of the deal?RJ: Oh, yeah, absolutely. Isn’t it? I mean, that’s the appeal of it. When you go into a movie, you can have the thrill of being conned and only lose $10. [laughs] I think that’s kind of why we go to the theater. I know that’s why I do it. I sit down hoping to be completely fleeced, you know? Hoping to be taken for a ride and turned on my head, and confused, and then not confused. All the same things that a con man does, a filmmaker does, I guess. The filmmaker just lets you off a little bit easier in terms of your wallet.RT: But only a little.RJ: Only a little. With today’s theater prices, my God.&nbsp;Check out this clip from The Brothers Bloom, in theaters this Friday. Plus, read our interview with Johnson for Brick.

Plus, Netflix's Army of the Dead gamble pays off and more from the weekend box office of May 14-16, 2021.by Erik Childress | May 16, 2021 |  Comments(Photo by Brooke Palmer)Masks are coming off in certain locations and more seats may be opening up in movie theaters but the films themselves are still not drawing much of an audience. Only four films this year have managed to open to more than $10 million and if the Saw series has anything in common with Raya and the Last Dragon it may be the disappointment in not being able to join that exclusive club in 2021. Instead, the latest&nbsp;Saw&nbsp;film, Spiral, looks to become another footnote suggesting that even brand names are not bringing back people to theaters. Yet.King of the Crop: Spiral Wins the Weekend But Leaves Questions In Its WakeThe Saw series was on a seven-year hiatus after “The Final Chapter” when Jigsaw was launched in 2017 to a $16.6 million start. The previous low for the franchise was Saw VI ($14.1 million), when people decided they would rather have a Paranormal Activity film for their October horror than another Saw entry. After James Wan’s original opened to $18.2 million in 2004, the next four entries opened between $30 million and $34 million. Nobody expected Spiral: From the Book of Saw to approach those lofty numbers, even on the downslope of the pandemic. But it was widely expected to come somewhere in the vicinity of those Saw VI opening numbers. Though: Is it the pandemic or are people just tired of the Jigsaw shtick altogether?In terms of horror comps for 2021, a $8.7 million start is certainly better than The Unholy ($2.35 million) or Separation ($1.8 million). It is also better than last week’s Wrath of Man ($8.3 million). Heck, that makes it good enough for the fifth best opening of the year. But do not expect this film to chug along the way Nobody’s $6.82 million opening did to over $25 million, so far. The last five films in the Saw series dropped between 60.6% and 67.6% after their first weekends. Wrath of Man just dropped 55% from its number 1 perch last weekend to gross $3.7 million this weekend. Assuming Spiral holds on to a narrow margin for first place next week we could be looking at the lowest number 1 gross since the weekend of February 19, when The Croods: A New Age made $1.71 million. The lowest since then was Raya and the Last Dragon’s third weekend victory, with $5.12 million. The Disney film has now officially surpassed Tom &amp; Jerry to become the second-highest grossing film of 2021 and the fifth-highest of the pandemic. Though the industry is certainly hoping that all the films on that list will be knocked down two notches sometime after Memorial Day weekend with the releases of A Quiet Place Part II and Cruella.Rotten Returns: The Devil Is in The Per-Theater-Average Details For a Number of Under-Performers(Photo by © Warner Bros. / Courtesy Everett Collection)Taylor Sheridan’s Those Who Wish Me Dead made $2.8 million, which does not rank as the weakest of the Warner Brothers/HBO Max hybrid openings: Judas and the Black Messiah made just $2.07 million. But that was still well back in February with theaters closed and vaccinations just getting rolling. It was also in 1,888 theaters compared to Dead’s 3,188. That is the widest launch for any film during the pandemic and represents just an $878 per-theater average. Judas’ PTA was $1,096.Roadside’s wide release of Finding You finished with $954,000 in 1,314 theaters. That’s a PTA of $726. Focus put out Timur Bekmambetov’s Profile, which first premiered at the Berlin International Film Festival in February 2018, and it grossed just $670,000 in 2,033 theaters for a $329 per-theater average. That is just above the current low in 2021 for a wide release PTA, which belongs to Long Weekend, released in 814 theaters and grossing $245,812 for a PTA of $302.Netflix In Theaters: Army of the Dead Lands Small Victory for the StreamerNetflix released Zack Snyder’s Army of the Dead ahead of its release online next week and the company finally gave up some box office numbers:&nbsp;Dead&nbsp;made $780,000 in 430 theaters. That’s a $1,813 average. It’s also the best opening for a film in less than 1,000 theaters this year, just besting last week’s 10th anniversary re-release of Edgar Wright’s Scott Pilgrim vs. the World, which grossed $729,930 in just 152 theaters. That is the fifth highest PTA of the year.On These Dates In Box Office History…(Photo by Marvel Studios)May 14: On this date in 2016, Jon Favreau’s retelling of The Jungle Book reached the $300 million milestone on its 30th day of release by grossing $7.76 million. In 2009, it was the seventh day of release for J.J. Abrams’ Star Trek reboot and it made $5.6 million to cross the $100 million line. By contrast, Darren Aronofsky’s Noah also hit $100 million on this day in 2014 by grossing $42,885, but it took 48 days to reach that mark.May 16: This date is actually quite the banner one for Marvel and its characters and is one we will have to keep an eye on in coming years. In 2007, Sam Raimi’s Spider-Man 3 broke the $250 million line after 13 days of release with $3.14 million. Flash-forward to 2016 when Captain America: Civil War made $4.75 million and crossed $300 million in its 11th day. It was a continuing trend when it came to Tony Stark appearances. In 2013, Iron Man 3 made $3.29 million to go over $300 million in its 14th day of release; in 2010, it was Iron Man 2 grossing $14.27 million to pass $200 million in 10 days. And it was so close but no cigar when the MCU kicked off in 2008 with the original Iron Man: it grossed $8.65 million on its 15th day of release and its total on this date was $199.94 million.

One of them was becoming the top-grossing film in the series, passing Bad Boys II’s $138 million. The second is more impressive: Until this weekend, Paul Blart: Mall Cop was the top-grossing January film of all-time with $146.3 million; in just 17 days, Bad Boys for Life&nbsp;took that record, eclipsing every other true January release ever with its total (so far) of $148.05 million. Though in the “for every action there is an opposite reaction” file,&nbsp;a new release this week set an abysmal new record for a release of its type.King of the Crop:&nbsp;Bad Boys For Life&nbsp;Officially the Biggest January Movie EverBad Boys for Life&nbsp;has left all of its January competitors in the rearview mirror, so we must go to the all-time lists to chart its progress going forward. At present time, the third film in the franchise is ahead of the pace of the second film in Mission: Impossible franchise (believe it or not, still the highest-grossing in that series), which had $145.7 million after 17 days, while grossing $17.2 million in its third weekend. The Bad Boys are up to $148.05 million with $17.68 million this weekend. The Will Smith/Martin Lawrence movie is also ahead of The Mummy Returns, which had $146.4 million at this point in its theatrical life, but a $20.4 million third weekend. While both were summer releases (and M:I2&nbsp;opened on a Wednesday),&nbsp;Bad Boys is still doing midweek numbers close to or exceeding those films, giving it a legit shot at reaching the $200 million line and becoming the seventh&nbsp;Will Smith movie to do so. The film has also grossed over $244 million worldwide to date. Bad Boys II topped out at $273 million.Recommended: The 50 Highest-Grossing Movies of All TimeRecommended: All Billion-Dollar Movies, Ranked by TomatometerRecommended: Fresher Movies Make More Money at the Box Office: a Tomatometer Deep DiveRotten Returns:&nbsp;Black Lively’s&nbsp;The Rhythm Section&nbsp;Sets Record Low for 3,000-Plus Theaters(Photo by © Paramount Pictures)Paramount’s The Rhythm Section made history this weekend and even the lowest expectations for it did not quite see it coming. The $50 million production grossed a miserable $2.8 million from Friday to Sunday. There have been more expensive films and greater disparities between their openings and budget, but there has never been a movie released in 3,000 theaters that has opened to so little or had a per-theater-average below $1,000. The Rhythm Section, with an estimated $918 per-theater-average, now owns that distinction&nbsp;and sits on top of the following list:The Rhythm Section ($2.80 million / 33% Tomatometer)Hoot ($3.36 million / 26% Tomatometer)The Seeker: The Dark is Rising ($3.74 million / 14% Tomatometer)Fun Size ($4.1 million / 25% Tomatometer)Burnt ($5 million / 28% Tomatometer)Hardcore Henry ($5.1 million / 50% Tomatometer)Meet Dave ($5.25 million / 20% Tomatometer)What’s Your Number? ($5.42 million / 24% Tomatometer)Keeping Up with the Joneses ($5.46 million/ 19% Tomatometer)The Darkest Minds ($5.84 million/ 16% Tomatometer)The Top 10 and Beyond: Oscar Contenders Continue Golden Streak, As&nbsp;Hansel and Gretel&nbsp;Only Manages a Few Box Office CrumbsMost of the films in the top 10&nbsp;continue to do very well. Sam Mendes’ 1917, just a week before it may take home the Best Picture Oscar, is up to $119 million. After 24 days of wide release, the film is ahead of the pace of many of the best-performing true January releases (American Sniper, like 1917, opened in limited release in December), except for Kung Fu Panda 3, which grossed $117.1 million in 24 days of wide release. (1917 grossed $2.72 million in limited and $116.57 million since its release.) The film will likely remain in the&nbsp;top 10 until at least early March and could&nbsp;pass $150 million by then.Fellow Best Picture nominee&nbsp;Little Women&nbsp;will be passing $100 million within the next week,&nbsp;just before it&nbsp;potentially wins the Best Adapted Screenplay Oscar for Greta Gerwig, who will join a very exclusive list of female directors with a nine-digit domestic gross. Dolittle has also crossed the $100 million line – worldwide, that is. It’s also the only other film besides Bad Boys For Life to gross over $50 million in 2020, so there’s that. Then again, it’s only the second 2020 release to gross over $25 million. Guy Ritchie’s The Gentlemen will be the third, though that figure is not much of an accomplishment.(Photo by Patrick Redmond / © United Artists Releasing)United Artists Releasing did not have enough confidence in Gretel &amp; Hansel to screen it for critics in many markets, and despite resting just below&nbsp;Fresh at 56% on the Tomatometer, Ozgood Perkins’ revisionist&nbsp;fairy tale fell into January’s horror doldrums with just $6 million. The film only cost $5 million to make, so it is not a major failure, but it will be amongst a list of scary underperformers from last month that includes The Grudge ($20.8 million), Underwater ($16.4 million), and The Turning ($11.7 million), which fell 56% this weekend.Finally, in more positive news, Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker has moved into 35th&nbsp;place all-time with $1.058 billion worldwide, right ahead of Rogue One’s $1.056 billion (even if it will fail to reach that movie’s $532 million domestic total). Meanwhile,&nbsp;Jumanji: The Next Level is headed toward $300 million domestic and over $750 million worldwide.This Time Last Year:&nbsp;Glass&nbsp;Stays on Top During a Record-Low Weekend(Photo by © Universal)M. Night Shyamalan’s Glass led&nbsp;for a third straight weekend, though it grossed just $9.54 million. The Upside held firm in second with $8.67 million ahead of the weekend’s only new release, the American remake of Miss Bala, which started with only $6.86 million. The top five was rounded out by a pair of comic-book films:&nbsp;Aquaman ($4.88 million in its seventh&nbsp;week) and Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse ($4.54 million in its eighth). The top 10 films as a whole grossed just $52.08 million, which was the lowest total for a February weekend since the 1990s; the films averaged 64.1% on the Tomatometer. This year’s&nbsp;top 10 grossed an estimated $65.15 million and averaged 57.5% on the Tomatometer.On the Vine:&nbsp;Harley Quinn Shows There’s Life After Mistah JThe next $100 million grosser of 2020 should be arriving in theaters with Birds of Prey featuring the return of Margot Robbie’s Harley Quinn from Suicide Squad. Early tracking on the $97 million production is in the low $50 million range;&nbsp;Suicide Squad&nbsp;opened to $133.6 million. Also look around for Neon’s pickup from the 2019 Sundance Film Festival, The Lodge, with Riley Keough.

One of them is looking to be the biggest film in its series, as well as having the second biggest opening over the Martin Luther King holiday. The other is on the path to become the first big disaster of the new year and decade. It is one of the few negatives within a top 10 set to rank as the fifth-biggest Martin Luther King holiday weekend ever.King of the Crop:&nbsp;Bad Boys for Life Dominates Weekend With $73.4 Million(Photo by Columbia Pictures)The two biggest MLK holiday moneymakers are American Sniper and Bad Boys for Life. The third entry in the very spaced-out series with Will Smith and Martin Lawrence earned an estimated $62.2 million over the weekend and $73.4 million in its first four days. That eclipses the $48.6 million that Ride Along opened to back in 2014 (the Ice Cube–Kevin Hart comedy was the MLK leader until Eastwood’s film exploded with $107.2 million the following year). Bad Boys II opened to $46.5 million in the summer of 2003. Bad Boys for Life’s total makes it the seventh best opening amongst sequels opening more than 10 years past their previous entry. It is a list that includes The Force Awakens, Jurassic World, Incredibles 2, Finding Dory, Toy Story 3, Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull in front of it, and Men In Black 3, Mad Max: Fury Road, and Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines behind it.Depending on who you talk to, Bad Boys II is either one of the greatest action films ever made (see: Hot Fuzz) or one of the worst, most vile films ever produced (see: Michael Bay). For a July release it may have grossed $138.6 million, but that is still just a 2.97 multiple over its opening, representing on the lower scales of word-of-mouth success for a summer film. Of the 18 films to open between $41 million–$52 million in July only four films had a worse multiple (The Nutty Professor II, Lucy, 2016’s Ghostbusters and The Village). How will the $90 million Bad Boys for Life rank with audiences? On the surface, it would seem unlikely for the film not to replace Paul Blart: Mall Cop as the all-time January champion with $146.33 million. (American Sniper technically began its run in December.) Given this third film is unchartered territory because of the disparity between the Sniper and Ride Along openings, it is hard to pinpoint precisely. On the other hand, only 25 percent of the true January-openers have had a multiple lower than the 2.46 Bad Boys for Life would need to knock down the Mall Cop, even if one of them was Taken 3.Recommended: The 50 Highest-Grossing Movies of All TimeRecommended: All Billion-Dollar Movies, Ranked by TomatometerRecommended: Fresher Movies Make More Money at the Box Office: a Tomatometer Deep DiveRotten Returns:&nbsp;Dolittle Is Universal’s Second Talking-Animal Disappointment in a Month(Photo by Universal Pictures)The good news is that Dolittle has already outgrossed Universal’s last talking-animal debacle, Cats. The bad news is that Universal may have an even greater talking-animal debacle on their hands. Cats was a loser with a $95 million budget, but reports that it was one of the biggest losers of all-time were greatly exaggerated. Dolittle, conservatively, cost in the $175 million range, so anything less than a $325 million worldwide gross is going to result in around a nine-digit loss for the studio. Only three January releases have ever grossed that much globally – Kung Fu Panda 3, xXx: The Return of Xander Cage, and Taken 3. Given that each were part threes, maybe Bad Boys for Life can join them as it added $37 million overseas. Meanwhile, Dolittle’s $30 million in four days would be a decent January start for most releases, but when it is staring at a bill that is going to take over a half-a-billion to pay off, expect write-off stories on the title.The Top 10 and Beyond: 10-Time Oscar-Nominee 1917&nbsp;Adds $26.8 MillionSince taking the No. 1 spot in its first week of wide release, Sam Mendes’ 1917 received 10 Oscar nominations to go with it. Now in its second weekend it earned another $26.8 million over the holiday and it is up to nearly $81.4 million total. Though technically a December release where it earned $2.72 million in just 11 theaters over 16 days, 1917 still has grossed more in January in its first 10 days of wide release than any other film except for American Sniper. (Bad Boys for Life will pass it next Sunday.) It is on a pace to gross over $150 million, however, and we will see if it outlasts Smith and Lawrence. Greta Gerwig’s Little Women got itself six nominations and with $86.7 million after 26 days of release still finds itself amongst a group of $100 million grossers. It is going to be close, but there are still three weeks left before the awards, so plenty of time for audiences to catch up on it and add Gerwig to the list of female directors to reach the milestone.Rian Johnson’s Knives Out was another Oscar nominee for Best Original Screenplay, and it has passed fellow nominee Quentin Tarantino’s Once Upon a Time in Hollywood as the second highest–grossing original film of 2019, as it will past $150 million next weekend. It will then ultimately pass La La Land to become the highest-grossing non-sequel/non-adapted film in Lionsgate’s history.In other all-time lists, Jumanji: The Next Level now ranks as the 11th highest–grossing December film after 38 days (edged out by Titanic) and is going to finish somewhere between The Lion, the Witch and The Wardrobe’s $291 million and The Fellowship of the Ring’s $313 million. Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker entered the billion-dollar list on its 28th day of release (The Last Jedi took less than three weeks), and it will join the half-billion domestic list the next week, but does not look to have the legs to best Rogue One’s domestic total of $532 million. Frozen II, on the other hand, is about to enter the Top 10 All-Time Worldwide Grossers list, requiring less than $90,000 to best Avengers: Age of Ultron. Maybe it will earn it by end of day Monday, depending on how the estimates hold. Tuesday at the latest.Last week’s other trio of wide releases are still not much to write home about. Just Mercy continues to lead the pack with over $21 million on its way to around $30 million. The $29 million Tiffany Haddish–Rose Byrne comedy, Like a Boss, is headed the direction of Proud Mary and may not get much further than $21 million. Then the Kristen Stewart monster film, Underwater, became the second 2020 horror film in a row (after The Grudge) to not spend two consecutive weeks in the Top 10. The at-least $50 million production may not even reach $20 million domestic. It has grossed $27.4 million worldwide to date.This Time Last Year:&nbsp;The Upside&nbsp;Lands First Big Surprise of 2019(Photo by Universal Pictures)Last year’s holiday weekend was led by M. Night Shyamalan’s Glass, which opened to $40.32 million and was the fifth $40-plus million opening of his career. The surprise hit, The Upside, dropped just 26 percent to second place with $15 million. Aquaman hung tight in third as it crossed $300 million. The big surprise of the week was Funimation’s Dragon Ball Super: Broly grossing $9.81 million in just 1,238 theaters for fourth place. The top five was rounded out by Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse with $7.57 million. Bohemian Rhapsody also crossed the $200 million line. The Top 10 over the 4-day weekend grossed $134.43 million and averaged 68.1% on the Tomatometer. This year’s Top 10 grossed an estimated $178.52 million and averaged 67.8% with critics.On the Vine: The Gentlemen and&nbsp;The TurningWhile a lot of film press will be talking about Sundance next week, audiences will get to choose between another new horror film and the latest from Guy Ritchie. The Turning is the first feature from director Floria Sigismondi since her Sundance entry from 2010, The Runaways. Universal is hoping the film can break the trend of lackluster openings for The Grudge and Underwater. It stars MacKenzie Davis, Finn Wolfhard, and The Florida Project’s Brooklynn Prince. Then Guy Ritchie is indeed back in the world of comic crime tales with The Gentlemen featuring a big cast including Matthew McConaughey, Colin Farrell, Charlie Hunnam, Michelle Dockery, Henry Golding, and Hugh Grant.The Full Top 10:&nbsp;January 17-20 (MLK 4-day Weekend)Bad Boys for Life (2020)  76% – $73.4 million ($73.4 million total)Dolittle (2020)  14% – $29.5 million ($29.5 million total)1917 (2020)  89% – $26.82 million ($81.44 million total)Jumanji: The Next Level (2019)  71% – $12.8 million ($273.71 million total)Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker (2019)  51% – $10.51 million ($494.15 million total)Little Women (2019)  95% – $8.2 million ($86.69 million total)Just Mercy (2020)  85% – $7.5 million ($21.11 million total)Frozen II (2019)  78% – – $5.37 million ($466.52 million total)Knives Out (2019)  97% – $5.31 million ($146.99 million total)Like a Boss (2020)  21% – $4.84 million ($17.92 million total)Erik Childress can be heard each week evaluating box office on WGN Radio with Nick Digilio as well as on Business First AM with Angela Miles and his Movie Madness Podcast.[box office figures via Box Office Mojo]Like this?

Whatever made up the top 10 last week&nbsp;week was pretty much here again this week, just with about two-thirds the revenue. In the meantime, most of America stayed away from the movies for one last summer vacation, fairs, BBQs, and – we assume – to save their money for the evil clown looking to break new records next weekend. For now, though,&nbsp;Angel Has Fallen&nbsp;can crow about being the top of a weak-ish crop for two weeks straight with a second-weekend haul of $14.8 million over four days.King of the Crop:&nbsp;Angel&nbsp;Does&nbsp;Not Fall In Second Week(Photo by Simon Varsano / © Lionsgate / courtesy Everett Collection)Neither Olympus Has Fallen&nbsp;nor London Has Fallen&nbsp;spent a single week in the top spot at the box office. Now,&nbsp;Angel Has Fallen&nbsp;has done it for two straight weeks&nbsp;and&nbsp;joins 300&nbsp;and this year’s How To Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World&nbsp;as the only films featuring Gerard Butler to spend two straight weeks at number 1. In fact, the first How To Train Your Dragon&nbsp;is the only other film featuring Butler&nbsp;to spend any&nbsp;week at number 1. Over the four-day Labor Day weekend, Angel grossed an estimated $14.8 million, a number that is neither high nor low when it comes to grossers over the holiday; it is 25th&nbsp;overall amongst premieres and holdovers. At an estimated $43.91 million after 10 days, the film remains right on par with Richard Donner’s Conspiracy Theory, which made a little more in its second weekend and finished with $75 million. It looks like Angel will come in a bit under that, but if its eventual international take comes in anywhere close to London’s $143 million, Lionsgate may be the first studio to take a second whack at this franchise.Rotten Returns:&nbsp;Bennett’s War&nbsp;Fails to Cut Through(Photo by © ESX Entertainment)Forrest Films released its&nbsp;debut, the motorbike and military&nbsp;drama&nbsp;Bennett’s War, into 970 theaters this weekend. The film about an injured war veteran trying to make a comeback on the motocross circuit has a solid&nbsp;Tomatometer at&nbsp;60%, but that’s with just five reviews. The film grossed just&nbsp;$445,151 over the three-day weekend (Friday to Sunday) for a per-theater-average of $459. That is actually&nbsp;far from the lowest PTA of 2019 – John Travolta’s The Fanatic grossed $3,153 in 52 theaters for less than a $61 PTA – but it is the lowest of the year for an original wide release. The 20th anniversary showing of Cruel Intentions&nbsp;averaged $385 in 708 theaters; Keanu Reeves’ sci-fi film, Replicas, released this January, had a $1,020 PTA in 2,329 theaters.Just for reference we looked at other August releases over time that opened in between 950 and 999 theaters and picked out a few highlights. In 2013 the Spanish language release, Instructions Not Included, with Eugenio Derbez, grossed $7.84 million in 978 theaters; in 2006, Idlewild made $5.74 million in 973 theaters; and in 1998, the Vince Vaughn/Joaquin Phoenix drama&nbsp;Return to Paradise&nbsp;opened to $2.46 million in 965 theaters.Top 10 and Beyond:&nbsp;Good Boys&nbsp;Continues Good Run,&nbsp;Brittany&nbsp;In a Marathon Race to B.O. Success(Photo by Ed Araquel / © Universal)Running down the rest of this weekend’s moneymakers, Universal should continue to be happy about the performance of Good Boys,&nbsp;which grossed $12.1 million over the four-day weekend and remains on course to gross around $75 million. Hobbs &amp; Shaw&nbsp;has also maintained itself rather well and is headed for somewhere between $165 million and $175 million. The film is also approaching the $700 million mark worldwide, which is down&nbsp;from the&nbsp;previous two Furious&nbsp;movies&nbsp;but sees it outgrossing&nbsp;Fast Five&nbsp;– possibly even Fast &amp; Furious 6 –&nbsp;and turning a decent profit.Sony pulled an Endgame and put Spider-Man: Far From Home&nbsp;back into theaters with new footage for one last summer push, possibly in an attempt to push it over the $400 million line. That goal&nbsp;seems unlikely with $385.96 million to date, and it would need another $19 million to pass Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle&nbsp;for Sony’s highest-ever domestic&nbsp;release. That being said, the film is already the highest-grossing worldwide in the studio’s history with $1.122 billion, which is the 25th&nbsp;highest ever. Disney’s The Lion King&nbsp;is not going to become a top 10 all-time&nbsp;domestic grosser, but it is currently 13th&nbsp;all-time with over $523 million, and is chasing Rogue One&nbsp;($532.1 million) and The Dark Knight&nbsp;($535.2 million) to possibly finish 11th. Worldwide the film can now rest comfortably as the 7th&nbsp;highest-grossing film ever, having pushed past Furious 7 ($1.515 billion) and Marvel’s The Avengers&nbsp;($1.518 billion) this weekend with a global total of $1.564 billion. Catching&nbsp;Jurassic World&nbsp;for 6th place&nbsp;($1.671 billion) is not entirely out of the cards, but&nbsp;The Lion King&nbsp;will&nbsp;need its international fans to keep showing up. Disney owns six of the ten highest-grossing films of all-time.Last week’s two other openers benefited from a lackluster weekend. The faith-based Overcomer&nbsp;earned just shy of $8 million and&nbsp;is currently outpacing both of&nbsp;director Alex Kendrick’s other&nbsp;films, Courageous&nbsp;and Fireproof, which finished with $34.5 and $33.4 million, respectively. In its 13th&nbsp;day, the Certified Fresh horror-comedy&nbsp;Ready or Not&nbsp;passed $20 million and now resides between the grosses of Mystery Men&nbsp;and Sinister 2,&nbsp;suggesting a final gross in the $28 million range. (Not spectacular but not terrible either on a $6 million budget.)&nbsp;Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark, on the other hand, is an unqualified success. The Guillermo del Toro-produced horror tale is very closely on par with the original Blade,&nbsp;which finished with just over $70 million. All horror is going to take a hit next week with the opening of It:&nbsp;Chapter Two,&nbsp;so it may come up a bit short of that but is nevertheless into profit.Sony has the tale of two movies in Once Upon a Time…In Hollywood&nbsp;and The Angry Birds Movie 2. The former has grossed over $130 million and is not far behind the pace of where Robert Zemeckis’ What Lies Beneath&nbsp;was back in 2000, though a total of $150 million may be a reach in the U.S. after dropping out of the top 10 this week. The movie is over $283 million worldwide. As for the&nbsp;Angry Birds sequel,&nbsp;it is relying on its international dollars to save it because it is currently on an Underdog pace domestically – literally on pace with the movie Underdog –&nbsp;to hopefully make $43 million.Finally, we get to some festival films. From Sundance we have this week’s Don’t Let Go&nbsp;(titled Relive&nbsp;at the festival), which made $3.04 million in its 922 theater launch.(Photo by © Amazon Studios)The most interesting story, though, could be developing under not just our noses, but also Amazon’s. The studio’s&nbsp;Brittany Runs a Marathon&nbsp;expanded from five theaters into 49 this weekend; last weekend it made $180,711 and this week it earned $414,000 across the three-day weekend (and an estimated $539,000 for the four-day holiday). Last year’s The Old Man &amp; The Gun,&nbsp;with Robert Redford, made the same leap, starting with $142,131 and then climbing up to $403,928 the second week. The Old Man &amp; The Gun&nbsp;ended up making $11.2 million. Anything over $7.65 million would be Amazon’s second highest-grossing film to date.Maybe they should be looking at what Roadside is achieving with The Peanut Butter Falcon.&nbsp;That film opened&nbsp;in 17 theaters and it grossed $204,793 for the 43rd&nbsp;best per-theater-average of the year. Brittany&nbsp;had the sixth&nbsp;best, then expanded to the same amount of theaters as Falcon in weekend two and outgrossed it $414,000 to $287,212. The Peanut Butter Falcon&nbsp;then expanded into 996 theaters last week and grossed $2.97 million. It jumped up to 1,249 theaters this weekend and made another $2.92 million (and an estimated $3.95 million over the four-day holiday). Its total now stands at $8.94 million and is the 11th-highest grossing film ever in Roadside’s indie history. The film was not even a high-profile Sundance premiere; it was first shown at SXSW in March.This Time Last Year: Crazy Rich Asians&nbsp;Led Robust Holiday Weekend(Photo by Sanja Bucko/Warner Bros.)Crazy Rich Asians&nbsp;won the box office for a third straight weekend as audiences flocked to their favorites again. That $28.5 million victory over the four-day holiday put the leader at $117 million as it prepared to eclipse the second-place finisher, The Meg, which was over $123 million. Mission: Impossible – Fallout&nbsp;was third and passed the $200 million mark. The week’s top newbie, Operation Finale, finished fourth with just $7.87 million and a lackluster six-day total of $9.61 million since opening on a Wednesday. Bursting into the&nbsp;top 10&nbsp;was Sundance hit,&nbsp;Searching, which made $7.61 million in just 1,207 theaters for fifth place. All combined it was the best Labor Day weekend since 2013, as the top 10&nbsp;grossed $96.29 million and averaged 68.2% on the Tomatometer. This year’s top 10&nbsp;grossed an estimated $80.69 million&nbsp;for just the 16th-highest holiday weekend since 1990 and averaged 68.8% with critics.On the Vine:&nbsp;Nothing Stands In&nbsp;It‘s WayNormally, the fall movie season begins with a flurry of&nbsp;films clamoring&nbsp;for awards attention, but this year it begins with what promises to be one of the most successful flicks of the year. The nearly three-hour conclusion of Stephen King’s story of the evil in Derry,&nbsp;It: Chapter Two,&nbsp;arrives in theaters with the adults now in the room to battle Pennywise. No other wide release even dares to challenge this monster, and why would they? The first film opened to over $123 million and concluded with over $327 million domestic and $700 million worldwide, making it the highest-grossing horror film of all time (in 2017 dollars).

However, after the box office made over $79 million this weekend (the best since the $90.4 million from March 6-8, 2020), with the horror sequel accounting for an estimated $48 million of that (plus another $8-plus million on Monday), we got our dream “Movies Are Back!” headlines. Though let’s not get ahead of ourselves just yet…King of the Crop: A Quiet Place Part II‘s Epic Weekend Suggests The Corner May Be TurnedJohn Krasinski’s A Quiet Place Part II was the first film to delay itself when the COVID-19 scare began last March. It was a sequel to a film that made over $188 million after opening to $50.2 million in April 2018: that’s 3.74 times its opening, which is the best multiple for a film opening in April to more than $26 million. For comparison, Godzilla vs. Kong was the follow-up to Godzilla: King of the Monsters, which was anything but a word-of-success after opening to $47.77 million in May 2019 and only cleared 2.31 times that start. GvK still managed to be the first truly breakout film of the pandemic era, grossing $48.1 million from Wednesday to Easter Sunday, or March 31 to April 4. That was when the vaccination rate across North America was around 28%-29%; by Memorial Day weekend, we are at double that (with folks who have received at least the first dose), theaters are opening wider, and A Quiet Place Part II is not available on any streaming service and is exclusive to theaters. (GvK&nbsp;was available on HBO Max upon its release). All of this shows why a $30 million holiday weekend opening would not have been too much cause for celebration.Thankfully, as already mentioned, we have very good news to report: $57 million and counting. That may not be record-breaking Memorial Day number (it’s the 21st-best Memorial Day opening overall), but this is completely a glass half-full kind of weekend. People are showing up in theaters still socially distancing. We are not at maximum capacity just yet, but it feels like we have turned a corner. In four days, A Quiet Place Part II has grossed more than all but three films during the pandemic (GvK, Tenet, The Croods: A New Age) and it will be passing those latter two by Tuesday. The budget for the film is about three times the original ($61 million), and with it not being available on streaming at the same time as its theatrical release – and therefore its total numbers not being obscured, as they are for some streaming releases – this is in many ways the first film in a long time that we can declare an honest-to-goodness hit.The Top 10 And Beyond: Cruella Opens Strong, But… It’s ComplicatedThe story for Disney’s Cruella&nbsp;is a bit more mixed. It is certainly true that many families could have forked out $29.99 to catch the film at home with Disney+’s Premier Access, but precisely how many did (or will) is not readily available information, nor is it something the streaming services seem comfortable sharing in the most transparent means possible. The movie’s box office earnings of $21.3 million over the weekend and $26.5 million over the holiday are still very good pandemic numbers. (Though surely we all remember the headlines in 2015 when the $190-million budgeted Tomorrowland opened to $42.67 million over the holiday.) Some reports have Cruella costing as much as $200 million. Even if the budget is actually half that, it is going to take a significant international number plus those premium cost clicks to say this is not a miss for Disney.(Photo by Warner Bros. Pictures and Legendary Pictures)While it is also hard to measure any overall success or failure of Raya and the Last Dragon, it remains one of the very few films to pass $50 million at the box office during the pandemic – just the third film this year to do so, and fifth overall. Godzilla vs. Kong, meanwhile, is still tiptoeing its way towards $100 million, even as it looks like A Quiet Place Part II is going to get there first. It’s a good effort, regardless, with over $435 million in the bank worldwide so far. The movie only took $852,000 over the three-day weekend, though, and theater space is quickly about to become a luxury again, leading us to wonder: Will it have enough in the tank to reach the $100 million milestone or will Black Widow end up being the first co-streaming/theatrical film to do it in July? That’s if In the Heights does not make a big enough splash first.On These Dates In Box Office History…(Photo by Merrick Morton/TM and ©copyright Twentieth Century-Fox Film Corporation. All rights reserved/Courtesy Everett Collection)May 28: This is a big day for the summer $100 million club. In 2006, Brett Ratner’s X-Men: The Last Stand grossed $25.65 million on its third day of release to hit the milestone. In 2018, Solo: A Star Wars Story did it in four days with $18.59 million. Twenty years earlier, Steven Spielberg’s The Lost World: Jurassic Park hit $100 million with a $4.62 million gross on its sixth day. 2010’s Shrek Forever After did it in eight days, with $11.36 million, while the original Shrek in 2001 took 13 days to do it with $12.73 million. That was the same amount of days The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian took to reach the milestone in 2008 with $1.54 million on this day. This was also the day that Disney’s live-action 2017 Beauty and the Beast grossed $536,772 to pass the $500 million mark on its 73rd day of release.May 29: Two big summer comedies hit the $100 million mark, respectively, in 2011 and 2003 when The Hangover Part II made $26.27 million to do it four days and Bruce Almighty grossed $4.51 million to do it on – when else – its seventh day. Shrek Week on Twitter will be happy to be reminded that Shrek 2 made $27.23 million on this day in 2004 to pass $200 million on its11th day of release. It took twice as long for J.J. Abrams’ 2009 Star Trek reboot to hit that number with $3.61 million on its 22nd day. Of course, four years earlier, Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith made $18.7 million to reach $250 million in just half that time in 11 days.(Photo by © 20th Century Fox)May 30: Sharon Stone is out with a new memoir and this is the day that Basic Instinct broke the $100 million line in 1992 after 72 days of release with $1.1 million. In 2009, Angels &amp; Demons took just 16 days to do it with $4.76 million. Then in 2015, after 157 days of release, Clint Eastwood’s American Sniper made $28,047 and passed $350 million.May 31: This is the period of sequels, prequels, and remakes, so let’s go from the ground up. In 2000, Mission: Impossible II made $3.73 million on its eighth day while in 2009 Night of the Museum: Battle for the Smithsonian made $6.62 million on its 10th day. Each crossed $100 million. Guy Ritchie’s 2019 live-action Aladdin made $11.85 million on its eighth day; X-Men: Days of Future Past made $13.79 million in 2014 on its ninth day; and The Da Vinci Code made $2.78 million on its 13th day in 2006. That is your $150 million club. Over to $200 million and it’s Spielberg and Lucas time. Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace made $15.5 million on its 13th day in 1999 and Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull made $19.82 million on day 10 in 2008. But just two days after it passed the $200 million milestone, Shrek 2 grossed another $23.4 million on its 13th day of release to go over $250 million.On The Vine: Ed and Lorraine Warren Look to Scare Up A Second Big Weekend at the Box OfficeNext week the next chapter in the Conjuring Universe arrives with The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It, again with Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga, but minus director James Wan.

Even though the options have been limited, the big titles still continue to deal with challenges of reduced capacity and the alternative to view them at home at the time of premiere or after a few weeks. Godzilla vs. Kong, Tenet, and The Croods: A New Age are still the only films to gross more than $50 million since the pandemic began; though, on the bright side, the $40 million club is starting to get more crowded and it looks like last week’s releases may be headed for membership there.King of the Crop: Demon Slayer Finishes on Top of Mortal Kombat, as Both Aim To Crack $50 Million(Photo by © Aniplex / Courtesy Everett Collection)Funimation’s hit anime Demon Slayer, which topped the box office this weekend after coming in second last weekend, had actually been slowly gaining on Mortal Kombat’s total earnings throughout the week. Mortal Kombat led $23.32 million to $21.14 million after last Sunday; by Thursday, the race closed to $27.85&nbsp;million–$27.70 million. While Demon may still trail overall, congratulations is in order to it pulling out the victory this weekend by an estimated margin of $6.4 million–$6.2 million; however, you may note that is a significant drop-off from last weekend for both genre films, and with no real competition to draw people away. Up until now, the biggest drop-off for a wide release during the pandemic was the 67.1&nbsp;percent fall of Wonder Woman 1984 from Christmas weekend to New Year’s weekend. With a respective $6.4 million and $6.2 million each, Demon Slayer and Mortal Kombat fell 70&nbsp;percent and 73&nbsp;percent.That brings their estimated totals to $34 million for Mortal Kombat and $32.2 million for&nbsp;Demon Slayer on their 10th days of release, which is higher than Wonder Woman 1984 ($28.43 million), Tom &amp; Jerry ($22.84 million), and Raya and the Last Dragon ($16.04 million). All of those films are now part of the $40 million– to $50 million–gross club at the moment — and each of them also had or have same-day streaming options. That is something Demon Slayer does not offer as of yet. Those three films also grossed between $5.42 million and $6.5 million in their second weekends.The drops could stabilize next week, but looking back to normal times, both Super Troopers 2 and the 2010 A Nightmare on Elm Street remake were the only April wide releases to drop over 70&nbsp;percent in their second weekends. From their 11th days on, Elm Street grossed just an additional $14.6 million and Troopers Deux made only $8.4 million more. That was with theaters open in full and no pandemic. But it was also with more competition. So $50 million is not out of the running for Mortal Kombat and Demon Slayer, but the numbers are suggesting they will more likely be joining the second tier. Then again, given the circumstances, they are still amongst the highest-grossing films during this difficult period in history.The $100 Million Watch: Godzilla vs. Kong Inches Towards Headline-Grabbing Milestone(Photo by Courtesy of Warner Bros. Pictures and Legendary Pictures)Another $2.74 million to its credit and Godzilla vs. Kong is over the $90 million mark. It is now available exclusively in theaters, with its one-month run on HBO Max finished, but there have not been any substantial numbers to show any sort of a boost because of that. GvK’s fifth weekend is right on par with Tom &amp; Jerry’s $2.7 million. That family film has only grossed $7 million since then, which suggests the titans could still come up just short of becoming the first nine-digit release since Sonic the Hedgehog passed the milestone on February 23, 2020. This film is going to be in the top 10, however, through Memorial Day weekend and probably the first week of June, too. The numbers will drop, but theaters will be opening up more seats. Warner Bros. wants that number certainly for the headlines, but they may be even more satisfied if the film can surpass the $426 million worldwide total of Bad Boys for Life, which is still the highest-grossing film since the start of 2020. Godzilla vs. Kong has made over $408 million worldwide so far.Rotten Returns: Horror Film Separation Fails to Connect With Critics and FansHorror just is not what audiences are looking for right now, it seems. Or should we say Rotten horror? Four weeks ago, The Unholy opened to $3.1 million and has quietly grossed $13 million with a 28% Tomatometer. William Brent Bell’s Separation grossed $1.8 million this weekend and currently sits with an 11% Tomatometer score (from just 19 reviews) — the worst score amongst all wide releases in 2021, one-upping Chaos Walking’s 23%.On These Dates in Box Office History…(Photo by © Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures / © Marvel Studios )April 30: On this date in 2019, Avengers: Endgame became the fastest film ever to reach $400 million at the domestic box office when it earned $33.1 million on its fifth day of release.May 1: Endgame’s predecessor, Avengers: Infinity War, also pulled off a feat on its fifth day of release a year earlier in 2018. It made $23.4 million, but was only passing the $300 million mark at that point. In 2016, it took 17 days for Jon Favreau’s The Jungle Book to cross $250 million with $13.8 million. The fully animated film&nbsp;Rio&nbsp;took 17 days to make it past $100 million when it grossed $4.53 million on this day in 2011 .May 2: Rio’s sequel (Rio 2) achieved the same feat on this day in 2014 when it crossed $100 million by adding $1.74 million to its total. It did that in 22 days. For perspective, Cameron Crowe’s Jerry Maguire took 141 days to reach $150 million when it grossed $163,952 on this day during its run.On The Vine: Jason Statham, Billy Crystal, Tiffany Haddish Bring the Star PowerJason Statham reteams with Guy Ritchie for the first time since 2005’s Revolver in the thriller, Wrath of Man.

Plus, the Cats-tastrophe continues.by Erik Childress | December 29, 2019 |  Comments(Photo by Walt Disney Pictures)Moviegoers must have been hitting the malls to do some last-minute Christmas shopping last weekend or entertaining newly-arrived family members, because there was certainly an uptick in attendance this weekend. The trend was boosted by some freshly-minted releases for certain, but last week’s big (if somewhat disappointing) winner is still in the running to put itself back on the path for the Star Wars box office legacy we had always assumed for it. And there is still another whole week of vacation left for the kids.King of the Crop:&nbsp;Rise of Skywalker&nbsp;Triumphs AgainThe Star Wars legacy of which we speak is one of dollars and cents. Last week it looked as if The Rise of Skywalker&nbsp;was going to buck that trend and maybe come up short of The Last Jedi. While the film is not completely out of the woods yet, it certainly made a case that it is registering better with moviegoers than critics; having the second-best Christmas Day gross of any film (debut or not) with $32.16 million was among its achievements this week alone. The Force Awakens remains tops with $49.32 million, and The Last Jedi comes in with $27.45 million. (The all-time debut opener was Guy Ritchie’s Sherlock Holmes with $24.6 million.)Skywalker then commanded $134.75 million from Wednesday through Sunday, with $72 million of that over the weekend, which still means a 59 percent drop. It now joins the list of the 10-best 10-day grosses of all-time with over $361.79 million. That is the eighth-best ever behind Marvel’s The Avengers ($373.07 million) and The Last Jedi ($368.16 million). This summer’s The Lion King is the only film on that list to not reach $600 million at the domestic box office. The Last Jedi made $71.56 million in its second weekend and finished with $620.18 million. The Rise of Skywalker still has a shot to join Return of the Jedi and Revenge of the Sith as the final chapters of each trilogy to outgross their second films, but it will take a strong second week of vacation and a third weekend of $53 million or higher to keep it on that path.Recommended: The 50 Highest-Grossing Movies of All TimeRecommended: All 44 Billion-Dollar Movies, Ranked by TomatometerRecommended: Fresher Movies Make More Money at the Box Office: a Tomatometer Deep DiveFresh Surprise:&nbsp;Adam Sandler Reasserts His Box Office Mettle with Uncut GemsA24 has only taken a handful of their films into wide release. Mostly on the horror side as The Witch, It Comes at Night, Hereditary, and Midsommar went there on opening weekend. Others like Spring Breakers, Mid90s, The Disaster Artist, Lady Bird, and their Best Picture–winning Moonlight got into the 1,000-plus venue category eventually. The lauded indie studio must be in stitches this weekend as they moved Josh and Benny Safdie’s Adam Sandler–starring thriller Uncut Gems, after two weeks of a successful limited release, into 2,341 theaters and saw it make $5.9 million on Christmas Day, $9.5 million over the weekend, and $18.86 million since Wednesday. After just five days of wide release, the film has made nearly as much as Midsommar did in 17. By next weekend, it will be the third-highest-grossing film in the studio’s history. This weekend was the second-best ever for the studio, and Uncut Gems is going to make a run at Lady Bird’s $48.95 million as their highest-grossing domestic film ever.Rotten Returns:&nbsp;Cats-tastrophe Continues, Bombshell Fizzles, and Richard Jewell BombsShining a dark light at the bottom of the list this week are three films that have not crossed the $20 million line yet. Universal’s Cats is the biggest debacle among them. The $95 million production may be drawing the curious, but $17.82 million in 10 days is just not going to cut it. Lionsgate’s Bombshell is not doing much better with just $15.63 million in 10 days of wide release and another $409,281 in a week of limited. Clint Eastwood’s Richard Jewell has been in release for 17 days, and the $40 million film has only made $16.08 million of it back.The Top 10 and Beyond:&nbsp;Will Little Women Hit $100 Million?Speaking of director Greta Gerwig, let’s talk about the true newcomers to the Top 10 this week and how they are looking. Fifteen films have opened wide on Christmas Day and gone on to gross over $100 million. The Greatest Showman is the only one to do it while opening to less than $7 million on the day. (Even more spectacular given it started with just $2.45 million.) Gerwig’s Little Women came close to that number with a $6.42 million start, and its odds of hitting the nine-digit milestone increase further with a $29 million start in its first five days. Of 38 films opening between $20 million and $30 million in their first five days in December, 14 have done it, and this film has great word of mouth and is likely to have a solid run into awards season. The three films on that list to garner Best Picture nominations (as Little Women seems likely to) have posted the following grosses: Jerry Maguire with $153.95 million, The Green Mile with $136.8 million, and War Horse with $79.88 million. Steven Spielberg’s film earned $26.02 million in its first five days.Only three fully-animated films to open in December have grossed $100 million; Sing, Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse, and The Prince of Egypt. Fox’s Spies in Disguise has gotten off to a good start with $22.08 million since opening on Christmas with $4.76 million. To set the odds for Spies crossing the milestone, see the aforementioned Little Women stats, but the film has started with a more favorable five-day than The Prince of Egypt ($19.69 million).One film that has successfully finished over the line this week is Rian Johnson’s Knives Out. $110 million and counting (including an additional $104.6 million internationally) has the mystery close to The Santa Clause 2’s numbers ($113.58 million after 33 days and a $12.13 million fifth weekend). That film finished with $139.23 million, so somewhere between $130 million and $135 million seems a reasonable landing point for Knives Out, which has become the third-highest grossing original film of the year behind Us and Once Upon a Time in Hollywood.Frozen II, meanwhile, joined the $400 million club this weekend. The sequel is now just a day or two away from becoming the highest-grossing November opener ever and is $26 million ahead of the pace of soon-to-be-previous champ, The Hunger Games: Catching Fire. It is now headed to pass $450 million domestic and has also joined the Top 20 worldwide grossers of all-time with eyes on finding another $62 million to pass the original.Jumanji: The Next Level also had a solid week, and while it has not reached $200 million just yet, that achievement is just around the corner. Eighteen December-openers have grossed $160 million or more after 17 days. Sony’s sequel ranks 16th on that list, and only National Treasure: Book of Secrets and Sherlock Holmes failed to reach $250 million. Jumanji: The Next Level is at $173 million and only five of the 18 films (The Force Awakens, Avatar, The Last Jedi, Rogue One, and Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle) on that list had a better third weekend. The Next Level has grossed over $375 million worldwide to date.In limited release, Sam Mendes’ WWI film, 1917, grossed an estimated $1 million in its first five days for a per-theater-average of $51,818 over the weekend in just 11 theaters. That is the 9th best of the year and its $570,000 over the weekend bested other 11-theater releases such as The Hurricane ($541,225), Good Night and Good Luck ($421,446), To Die For ($386,510), and A Beautiful Mind ($367,151). The 19th best of the year, Dustin Destin Cretton’s Just Mercy grossed $111,000 in four theaters for a $27,750 PTA. Both films go into wide release on January 10.This Time Last Year: Aquaman’s $200 Million DominanceAudiences were still seeing James Wan’s Aquaman on the final weekend of 2018. It grossed $52.11 million and crossed the $200 million line on New Year’s Day. Mary Poppins Returns placed second with $28.53 million and passed its first $100 million on New Year’s Eve. The Top Five was rounded out by Bumblebee ($20.90 million), Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse ($18.79 million), and The Mule ($12.16 million). Falling back to sixth and seventh were Christmas Day openers Vice ($7.76 million) and Holmes and Watson ($7.41 million), each of which grossed more in their first three days from Tuesday to Thursday than over the weekend. The Will Ferrell–John C. Reilly pairing became one of the 10 worst-reviewed wide releases of the year with just an 11% Tomatometer score. The leading per-theater-average of the week went to On the Basis of Sex ($20,798 in 33 theaters.) The Top 10 films grossed $165.71 million and averaged 67.3% on the Tomatometer.This year’s Top 10 grossed $185.34 million and scored Fresh ratings with 71.7% of critics.On the Vine:&nbsp;Another Grudge&nbsp;The first weekend of 2020 brings back a familiar horror series being remade (once again) for American audiences. Director Nicolas Pesce who gave us indie horror films, The Eyes of My Mother (78%) and Piercing (72%), takes over the helm for The Grudge, starring John Cho and Betty Gilpin. The 2004 remake (39%) opened to $39.12 million and grossed over $110 million. The 2006 sequel (10%) not so much, as it started with $20.82 million, but then could not even double that with just $39.14 million.

Last week’s top two films The Possession and Lawless held onto their positions, the new Bradley Cooper film The Words debuted poorly in third, and most holdovers enjoyed relatively low declines. Still, the top ten failed to break $50M and the Top 20 barely inched over the $60M mark making for an ocean of empty seats.The Possession became the first horror movie in three years to top the box office over back-to-back weekends as the Lionsgate hit scared up an estimated $9.5M in its sophomore session slipping 46%. That was a hold that any fright film would kill for and the fact that it was coming off of a holiday frame made it even more impressive. With no real competition from new releases and a months-long drought of scary movies, the supernatural thriller upped its ten-day total to a terrific $33.3M on its way to possibly $50M+. 2009’s The Final Destination was the last horror movie to rank number one over two straight weekends.Distributor Lionsgate is on a hot streak and has owned the number one spot for four consecutive weekends now with two frames a piece for Possession and The Expendables 2. Add in the four-week reign that The Hunger Games had back in the spring and the company has held the top spot for eight total frames in 2012 – the most of any studio. It’s also as many as Warner Bros., Fox, and Paramount combined.The weekend after Labor Day is always one of the slowest frames of the entire year at the North American box office. Kids are back to school, the NFL football season starts, and studios usually avoid opening anything big. But this year was exceptionally poor. It was the first weekend in four years where no film managed to break the $10M mark. The last time was this very session in 2008 when Nicolas Cage’s Bangkok Dangerous opened at number one with a puny $7.8M. The Top 20 sank to only $60.2M that year with this weekend seeing a similar funk at a dreadful $60.6M. If estimates fall when final numbers are reported Monday, this weekend could end up as the worst in nine years. This same frame in 2003 saw Dickie Roberts: Former Child Star bowing in the top spot with $6.7M leading the Top 20 to a sad $59.7M. Some studio muscle will try to revive the box office next weekend with the openings of Sony’s Resident Evil: Retribution and Disney’s 3D release of Finding Nemo. Both open Friday in roughly 2,900 theaters.The moonshine flick Lawless enjoyed a good hold in its second weekend slipping 40% to an estimated $6M as it retained second place. Released by The Weinstein Co., the Shia LaBeouf pic has grossed a modest $23.5M from a very wide release in 3,138 theaters averaging only $1,913 per location this weekend.Audiences showed little interest in the new Bradley Cooper drama The Words which opened in third place with an estimated $5M from 2,801 locations for a poor $1,785 average. The PG-13 film co-starring Zoe Saldana, Dennis Quaid, and Jeremy Irons failed to generate any excitement with moviegoers and bad reviews didn’t help. Older women made up the core audience for the CBS Films release with research showing that 58% of the crowd was female and 78% was 25 and older. A CinemaScore grade of B indicates that the road ahead will not be easy for Words which was acquired at Sundance this year for $2M.August action sequels rounded out the top five. The Expendables 2 fell 47% to an estimated $4.8M giving Lionsgate $75.4M to date. Universal’s spy thriller The Bourne Legacy cracked the $100M mark over the weekend with an estimated $4M in its fifth round. The Jeremy Renner pic declined by 44% and raised its domestic total to $103.7M. The actor has now been in three different franchise films over the past nine months that reached nine-digit territory with Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol and The Avengers being the others.A pair of PG-rated kidpics followed. The animated ParaNorman slipped 42% to an estimated $3.8M while Disney’s The Odd Life of Timothy Green dropped by the same amount to an estimated $3.7M. Totals are $45.1M for the Focus toon and $43M for the Jennifer Garner starrer.Will Ferrell’s political comedy The Campaign held up well dipping 38% to an estimated $3.5M pushing the sum to $79.5M for Warner Bros. Despite virtually no new competition, The Dark Knight Rises suffered one of the largest drops in the top ten falling 46% to an estimated $3.3M for a domestic cume of $437.8M thus far. Overseas saw another $13M boosting the international total to $603.4M and the global gross to a stunning $1.04 billion. China stands at $42M after only two weeks and will soon become the film’s second biggest offshore market after the U.K. Grossing an identical $3.3M domestically was the hit documentary 2016 Obama?s America which dropped 36% giving the Rocky Mountain release $26.1M so far.A pair of notable films opened outside of the top ten to varying degrees of success. With zero degrees, Lionsgate’s kidnapping thriller The Cold Light of Day with Henry Cavill and Bruce Willis bowed to dismal results with an estimated $1.8M from 1,511 locations for a wimpy $1,191 average. The leftover title from the company’s acquisition of Summit did not get a big promo push and was quietly slotted into what is always one of the slowest frames of the entire year.With a new and annoyingly long title, Indiana Jones and The Raiders of the Lost Ark: The IMAX Experience saw a solid bow with an estimated $1.7M from 267 higher-priced IMAX locations for a $6,461 average. Paramount scheduled an exclusive one-week-only run to give fans the big-screen experience and help hype the Blu-ray release of all four Indiana Jones films which hit stores later this month.The top ten films grossed an estimated $46.9M which was down a sizable 23% from last year when Contagion debuted at number with $22.4M; and down 24% from 2010 when Resident Evil: Afterlife opened on top with $26.7M.","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"Company, FirstLook, Winter, dogs, The, Rock, mutant, play, Go, Ovation, SundanceTV, comics, Dark, Sematary, Christmas","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-Possession-Leads-Worst-Weekend-in-4-Years"},{"id":"47509122876195","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: Taken 2 Soars to Huge #1 Opening","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: Taken 2 Soars to Huge #1 Openingby Gitesh Pandya | October 7, 2012 |  CommentsLiam Neeson rocked the global box office with his much-anticipated kidnapping sequel Taken 2 which scored the best opening ever for an action film in the September-October corridor grossing an estimated $50M. The Fox hit debuted in 3,661 theaters and averaged a spectacular $13,657 per location. The PG-13 film doubled the $24.7M bow of its predecessor which was released on Super Bowl weekend in January 2009. Reviews were mostly negative, however audiences disregarded critics and came out for Neeson who proved once again his ample starpower. Since Taken, he has rebranded himself as the thinking man’s action hero and ticket buyers have responded. This is the actor’s second time anchoring a number one hit this year following The Grey which debuted to $19.7M in January. He also hit number one last year in Unknown which bowed to $21.9M.Taken 2, which involves a kidnapping plot to capture Neeson’s retired CIA agent character as well as his ex-wife and daughter who are on holiday together in Istanbul, played broadly as males made up 52% of the audience. 56% was 25 and older while the CinemaScore grade was a B+, respectable for a sequel. Friday started red hot with $18.5M, Saturday inched up 3% to $19.1M and Sunday is estimated to drop 35% to $12.4M. Action films in the fall are often affected by football on Sundays, but with Monday being the Columbus Day holiday, the studio is expecting continued solid results. Taken 2 performed much like a summer action film as movies of this genre have never opened close to $50M at this time of year. The biggest openings to date for action films in the months of September and October have been $33M for 1998’s Rush Hour and $36.5M for 2002’s Red Dragon which was a suspense thriller, but marketed to an adult action crowd.The jump in opening weekend sales for the new Taken was similar to what the second Jason Bourne film did. The original installment The Bourne Identity debuted to $27.1M in June 2002 while the sequel The Bourne Supremacy jumped 94% to $52.5M for its debut in July 2004. Taken 2 and Supremacy both benefited from the good will that their predecessors generated during their leggy runs at the box office. People who found the films after the first three days made sure that the second time around they came out on opening weekend for another adventure with a character they grew attached to. Both franchises feature gritty action anchored by a solo hero with lethal skills. The third Bourne film soared even higher at the box office. No word yet on a third round of Taken although it would certainly make financial sense.International moviegoers also lined up for Liam Neeson as Taken 2 grossed an estimated $55M from mostly openings in new territories. The global gross now stands at $117M with plenty more to come. It has been a busy year for Neeson. He has been on the big screen in 2012 with all of his top-grossing characters – Qui-Gon Jinn in the Star Wars Episode I 3D release, Ra’s Al Ghul in The Dark Knight Rises, Bryan Mills in Taken 2 &amp; Zeus in Wrath of the Titans.Last weekend’s most popular film Hotel Transylvania dropped down to second place but still attracted a huge audience of paying customers. Sony’s PG-rated monster toon grossed an estimated $26.3M, which would be impressive as an opening weekend, and dropped by a reasonable 38%. After only ten days, the Adam Sandler-led film has spooked up a stellar $76M and could be on track to end its domestic run in the area of $140M. With nothing for kids opening until after Halloween, the road ahead looks bright for Hotel.The college comedy Pitch Perfect expanded nationwide and landed in third place with $14.7M following its potent limited bow last week. Universal’s PG-13 pic about an all-female a cappella group averaged a good $5,320 from 2,770 theaters with holdover locations dropping by only 26%. The cume for the low-budget $17M film is now $21.6M on its way to $55M or more. Studio research showed that women made up an overwhelming portion of the audience as 81% of the crowd was female. 55% were under 25 and the film connected primarily to teen and young adult females. The studio is hoping that positive buzz will broaden the audience over the weeks ahead. Males often avoid films like these upfront, but can get drawn in down the road after hearing many recommendations from friends as was the case with Universal’s Bridesmaids last year.The well-reviewed sci-fi actioner Looper enjoyed a good hold in its second weekend grossing an estimated $12.2M for a 41% decline. The Sony release has taken in $40.3M in ten days and looks headed for a final tally of around $70M.Opening poorly in fifth place was Tim Burton’s animated film Frankenweenie with an estimated $11.5M from 3,005 theaters for a mild $3,827 average. It was the third 3D creepy comedy toon aimed at kids in the last two months and the worst performer on opening weekend. August’s ParaNorman opened better with $14.1M while last week’s Transylvania ended up opening much better than expected with $42.5M providing intense competition this weekend since both were aimed at the exact same crowd.Despite having much better reviews, Frankenweenie was a less mainstream film with its black-and-white and claymation style making Hotel the more popular choice for families looking for a pre-Halloween laugh. The CinemaScore for the Burton pic was a decent B+ and with the pumpkin holiday still a few weeks away, the PG-rated film has a chance to show some legs if good word-of-mouth spreads. Its story about a boy who reanimates his dead dog made the appeal more narrow so strong buzz will be needed for Disney to find long-term success against its competitors.Dropping 49% to an estimated $4M was the cop thriller End of Watch which has collected $32.8M so far for Open Road. Clint Eastwood’s Trouble with the Curve followed with an estimated $3.9M, down 47%, for a $29.7M total for Warner Bros. The horror film House at the End of the Street fell 48% to an estimated $3.7M putting the Relativity release at $27.5M.The acclaimed drama The Master held up well slipping only 31% to an estimated $1.8M for The Weinstein Co. which has grossed $12.3M to date. Disney and Pixar rounded out the top ten with its 3D release of Finding Nemo which took a sharp hit tumbling 62% to an estimated $1.6M for a $39M sum. That boosted the lifetime tally to $378.7M.The top ten films grossed an estimated $129.7M which was up a sharp 62% from last year when Real Steel debuted at number one with $27.3M; and up 69% from 2010 when The Social Network remained on top with $15.5M.","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"TV, Video, deadpool, natural, thriller, Animation, Funimation, Rock, james","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-Taken-2-Soars-to-Huge-1-Opening"},{"id":"47509086366129","title":"Weekend Box Office Results: Ford v Ferrari Outruns Competition With $31 Million","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Weekend Box Office Results: Ford v Ferrari Outruns Competition With $31 MillionCharlie's Angels grounded, while Joker crosses a billion bucks.by Erik Childress | November 17, 2019 |  CommentsThe holiday box office is still awaiting its best and brightest. For two weeks it has been filled with one underperforming title after another and that pile found some more company this weekend. Though the appearance of a success is certainly a smidge of good news this weekend for theaters, how far Ford v Ferrari will go to recover another extravagant budget remains to be seen. But it is the leader in spirit at the moment and could be a top five finisher for the next month to come.King&nbsp;of the Crop:&nbsp;Ford v Ferrari: Dawn of (box office) justiceJames Mangold’s Ford v Ferrari&nbsp;opened to $31 million, and it checks a lot of boxes in box-office watching: Two major stars, a successful director and a November opening. Where it certainly stands out is amongst its very specific genre. Unless your racing movie involved Pixar, Will Ferrell, or was wedged into a faux Point Break remake advertising itself as “fast” AND “furious,”&nbsp;car racing is not a genre that has drawn great interest beyond its base. Renny Harlin’s Driven ($32.7 million), Ron Howard’s Rush ($26.9 million), not even the video-game inspired Need for Speed ($43.5 million) could make what FvF is going to make in its first 10 days. The star power certainly helps. Tom Cruise got Days of Thunder to over $82 million back in 1990 and with a $31 million head start, Bale and Damon may help this one go even further. (We&nbsp;ranked Ford v Ferrari&nbsp;as the likely eighth-highest–grossing film this season in our holiday box office preview.)Terminator: Dark Fate opened to $29 million, dropping out of the top 10 in just its&nbsp;third&nbsp;weekend, and now looks like it will not hit $65 million. (For those looking for some history, Terminator: Dark Fate is the first film to open numbr 1 and only spend two weeks in the top 10&nbsp;since Texas Chainsaw 3-D in January 2013.) FvF is hoping to be more on the Creed/Murder on the Orient Express side of the equation,&nbsp;hoping to cross&nbsp;the $100 million finish line. Frozen II and A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood will knock it back to third next weekend, then Knives Out will put it in fourth in what could still be a very nice five-day weekend for FvF over the Thanksgiving holiday.With little challenge over the December 6 weekend, Mangold’s film should be at worst in the&nbsp;top five and that helped get Wonder over $100 million in 2017 after starting with $27.5 million. Ford&nbsp;is still looking at a $96 million production budget to overcome, but has also grossed an additional $21 million internationally.Rotten Returns:&nbsp;Charlie’s&nbsp;Angels&nbsp;grounded(Photo by Sony Pictures)There is no sugarcoating the numbers on Elizabeth Banks’ reboot of Charlie’s Angels. Scoring 60% with critics on the Tomatometer so far may be the best number it is going to see going forward. The 2000 big-screen version took in $13.6 million on its first day; the 2003 sequel made $14.6 million on Friday. The 2019 version grossed just $8.5 million in its first three days. The $48 million production is not going to be the kind of disaster that Terminator: Dark Fate nor possibly Midway is headed for, but it is no question a major disappointment that has killed any hopes of it becoming a franchise of any kind. No film opening in November between $8 million and $9 million since 2000 has reached $26.5 million, which is less than Charlie’s Angels (2000) and Charlie’s Angels: Full Throttle grossed in their opening weekends.The Top 10 And Beyond:&nbsp;Battle of&nbsp;Midway&nbsp;profitability,&nbsp;Joker&nbsp;crosses a billionLast week’s number 1 managed to win the battle against Charlie’s Angels but it is certainly losing the war. Dropping 51% in its second weekend to $8.75 million, Roland Emmerich’s Midway now finds itself between The Bone Collector and Harlem Nights on the all-time November chart after 10 days. That would give Midway a final estimate between $60-66 million, except its weekend is roughly $2-3 million behind either of those films, so even that low bar is in danger of not being passed. The $100 million production has grossed just $18.6 million internationally for a total of $53.7 million to date and is looking like one of the biggest losers of 2019.In the number 2 slot last week was The Shining sequel, Doctor Sleep. This week it is in sixth place after dropping 59%. With $25.03 million it is estimated right now to finish between $32 million and $35 million, below its $50 million budget. It has made just another $28.8 million overseas to date and, domestically, is looking like it will ultimately fall behind all of its challengers from last week. The John Cena family firefighter comedy, Playing with Fire, is on pace for close to $40 million and Paul Feig’s holiday-romance-with-a-twist, Last Christmas, could be looking at over $36 million.Warner Bros. is probably not thrilled with Bill Condon’s&nbsp;The Good Liar getting started with just $5.6 million, but the thriller with Helen Mirren and Ian McKellen only carried a $10 million budget. The film should at least gross that much but will need some overseas love to cover its prints and advertising. Thankfully, WB still&nbsp;has&nbsp;Joker killing it. Not only did it become the first “R”-rated film in history to pass a billion dollars worldwide, but it also passed the 2008 total of Christopher Nolan’s The Dark Knight featuring Heath Ledger’s posthumous Oscar-winning role of the iconic villain. Joker is now the 43rd highest-grossing film of all-time with $322 million domestic and over $694 million internationally. (See our guide to the highest-grossing movies ever.)Taika Waititi’s Jojo Rabbit added another 197 theaters (995 total) and made another $2.81 million in its fifth weekend. The Oscar-winning Spotlight made $2.8 million in its fifth weekend in 980 theaters and had $16.5 million to date. The Oscar-nominated The Kids Are All Right made $2.59 million in 994 theaters and had grossed $14.04 million. Jojo Rabbit currently has a $13.59 million total. A24’s release of Trey Edwards Shults’ Waves grossed $144,562 in just four theaters. If the estimate holds, its $36,140 per-theater-average will be the 12th best of the year and the third best for A24 in 2019 behind The Farewell ($88,916) and The Lighthouse ($53,475). The latter lost 393 theaters this weekend and its total stands at $9.79 million.Meanwhile, the holder of the best PTA of the year, Bong Joon-Ho’s Parasite ($128,072) pulled in another $1.9 million in 620 theaters in its sixth weekend. That is better than Moonlight did in its sixth weekend in 618 theaters ($1.21 million). Barry Jenkins’ Best Picture-winning film had made $8.54 million in its first 38 days of release. Parasite is at $14.4 million, which is almost exactly on par with what Best Picture nominee&nbsp;Good Night And Good Luck had at the same point.This Time Last Year:&nbsp;A little grim for&nbsp;GrindelwaldThe prequel extension of the Harry Potter universe, Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald, opened atop the box office with $62.16 million, which was more than $12 million less than the first film in 2016, and ultimately grossed around $75 million less total domestically. The Mark Wahlberg/Rose Byrne comedy, Instant Family, opened in fourth to $14.5 million. And one of the bigger disappointments of the season, Steve McQueen’s Widows, opened in fifth place with $12.36 million. The Grinch held strong in second with $38.58 million in its second weekend. Bohemian Rhapsody was third with $16.04 million. In 10th place was the documentary, Burn the Stage: The Movie, about pop group BTS, which grossed $2.42 million in just 629 theaters. The top 10 films grossed $161.43 million and averaged 47.22% on the Tomatometer. (Burn the Stage still does not have an official score.) This year’s top 10 grossed an estimated $91.13 million and averaged 58.6% with critics.&nbsp;On the Vine:&nbsp;A Beautiful&nbsp;Day&nbsp;and a&nbsp;Frozen&nbsp;SequelParents are already making plans with their kids on when to see Disney’s Frozen II, the sequel to the studio’s highest-grossing animated film of all-time. Expect an opening in the nine-digit region and play throughout the rest of the season. While the children are engaged with Anna and Elsa, parents get a chance to spend some time with one of their childhood icons in A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood. Tom Hanks plays Fred Rogers and may be looking at his sixth Oscar nomination and possibly his third statuette. Also vying for awards attention is the latest from Todd Haynes, Dark Waters, with Mark Ruffalo in a tale of environmental corporate malfeasance. From class action to just action there is also the oft-delayed cop thriller, 21 Bridges, with Chadwick Boseman. The film has was delayed July-to-September and then now to November 22.The Full Top 10:&nbsp;November 15-17Ford v Ferrari (2019)  92% – $31.03&nbsp; million ($31.03 million total)Midway (2019)  41% – $8.75&nbsp; million ($35.14 million total)Charlie's Angels (2019)  52% – $8.60 million ($8.60 million total)Playing with Fire (2019)  23% – $8.55 million ($25.49 million total)Last Christmas (2019)  46% – $6.70 million ($22.57 million total)Doctor Sleep (2019)  78% – $6.18&nbsp; million ($25.03 million total)The Good Liar (2019)  63% – $5.65&nbsp; million ($5.65 million total)Joker (2019)  68% – $5.63&nbsp; million ($322.59 million total)Maleficent: Mistress of Evil (2019)  39% – $5.24 million ($106.04 million total)Harriet (2019)  73% – $4.78 million ($31.88 million total)Erik Childress can be heard each week evaluating box office on WGN Radio with Nick Digilio as well as on Business First AM with Angela Miles and his Movie Madness Podcast.[box office figures via Box Office Mojo]Like this?

The DC villain overtook the Disney villain to reclaim his weekly crown, while Joker also&nbsp;celebrates an all-new crown&nbsp;as the highest-grossing R-rated film of all-time. The final weekend of October was certainly calm for the newcomers&nbsp;but the storm is coming soon as the Holiday movie season kicks off in earnest next week. Until then, the winners and losers of the Autumn season look pretty clear.King&nbsp;of the Crop:&nbsp;Joker&nbsp;Sets October&nbsp;And&nbsp;R-Rated Record(Photo by © Warner Bros. )Joker is the King in more ways than one. It is the first movie to regain the number 1 spot at the box office after being dethroned since A Quiet Place did it in April 2018. With over $277 million on Sunday, it surpasses Gravity to become the highest-grossing film ever released in October and, as mentioned, it has also passed Deadpool 2 as the top R-rated grosser worldwide with over $790 million. The $18.7 million that Joker made in weekend four is higher than both Thor: Ragnarok ($16.86 million) and Iron Man 2 ($16.45 million), as well as Deadpool 2 ($14.41 million). That suggests Joker is headed for somewhere over $320 million domestic and on its way to over $900 million worldwide. Joker is going to have the biggest profit of the Autumn season by over three times&nbsp;more than Warner Brothers’ other big hit of the season, It: Chapter Two. Other winners include Focus Features’&nbsp;Downton Abbey and STX’s Hustlers.Rotten Returns:&nbsp;Maleficent&nbsp;Sequel Trailing Well Behind Original, But Some Signs of Hope(Photo by © Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures)Maleficent: Mistress of Evil is in the running for an altogether different crown at the other end of the spectrum: that of one of the biggest bombs of the year. The international dollar is going to ultimately decide its final placement, but as of this weekend it has grossed just $65 million domestically and is in danger of not even crossing the $100 million line. (Its predecessor cleared $240 million.) The sequel is just a bit behind the 10-day grosses of Paranormal Activity 2 and Red Dragon,&nbsp;though it did gross a little more in weekend two than either of them. Those films, nevertheless, finished with only $84.75 million and $93.14 million, respectively.Good news for the Mistress of Evil is that family films are in short supply until Frozen 2 opens on November 22; neither Arctic Dogs nor Playing with Fire&nbsp;is likely to draw much business away from it. But even if Maleficent can reach nine digits here, it is still going to need to reach about $450 million internationally to break even. Currently it has made $228 million outside of its North American total.&nbsp;Still,&nbsp;Mistress of Evil looks like its red in the ledger will still be less than that of Paramount’s Gemini Man, which remains about $260 million away from the black. That would make it the clear loser in an Autumn season&nbsp;in which it has had plenty of company, including&nbsp;The Goldfinch, Ad Astra, and Rambo: Last Blood.The Top 10 And Beyond:&nbsp;Newcomers&nbsp;Make a Dull Impact as&nbsp;The Lighthouse&nbsp;Shines(Photo by © STX Entertainment)Neither of this weekend’s new releases posted noteworthy grosses, but neither were heavily budgeted either. Sony’s Black and Blue was the more expensive of the two, costing $12 million, so an $8.3 million start means it is likely headed at best for $20-$25 million total, if that. The horror film&nbsp;Countdown&nbsp;cost about half as much at $6.5 million and at least passed that figure with $9 million. It is also likely to take a small loss if it is forgotten by audiences once Halloween comes and goes.Two films still looking to get out of the red for the Autumn season remained in the top four and could see a decent showing leading up to Halloween next Thursday. Last week’s newcomer&nbsp;Zombieland: Double Tap is now up to nearly $47 million. The original film had $47.6 million after 10 days and grossed $14.8 million in its second weekend; the sequel dropped 57% and grossed just $11.6 million, so it appears it is headed to somewhere below the first film’s $75.59 million. The Addams Family is also having a nice little run and looks headed for over $90 million with an outside shot at reaching $100 million which, globally, is the number it needs to start turning a profit. Its total stands worldwide at $84 million.In other direct battles this weekend, we had one between musicians Kanye West and Bruce Springsteen. Kanye’s 31-minute short, Jesus Is King, grossed $830,000 in 372 IMAX theaters, which charge a bit extra no matter what the length, for a per-theater-average of $2,231. The Boss’ full-length music doc, Western Stars, was in 345 non-IMAX theaters and grossed just $560,000 for a $1,623 PTA. Then there was the battle between Thomas Edison and George Westinghouse in The Current War, labeled with “Director’s Cut” after the film spent two years on the shelf after premiering at the Toronto Film Festival in 2017 to mediocre reviews in the midst of the Harvey Weinstein scandal. It made just $2.73 million.And that wasn’t all. There was also&nbsp;the showdown between Robert Pattinson and Willem Dafoe in The Lighthouse. Robert Eggers’ follow-up to The Witch expanded to 586 theaters and made the&nbsp;top 10 with a gross of $3.08 million. That is a better per-theater-average ($5,257) than the expansion of Sofia Coppola’s remake of The Beguiled in 2017, which started with $229,229 in four theaters and then grossed $3.16 million in 674 theaters. That film jumped up to its widest release the following week into 941 theaters and ultimately finished with $10.7 million. A24’s very first opening weekend wide launch was The Witch, which grossed $8.8 million in 2,046 theaters and finished with $25.13 million.In other limited news, Bong Joon-Ho’s Parasite (Certified Fresh at 99%) continued to stay strong as it expanded into 129 theaters with $1.81 million. Comparing to similar platforming strategies, it is certainly in some great company. Boogie Nights went from 30-to-124 theaters in weekend three and grossed $1.8 million. Here are others in Parasite’s realm:There Will Be Blood (51-to-129 screens): $1.86 millionBoyhood (34-to-107 screens): $1.76 millionThank You For Smoking (54-to-126 screens): $1.60 millionThe Farewell (35-to-135 screens): $1.51 millionThe Theory of Everything (44-to-140 screens): $1.51 millionAn Inconvenient Truth (77-to-122 screens): $1.5 millionRevolutionary Road (38-to-135 screens): $1.42 millionInto the Wild (33-to-135 screens): $1.27 millionThe lowest-grossing film on that list overall was The Farewell with $17.67 million.Finally,&nbsp;we’re looking at the second weekend of Taika Waititi’s Jojo Rabbit, which added another 50 theaters to last week’s launch of just five and grossed $1.04 million. That is right in line with Jason Reitman’s Thank You For Smoking, which Fox Searchlight saw gross $1,003,911 in 54 theaters after a $262,923 launch in five theaters. Other Fox Searchlight releases along these lines include Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri, which made $1,102,166 in 53 theaters after a $322,168 start in four theaters, and Birdman, which made&nbsp;$1.37 million (50 theaters) after $424,397 (four theaters).&nbsp;Jojo Rabbit is up to $1.5 million after 10 days of release.This Time Last Year: Halloween&nbsp;Wins Halloween WeekendThe pre-Halloween weekend in 2018 was won by (what else?) David Gordon Green’s Halloween,&nbsp;which earned&nbsp;$31.4 million in its second weekend, crossing the $125 million line. A Star is Born was second with $14.03 million and Venom finished third with $10.65 million. The only newcomer to enter the top 10 was the Gerard Butler submarine thriller, Hunter Killer, which opened to just $6.65 million. Johnny English Strikes Again and the faith-based Indivisible opened in less than 1,000 theaters and grossed just $1.63 million and $1.50 million, respectively; Jonah Hill’s mid90s was expanded into 1,206 theaters and held the&nbsp;number 10 spot with $2.98 million. The&nbsp;top 10 films grossed a total of $90.99 million and averaged an even 65% on the Tomatometer; this year’s&nbsp;top 10 grossed $89.88 million and averaged 55%.On the Vine: He Said He’d Be BackThe holiday movie season officially begins and one film should have no problem ruling them all:&nbsp;Terminator: Dark Fate is primed to lead the way with both Arnold Schwarzenegger and Linda Hamilton returning to the franchise. The movie is already earning solid reviews, particularly when compared to the previous sequels; its current Tomatometer score is 65%. Dark Fate&nbsp;started with $12.8 million overseas in 10 territories this weekend. The holiday season also means it is awards season and a couple of Oscar wannabes begin their runs next week: Edward Norton’s Motherless Brooklyn&nbsp;and&nbsp;Harriet with Cynthia Erivo as Harriet Tubman. Finally there is Entertainment Studios’ first animated release, Arctic Dogs, featuring the voice work of Jeremy Renner, James Franco, and Alec Baldwin, which is expected to be on the low end of animated openings.The Full Top 10:&nbsp;October&nbsp;25-27Joker (2019)  68% – $18.9 million ($277.58 million total)Maleficent: Mistress of Evil (2019)  39% – $18.54 million ($65.41 million total)The Addams Family (2019)  45% – $11.71 million ($72.8 million total)Zombieland: Double Tap (2019)  69% – $11.6 million ($47 million total)Countdown (2019)  26% – $9.01 million ($9.01 million total)Black and Blue (2019)  52% – $8.33 million ($8.33 million total)Gemini Man (2019)  26% – $4 million ($43.34 million total)The Lighthouse (2019)  90% – $3.08&nbsp;million ($3.66 million total)The Current War: Director's Cut (2019)  60% – $2.73 million ($2.73 million total)Abominable (2019)  82% – $2 million ($56.82 million total)Erik Childress can be heard each week evaluating box office on WGN Radio with Nick Digilio as well as on Business First AM with Angela Miles and his Movie Madness Podcast.[box office figures via Box Office Mojo]Like this?

With many consumers still wary of heading to the local multiplex after last week’s shooting tragedy, no compelling new releases hitting the screens, and the start of the London Olympics, momentum slowed down to a crawl with the Top 20 sliding down to only $133M – a low amount for July which is usually one of the busiest months of the year.Following its massive opening weekend – the best ever for a 2D-only movie – The Dark Knight Rises fell an understandable 60% to an estimated $64.1M. It was larger than the 53% fall that its predecessor suffered four years ago in July 2008 but threequels often fade faster thanks to more upfront business. Warner Bros. did, however, hope that those that skipped seeing the film last weekend because of the Colorado shooting might help solidify the picture over this frame. But the decline was about what would be expected for the third chapter of a mega-franchise. Core comic book and action fans have been coming out, but some of the broader audience not as attached to the franchise are feeling less excitement now and have dropped out.Still, Rises has amassed a mammoth $289.1M in only ten days making for the third best ten-day start of any film in history after just The Avengers ($373.1M) and The Dark Knight ($313.8M). TDKR has even landed in the list of all-time domestic blockbusters at number 50. TV ratings were huge for Friday night’s opening ceremonies of the Olympics and Rises, like all films, took a hit on that day. But sales bounced back well on Saturday for the broader marketplace.Studios usually see the Summer Games as formidable competition especially if the host city is not halfway around the world allowing for more live coverage. In 1996 when the U.S. hosted the Games in Atlanta, Hollywood took the bold move of starting the summer movie season earlier to get an extra week of playtime. Warner Bros. unleashed the disaster hit Twister on May 10 and went on to collect $241.9M beating out the $181M of what was supposed to be the summer kickoff film Mission: Impossible. At its current trajectory, The Dark Knight Rises could end its domestic run in the $440-450M range which would still be an impressive number seven all-time.Overseas, TDKR launched in 40 new territories against the Olympics and grossed an estimated $122.1M this weekend from 57 total markets. That brought the international cume to $248.2M and the global tally to a stunning $537.3M after just the second weekend. Like the Joker film before it, the Bane flick should still be able to break the $1 billion mark in global box office thanks to growth from overseas markets.Following a hard sophomore slide, Ice Age: Continental Drift settled in for a commendable 35% dip in its third weekend and held onto second place with an estimated $13.3M raising the 17-day sum to $114.8M. It was the smallest third-weekend gross for any film in the animated franchise as the others each did $17-20M despite lower ticket prices. The Fox fourquel is on course to reach the neighborhood of $150M from the domestic market – also the lowest in the series. Overseas has been a different story where the franchise continues to grow stronger. Drift pulled in an estimated $49.4M internationally helped by big Asian debuts in China, Korea, and India boosting the offshore tally to a staggering $514.1M and the worldwide haul to $628.9M with a whopping 82% coming from outside of North America. As with the last chapter, the $800M global mark should be broken.Opening to poor results in third place was the sci-fi buddy comedy The Watch which managed to take in an estimated $13M from 3,168 theaters for a dull $4,104 average. Starring Ben Stiller, Vince Vaughn, and Jonah Hill, the R-rated pic about a group of suburban men who start a neighborhood watch only to discover that aliens have invaded their town came in well below many of the debuts that the individual stars have seen in past projects. Critics panned the Fox release and links in the news media between the film and the neighborhood watch killing of Trayvon Martin earlier this year didn’t help.Stiller is coming off of the so-so debut of the all-star comedy Tower Heist from last November as well as 2010’s franchise flick Little Fockers which was the lowest-grossing in that series. Vaughn’s The Dilemma from last year also opened poorly following a string of studio hits. Hill is hot this year thanks to his Oscar nod and spring hit 21 Jump Street, but the starpower from the cast failed to drive in business this time. Males made up the primary audience for Watch accounting for 60% of the crowd while 59% were 25 and older. With the final Batman pic also playing to adult men, competition was fierce and the start of the Olympics also provided a distraction for sports fans. Moviegoers were not impressed with what they got as the CinemaScore grade was only a C+ signaling a lousy road ahead.It’s been a tough summer for R-rated comedies with The Watch following the dismal debut of Adam Sandler’s That’s My Boy and Sacha Baron Cohen’s The Dictator not faring too well either. Each carried a high price tag for a comedy and The Watch is estimated to have cost nearly $70M to produce. This has been in stark contrast to last summer when The Hangover 2, Bridesmaids, Horrible Bosses, and Bad Teacher all broke the $100M mark keeping adult audiences laughing all season. Seth MacFarlane’s Ted has been the only standout hit this summer and Will Ferrell and Zach Galifianakis hope to score a hit in two weeks with their political comedy The Campaign.Generating the smallest opening of the four-picture franchise, the 3D dance drama Step Up Revolution debuted in fourth with an estimated $11.8M from 2,567 locations for a mild $4,597 average. The PG-13 pic which moves the dancing-will-save-my-life concept to Miami played young and female like its predecessors with studio research showing that the crowd was 64% female, and 71% under 25. The CinemaScore was a moderate B+. Disney handled the first three Step Up films domestically while Summit released them overseas where substantial growth has been seen with recent installments. Summit, now part of Lionsgate, is handling the new chapter worldwide. Revolution bowed 25% below the $15.8M opening of the last film Step Up 3D from August 2010 and 43% behind the $20.7M of the first chapter which starred Channing Tatum. Reviews were mostly negative.The hit comedy Ted still ranked in the top five in its fifth weekend with an estimated $7.4M, off just 26%. The year’s top-grossing comedy has collected $193.6M for Universal to date. Sony’s super hero reboot The Amazing Spider-Man followed with an estimated $6.8M, down 38%, for a $242.1M cume. The worldwide tally now stands at $654.8M.Brave, 2012’s highest-grossing toon domestically, declined by just 30% to an estimated $4.2M boosting the total to $217.3M from North America and $309.3M worldwide for Disney. Channing Tatum’s latest hit Magic Mike fell 40% to an estimated $2.6M and has banked $107.6M thus far. Tatum has been on fire this year and has anchored three different $100M+ grossers over a six-month period. None were sequels or animated films and all had reasonable budgets making him a moneymaking machine.Rounding out the top ten were mature-skewing films from notable filmmakers. Oliver Stone’s Savages dropped 47% to an estimated $1.8M while Wes Anderson’s Moonrise Kingdom dipped only 24% to an estimated $1.4M. Totals stand at $43.9M for Universal and $38.4M for its subsidiary Focus.It was an active weekend in the specialty marketplace. The indie comedy Ruby Sparks opened well with an estimated $152,000 from 13 sites for a solid $11,683 average. The latest film from the directors of the Oscar-winning Little Miss Sunshine collected $192,000 since its Wednesday debut and expands Friday into 20 more markets. Reviews were positive.Proving again that NC-17 films can book theaters, buy ads in mainstream media, and connect with paying audiences, Matthew McConaughey’s new hit man drama Killer Joe bowed to an estimated $38,000 from just three locations averaging $12,621 for LD Entertainment. Sony Classics generated a $9,511 average from three playdates for its new rock documentary Searching for Sugar Man which grossed an estimated $29,000 this weekend.The top ten films grossed an estimated $126.4M which was down 25% from last year when Cowboys &amp; Aliens opened at number one with $36.4M; and down 2% from 2010 when Inception debuted on top with $27.5M.Follow Gitesh on Twitter.","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"WarnerMedia, your, universal, films, Food, ABC, nfl, Us","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-Dark-Knight-Leads-Sluggish-Frame"},{"id":"47509084571053","title":"Weekend Box Office Results: Audiences Went to The Next Level for Jumanji","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Weekend Box Office Results: Audiences Went to The Next Level for JumanjiPlus, Frozen II and Knives Out hang on, while Richard Jewell and Black Christmas fail to make an impact on the weekend of December 13-15.by Erik Childress | December 15, 2019 |  CommentsMovie audiences went to The Next Level this weekend, literally. The third Jumanji film was the clear victor, garnering the second-best opening of the holiday season to date with the further promise of solid returns through the Christmas vacation. Adult fare, on the other hand, hit the wall this week, unable to draw even $10 million between them as many may have chosen to avoid controversy and politics as part of their escapism. That said, there might still be interest in another film with those themes coming down the pike.Recommended: The 50 Highest-Grossing Movies of All TimeRecommended: All 44 Billion-Dollar Movies, Ranked by TomatometerRecommended: 2019 Holiday Box Office PreviewRecommended: Fresher Movies Make More Money at the Box Office: a Tomatometer Deep DiveKing of the Crop:&nbsp;Jumanji Destroys the Competition(Photo by Sony Pictures)Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle opened on a Wednesday, five days after the release of Star Wars: The Last Jedi, and in its first five days, it grossed $52.77 million. Jumanji: The Next Level took just three days to make $60 million, way ahead of its ultra-conservative estimates of just $35 million. That may only be the 13th&nbsp;best start for a film in the month of December, but if it follows suit with the other films like it,&nbsp;The Next Level should pass $200 million with no issue. Sony has a much higher number in mind, given that Jungle had the second-best December multiple of all time (after Avatar) when it earned 11.18 times its opening Fri-Sun weekend, amounting to over $400 million domestic. Another $557 million internationally gave the film enough ($962 million) to place among the Top 50 grossing films ever; a spot it is likely to relinquish soon after The Rise of Skywalker opens. Can The Next Level&nbsp;reach the $300 million level? Only 12 other films to have started in December (including the limited release of American Sniper, which broke through in January) have done it. Four are Lord of the Rings/Hobbit films, three are Star Wars, two are from James Cameron, and the others are Aquaman and Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle. Budgeted at $125 million,&nbsp;The Next Level’s global total currently stands at $113 million and will have no problem turning a profit for Sony.Rotten Returns:&nbsp;Richard Jewell and&nbsp;Black Christmas Fail to Make an Impact‘Tis the season not to release films about terrorist bombings and serial killers. It is hard to say whether or not the accompanying controversy over the portrayal of a journalist in Richard Jewell really kept people away, but a Clint Eastwood film without a big star at its center (like Tom Hanks, Bradley Cooper or… Clint Eastwood) is normally not a big draw. The last Eastwood film without any of those faces in front of the camera to gross over $50 million was 2003’s Mystic River. But the last of his films to open as weak as Jewell ($5 million) was, ironically, True Crime, back in 1999. Eastwood the actor only drew a $5.27 million opening for that February release, which went on to gross just $16.64 million. His Best Picture&nbsp;nominee, Letters from Iwo Jima, made just $13.75 million. Jewell may still find itself grossing over $20 million, but it will rank as one of the lowest-grossing wide releases of his career and one of the bigger losers, given its $45 million budget.Then there is Black Christmas, the second remake of Bob Clark’s first great Christmas film from 1974. The 2006 remake opened to just $3.72 million and finished with $16.27 million. The 2019 version did not do much better, with a $4.4 million start after what turned out to be an against-the-odds projection of $10-12 million. Horror has not been a popular genre to release in December, and the numbers show why. Going all the way back to 1981, only three horror films have opened to more than $10 million in December (Scream 2, Krampus, and the 1998 remake of Psycho) and only four horror films have grossed over $30 million (Scream, Scream 2, Krampus, and Dracula 2000.) In Blumhouse fashion, the budget for Black Christmas was only $5 million, so it is not some major financial disaster, but if it fails to reach the $16 million benchmark set by the 2006 remake (Rotten at 14%), that has to stand as a big disappointment.The Top 10 and Beyond:&nbsp;Frozen II Hangs on,&nbsp;Uncut Gems and&nbsp;Bombshell Are Solid in Limited TheatersThe champion of the past three weeks fell to second place, as&nbsp;Frozen II missed becoming the 45th&nbsp;film to gross more than $20 million in its fourth weekend of wide release, though its $19.18 million raised its tally to $366.54 million, which is the 19th&nbsp;best ever after 24 days. That’s about $9 million higher than The Hunger Games: Catching Fire had back in 2013, when it was the original Frozen’s November partner in grossing $400 million. Frozen II’s fourth weekend is also around $6 million more so we should expect no less than $430 million domestic in its pocket by the end of its run. Most importantly, though, Frozen II has become Disney’s 6th&nbsp;film this year to cross the billion-dollar mark which makes it the 38th highest-grossing film ever, and it will ultimately join the Top 25. The original Frozen currently ranks 15th,&nbsp;with $1.274 billion. Frozen II is only $242 million behind right now.Then we have two films making their runs toward $100 million. Ford v Ferrari is nearly there after another $4.14 million this weekend. Its total stands at $98.2 million domestic, but it is the $175 million global tally that lingers for Fox, as that is still around $75 million behind where it needs to be to recoup its costs. Rian Johnson’s Knives Out is already into profit for Lionsgate and is now just trying to leg it out to the milestone. With $78.8 million so far, the murder mystery is hitching a ride on the numbers that Creed had at this point, within a million behind of both it’s 19-day tally and its third weekend. Creed finished with $109 million. That is a number that Ferrari is also headed towards and even with Knives a few million behind its pace it looks like it should still cross the finish line and may even pass Ferrari worldwide as it currently has $162 million.Benny and Josh Safdie’s Uncut Gems (92%) with Adam Sandler had a stellar showing in just five theaters grossing $525,498. While that is the second best per-theater-average of the year ($105,099) behind just Bong Joon-ho’s Parasite ($128,072 in each of three theaters), it is the fourth-best ever for a film released in five theaters. Only La La Land ($881,104), The Master ($736,311), and Brokeback Mountain ($547,425) opened better. Gems also just missed a personal best PTA for A24, passing such notable titles as Lady Bird ($91,109) and this year’s The Farewell ($88,916), but was just behind Moonlight ($100,519) as the all-time champion. We will see if the estimates come out higher on Monday. The studio’s $50,000+ PTAs have all grossed at least $7.3 million. The Safdies’ last film, Good Time with Robert Pattinson, grossed a total of $2.02 million.The list of four-theater openings is a little steeper, but Jay Roach’s Bombshell nevertheless had a solid showing this weekend. With $312,000 the Fox News sexual harassment expose became the 15th&nbsp;best opening within that group ahead. Among the top 15 films in that group, 11 of them were nominated for Best Picture (with The Farewell TBD) including the aforementioned American Sniper (the all-time champ with $873,667) and Moonlight, which went on to win the Oscar, as did Birdman ($424,397).Terrence Malick’s latest, A Hidden Life, had a less than great showing with just $52,000 in five theaters. That comes between his last two narrative releases, Song to Song ($50,559 / Rotten at 43%) and Knight of Cups ($60,551 / Rotten at 47%), which were only in four theaters initially. A Hidden Life’s PTA ($10,400) is the director’s third lowest since his return to cinema in 1998 with The Thin Red Line and could be second lowest if the estimates fall.&nbsp;This has to be cited as a big disappointment for Fox Searchlight, who released the three-hour film&nbsp;featuring his first positive score with critics (78%) since The Tree of Life in 2011.This Time Last Year:&nbsp;Spider-Verse&nbsp;Swings into First Place(Photo by Sony Pictures Animation)The Oscar winner for Best Animated Feature first took the #1 spot at the box office this weekend. Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse opened to $35.36 million, doubling the take by Clint Eastwood’s The Mule, which began with $17.50 million. In turn, Eastwood’s film more than doubled the start of Mortal Engines ($7.55 million) which ultimately barely doubled its opening weekend to become one of the biggest bombs of 2018. Both Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald and Ralph Breaks the Internet passed $150 million, and Creed II got over $100 million. James Wan’s Aquaman earned $2.9 million in special previews and that was good enough to grab the tenth slot on the list. Barry Jenkins’ If Beale Street Could Talk opened to $224,476 in four theaters, which amounted to the eighth best per-theater-average of the year. The Top Ten films grossed $101.64 million and averaged 67% on the Tomatometer.This year’s Top Ten grossed an estimated $112.24 Million and averaged 76.7% with critics.On the Vine:&nbsp;Jumanji&nbsp;Is Back, Along with a Slew of Awards Hopefuls(Photo by © Lucasfilm)The week fans both young and old have been waiting decades for is finally here: The big-screen adaptation of Andrew Lloyd Webber’s Cats arrives to storm the box office with its blend of live-action FX wizardry and angel-like lyrics. All kidding aside, while that all remains to be seen, it is also the week that the Skywalker Saga comes to an end. For years, fans all over the world have been anticipating the conclusion of the nine-film arc that George Lucas hinted at so many years ago. And now Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker, Episode IX of the series, arrives and will undoubtedly be one of the biggest hits of 2019 and ultimately give Disney its 7th&nbsp;billion-dollar film of the year and push their grosses to over $11 billion.The Full Top 10: December&nbsp;13-15Jumanji: The Next Level (2019)  71% – $60.1 million ($60.1 million total)Frozen II (2019)  78% – $19.18 million ($366.54 million total)Knives Out (2019)  97% – $9.25 million ($78.91 million total)Richard Jewell (2019)  77% – $5&nbsp;million ($5 million total)Black Christmas (2019)  39% – $4.42 million ($4.42 million total)Ford v Ferrari (2019)  92% – $4.14 million ($98.12 million total)Queen &amp; Slim (2019)  83% – $3.6 million ($33.17 million total)A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood (2019)  95% – $3.35 million ($49.32 million total)Dark Waters (2019)  89% – $2 ($8.89 million total)21 Bridges (2019)  53% – $1.19 million ($26.36 million total)Erik Childress can be heard each week evaluating box office on WGN Radio with Nick Digilio as well as on Business First AM with Angela Miles and his Movie Madness Podcast.[box office figures via Box Office Mojo]Like this?

What a wonderful kind of day!\" as he laughs all the way to the bank the weekend of October 4-6.by Erik Childress | October 6, 2019 |  CommentsThere is no surprise just how well Todd Phillips’ Batman villain spinoff, Joker, did at the box office. Ticket buyers showed up in anticipation and curiosity on what the director of The Hangover&nbsp;trilogy would bring to the iconic villain, last portrayed by Jared Leto in Suicide Squad. Of course, it was Heath Ledger’s take that won the Oscar in Christopher Nolan’s The Dark Knight.&nbsp;Is&nbsp;Joaquin Phoenix in the running for one as well?King&nbsp;of the Crop:&nbsp;Joker&nbsp;Puts A Smile On&nbsp;(Photo by Niko Tavernise / © Warner Bros. / courtesy Everett Collection)Joker can already claim a few October victories: Its $39 million Friday beat the record set by 2018’s Halloween, which started with $33 million. Then Joker&nbsp;bested the all-time October weekend record ($93.50 million) set also last year by&nbsp;Venom ($80.25 million), along with Venom‘s&nbsp;Thursday previews top standing ($10 million) by grossing $13.3 million.Joker is the 77th film to open to $90 million or higher. Not one of them failed to reach at least $200 million and only 11 failed to reach $250 million, including It: Chapter Two which is not going to make it. Believe it or not, of the 206 films&nbsp;to gross over $200 million, only 17 have been rated R — a list that includes two Deadpools, two Its and a pair of Hangovers,&nbsp;directed by&nbsp;Joker‘s Todd Phillips.&nbsp;&nbsp;Fresh Surprise:&nbsp;War, What Is It Good For? Well…(Photo by Yash Raj Films / courtesy Everett Collection)Two Asian films did very well in limited release. Siddharth Anand’s War grossed $1.58 million in just 305 theaters, good enough to finish in the Top Ten. Then My People, My Country came really close, finishing 11th with $865,000 in just 70 theaters for the third highest per-theater-average in the Top Ten behind Joker and Pedro Almodovar’s Pain and Glory which grossed $160,087 in four theaters. Compare those numbers to another notable limited release this week…Rotten Returns:&nbsp;Lucy in the Sky Gets No Piece of the Pie(Photo by Fox Searchlight Pictures. All rights reserved. / courtesy Everett Collection)Not doing well at all in limited release is Fox Searchlight’s Lucy in the Sky, which earned $55,000 in 37 theaters this weekend. &nbsp;Lucy’s $1,486 per theater average is bad enough to make Fox Searchlight’s worst ten PTAs of all-time. Currently 10th (out of the nearly 190 films in their history) if the estimates don’t get worse, it’s a list that includes the likes of this year’s Tolkien; Lucia, Lucia; Miss March; Whiteboyz; Jean-Marc Vallee’s Demolition; Richard Linklater’s Fast Food Nation; The Art of Getting By; Wilson; and Alex Proyas’ Garage DaysThe Top Ten and Beyond:&nbsp;Abominable,&nbsp;Ad Astra,&nbsp;Rambo: Last Blood Struggling(Photo by Universal Pictures)Last week’s #1 family offering, Abominable, dropped 41.8% to second place this week with $12 million. With $37.8 million total after ten days, that puts it between 1998’s Antz ($35.6 million) and 2012’s Rise of the Guardians ($38.4 million). Those films legged out to&nbsp;$90.7 and $103.4 million totals, respectively.&nbsp;Abominable&nbsp;will instead close out similarly to&nbsp;The Lego Ninjago Movie&nbsp;with a final estimate between $60-65 million. That’s well behind Smallfoot’s $83 million last year. The film has only made an additional $10.3 million overseas so far which is not great for the $75 million production and is likely to become Universal’s first red mark since Little in April.As mentioned, It Chapter Two joined the ranks of the $200 million club this weekend with its $5m pick-up. In other pending milestone news, Hustlers has the 11th best total for a September release after 24 days, earning $6m this weekend, and is headed for somewhere around $105-110 million. Downton Abbey may be out of range to join the $100 million club, with $8 million this weekend, but it is primed to best the $83 million grossed by Brokeback Mountain to become Focus Features’ all-time domestic grosser.&nbsp;&nbsp;Roadside’s&nbsp;Judy&nbsp;with Renee Zellweger jumped from 461 theaters to 1,458, grossing $4.4 million.In less promising news, Fox’s Ad Astra has just about hit the wall in North America with a $4 million weekend, and is limping its way to $50 million. The film would still need another $128 million to break even based on its most conservative cost estimates. Rambo: Last Blood is not doing much better, but also cost less. With $64 million worldwide, after a $3 million domestic gain this weekend, the film still needs around another $86 million to get into the black.This Time Last Year:&nbsp;Venom‘s Big Wind-Turdlin’ Debut!(Photo by Columbia / courtesy Everett Collection)Last year, October kicked off with the biggest top ten haul of all-time this month. Similarly, it also kicked off with a big comic book spinoff – albeit from Marvel – as Venom opened to the biggest October weekend of all time with $80.2 million.&nbsp;But hold on: Bradley Cooper’s A Star is Born opened as well. Even though it finished second with a strong $42.9 million it would go on to outgross Venom: $215 million versus $213m. The Fathom event broadcast of the Met Opera Aida actually grossed enough on just Saturday night to finish tenth overall with $1.18 million.&nbsp;On the Vine: A Family of Addams, A Sassy Siri, A Parasite &amp; A Tale of Two Will Smiths(Photo by Paramount Pictures / courtesy Everett Collection)The best chance to unseat Joker next weekend rides with not one, but two Will Smiths in Ang Lee sci-fi actioner, Gemini Man. Meanwhile, United Artists does not appear to be expecting great notices for their animated version of The Addams Family. It has been 28 years since the last live-action version of the television theaters hit theaters.&nbsp;The Hangover writers and Bad Moms directors, Jon Lucas &amp; Scott Moore, will try to pull off a wacky version of Spike Jonze’s Her with the Adam Devine-starring&nbsp;Jexi.&nbsp; Otherwise, you’ll&nbsp;find&nbsp;Bong Joon-Ho’s Parasite&nbsp;opening in limited release next week.&nbsp;The Full Top 10:&nbsp;October 4–6Joker (2019)  68% – $93.50 million ($93.50 million total)Abominable (2019)  82% –&nbsp;$12.00 million ($37.83 million total)Downton Abbey (2019)  84% – $8.00 million ($73.62 million total)Hustlers (2019)  87% – $6.30 million ($91.32 million total)It Chapter Two (2019)  62% – $5.35 million ($202.20 million total)Ad Astra (2019)  83% – &nbsp;$4.1554 million ($43.66 million total)Judy (2019)  81% – &nbsp;$4.44 million ($8.90 million total)Rambo: Last Blood (2019)  26%&nbsp;– $3.55 million ($39.82 million total)War (2019)  69% – $1.58 million ($2.08 million total)Good Boys (2019)  80%&nbsp;– $900,000 ($82.04 million total)Erik Childress can be heard each week evaluating box office on WGN Radio with Nick Digilio as well as on Business First AM with Angela Miles and his Movie Madness Podcast.[box office figures via Box Office Mojo]Like this?

Three new films failed to make any significant dent into the marketplace while the political documentary 2016 Obama’s America enjoyed a strong national expansion jumping into the top ten. Sylvester Stallone’s action sequel The Expendables 2 topped the charts for the second straight weekend as holdovers took up the top six chart positions. It’s been ten years since the weekend before the Labor Day frame saw such poor grosses from new releases and the first time all year that no film opened in the top five. With people salvaging the last days of their summer vacations, football back for pre-season action, and very few must-see films in theaters, audiences stayed away as the total weekend box office failed to crack $100M for the first time in 2012.\n\n\nThe macho heroes of The Expendables 2 did what they did two years ago — control the number one spot for two weekends in a row. The R-rated actioner grossed an estimated $13.5M and was the only movie to break double digit millions. Lionsgate saw a 53% decline which was good for an action sequel and boosted its ten-day gross to $52.3M. The first Expendables had a bigger debut and then dropped by 51% in its sophomore session for a ten-day tally of $65.4M. Produced for $90M, Expendables 2 seems on course to finish its domestic run in the vicinity of $80M.\n\n\nHolding steady in second place was Universal’s own action sequel ","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"New, Dark, serial, Mary, and, america, strong, drama, Arts, canceled, Pixar","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-Expendables-Tops-Slow-Weekend"},{"id":"47509090606568","title":"Weekend Box Office Results: Halloween Continues Hot Streak With $32 Million Second Weekend","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Weekend Box Office Results: Halloween Continues Hot Streak With $32 Million Second WeekendMichael Myers is proving as hard to kill at the box office as he is in the movies. Plus, Suspiria breaks a 2018 record on the weekend of October 26-28by Erik Childress | October 28, 2018 |  Comments(Photo by © Universal Pictures)Until this year there were only ever six films&nbsp;to open in October and gross $150 million or more. And never two within the same year. 2018 is going to see three. Venom is already there and approaching $200 million. A Star is Born will be crossing the line this week and&nbsp;the no. 1 film for the second weekend in a row,&nbsp;Halloween, could be there by the end of next weekend, having earned $32 million this weekend. Those are pretty extraordinary numbers, particularly with two of the films having opened on the same weekend.King of the&nbsp;New Crop:&nbsp;Halloween&nbsp;Targets&nbsp;Get Out for&nbsp;Blumhouse RecordDavid Gordon Green’s Halloween led the box office for a second straight week, and has now made $126.6 million in its first 10 days. Could the movie&nbsp;pass Get Out&nbsp;($176 million domestically) to become Blumhouse’s highest domestic grosser, and could it reach the $200 million mark? With an October 31 bump, and horror still on people’s minds, it does have a chance. Of the 11 films to gross between $123 million and $129 million in their first 10 days, eight of them&nbsp;reached $200 million:&nbsp;The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug,&nbsp;Maleficent,&nbsp;WALL-E,&nbsp;Mission: Impossible – Fallout,&nbsp;National Treasure: Book of Secrets,&nbsp;World War Z,&nbsp;Superman Returns,&nbsp;and&nbsp;Spectre. Venom was at $142 million on its 10th&nbsp;day ($14 million ahead of Halloween) and is going to reach $200 million with little fuss, with a current total of $187 million.Rotten Returns: Gerard Butler’s Submarine Thriller Goes Undetected By Audiences(Photo by Jack English /© Summit Entertainment /Courtesy Everett Collection)The lowest opening Gerard Butler has ever had with a film&nbsp;bowing in more than 2,500 theaters was the romantic comedy, Playing for Keeps. It started with $5.7 million in 2,837 theaters. The submarine thriller, Hunter Killer, which sits at&nbsp;36% on the Tomatometer, made just $6.6 million this weekend in 2,728 theaters for a $2,419 per-theater-average. Playing for Keeps posted a $2,027 average and Guy Ritchie’s Rocknrolla, in which Butler also starred,&nbsp;posted a $2,267 average. Elsewhere this weekend, PureFlix’s faith-based Indivisible (64% on the Tomatometer) made just $1.5 million in 830 theaters, which was the distributor’s smallest&nbsp;opening weekend since last year’s A Question of Faith was released in 661 theaters to a cool $1 million.The Rest of the Top 10 and Beyond:&nbsp;Suspiria&nbsp;Earns 2018’s Highest Per-Theater-Average(Photo by @ Amazon Studios)Bradley Cooper’s A Star is Born continues its impressive run. The film has now earned $148 million in 24 days,&nbsp;putting it between 2012 and The LEGO Batman Movie on the all-time chart for earnings at this stage of its run, which suggests a final gross between $166 million and $175 million. Though you can expect a more likely final total&nbsp;between $176 and $188 million. Its worldwide total is up to $253 million. Venom, meanwhile,&nbsp;has earned over $186 million in the same timeframe, which places it between The Da Vinci Code and National Treasure: Book of Secrets&nbsp;at this point in its release, giving it a final estimate of $217-$219 million. Its worldwide total stands at $508 million.Johnny English Strikes Again (32% on the Tomatometer) did not make the&nbsp;top 10 this week, making $1.6 million – albeit in just 544 theaters. (That’s a better per-theater-average than Hunter Killer and Indivisible.) But the film has already topped over $100 million worldwide, which is more than can be said of Universal’s First Man, which is now sitting at&nbsp;$74 million worldwide ($37.8 million of which has been earned in the U.S.). Jonah Hill’s directorial debut, Mid90s (Certified Fresh at 78%),&nbsp;cracked the top 10 with $3 million after expanding to 1,206 theaters. That $2,487 per-theater-average is a far cry from last week’s $58,000 per-theater-average, earned from&nbsp;four theaters, which was the sixth best in A24’s history. Its total take now stands at $3.3 million.Amazon’s Beautiful Boy with Steve Carell and Timothée Chalamet was upped to 190 theaters and grossed $592,000 for a total of $1.4 million. It will expand&nbsp;nationwide next weekend. Fox Searchlight’s Can You Ever Forgive Me?, starring Oscar hopeful Melissa McCarthy – one of the year’s best-reviewed movies, with a 99% Tomatometer score – moved into 25 theaters and grossed $380,000 for a total of $610,000.&nbsp;Fox Searchlight&nbsp;also expanded David Lowery’s The Old Man &amp; The Gun with Robert Redford into another 240 theaters (1,042 total); the film grossed $1.8 million for a total of $7.2 million.Finally, Luca Guadagnino’s remake of Dario Argento’s Suspiria (69% on the Tomatometer)&nbsp;opened in just two theaters and grossed a huge $179,000. Its $89,500 per-theater-average is the highest of 2018, surpassing Eighth Grade, which had a $65,949&nbsp;per-theater-average from four theaters on its first weekend. The number up there with some of the biggest-ever two-theater openings, such as Aladdin ($196,664), Evita ($195,085), The Nightmare Before Christmas ($191,232), and There Will Be Blood ($190,739)This Time Last Year:&nbsp;Jigsaw&nbsp;Marked a Grand, But Short-lived, Return for the&nbsp;Saw Franchise(Photo by © Lionsgate /courtesy Everett Collection)The final week of October 2017 featured the return of the Saw franchise with Jigsaw. Though it opened at no. 1 with $16.6 million, audiences&nbsp;virtually ignored it for the rest of its run, making it the second lowest-grossing film in the series with just over $38 million total. (Saw VI grossed just $27.4 million in 2009 after the Paranormal Activity series replaced Saw as the go-to franchise for the Halloween season.) On the other hand, Jigsaw’s opening number was better than the combined final grosses of the Certified Fresh&nbsp;Thank You For Service ($3.8 million opening / $9.5 million total) and George Clooney’s Rotten&nbsp;Suburbicon ($2.8 million opening / $5.7 million total). The weekend’s&nbsp;top 10 grossed a total just shy of $57.9 million and averaged 55.2% on the Tomatometer; this year’s&nbsp;top 10 grossed an estimated $92.1 million with an average Tomatometer score of 64.9%.On the Vine: Queen Biopic vs.&nbsp;Nutracker&nbsp;Adaption: Who Will Be Champion?(Photo by © 20th Century Fox)It’s the tale of departing directors next weekend, starting with Bryan Singer’s (and Dexter Fletcher’s) tale of Freddie Mercury and Queen. Bohemian Rhapsody will likely shoot to the&nbsp;no. 1&nbsp;spot and Fox is hoping to draw enough attention to Rami Malek’s performance as Mercury to make him a serious awards contender. Disney’s The Nutcracker and the Four Realms from Lasse Hallström (and Joe Johnston) may be more in the A Wrinkle in Time&nbsp;/Alice Through the Looking Glass&nbsp;realm for the studio of the box office.

First, the box office tracking services seriously underestimated the growing word-of-mouth of&nbsp;A Star is Born&nbsp;after its raves at film festivals. On top of that, sure, the glass-half-full will point to Venom having the biggest opening ever for an October release — even better than&nbsp;those same services were predicting for it weeks ago — but it could&nbsp;become an example of winning the battle but ultimately losing the war.King of the Crop: Venom Breaks Individual Records, But&nbsp;Its Future Is Uncertain(Photo by Sony Pictures Entertainment)So let’s examine Venom and see if it truly exists in a half-empty glass. Until this weekend, Paranormal Activity 3 had the highest Friday opening ever in October with $26.3 million. Despite Gravity pulling in nearly $9 million less on its opening day, by the end of its weekend it became the best 3-day October opening of all-time. Venom made $32.3 million on Friday and spawned a final estimated 3-day of $80 million. That is $25 million higher than Gravity. Big for October, sure. Big for a Marvel property, not so much. Now, Marvel has never opened a film in October before so even if it opened to an Ang-Lee-Hulk-like $65 million (as was initially projected) they still have an October record nearly $25 million greater than the biggest release ever this month (Gravity’s $274 million.) Is Venom really headed for that kind of word-of-mouth?The Tomatometer currently reads 32% for Venom. That is the 9th&nbsp;worst score of Marvel properties&nbsp;since 2000, down there with The Punishers&nbsp;and the Ghost Riders. On the other hand, only two films ever to open with higher than $75 million (Fifty Shades of Grey and X-Men Origins: Wolverine) failed to reach $200 million. That would get the reported $100 million production nearly halfway to hitting the $450 million target it needs to break even. However, among the 20 Marvel titles since 1998’s Blade&nbsp;to fail to reach $250 million internationally are the ten worst-reviewed films of the bunch – including X-Men Origins: Wolverine. Venom may be bucking this trend by making half that this weekend with $125 million overseas. The Predator is currently establishing the new multiple low for a film to open on over 4,000 screens. Will Venom challenge that? We will be examining Venom’s progress week-to-week. In the meantime, Sony and Ruben Fleischer can enjoy this victory.Fresh Surprise: A Star Is Born, Cooper and Gaga In It For The Long Haul(Photo by Warner Bros. Pictures)Even on the heels of raves at film festivals, Bradley Cooper’s A Star is Born&nbsp;was being projected for a $25 million opening. That was ludicrous then and even moreso now, as it is estimated to have a start of over $41 million. While Venom is catching headlines for having the biggest October opening ever, A Star is Born just claimed the 10th spot on the list and could conceivably outlast the Marvel spinoff and climb the all-time October chart. The directorial debut is the 14th wide release of 2018 to score over 90% on the Tomatometer. (It is currently at 91%.) That number just missed the top ten openings ever for an actor-turned-director but is actually the best ever when the director is also the star.Movies about singers have not been a cash cow for this industry. We’re not talking straight-up musicals here, but movies about the art or characters who make their living through it. Go past Pitch Perfect 2 and Straight Outta Compton (starting with $69 &amp; $60 million) and you go down to Walk the Line and Ray ($22 &amp; $20 million,) The Bodyguard with Whitney Houston is just one of six movies about this line of work that passed the $100 million mark. A Star is Born is going to do that and then some. Finally, come awards time, Bradley Cooper has a chance to join Walt Disney as the only people to get at least six nominations in the same year. Cooper has a chance for Producing, Directing, Acting, Screenwriting and possibly multiple songs that he co-wrote with future Oscar winner Lady Gaga. Throw in a possible Supporting Actor nomination for Clint Eastwood’s The Mule (which was just added to the December release slate) and Cooper could become the most nominated person in any one year of the Oscars ever.Top 10 And Beyond: Night School Falls And Limited Releases Expand(Photo by Eli Joshua Ade/Universal Pictures)Last week’s top film, Night School, fell 55% down to fourth place this weekend. That puts it slightly behind the pace of Think Like a Man Too which finished with $65.1 million. Smallfoot held a bit better with its family constitutent and with $42.7 million is in a group that includes Captain Underpants, Happy Feet Two, Open Season, Chicken Run and Penguins of Madagascar. The $100 million of Chicken Run appears to be well out of reach and with it a few million ahead of the pace of Storks, Smallfoot is headed for the $75 million range. Warner Bros. had four films in the Top Ten this weekend. The Nun and Crazy Rich Asians are at $346 and $225 million worldwide, respectively. Crazy Rich Asians gets to hold onto the 10th spot of the highest-grossers of 2018 for at least a few more weeks.Eli Roth’s The House with a Clock In Its Walls remains within the realm of live action children’s book adaptations of Goosebumps, Eragon and The Spiderwick Chronicles keeping it with an estimate in the $70-80 million range. Paul Feig’s A Simple Favor is going to cross $50 million in the next couple of days as is The Predator though that film is going to be marked a financial failure even if it still manages to outgross it’s 2010 predecessor Predators. (Say that five times fast.)Among limited releases, Fox has a pair of titles to keep an eye on. Searchlight expanded David Lowery’s The Old Man and the Gun this weekend into 49 theaters and it grossed $385,000. It’s total now stands at an estimated $575,000 and it will be expanding into more cities over the next few weeks. Then Fox has George Tillman Jr.’s The Hate U Give (96%) which grossed $500,000 in 36 theaters. That is less than a third of what Isle of Dogs made opening in 27 theaters ($1.62 million) but it is on par with the documentary RBG which grossed $575,455 in 34 theaters this May. It also expands in the coming weeks. Also notable is the mountain climbing documentary, Free Solo which expanded from 4 to 41 theaters and had the 4th best per-theater-average of the weekend with a gross of $540,000. The Hate U Give had the 3rd best PTA while Venom had the best.This&nbsp;Time Last Year: Replicants, Ponies and a Mountain Enter the Box Office(Photo by Stephen Vaughan/Warner Bros.)Two relics from the 1980s drew different audiences and somewhere in between there was a mountain. Blade Runner 2049 led the way with $32.7 million but ultimately came up well short of hitting its profit margin with $259 million worldwide on a $150 million budget. That left one of the biggest red marks in the Hollywood ledger last year. That still seems better than My Little Pony: The Movie which opened to $8.8 million and finished with just $21.8 million domestic. Then finishing second was the Kate Winslet/Idris Elba survival drama, The Mountain Between Us, which started with $10.5 million and ended with $30.3 million. Meanwhile, It crossed the $300 million mark. The top ten films in 2017 this weekend grossed a total of $97 million and averaged 61.1% on the Tomatometer. This weekend’s films grossed an estimate $166.8 Million and averaged 57.2%On the Vine: The 1960s To The Present Will Give You Goosebumps(Photo by Universal Pictures)Back-to-back weeks we get one of the biggest award contenders of the year when Damien Chazelle presents his follow-up to La La Land with the story of Neil Armstrong in First Man (currently 89% on the Tomatometer.) Drew Goddard brought genre deconstruction with The Cabin in the Woods and now takes on a whole other sort of deconstruction with the crime thriller, Bad Times at the El Royale (79%). Jack Black jumped ship but Goosebumps 2: Haunted Halloween&nbsp;hopes to bring back its family audience. Also in limited release is another awards contender with Steve Carell and Timothee Chalamat in the junkie drama, Beautiful Boy (68%), and actor/comedian Ike Barinholtz makes his directorial debut with a hilarious commentary on the state of this fractured nation in The Oath (92%) featuring Tiffany Haddish and John Cho.The Full Top 10:&nbsp;September 28-30Venom&nbsp;–&nbsp;$80 million ($80 million total)A Star Is Born&nbsp;–&nbsp;$41.2 million ($41.2 million total)Smallfoot&nbsp;–&nbsp;$14.9 million ($42.7 million total)Night School&nbsp;–&nbsp;$12.2 million ($46.7 million total)The House With a Clock In Its Walls&nbsp;–&nbsp;$7.2 million ($55 million total)A Simple Favor&nbsp;– $3.4 million ($49 million total)The Nun&nbsp;– $2.6 million ($113.3 million total)Hell Fest&nbsp;–&nbsp;$2.07 million ($8.8 million total)Crazy Rich Asians&nbsp;–&nbsp;$2.06 million ($169.1 million total)The Predator&nbsp;– $900,000 ($49.9 million total)Erik Childress can be heard each week evaluating box office on WGN Radio with Nick Digilio as well as on Business First AM with Angela Miles and his Movie Madness Podcast.[box office figures via Box Office Mojo]","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"America, OWN, Horror, all-time, scene, Kimmy","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/02110716/Venom-Buzz-Rep.jpg","slug":"weekend-box-office-results-venom-breaks-records-in-monster-debut"},{"id":"47509093234183","title":"Box Office: Pacific Rim Uprising Takes Down Black Panther","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office: Pacific Rim Uprising Takes Down Black Pantherby Sujit Chawla | March 25, 2018 |  CommentsAfter five weekends on top, Marvel’s Black Panther&nbsp;was dethroned by Universal’s&nbsp;Pacific&nbsp;Rim Uprising&nbsp;which was the only of the new wide releases to do well.The sequel apparently a few people were looking forward to,&nbsp;Pacific Rim Uprising, snatched the top spot this weekend with an estimated $28M from 3,708 theaters for a per screen average of $7,552. That’s down nearly 25% from the original’s opening of $37.3M back in the summer of 2013. That film faded fairly quickly ending up with only $101M domestically though it did make $309M internationally which may be the biggest reason why a sequel was greenlit. In fact its highest gross ended up coming from China where it made $112M. Speaking of which, internationally&nbsp;Uprising&nbsp;made $150M this weekend led by, of course, China with $65M. Critics were mixed while audiences gave the film a so-so B CinemaScore.Slipping one spot to number two,&nbsp;Black Panther&nbsp;earned another $16.7M this weekend, according to estimates, bringing its cume to a remarkable $631M putting it solidly at #5 on the all-time domestic box office list and officially becoming the highest grossing superhero film ever. Next in its sights are&nbsp;Jurassic World&nbsp;($652M) and&nbsp;Titanic&nbsp;($659M). Worldwide T’Challa and company stand at $1.237B putting it at #12 all-time with studio stablemates&nbsp;Beauty and the Beast&nbsp;($1.263B) and&nbsp;Frozen&nbsp;($1.276B) next to fall.In third place with the best hold in the top 10 was the Christian biopic I Can Only Imagine&nbsp;which added 624 screens and fell only 19% to an estimated $13.8M bringing its total to a heavenly $38M with the Easter holidays just around the corner. The movie could see a finale in the $75-80M range, tremendous for a film with a budget under $10M.Opening poorly in fourth place was the animated&nbsp;Sherlock Gnomes&nbsp;which made an estimated $10.6M from 3,662 theaters for a per screen average of only $2,895. Critics savaged the film while audiences were a little kinder giving it a solid B+ CinemaScore.In fifth place with the worst hold in the top 10 was the reboot of Tomb Raider&nbsp;which fell 56% to an estimated $10.4M bringing its total up to only $41.7M. A final number in the $60-65M range is likely for a film that had much higher expectations. Speaking of films with much higher expectations, Disney’s A Wrinkle in Time&nbsp;fell 50% in its third weekend to an estimated $8M bringing its cume up to $73.8M.Love, Simon held on reasonably well in its second weekend slipping 34% to an estimated $7.8M, bringing its total up to $24M. Look for a final total of around $45-50M. Another religious-themed film debuted this weekend, this one to much poorer numbers than&nbsp;I Can Only Imagine&nbsp;as&nbsp;Paul, Apostle of Christ&nbsp;opened to an estimated $5M from 1,473 theaters for a per screen average of $3,394. Critics again were not kind as the film got half the positive reviews that I Can Only Imagine&nbsp;received. Game Night&nbsp;has been the little film that could with another strong hold falling only 25% in its fifth weekend to an estimated $4.2M bringing its total up to $61M.A couple of new films debuted in 10th and 11th place this weekend. Bella Thorne’s romantic drama&nbsp;Midnight Sun&nbsp;opened with an estimated $4.1M from 2,173 theaters for a per screen average of $1,896, worst in the top 10. Critics disliked the film but audiences really enjoyed what they saw giving the film an A- CinemaScore but this is the kind of film that will get more traction being watched at home. Steven Soderbergh’s&nbsp;Unsane, which he shot using only an iPhone 7 Plus (!), debuted with an estimated $3.8M from 2,023 theaters for a per screen average of only $1,907. Reviews were mostly positive across the board but audiences only gave it a B- CinemaScore. And finally the highly anticipated animated film from Wes Anderson,&nbsp;Isle of Dogs, opened to an estimated $1.57M from only 27 screens for a per screen average of an amazing $58k.The top ten films grossed an estimated $108.6M this weekend which was down 43% from last year when&nbsp;Beauty and the Beast&nbsp;remained at number one for a second straight weekend with $90.4M; and down 55% from 2016 when&nbsp;Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice&nbsp;opened at number one with a massive&nbsp;$166M.Follow&nbsp;BoxOfficeGuru.com on&nbsp;Twitter.&nbsp;","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"women, Mary, Studios, Television, a, Central, Rey, spain, Hulu, Premium, Talk, DirecTV, Arts","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/25113107/pacific-rim-uprising-600x314.jpg","slug":"box-office-pacific-rim-uprising-takes-down-black-panther"},{"id":"47509089342941","title":"Weekend Box Office Results: The Upside Sunny With Surprise $19.5 Million","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Weekend Box Office Results: The Upside Sunny With Surprise $19.5 MillionPlus Replicas can't duplicate John Wick success on the weekend of January 11-13.by Erik Childress | January 13, 2019 |  CommentsJust as Aquaman was poised to become the first film since Black Panther to rule the box office four weeks straight, a movie that has had to sit on the shelf for over a year comes along to say not so fast. Whether it was support for Kevin Hart over his most recent controversies or the feel-good possibilities of a rich&nbsp;paraplegic&nbsp;and his unqualified ex-con caretaker, it surely was not the reviews for The Upside which stands at 39% on the Tomatometer. Though STX Films likely does not care either which way as it becomes their first&nbsp;no. 1 opener ever with a $19.5 million haul this weekend.King&nbsp;of the Crop: The Upside Continues Kevin Hart’s Strong January Numbers(Photo by © STX Entertainment)STX’s strongest opener is still Bad Moms ($23.8 million),&nbsp;but a $19.5 million start for The Upside&nbsp;is a true victory for a studio which has not had a success since A Bad Mom’s Christmas back in 2017. And the news could be even better for them considering that they are only on the hook for the prints and advertising, which is reportedly less than $30 million. The $39 million production budget rests elsewhere as this film was originally repped by the Weinstein Co. when it premiered at the 2017 Toronto Film Festival. A month later the Harvey scandal erupted and&nbsp;his company’s films were eventually shelved or sold off. Poor Paddington 2 was one of them and it failed to find half of the original’s audience last January. The $19.5 million of The Upside would have been the fifth biggest opening ever for the now defunct Company, just ahead of the original Paddington’s $18.9 million start.Kevin Hart, on the other hand, has had some big openings so this number relatively pales in comparison. Just in January alone Hart has opened Ride Along ($41.5 million), Ride Along 2 ($35.2 million), and The Wedding Ringer ($20.6 million) to bigger numbers but his prevailing starpower is clearly a factor in The Upside’s success. Films in January opening between $19 and $21 million have finished anywhere between $42.6 and $70.6 million. The 4-day holiday next weekend can only help if word-of-mouth holds and it stays in second behind the launch of Glass. Only three of the 10 films in that range managed to gross three times their opening weekend. But one of those three was The Wedding Ringer.Rotten Returns: Replicas Unmatched For Futility Of Keanu Reeves Openers(Photo by Entertainment Studios)The Upside was not the only film delayed until this weekend. Replicas&nbsp;was pulled from the 2018 schedule and dumped into theaters now with no press screenings to boot. The 13% on the Tomatometer can clue you into why. The $2.5 million it made is the lowest amount ever for any Keanu Reeves headliner to open on more than 2,000 screens. The previous low was Johnny Mnemonic opening to $6 million in 2,030 theaters back in 1995; that was his first film since the success of Speed the previous summer. The $30 million-budgeted film was bought by Byron Allen’s Entertainment Studios for $4 million back in 2017 and will continue a streak of financial losers for them.The Top Ten And Beyond: Aquaman Reaches Milestone For DC’s Cinematic Universe(Photo by Warner Bros.)Aquaman&nbsp;may have missed the opportunity of four straight weeks at no. 1, but it will surely trade that as it became just the 37th film ever to reach the billion dollar milestone this weekend. That is the second billion dollar film under James Wan’s watch and he has done it with two separate franchises. (Furious 7 grossed $1.51 billion worldwide.) It should reach the $300 million mark in the U.S. by the end of next weekend’s holiday.Kids may be back in school but that doesn’t account for the huge drop that Disney’s Mary Poppins Returns&nbsp;took this weekend. From $15.8 million (third place last week) to $7.2 million (eighth place this week) that’s a 54% drop (the biggest in the top 10) putting it virtually out of the running to achieve what some of us perceived to be an inevitability. With $150.6 million in its 26th day that puts it smack dab between Wreck-It Ralph and Coco&nbsp;for Disney features – or $189-$209 million as a final gross. However, no December release with less than $172 million in the same timeframe ever reached the $200 million mark. The film still needs roughly another $102 million to turn a profit.Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse should be into profit by now and is actually en route to&nbsp;swinging over&nbsp;Mary Poppins’ domestic total. It may be in the same boat as far as not reaching $200 million, but it should take delight in the $180 million range where its headed. Bumblebee&nbsp;remains poised to become the lowest-grossing, best-reviewed Transformers film to date, though Viacom has said the movie is already ‘solidly profitable‘. Its total stands at $364 million worldwide. Clint Eastwood’s The&nbsp;Mule&nbsp;should now certainly reach the $100 million mark (the sixth of his directorial career) but is still going to need around $40 million internationally to turn a profit.Sony’s A Dog’s Way Home‘s $11.3 million&nbsp;is really neither here nor there. Not as much as Max ($12.1 million) but a bit better than Because of Winn-Dixie ($10.2 million). Snow Dogs and Hotel for Dogs both had better January starts with $17.8 million and $17 million, respectively. Last week’s top (new) dog, Escape Room, is up to a respectable $32.4 million. Annapurna’s awards hopeful, Vice, is up to $35.9 million, while Focus’ less-awards-hopeful, On the Basis of Sex&nbsp;&nbsp;added 1,811 theaters to its run this weekend and&nbsp;grossed $6.2 million. Its total stands at $10.5 million. Also expanding was Barry Jenkins’ If Beale Street Could Talk,&nbsp;which added 683 theaters (for 1,018 total) and grossed $2.38 million. Moonlight did not cross 1,000 theaters until the weekend after the Oscar nominations. It expanded to 650 theaters on its fifth weekend and grossed $1.48 million for a total of $6.6 million. Beale Street has made $7.68 million after its fifth weekend. Moonlight grossed a total of $27.8 million.This Time Last Year: Jumanji Led All While Wide Launch Of The Post Beat Newcomers(Photo by @ Columbia Pictures)Jumnaji: Welcome to the Jungle led the way for a second week in a row with $28.1 million, and the wide release of Steven Spielberg’s The Post beat all the newcomers with a $19.3 million weekend. Amongst films in their first three days anywhere, Liam Neeson in The Commuter fared best with $13.7 million. Critical darling Paddington 2 (still a perfect 100% with 216 posted reviews) made $11 million, and Taraji P. Henson in Proud Mary grossed $9.9 million. The&nbsp;top 10 films grossed $129.3 million and averaged 64.3% on the Tomatometer.

Night Shyamalan’s Glass, the third film in his surprise Unbreakable trilogy, is the only major release next week and those who made Split a big hit in 2017 are likely to come out in droves. For at least its opening weekend. The studio lifted the embargo for reviews of the film this past Wednesday and the response from critics (currently 37% on the Tomatometer) may be reflected in audience disappointment and see the grosses trail off.

The holiday season (November through New Year’s week) had been holding pace as the fourth best ever (behind 2017, 2013 and 2012), though it fell to sixth this weekend. However, this upcoming week’s ticket sales will push the industry into their highest-grossing year ever, besting the 2016 record of $11.37 billion.King of the Crop: Aquaman Leaps To The Surface And Pursues The Clouds(Photo by Warner Bros)Aquaman&nbsp;led the way this weekend, grossing more than the next three films combined. It’s $67.4 million start was the 9th best ever in December (it made another $4.7 million with Amazon previews last weekend) and yet was still the weakest opening in the DC Universe to date by some margin. That should be expected given the rejection of Justice League which introduced Jason Momoa’s superhero. That film opened to $93.4 million and finished with $229 million – itself the weakest gross of the Universe. Aquaman would really have to fail with audiences going forward not to reach that amount. The film’s support with critics dropped as the Tomatometer has fallen to 64% after some initial robust reviews from the junket crowd.&nbsp;Aquaman’s worldwide total has risen to over $482 million.Fresh Surprise: Bumblebee Shocks, But Not At Box Office(Photo by Paramount)There is only one number that earns Bumblebee its slot here and it’s certainly not its opening weekend. Bumblebee’s $21 million start is less than half of what Transformers: The Last Knight opened to. No, the real impressive number is the Tomatometer score: 94%. The total score of the four Michael Bay Transformers sequels combined&nbsp;is just 88%. That’s four films. (The original received a 57%.) Whether or not Bumblebee can continue to draw family audiences in such a crowded season remains to be seen, but even catching The Last Knight’s $130 million means the $135 million production will be relying on its international draw to turn a profit. None of the live-action Transformers films have grossed less than $600 million worldwide.Rotten Returns: Welcome To Marwen! Hello? Seriously, You Can Come In.(Photo by Universal)In a sad turn of events Robert Zemeckis’ current box office status is looking a lot like the beginning of his career, marked by&nbsp;I Wanna Hold Your Hand&nbsp;and Used Cars, before&nbsp;Romancing the Stone and Back to the Future saved him. Countless masterpieces later, the director has fallen on hard times again in ticket sales. Sony opened The Walk wide a week after The Martian. It grossed $3.7 million and finished with just $10.1m. Allied was an $85 million production that Brad Pitt did no press for as he was in the middle of his domestic issues with Angelina Jolie. It ended up making just $40 million domestic.This weekend, Universal opened Welcome to Marwen and it, unfortunately, reached new lows for Zemeckis. The film opened in just 1,911 theaters but a $1,234 per-theater-average is weak for any release. Critically it is the worst-reviewed film of his career by a margin;&nbsp;What Lies Beneath received a 46%. That is just the fifth rotten score ever for Zemeckis, but the opening was even worse than The Walk with just a $2.3 million tally.&nbsp;The Top Ten And Beyond: Mary Poppins Eyes The Musical Long Game(Photo by Walt Disney Studios)Disney’s Mary Poppins Returns&nbsp;opened with&nbsp;a $22.2 million haul this weekend, it’s total now up to $31 million. These may seem like low numbers but do we need to remind you of La La Land, Chicago and just how well The Greatest Showman did last year?&nbsp; Even Joel Schumacher’s The Phantom of the Opera started with just $4 million and stretched to $51 million. Watch for those Poppins numbers to grow steadily for several weeks.Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse rose to almost $65 million this weekend and is currently on a path to between $125-$135 million. Clint Eastwood’s The&nbsp;Mule‘s made nearly $10 million in its second frame; final estimate is still a bit erratic but&nbsp;expect a tally between $65-$75 million.The $6.5 million opening of Second Act (42%) ranks between Angel Eyes ($9.2 million) and Gigli ($3.7 million) for Jennifer Lopez films. Ralph Breaks the Internet&nbsp;($5 million this weekend) remains slightly ahead of the pace of Coco so $200 million is still very much in play for it, though the $175 million production is still looking for some international help to get into the profit margin. Focus expanded Mary Queen of Scots into 795 theaters and it grossed $2.2 million to breach the top 10. In five theaters fewer, The Favourite made $2 million and has grossed a total of $10 million to date. Finally, Bradley Cooper’s A Star Is Born crossed the $200 million mark this weekend, becoming the 11th film of 2018 to reach that milestone. All eyes will now be on Aquaman, Ralph Breaks the Internet, and Mary Poppins Returns to make this year the first to have 14 films to do it.This Time Last Year: Last Jedi Reigned But Jumanji&nbsp;and&nbsp;Showman Were Just Warming Up(Photo by Walt Disney Studios)The Last Jedi&nbsp;took the top spot for a second straight week, but its holiday archenemy,&nbsp;Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle&nbsp;made its debut at number 2 with $36.1 million. Christmas Eve fell on Sunday last year and a number of slow starters would go to become huge earners.&nbsp;Pitch Perfect 3&nbsp;started with just under $20 million and ended up making $104 million. Then there was&nbsp;The Greatest Showman&nbsp;which opened on Wednesday, made less than $5 million in its first two days and $8.8 million over the weekend. It’s final tally was $174 million. The musical’s 19.79 multiple over its opening weekend was second only to&nbsp;Titanic&nbsp;(20.97) for December films opening on more than 2,500 screens. Also opening were Alexander Payne’s&nbsp;Downsizing&nbsp;to $4.9 million and&nbsp;Father Figures&nbsp;with $3.2 million. Last year’s&nbsp;top 10 grossed $164.3 million and averaged 66.6% on the Tomatometer. This year’s&nbsp;top 10&nbsp;grossed $161.3 Million and averaged 66.8%On the Vine: Three (In)Famous Pairings And Two Strong Women For The Holidays(Photo by Sony Pictures)In just a few days Christmas brings us heroes and villains, though each with a comic slant. There’s Will Ferrell and John C. Reilly in&nbsp;Holmes &amp; Watson, which Sony is hiding from critics so beware its eventual score on the Tomatometer. Adam McKay’s Vice has been dividing critics since it started screening: it’s barely holding&nbsp;on to a Fresh rating at 68% despite positioning as a&nbsp;significant awards player this season. Doing much better with critics are the upcoming&nbsp;limited releases are Nicole Kidman in Destroyer (78%), Felicity Jones as Ruth Bader Ginsburg in On the Basis of Sex (73%), and John C.

Then&nbsp;How To Train Your Dragon 2 opened just a bit better than its predecessor in the summer of 2014. This weekend, the final chapter of the animated trilogy is living up to all the expectations its predecessors have set.King of the Crop: Dragon Poised To Become Franchise’s Biggest Success(Photo by Universal Pictures)How To Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World maintains the strong critical support of the series, registering a 91% on the Tomatometer compared to the first two’s 98% &amp; 92%, respectively. The 2010 original opened to $43.7 million and finished with $217.5 million (a 4.97 multiple) and the 2014 sequel started with $49.4 million and ended with $177 million (a 3.57 multiple.) The Hidden World was expected to gross somewhere in-between that range but instead defied the tracking services and made $55.5 million over the weekend. That is the eighth best opening ever in February, the second for an animated film behind The Lego Movie’s $69 million start, and the biggest opening of 2019 until Captain Marvel opens in two weeks. And&nbsp;with a production budget that has shrunk from $165 to $145 to $129 million, The Hidden World is going to be the most profitable film in the series.Rotten Returns: Why Are We (Not) Fighting?(Photo by WWE Films)How To Train Your Dragon was not the only film to register over 90% on the Tomatometer this weekend, but audiences just were not swayed to attend Fighting with My Family. The Stephen Merchant wrestling dramedy opened to just $8 million after a four-theater limited stint last week produced $138,780. The selling of Dwayne Johnson’s two-scene cameo (as himself) and a “surprise” screening at Sundance to build buzz a month ago was not enough to get it into eight digits.&nbsp;The Top Ten And Beyond: Alita Takes A Dive, But The Upside Reaches Milestone(Photo by 20th Century Fox)While box office analysts have been fighting the good fight for Alita: Battle Angel all week, this weekend’s numbers tell a much different story. Sure it is important to watch the international dollars flow in – and they are to the current tune of nearly $104 million – but as I mentioned here last week anything under $100 million domestic means it is unlikely to break even. Of the 16 films with an opening weekend between $28-29 million, Alita’s $12 million is the second lowest second weekend ever, ahead of only last year’s Pacific Rim: Uprising. Thanks to an extra day on the schedule and previews on Jan. 31, Alita is just about even with Uprising total’s $60.3 million gross but it is getting nowhere close to $100 million here in the U.S. and is still going to need around $350 million to get out of the red.By tomorrow,&nbsp;The Upside should hit the $100 million mark as it continues to chase Glass,&nbsp;which at $107.9 million appears will finish south of The Village’s $114 million. The Lego Movie 2 is not there yet, but it will be despite its final estimates being downgraded to the $120 million range rather than $130. Ralph Breaks the Internet will be hitting $200 million domestic this week and it has cleared over $514 million worldwide.It’s going to take What Men Want and Isn’t It Romantic to pool their resources to reach $100 million. Both Cold Pursuit and Happy Death Day 2U are going to come in somewhere around $30 million each. Roadside Attractions’ Run the Race (40% at RT) made it into the Top Ten with $2.27 million.&nbsp;Finally, Peter Jackson’s WWI documentary, They Shall Not Grow Old, has now grossed $16.4 million, now more than what&nbsp;Mortal Engines&nbsp;made in its theatrical run.This Time Last Year: T’Challa Ruled But A Pair Of Future Classics Were Born(Photo by © Marvel Studios)Black Panther was going nowhere from the #1 spot with $111.6 million, which was the second highest second weekend of all time behind Star Wars: The Force Awakens. That was until Avengers: Infinity War came along a few months later and knocked it back to third. Ryan Coogler’s film passed the $400 million mark in just its tenth day. Opening against it were two films that have already begun to stand the test of time. Game Night (84%) opened in second to $17 million and Alex Garland’s Annihiliation (88%) was fourth with $11 million. Those films helped raise the average of the Top Ten on the Tomatometer to 61.5% as they grossed $177 million. This year’s Top Ten grossed $112.0 And averaged 66.1% on the Tomatometer.On the Vine: Madea Aims For #1 And Neil Jordan Returns To Wide Release(Photo by Lionsgate)Tyler Perry returns with his first directorial effort in four months with A Madea Family Funeral. Perry has not cracked the $50 million mark since 2016 but when his most famous character appears in the title those films have averaged a $26.7 million opening and a final gross of $63.6 million. Focus is also going wide with Neil Jordan’s latest, Greta.

Then Venom&nbsp;came along and put up $80.2 million on its first weekend. As the estimates shifted&nbsp;during this weekend, there was danger that David Gordon Green’s Halloween, the 40-years-later direct sequel to John Carpenter’s classic, would unseat Venom&nbsp;after just two weeks. Alas, the new slasher movie will have to settle for second with a still-incredible $77.5 million haul. Neither&nbsp;Halloween nor Venom is&nbsp;likely to unseat the $274 million total that Alfonso Cuarón’s sci-fi spectacular made to become the all-time October champion, but Green’s film could take a run at Get Out to become the highest-grossing Blumhouse production of all time.King of the&nbsp;New Crop:&nbsp;Halloween&nbsp;Earns Franchise’s Best OpeningHalloween’s&nbsp;reported $15 million production budget (Box Office Mojo reports $10 million) would be the most expensive for Blumhouse (over the $13 million for The First Purge).&nbsp;Halloween, which is Certified Fresh&nbsp;on the Tomatometer with&nbsp;80%, earned&nbsp;half of that back just in Thursday-night previews with $7.7 million. Its $33.3 million Friday haul did best Venom’s $32.5 million Friday take, but it still came up just short of the October weekend record. On the other hand, that Friday performance – including Thursday previews – was more money than any other David Gordon Green film made in their entire domestic run (excepting Pineapple Express).Now, what are its long-term prospects? Only five films have ever had a $30 million Friday and failed to reach $200 million domestically. They were 2009’s&nbsp;Fast and Furious, Fifty Shades of Grey, X-Men Origins: Wolverine, The Simpsons Movie, and the first Twilight film. (At over $170 million after 17 days, Venom is on a path to the $200 million milestone, or would be the first film ever not to reach it with such a total after 17 days.) Crammed between the $123.4 million opening for It&nbsp;in 2017 and this year’s $53.8 million start for The Nun, there is not much of a precedent for what Halloween could do moving forward. Multiples for successful horror openings are wildly inconsistent with some films opening with more than $40 million having multiples of 3.00 (A Quiet Place, Split, The Conjuring, and The Meg) and others under 2.2 (The Nun,&nbsp;Paranormal Activity 2, Insidious: Chapter 2, Paranormal Activity 3, and 2009’s Friday the 13th).&nbsp;Halloween would need a 2.58 multiple to reach $200 million, but just a 2.27 one to surpass Get Out as Blumhouse’s all-time domestic champion; it earned $176 million in the U.S. One thing is for certain:&nbsp;Halloween will have no competition next weekend on the weekend before Oct. 31.Rotten Returns:&nbsp;First Man&nbsp;Still Hitting Box Office Turbulence(Photo by Daniel McFadden / © Universal )Things are not looking up for Damien Chazelle’s First Man;&nbsp;the 46% drop it experienced this weekend – partially due to Neil Armstrong losing a bunch of IMAX screens to Michael Myers – is not what optimists were looking for. We tried to put a positive face on its $16 million opening last weekend, but it is now looking like the movie will come in on the low end of the projected $55-$75 million total. Its international total is at $55 million. Hopefully for Universal, a perceived&nbsp;underperformance at the box office will not impact the movie’s Oscar chances – it remains one of the best-reviewed wide releases of the year.The Rest of the Top 10:&nbsp;The Hate U Give&nbsp;Goes Wide,&nbsp;Mid90s&nbsp;Posts Stellar First&nbsp;Weekend(Photo by © 2018 Twentieth Century Fox Film Corporation)Staying put in the no. 2 spot for the third straight week is Bradley Cooper’s A Star Is Born, which now stands at $126 million. The average final gross of films that have earned between $120 million and $130 million after 17 days is $180 million. Wedding Crashers is the only live-action film since 2000 to have made less than $133 million after 17 days and still reach the $200 million milestone. It had made just $115.6 million at this stage of its theatrical release.Fox, like Universal, had a trifecta in the&nbsp;top 10 this week. The numbers for its&nbsp;Bad Times at the El Royale are&nbsp;not-so-good&nbsp;indeed, with the movie dropping 53% for a total take so far of $13.3 million, but George Tillman Jr.’s The Hate U Give (96% on the Tomatometer) expanded wide after two weeks of limited release to gross nearly as much as Halloween did Thursday night with $7.5 million for the weekend. Fox Searchlight also finally&nbsp;pushed David Lowery’s The Old Man &amp; The Gun into wide release (802 theaters) to break into the top 10. It has grossed $4.2 million to date.In more limited releases, Jonah Hill’s directorial debut, Mid90s (80% on the Tomatometer), grossed $249,500 in four theaters. That is the sixth best per-theater-average opening ($58,000) in A24’s history, behind Moonlight, Lady Bird, Spring Breakers, Eighth Grade,&nbsp;and The Disaster Artist. Pretty good company. Can You Ever Forgive Me? (99% on the Tomatometer), with award hopefuls Melissa McCarthy and Richard E. Grant, made $150,000 in five theaters. That is right behind Fox Searchlight’s Kinsey, Once, (500) Days of Summer, and Win Win. Each went on to gross over $9 million. Then there was Paul Dano’s directorial debut, Wildlife (96% on the Tomatometer), with award hopeful Carey Mulligan. According to Saturday estimates, it made $112,000 for the third best per-theater-average for IFC in 2018, behind The Death of Stalin and Let the Sunshine In.As for other expansion news, Amazon’s Beautiful Boy moved into 44 additional theaters and grossed an estimated $439,056. Its total now stands at $722,008. Mountain-climbing documentary&nbsp;Free Solo – Certified Fresh at 98% –&nbsp;added 124 theaters and grossed $965,000 for a total of $3.5 million. Annapurna’s The Sisters Brothers added 1,012 theaters to its run, and it came in with&nbsp;just $742,014 for a total so far of $1.9 million.This Time Last Year: A Scare-Free, Rotten Weekend at the Box Office(Photo by Chip Bergmann / @ Lionsgate)A different kind of Halloween sequel had the no. 1 spot at the box office:&nbsp;Tyler Perry’s Boo 2! A Madea Halloween. Though it opened to $21.2 million, it only managed to climb to $47.3 million total; the original had made $73.2 million the year before. Gerard Butler fought the weather in Geostorm, which finished second with $13.7 million on its way to becoming a major loser for Warner Bros. Sony did no better with the critically acclaimed the true story of firefighters,&nbsp;Only the Brave, which grossed just $6 million. Finally, infamous flop&nbsp;The Snowman&nbsp;grossed just $3.3 million and finished with a grand total of $6.7 million domestic. The&nbsp;top 10 grossed a total of $76.4 million and had an average score on the Tomatometer of 55.9% thanks mainly to the average 9% Tomatometer scores collected by Geostorm, The Snowman, and Boo 2. This year,&nbsp;Halloween&nbsp;grossed more than last year’s&nbsp;top 10 combined. This weekend also posted a stronger average Tomatometer of 69.4%, with an estimated total haul of $157.6 million.On the Vine:&nbsp;Suspiria&nbsp;Opens In Limited Release as&nbsp;Halloween&nbsp;Faces a Challenge-Free Weekend(Photo by Jack English / © Summit Entertainment )The month of October is going out with a whimper before the holiday movie season kicks into gear.

Here at Total Recall, we thought we’d look back at the movies that have inspired the former Robert Cummings’ work on House of 1,000 Corpses (15 percent on the Tomatometer) and The Devil’s Rejects (53 percent).Under the “Hellbilly Deluxe” trappings, Zombie is a true cinephile at heart: he’s as likely to find inspiration in the works of Martin Scorsese and Sam Peckinpah as he is in the grimy world of low-rent 1970s drive-in fare. True, Zombie looks to the dark side for inspiration, but he’s also informed by works with gallows humor.Growing up in blue-collar Haverhill, Mass., the little Zombie enjoyed a steady TV diet of the Marx Brothers. The anarchic antics of Groucho, Chico, and Harpo obviously left an impression, as Zombie would christen his antiheros in House of 1000 Corpses and The Devils Rejects Captain Spaulding, Rufus Firefly, and Otis Driftwood — each names of characters played by Groucho Marx. It may seem like an odd choice, but the Marxes always maintained a subversive appeal. As Roger Ebert notes in his review of Duck Soup, “Although they were not taken as seriously, they were as surrealist as Dali, as shocking as Stravinsky, as verbally outrageous as Gertrude Stein, as alienated as Kafka.”The Brothers’ films are generally more like a string of gags than cohesive narratives, and some of their shtick — like the long musical interludes in A Night at the Opera — can seem hopelessly dated. But Groucho’s double-entendre-laden one-liners, Chico’s hustler persona, and Harpo’s deft physical comedy still contain a hilarious, rebellious edge. If you’ve never seen the Brothers in action, Duck Soup (94 percent) and A Night at the Opera (97 percent) are perhaps the best places to start. Of the latter, Peter Bradshaw of London’s Guardian wrote, “Their sheer irreverence, exuberance and verbal comic genius are marvelous.”In Corpses and Rejects, Captain Spaulding has “Love” and “Hate” tattooed on his knuckles — a direct reference to Robert Mitchum‘s iconic Harry Powell, the evil false prophet from The Night of the Hunter. In his only directorial effort, Charles Laughton borrowed heavily from the angular, shadowy ambience of the German Expressionist classic The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari (100 percent). Still, there’s an unreality to The Night of the Hunter that make it a singular viewing experience; it has a haunted, surreal ambience you won’t see anywhere outside of a Bjork video. It’s also viscerally frightening, and Robert Mitchum is at his demonic best here, playing an ex-con who learned of a stash of money from his cellmate, and proceeds to ingratiate himself with the man’s family. But the children are not fooled by Powell’s smooth talk, and flee across an ominous countryside, with Powell in pursuit. Eventually, they are taken in by Rachel Cooper (Lillian Gish), the guardian of a group of troubled orphans. The climax has an apocalyptic air, as Gish tells the story of mean ol’ King Herod while pumping her shotgun.Filmmakers like Spike Lee (in Do the Right Thing, 100 percent) and the Coen Brothers (in The Big Lebowski, 83 percent) have borrowed dialogue from Hunter, and the excellent-yet-ignored Undertow (57 percent) re-imagined its plot for contemporary times. Hunter is at 100 percent on the Tomatometer; Dave Kehr of the Chicago Reader calls Hunter “an enduring masterpiece — dark, deep, beautiful, aglow… Ultimately the source of its style and power is mysterious — it is a film without precedents, and without any real equals.” Shawn Levy from the Oregonian calls it “As crude, direct, rattling, mystifying and exciting as American movies get.”If Night of the Hunter spawned few direct imitators, the opposite can be said of John Carpenter‘s original Halloween. Yet seven sequels and thousands of knockoffs haven’t dulled the impact of the original slasher flick, perhaps because it’s not really a slasher film at all. Like Psycho (98 percent), it generates its scares by maintaining an almost unbearable level of suspense. Halloween is the story of Michael Myers, who committed unspeakable acts of violence as a child and has escaped from a mental hospital, ready to kill again. Possessing a wicked sense of humor, Halloween lacks the self-seriousness that would infect later horror films. As sharp as Scream was, Halloween parodied horror tropes just as effectively, even while inventing them. At 89 percent on the Tomatometer, “Halloween remains untouched,” wrote James Berardinelli of ReelViews, “a modern classic of the most horrific kind.” “They should have broken the mold when they released Halloween, for when it comes to escaped-maniacs-on-the-loose films this one’s the real deal,” wrote Marjorie Baumgarten of the Austin Chronicle.It’s unlikely that Zombie’s Halloween will be the enduring classic the original has become, but that would be holding him to an impossibly high standard. Regardless, don’t let Zombie’s new remake and horror-film reputation fool you; there’s a much broader history of cinema informing his movies than their shock-and-scare heavy execution might suggest.","section":"Total Recall","tags":"Fox, green, science, FX, movies, Apple","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Total-Recall-Halloween-Director-Rob-Zombies-Favorites"},{"id":"47509093218816","title":"Weekend Box Office Results: Avengers: Infinity War Crushes Competition (Again), Eyes $2 Billion Club","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Weekend Box Office Results: Avengers: Infinity War Crushes Competition (Again), Eyes $2 Billion ClubMelissa McCarthy's Life of the Party does solid business while Gabrielle Union shows her star power on the weekend of May 11-13.by Erik Childress | May 13, 2018 |  Comments(Photo by ©Marvel/©Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures)It’s no surprise Marvel’s Avengers: Infinity War held the top spot for the third week in a row, dropping just 46.1% to earn $61.8 million. There may not be another film this summer that holds it for as long until Mission: Impossible – Fallout, which opens ahead of an uncompetitive stretch. But it will be next week that gives box office watchers a little clearer picture of whether Infinity War stands a chance of passing Black Panther for total earnings this year in America. Overseas, thanks to a $200 million opening in China this weekend, Infinity War has jumped up to fifth on the all-time worldwide list, with over $1.606 billion to date. Another $65 million and it will pass Jurassic World, leaving only the $2 billion club in front of it — that club includes Avatar, Titanic, and&nbsp;The Force Awakens. Assuming&nbsp;Infinity War&nbsp;earns at least another $100 million in the States,&nbsp;it will need roughly another $361 million internationally to join that exclusive list.Queen&nbsp;of the Crop: Melissa McCarthy Beats Newcomers, But Not Herself(Photo by Hopper Stone/ © Warner Bros.)The films that Melissa McCarthy has made with Paul Feig represent four of her top five openings ever (Identity Thief is the outlier). Coming in sixth and seventh&nbsp;on her&nbsp;box office chart&nbsp;are the films she has made with her husband, Ben Falcone. The Boss and Tammy opened to $23.5 and $21.5 million, respectively. Tammy, which opened on a Wednesday before the July 4 holiday, had already grossed $17.9 million before the weekend arrive.&nbsp;Which brings us to Life of the Party, another McCarthy/Falcone collaboration, which was number two this weekend but is the eighth highest opening for McCarthy.Its $18.5 million start is better than 2015’s counter-programmer to Age of Ultron, Hot Pursuit, which opened to $13.9 million, but is less than last year’s Mother’s Day weekend entry, Snatched, which grabbed $19.5 million. Neither film had a particularly strong multiple in the end (2.48 and 2.38), nor were they embraced by critics (7% and 36% on the Tomatometer). This is about the only area where Life of the Party can brag, besting both of those films as well as Tammy’s 24% and The Boss’ 22% with a current score of 41%.Fresh Surprise:&nbsp;Gabrielle Union Shows She Can Lead, Ruth Bader Ginsburg Breaks Into Top 10(Photo by Paul Sarkis/ © Universal)Gabrielle Union made her film debut in 1999’s She’s All That, but has not had much in the way of starring roles since, except as one half of a leading couple in films like Deliver Us from Eva, Breakin’ All the Rules, and Daddy’s Little Girls. Breaking In, in which she headlines as a resourceful mom-in-peril, opened this weekend to a respectable $16.5 million. Sure, it’s not the $25.8 or $24.2 million that Sony’s comparable&nbsp;The Perfect Guy and No Good Deed earned on opening weekend, but Universal should be very pleased with the result for the thriller with a $6 million budget. They will be less thrilled with its 27% on the Tomatometer,&nbsp;one of the lowest scores&nbsp;amongst wide releases so far this summer. Meanwhile, Neon’s Revenge is brandishing a 91% on the Tomatometer, and can be seen in limited release as well as on VOD. It made $46,023 in 36 theaters. Magnolia’s Ruth Bader Ginsburg doc, RBG, added 146 theaters and made it into the top 10, bringing its total to $2 million. It’s currently Certified Fresh at 93% on the Tomatometer.Beyond the Top 10:&nbsp;Saoirse’s&nbsp;Seagull&nbsp;and Basquiat Doc Lead Limited Releases(Photo by Nicole Rivelli /© Sony Pictures Classics /Courtesy Everett Collection)Sony Classics’ adaptation of Anton Chekhov’s The Seagull,&nbsp;featuring an impressive cast including Saoirse Ronan, Annette Bening, and Elisabeth Moss — and an impressive 79% on the Tomatometer — had the third best per-theater-average of the weekend, earning $80,607 in six theaters. Bleecker Street expanded Disobedience&nbsp;(88%) into 101 theaters and made another $437,859 for a total of $1.2 million. Magnolia’s documentary,&nbsp;Boom for Real: The Late Teenage Years of Jean-Michel Basquiat (88%), led all per-theater-averages, thanks to a solo showing at New York’s IFC Center that brought in $22,500.This Time Last Year: Last Laugh for Guardians(Photo by ©Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures)Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2&nbsp;enjoyed&nbsp;its final week at number 1 with $65 million, bringing its 10-day total to $248 million. Amy Schumer and Goldie Hawn led newcomers in Snatched with $19.5 million over Mother’s Day weekend, holding off Guy Ritchie’s King Arthur: Legend of the Sword.&nbsp;That big-budget epic opened in third place with just $15.3 million, and a Tomatometer of 30%, on its way to being crowned 2017’s most expensive flop.On the Vine:&nbsp;Deadpool 2&nbsp;to Take First Step Towards R-Rated Record(Photo by © 20th Century Fox Film Corp.)Infinity War’s first challenger of the season comes in the form of Deadpool 2. The original film earned $132 million over Valentine’s Day weekend in 2016 and all signs point to the sequel outperforming it. We’re thinking the $150 million tracking figure is lowballing it. It’s interesting to note that only one film that has opened with $152 million or more has gone on to gross less than $370 million domestically. (That was Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, which finished with $330.3 million.) Why is that $370 million figure significant? Because that was the final gross of Mel Gibson’s Passion of the Christ, which is still the highest-grossing R-rated release in history. Until Deadpool 2 passes it that is. (We predict!) Paramount is counter-programming with the ensemble Book Club, and Global Road (formerly Open Road) will try for the family audience with Show Dogs.The Full Top 10:&nbsp;May 11-13Avengers: Infinity War – $61.8 million ($547.8 million total)Life of the Party – $18.5 million ($18.5 million total)Breaking In – $16.5 million ($16.5 million total)Overboard – $10.1 million ($29.5 million total)A Quiet Place – $6.4 million ($169.5 million total)I Feel Pretty – $3.7 million ($43.8 million total)Rampage – $3.3 million ($89.7 million total)Tully – $2.2 million ($6.9 million total)Black Panther – $1.9 million ($696.1 million total)RBG – $1.1 million ($2.0 million total)Erik Childress can be heard each week evaluating box office on WGN Radio with Nick Digilio as well as on Business First AM with Angela Miles and his Movie Madness Podcast.[box office figures via Box Office Mojo]","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"Sundance, Walt, Horse, reboot, TLC, YouTube, History, Classic, MCU, franchise, mutant, cancelled, TV, movies, finale","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/11173850/Avengers-Featured.jpg","slug":"weekend-box-office-results-avengers-infinity-war-crushes-competition-again-eyes-2-billion-club"},{"id":"47509093227013","title":"Weekend Box Office Results: A Quiet Place Screams into the Record Books","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Weekend Box Office Results: A Quiet Place Screams into the Record BooksA Quiet Place soars and Ready Player One holds strong on weekend of April 6-8, 2018.by Erik Childress | April 8, 2018 |  CommentsOn a weekend when the folks at Paramount would love to shout from the rooftops as loudly as possible, out of respect for their latest release they may just be doing a silent scream (of joy) instead. John Krasinski’s A Quiet Place opened to a huge $50 million, and has broken a stretch of rough openings for the studio — one that goes as far back to January 2017 when enough folks overseas saw xXx: The Return of Xander Cage to dub that film a success. The $17 million-budgeted A Quiet Place may turn out to be the studio’s&nbsp;most profitable film since Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation.King of the Crop: Quiet, We’re Hunting Humans(Photo by Jonny Cournoyer / © Paramount )A Quiet Place&nbsp;is setting and matching all sorts of records, including with its 97% rating on our own Tomatometer. That score matches the highest critical score for a wide April release since 2000 (joining the 97%-rated&nbsp;Mud, which&nbsp;opened April 2013), besting movies like&nbsp;The Jungle Book&nbsp;(95%),&nbsp;The Cabin in the Woods&nbsp;(92%),&nbsp;Source Code,&nbsp;and&nbsp;Hot Fuzz&nbsp;(both 91%). When we talk dollar records, the $50 million take this weekend gives&nbsp;A Quiet Place&nbsp;the highest non-sequel, non-remake opening ever for the month of April.How high can it climb from here? Last January’s Split opened to $40 million and managed a 3.45 multiple to end up with over $138 million domestically. A broader look shows that since 2000, only one film to open between $25-$60 million with&nbsp;more than 90% on the Tomatometer failed to achieve at least a 3x multiple over their opening weekend — last year’s&nbsp;War for the Planet of the Apes. Films that did cross that multiplier include Mad Max: Fury Road (3.38 multiplier), Minority Report (3.70) and Edge of Tomorrow (3.48), also featuring A Quiet Place’s Emily Blunt. So, even a low-end estimate would put A Quiet Place between $150-$169 million for its final domestic total.Fresh Surprise: Blockers Continues Comedy Trend(Photo by © Universal)Another SXSW premiere, Universal’s Blockers, is proving there is value in appealing to both adults and teens with your gross-out humor. Its $21.4 million doesn’t quite measure up to the debuts of other big recent SXSW comedy premieres, such as Neighbors ($49 million), Sausage Party ($34.2 million), Knocked Up ($30.6 million) and Bridesmaids ($26.2 million) —&nbsp;the&nbsp;Blockers&nbsp;number is closer to Forgetting Sarah Marshall’s $17.7 million. But there is reason to hope that the film, currently Certified Fresh at 83% on the Tomatometer, will have legs. February’s Game Night, also Certified Fresh at 82%,&nbsp;opened to $17 million and is currently over $66 million for a 3.88 multiple. Do not be too surprised if Blockers follows the same path given the hunger for quality comedies currently in the marketplace. It may face some competition with Amy Schumer’s PG-13 I Feel Pretty (opening April 20), even if Snatched proved to be a disappointing follow-up Trainwreck. (Both were “R”-rated.) Hopefully, Universal doesn’t lose half of Blockers’ audience next week to Blumhouse’s Truth or Dare;&nbsp;if&nbsp;Blockers does hold through April, the $21 million production will get the studio in the win column.Rotten Returns: Kennedy Cover-Up Fails to Connect, Rim Drops to Ninth(Photo by © Universal Pictures)Byron Allen’s Entertainment Studios may have struck a little oil with last summer’s 47 Meters Down, but it’s been pretty dry ever since: Friend Request ($3.7 million&nbsp;domestic on a $9.9 million budget), Hostiles ($29.8 million, $39 million budget) and The Hurricane Heist ($6.1 million, $35 million budget). Now Chappaquiddick has opened with just $6.2 million. The Tomatometer score is solid —&nbsp;80%, and the Audience Score is almost the same —&nbsp;so there is a chance it may get a word-of-mouth boost, but that may not be enough for its backers to recoup their investment. Meanwhile, Universal’s Pacific Rim: Uprising dropped to ninth place. After its $28.1 million opening, it may end up having the third worst multiple of the year after The Hurricane Heist (2.01) and Proud Mary (2.09).Best of the Rest: Panther Makes More History, Player One Has Legs(Photo by © Marvel / © Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures)On Saturday, Black Panther passed the gross of Titanic (including all of its re-releases) to become the third highest grossing domestic film of all time, with over $665 million. It is also now the tenth all-time highest earner worldwide, with $1.299 billion,&nbsp;and is currently about $23 million away from passing The Last Jedi for ninth place. Steven Spielberg’s Ready Player One had a very solid hold, dropping just 40%, and has reached $391 million worldwide. (Still looking for all of the film’s Easter Eggs? Check out our video guide.) On the indie front, The Death of Stalin is now the fourth highest-grossing domestic film in IFC Films’ limited-release history, with over $5.5 million.This Time Last Year: The Baby Continued to Show ’em Who’s Boss(Photo by © 20th Century Fox Film Corp.)Smurfs: The Lost Village and Going in Style combined were no match for the $26.3 million of The Boss Baby’s second weekend. Disney’s live-action Beauty and the Beast was in second place, reaching $430 million. Jordan Peele’s Oscar-winner-to-be, Get Out, was still chugging along in its seventh weekend, coming in at eighth place, and Logan finished its final week in the top 10 in ninth place. The top 10 movies combined grossed $106.28 million compared to this year’s $142 million. Last year, the average Tomatometer score amongst the top 10 box office earners was 61.8%, while this year it is 68.1%.On the Vine: A Three-Way Box Office RampageWarner Bros. is hoping to capitalize on Dwayne Johnson’s Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle success by throwing him into an actual video game adaptation in Rampage. The ’80s arcade favorite is determined to destroy Chicago on screen, but will it destroy any records? &nbsp;It will need $40.2 million just to beat Scary Movie 4 to enter the top 10 April earners of all time. For context, Johnson opened San Andreas to $54.2 million (that film also directed by Rampage’s Brad Peyton) and G.I. Joe: Retaliation to $40.5 million. So, they may be in with a chance. Also opening, as mentioned, is Blumhouse’s horror film, Truth or Dare. The horror giant’s last four releases have been Insidious: The Last Key, Happy Death Day, Get Out and Split, with the lowest opening among them being $26.3 million. Between&nbsp;Rampage&nbsp;and&nbsp;Truth or Dare,&nbsp;and a solid hold by A Quiet Place, the top three films could all be over $20 million for the second weekend in a row. Until this week, that&nbsp;not happened since the very first weekend this year when Jumanji, Insidious and The Last Jedi topped the charts.The Full Top 10: April 6-8A Quiet Place&nbsp;– $50.0 million ($50.0 million total)Ready Player One&nbsp;–&nbsp;$25.0 million ($96.9 million total)Blockers&nbsp;–&nbsp;$21.4 million ($21.4 million total)Black Panther&nbsp;–&nbsp;$8.4 million ($665.3 million total)I Can Only Imagine&nbsp;–&nbsp;$8.3 million ($69.0 million total)Tyler Perry’s&nbsp;Acrimony&nbsp;– $8.0 million ($31.3 million total)Chappaquiddick&nbsp;–&nbsp;$6.2 million ($6.2 million total)Sherlock Gnomes&nbsp;–&nbsp;$5.6 million ($33.8 million total)Pacific: Rim Uprising&nbsp;–&nbsp;$4.9 million ($54.9 million total)Isle of Dogs&nbsp;–&nbsp;$4.6 million ($11.1 million total)– Erik Childress can be heard each week evaluating box office on WGN Radio with Nick Digilio as well as on Business First AM with Angela Miles and his Movie Madness Podcast.[box office figures via Box Office Mojo]","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"FXX, USA, films, tv, slashers, movie, TV, Us, directors, police, archives, adaptation","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/08124758/Quiet-Place-rep.jpg","slug":"weekend-box-office-results-a-quiet-place-screams-into-the-record-books"},{"id":"47509093229062","title":"Box Office: Ready Player One is Steven Spielberg’s Best Opening in a Decade","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office: Ready Player One is Steven Spielberg's Best Opening in a Decadeby Gitesh Pandya | April 1, 2018 |  CommentsSteven Spielberg returned to mainstream sci-fi cinema and generated his biggest opening in ten years with the futuristic adventure Ready Player One which easily ruled the Easter holiday frame. The Warner Bros. release debuted to an estimated $41.2M over the Friday-to-Sunday span averaging a solid $9,733 from 4,234 locations. Opening on Thursday with Wednesday night pre-shows, the PG-13 actioner kicked off its run with an impressive $53.2M across four days. 12% of that came from 405 IMAX screens.It was the largest opening weekend of Spielberg’s career since the $100.1M of 2008’s Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. Reviews were overwhelmingly positive for Ready and paying crowds were also pleased. The CinemaScore grade was a promising A-. Studio data indicated that the audience was 59% male and appeal was spread across a broad age range with 26% of the crowd being under 18, 42% falling into the 18-35 category, and 32% being over 35. With good buzz and many schools on spring break this week, the road ahead looks bright.Based on the best-selling book, but also offering some changes, Ready Player One did not have major stars but instead was sold on the source material, the director’s name, and the promise of a dazzling visual spectacle. The $175M-budgeted film generated the second biggest opening weekend of 2018 after only Black Panther.Ready Player One also rocked the global box office opening to a stellar $128M from international territories this weekend for a potent worldwide launch of $181.2M. China led the way as usual with a mighty $61.7M in three days which was a new company record for Warners. This marked the third consecutive weekend when a Hollywood action tentpole opened bigger in China than in the U.S. Last weekend it was Pacific Rim Uprising ($64.9M vs $28.1M) and the week before was Tomb Raider ($41.3M vs $23.6M). With Germany and Japan still to come, Ready Player One has a good shot at reaching the $500-600M range in global box office by the end of the run.Tyler Perry attracted solid business for his latest film Acrimony which debuted in second place with an estimated $17.1M from 2,006 locations for a healthy $8,524 average. The R-rated film was anchored by Taraji P. Henson and skewed heavily to adult women – 74% of the crowd was female and 85% was over 25. Audiences spent their money on diversity at the box office as the top ten included four films led by African-American stars and three films led by women.Another week, another milestone for Black Panther. The biggest super hero movie of all-time ranked third in its seventh weekend of play and grossed an estimated $11.3M propelling the domestic cume over the $650M mark with a robust $650.7M. The T’Challa megahit will pass Jurassic World‘s $652.3M in a matter of days to take the number four spot on the all-time domestic list on its way to a final in the $680M area. With an additional $623.2M from international markets, Black Panther currently stands at $1.27 billion worldwide which is number 11 all-time. The global final looks on course to reach roughly $1.32 billion which is an incredible result.The faith-based smash I Can Only Imagine held up very well over Easter weekend dropping only 21% to an estimated $10.8M boosting the cume for Roadside Attractions to $55.6M which is the highest in company history. It was one of three faith-based films that made the Top 12 this holiday weekend. Pacific Rim Uprising collapsed in its second weekend as shaky word of mouth and direct competition took their toll. The Universal release tumbled 67% to an estimated $9.2M for a cume of $45.7M. After ten days it is running 33% behind the pace of 2013’s Pacific Rim. Toon offering Sherlock Gnomes dipped 34% in its second frame to an estimated $7M giving Paramount $22.8M to date. Fox’s Love, Simon followed with an estimated $4.8M, off 37%, for a $32.1M sum.The action reboot Tomb Raider declined by 54% to an estimated $4.7M lifting the total to $50.5M for Warner Bros. Disney’s A Wrinkle in Time was tied with the same estimate, falling 43%, and has banked $83.3M. Global cumes are now $245.1M and $104.4M, respectively. Rounding out the top ten was Paul, Apostle of Christ which dropped 32% to an estimated $3.5M giving Sony $11.5M overall.Below the top ten, Wes Anderson‘s new animated film Isle of Dogs expanded and reached number eleven with an estimated $2.8M from only 165 theaters for a solid $17,030 average. Fox Searchlight will further widen the acclaimed pic next weekend into nearly 500 locations.

Again. Both I Feel Pretty and Super Troopers 2 opened stronger than expected. But neither could stand up to the one film most moviegoers can agree is the must-see of the moment: John Krasinski’s A Quiet Place reclaimed the top spot at the box office, maintaining its pace for between $190 million to $200 million domestic, as Rampage took a plunge.King of the Crop: I Feel Pretty Exceeds ExpectationsAmy Schumer’s Trainwreck opened to a robust $30 million and 86% Tomatometer score in summer 2015. Two years later her follow-up, Snatched (boasting the return of Goldie Hawn after a 15-year absence from the big screen) opened to a decent $19.5 million; however, the film, with a weak 36% Tomatometer score and boosted by a Mother’s Day weekend campaign, petered out quickly with just a 2.34 multiple for only a $45.8 million total. STX sold I Feel Pretty’s premise to $16 million this weekend, which, on one hand, is another drop for Schumer, but not nearly the kind predicted by tracking, which barely had it in the teens.The track record of screenwriters Abby Kohn and Marc Silverstein (who make their directorial debut here) has some impressive box office numbers despite some critical drubbings. They include Never Been Kissed (57% Tomatometer score / $11.8 million opening / 4.68 multiple / $55.4 million total), He’s Just Not That Into You (40% / $27.7 million / 3.38 / $93.9 million), Valentine’s Day (where they just had story credit) (18% / $56.2 million / 1.96 / $110.4 million ), and The Vow (29% / $41.2 million / 3.03 / $125 million). Those last three movies opened within two to eight days each of actual Valentine’s Day. Through the Hallmark holiday, those films had already, respectively, grossed 53%, 50.9%, and 44.8% of their final grosses. Critics were also not on board with I Feel Pretty (35%) and&nbsp;the film’s&nbsp;RT Audience Score is currently lower than that for&nbsp;Snatched (28% vs. 30%). If it follows that same path, the $32 million production is unlikely to accumulate the near $100 million worldwide it will need to turn a profit. Snatched did only $14 million internationally and $60 million total.Fresh Surprise: Broken Lizard Fans Show Their Support Like Never BeforeThe Broken Lizard brand has never grossed $20 million at the box office. Super Troopers 2 is going to do that in its first week. The crowdfunded sequel to the cult pickup from Sundance 16 years ago made more on Friday than Club Dread made in its entire run ($5 million.). This columnist’s belief that it’s far and away the troupe’s best film is at odds with Rotten Tomatoes’ collection of critics who rated it as their worst, scoring the film only a 29% on the Tomatometer. Then again their best rating is Beerfest’s 41% Tomatometer score with both Super Troopers and The Slammin’ Salmon coming in at 35%. Critics were not thrilled with the sequel either with just 33% of them rating it favorably. But their fans showed up like they never have before with a $14.7 million opening. Not too shabby for a film that raised $4.4 million after an initial request of just $2 million.Rotten Returns: Warner Bros. Could Be Looking at a Long SummerRampage continues to generate exponential increases over its initial weekend estimates — the film, expected to post a 51% drop, fell just 41%. With a little over $283 million worldwide, the film is still about $76 million away from getting into the black for Warner Bros. Speaking of WB, Ready Player One has become the sixth film of Steven Spielberg’s career (inflation notwithstanding) to gross over $500 million worldwide alongside E.T., Jurassic Park, The Lost World: Jurassic Park, War of the Worlds, and Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. (Jaws, Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, and Saving Private Ryan grossed over $450 million.) With due respect to international sensations, Operation Red Sea and Detective Chinatown 2, Ready Player One is the second highest-grossing (Stateside) release globally after Black Panther this year. But with a hefty all-in pricetag of around $300 million, the studio may be looking at the home market to recoup all costs. Given their summer lineup, too — Life of the Party, Tag, Teen Titans Go! to the Movies, The Meg, and Crazy Rich Asians — it is possible only one film, Ocean’s 8, will even touch the $100 million milestone in the States.Beyond the Top 10: Bharat&nbsp;Ane Nenu and The Rider Boast Top AveragesThe Telugu-language film, Bharat Ane Nenu, just missed the top 10 this week. With $2.85 million in just 305 theaters, it also boasted the best per-theater-average of the week with $9,344. Sony Classics’ The Rider (97% RT) added six more theaters (for a total of nine) to grab the second PTA of $8,715. It has made $142,768 in two weeks. (Super Troopers 2 had the third best PTA.)This Time Last Year: The Fate of the ForgettableThe Fate of the Furious dropped 61% in its second weekend, but still had plenty in the bank to win the weekend with $38.4 million. It was a weekend of forgotten newbies including Unforgettable&nbsp;($4.78 million) and Phoenix Forgotten ($1.8 million). Disney’s nature doc, Born in China, led all the new releases in sixth place with $4.79 million. The weekend also saw the release of the $90 million-financed disaster, The Promise, about the Armenian genocide released by then Open Road (now Global Road). It opened to $4 million and finished with $8.2 million. A24 also had their second wide release launch (after The Witch) with Ben Wheatley’s Free Fire. It opened in 1,070 theaters to just $994,431 and finished with just $1.79 million.On the Vine: Avengers Opens the Summer With Eyes on Numerous No. 1sAvengers: Infinity War, the first event movie of the summer opens a week earlier than originally announced, getting an extra jump on the upcoming Deadpool 2 and Solo: A Star Wars Story — all surely to be among the top five grossers of the summer. Infinity War should be the undisputed champion crossing at least the half-billion mark domestically and the full billion and then some worldwide. Can it ultimately beat Black Panther, which, this weekend, passed $681 million domestic? Unlikely, given the direct challengers that will face off against the Avengers sooner rather than later. On the other hand, do not be surprised if the film opens to the third (maybe second) highest opening weekend ever, reclaiming the Marvel record while Black Panther continues to linger in the top 10 for its 11th straight week.The Full Top 10: April 20-221. A Quiet Place – $22 million ($132 million total)2. Rampage – $21 million ($66 million total)3. I Feel Pretty – $16.2 million ($16.2 million total)4.

Following two red hot weeks in second place in the shadow of&nbsp;The Last Jedi,&nbsp;Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle&nbsp;enjoyed a terrific hold dropping only 28% to an estimated $36M leading all films in North America this weekend.The Sony smash averaged $9,471 per theater – an incredible figure for any film’s third weekend.&nbsp;Jumanji&nbsp;has already climbed to an eye-popping $244.4M domestic and has the potential to add another $100M to its treasure by the end of the run. For Dwayne Johnson, this is now the third highest grossing film of his career after&nbsp;Furious 7&nbsp;and&nbsp;Moana&nbsp;while for Kevin Hart it ranks number two behind the animated film&nbsp;The Secret Life of Pets. This is the second pairing of Johnson and Hart after&nbsp;Central Intelligence.With audiences having a wild time filled with laughs and adventure, recommendations have been key in getting more ticket buyers to show up. With next weekend’s Martin Luther King holiday frame giving the box office a boost, there is still plenty of business to come.&nbsp;Jumanji&nbsp;may even surpass&nbsp;Spider-Man: Homecoming&nbsp;to become the fifth biggest blockbuster to come out of 2017.Globally, Jumanji&nbsp;crushed the half-billion mark this weekend and will enter China this coming Friday for what should be a powerful debut, especially with Johnson going to Beijing just days ago to promote there. The international total is now $275M putting worldwide at $519M.Opening to fantastic results in second place was the horror sequel&nbsp;Insidious: The Last Key&nbsp;which took in an estimated $29.3M from 3,116 locations for a stellar $9,392 average. Early January is often used by studios for new fright films as the feel-good holiday season finishes and genre audiences go back to what they crave, often with no good films since&nbsp;Halloween. The Universal release powered ahead of the $22.7M of the last film in the series,&nbsp;Insidious: Chapter 3&nbsp;from the summer of 2015. Four films into a series, this usually does not happen.The studio marketed the PG-13 thriller very well and although critics were not on their side, audiences instead responded to the promotional push and liked what they got. The CinemaScore was a B- which is pretty good for horror films. The new&nbsp;Insidious&nbsp;had broad appeal as studio data indicated that the crowd was split 51/49 female/male. 59% were under 25 and 57% were non-white. Sony is distributing overseas where the weekend saw an estimated $20.1M from 33 markets. The Insidious&nbsp;franchise has now grossed over $400M worldwide and counting with production budgets for the four-pack combining to a mere $27M. Low budget horror is still alive and well in the new year.Suffering the largest drop in the top ten was&nbsp;Star Wars: The Last Jedi&nbsp;which tumbled 55% to an estimated $23.6M boosting the domestic cume to an astounding $572.5M which is number six all-time. 24 days into its run and the new episode is running 30% behind the pace of The Force Awakens&nbsp;but 20% ahead of Rogue One. All released at the same time of year in mid-December and benefitted from the holiday season.&nbsp;Last Jedi&nbsp;was very close in gross and decline to&nbsp;Rogue One‘s fourth frame from a year ago when it did $22.1M falling 56%. The newest&nbsp;Star Wars&nbsp;is eroding a bit faster than&nbsp;Rogue One&nbsp;so a final of about $635M now seems likely for a drop of 32% from&nbsp;Force Awaken‘s all-time record of $936.7M. This coming Christmas will have no&nbsp;Star Wars&nbsp;film but&nbsp;Episode IX&nbsp;opens on December 20 of 2019 concluding the current trilogy.Overseas,&nbsp;The Last Jedi&nbsp;opened in China, its final market, with less than impressive results. The weekend estimate is $28.7M which is slightly below&nbsp;Rogue One. But even recent action films&nbsp;Geostorm&nbsp;and&nbsp;The Mummy&nbsp;opened better in China. The international total on&nbsp;Jedi&nbsp;rose to $632.7M putting the global gross at $1.2 billion with the final trajectory heading to $1.4 billion. While some may have expected more, this is still a massive gross for any film and will challenge&nbsp;Avengers: Age of Ultron&nbsp;for number seven all time.Displaying fantastic legs, the Hugh Jackman-led musical The Greatest Showman&nbsp;dipped only 11% to an estimated $13.8M boosting Fox’s cume to $76.9M to date. Among all the actor’s live action films where he is not playing Wolverine, this PG-rated crowdpleaser is quickly becoming one of his top career grossers as it heads into the $100M club joining&nbsp;Van Helsing&nbsp;($120.1M) and the musical&nbsp;Les Miserables&nbsp;($148.8M).Pitch Perfect 3 followed with an estimated $10.2M, down 39% from last weekend, putting Universal at $86M as it runs 42% behind the pace of its 2015 predecessor. The Fox toon Ferdinand&nbsp;was off 32% to an estimated $7.7M for a new cume of $70.5M.Aaron Sorkin’s film&nbsp;Molly’s Game&nbsp;starring Jessica Chastain expanded nationwide and saw decent results with an estimated $7M from 1,608 locations for a $4,356 average for STX. Focus followed closely with its play for adult audiences, and awards voters, Darkest Hour&nbsp;which grossed an estimated $6.4M, up 16% after another expansion. Totals to date are $14.2M and $28.4M, respectively.Pixar’s hit animated film Coco&nbsp;dipped only 26% to an estimated $5.5M lifting Disney’s domestic sum to $192.1M with global now up to $589.1M. Sony’s All the Money in the World&nbsp;rounded out the top ten with an estimated $3.6M, down 36%, and $20.1M overall.The top ten films grossed an estimated $143M which was up a healthy 19% from last year when&nbsp;Hidden Figures&nbsp;took over the number one spot with $22.8M; and dead even with 2016 when&nbsp;The Force Awakens&nbsp;remained in the top spot for a fourth time with&nbsp;$42.4M.Get earlier box office updates and analysis by following BoxOfficeGuru.com on&nbsp;Twitter.","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"Fantasy, green, king, guild, VICE, kong, Classic, National, nbcuniversal, Mary","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/07135416/RT_BoxOffice_Jumanji_600X314.jpg","slug":"box-office-jumanji-wins-1-spot-soaring-to-500m-worldwide"},{"id":"47508689846135","title":"Daddy Issues Fuel The Umbrella Academy’s Weird Superhero Family","content":"Comics On TVvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Daddy Issues Fuel The Umbrella Academy’s Weird Superhero FamilySeries stars Ellen Page, Tom Hopper, Mary J. Blige, and more reveal the toxic environments that created Netflix's new superheroes.by Erik Amaya | February 7, 2019 |  CommentsWhen audiences discover The Umbrella Academy&nbsp;on Netflix, they will be introduced to a very different sort of superhero family. As actor Aidan Gallagher, who plays the time-lost Number Five, put it when Rotten Tomatoes spoke with the cast, “[The characters] are not seen at great heights.” Instead, the series focuses on the group, formerly a teen superhero team with fantastic abilities, at “rock bottom a lot of times.”As in the graphic novel series by Gerard Way and Gabriel Ba upon which the show is based, the characters face the legacy of a choice made by their adoptive father Sir Reginald Hargreeves (Colm Feore). In the series backstory, a number of children were born at the same time on the same day despite the fact their mothers — themselves not connected in any way — had not been pregnant when the day began. Already a famous adventurer, Hargreeves tries to adopt these special children, and succeeds at collecting&nbsp;several of them. He surmised that they would have extraordinary abilities and prove instrumental in saving the world.(Photo by Netflix)Click to view full image.Spectacularly ill-equipped to raise children, Hargreeves failed to give them names; they would receive them after Number Five disappeared around age 12. Treating them as test subjects and then as tools to prop up his planned superhero team, Hargreeves left the children with serious cases of emotional neglect.“On top of dealing with the emotional neglect and narcissism of the father, they are obviously going into extremely violent situations. So they have that added layer of insanity,”&nbsp;Ellen Page, who plays Vanya, noted when Rotten Tomatoes spoke with the series’ stars.“They weren’t allowed to be kids,” explained Emmy Raver-Lampman, who plays Allison (formerly Number Three).In lieu of “running around and scraping their knees,” the kids were subjected to rigorous training regimens to hone their abilities. Allison’s, for example, allows her to plant powerful suggestions in peoples’ minds. The situation only became worse as the kids reached an age at which Hargreeves could present them to the public as the Umbrella Academy.“They also had the weight of the world on their shoulders,” Raver-Lampman said. “Being put in situations where they’re seeing horribly graphic stuff and doing very violent things to other humans at such a young age.”(Photo by Netflix)Click to view full image.Tom Hopper, who plays devoted son Luther (aka Number One) explained: “They’re all massively affected by their relationship with their dad.” As he continues to be loyal to Hargreeves when the series begins, he faces a great challenge when his father turns up dead: forcing the family to reunite for a funeral and an investigation into his death.But all of the children, now adults (even Number Five, though he looks 12 thanks to some time-travel weirdness), must come to grips with the neglect and abuse Hargreeves inflicted upon them. It is part of the reason David Castañeda, who plays Diego (Number Two), has a hard time seeing Umbrella Academy as being anything like a traditional superhero show. “There was this [aspect] about child abuse,” he said. At it happens, Diego operates like traditional vigilante with police contacts and other familiar trappings. But unlike many other television vigilantes (and some members of the Academy), he accesses his emotions in a more open way.(Photo by Netflix)Click to view full image.“He’s very much outspoken in what he feels,” Castañeda said.&nbsp; “And he’s not afraid to kinda react on them.” His willingness to react brings him into conflict with the more closed-off Luther on many occasions.Unlike Diego, Klaus (Number Four) numbs out the pain of the neglect (and the literal voices of the dead his ability allows him to hear) with copious amounts of drugs and alcohol. The dichotomy of a broken superhero attracted actor Robert Sheehan to the part.“It’s much more interesting, I think, to show people who are supposedly super or have these allegedly super abilities couched in a very normal, familial, dysfunctional context,” Sheehan explained. “All the great comic books are abstract manifestations of existing human qualities. Super strength, invisibility, these are all emotional states you might say that have been abstracted. The show takes the focus off the ability and focuses on the emotional state that causes the ability.”(Photo by Netflix)Click to view full image.Of all the children, Vanya has the strongest&nbsp;claim that Hargreeves neglected her. Despite being born under the same circumstances as the others, Vanya never manifested powers. Consequently, Hargreeves isolated her from the other children, and she never became a number of the Umbrella Academy. But her pain goes deeper than just Hargreeves’ emotional neglect.“Vanya has this extra layer in terms of just being ostracized by the whole family,” Page explained. “[She’s] just so profoundly isolated and constantly reminded that she wasn’t special, so she grows up with such a deep sense of worthlessness.”When audiences meet Vanya, they will see someone who has internalized that isolation and witness the toll it takes on her — even as she is forced into contact with her family after many years.Nevertheless, the sense that the characters were neglected as children permeates the series – even infecting the outlook of antagonists Hazel (Cameron Britton) and Cha-Cha (Mary J. Blige), a pair of time-traveling assassins with instructions to eliminate one of the Hargreeves clan.“I think Cha-Cha is emotional neglect,” Britton joked.“She was definitely neglected somewhere in her life,” Blige added.And just as Umbrella Academy spins its heroes into survivors of childhood emotional neglect, its villains also face some serious soul searching during their latest mission. “How often do you have a bad guy like Hazel that doesn’t know who he is? Bad guys always know who they are,” Britton said. “They’ve always got that covered, but he’s mixed up and torn up and his only friend in the whole world, his only companion he could relate to in any way, is a f—ing sociopath.”(Photo by Netflix)Click to view full image.Though the characters face a tough battle in coming to terms with the neglect they suffered in the past, Umbrella Academy takes them on a journey with as much humor as melancholy. According to Sheehan, it reflects the “great conundrum of the tragicomedy of being alive.”But was Hargreeves really the cruel and distant father his adopted children believe him to be?“I feel like he imagined they would serve a purpose, which is one day save the world, and he doesn’t fool himself into thinking he has to love them to do that,” executive producer and showrunner Steve Blackman explained. “They are these special things, and he will train them and he will bring them to this place. But he’s forgotten that there’s emotions involved with these little kids, and he’s completely removed himself from that, to their detriment.”(Photo by Netflix)Click to view full image.Umbrella Academy co-creator Way had a different take on Hargreeves: “I don’t think he’s as much of a monster as he looks like,” he said. Though, with a moment’s reflection, he added, “he is and was a monster to those kids. That’s indisputable.”And, perhaps, embracing that fact will allow the members of the Umbrella Academy (and Vanya) a space to heal – although Sheehan is convinced they will have to heal together.“For better or for worse, these siblings are bonded together for life because they all went through a relatively similar emotional trauma that was unique to their family,” he said. “And I think the closest they can come to peace is when they’re together, which ultimately is sort of a catch-22 because they all remind each other of that dynamic and that trauma growing up. But they are emotionally strongest when they are facing the world together.”(Photo by Netflix)Click to view full image.The Umbrella Academy launches on Netflix on February 15, 2019.&nbsp;&nbsp;","section":"Comics on TV","tags":"See, Logo, ViacomCBS, police, American, Superheroes, elevated, psychological, Apple, on, elm, Walking","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/07150224/UmbrellaAcademy-700x3801.jpg","slug":"the-umbrella-academy-weird-superhero-family-on-their-daddy-issues"},{"id":"47509092086262","title":"Weekend Box Office Results: Equalizer Delivers Justice Over Mamma Mia","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Weekend Box Office Results: Equalizer Delivers Justice Over Mamma MiaPlus Eighth Grade and Blindspotting draw indie crowds on the weekend of July 20-22.by Erik Childress | July 22, 2018 |  CommentsThe first Equalizer had been Antoine Fuqua’s greatest domestic success to date, and his only to (barely) make over $100 million. Mamma Mia, on the other hand, was a $144 million domestic hit – with nine years of theatrical sing-alongs leading up to its sequel – with a worldwide tally that bests Fuqua’s King Arthur, Equalizer, The Magnificent Seven, The Replacement Killers, and Bait combined. In this weekend’s battle of the sequels, the headline was set to read “ABBA Beats Denzel.” But then the tides turned.King of the Crop: Equalizer 2 Give’s Fuqua His Best Opening Ever(Photo by Glen Wilson /© Columbia Pictures /Courtesy Everett Collection)Sony was on the low-end of expectations this weekend for Equalizer 2, preparing for a decent if unremarkable number around $27 million. The Equalizer&nbsp;started with $34.1 million, but the sequel safely beat it with $35.8m. Antoine Fuqua may not have set the box office on fire in the past but Denzel Washington certainly has, with&nbsp;Equalizer 2&nbsp;is now the third highest opening of his career, behind American Gangster and Safe House. It is also the third collaboration (out of four) between actor and filmmaker to open between $34-$36 million.&nbsp;Only two of Denzel’s seven films to open over $25 million have managed to do a 3x multiple upon their first weekend (Safe House&nbsp;and&nbsp;Inside Man). And only one of them (The Book of Eli) had a lower critical score (47% on the Tomatometer) than The Equalizer 2 (51%).Seven films since 2014 have opened to less than $36 million during the summer and managed to hit $100 million:&nbsp;Baby Driver, Central Intelligence, and Edge of Tomorrow were three, and you may notice something in common with the other four (Girls Trip, Bad Moms, Trainwreck, and Spy). With Mission: Impossible – Fallout set to take over next weekend,&nbsp;Fuqua&nbsp;and Denzel may still not have the numbers to equal their previous success and are not expecting&nbsp;a big international tally either. But stay tuned.(Not-So) Fresh Surprise: Mamma Mia Narrowly Misses #1(Photo by Jonathan Prime /© Universal Studios /Courtesy Everett Collection)Mamma Mia opened on July 18, 2008 to $27.7 million. Though hardly a critical favorite, with just a 54% Tomatometer rating, it had a 10-week stay in the Top 10. Critics have given in to the sequel a bit more, with a 79% on the Tomatometer. Despite falling back from initial estimates of a $40+ million weekend, Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again’s $34.3 million is nothing to sneeze at given how musicals have been doing recently.Both Les Miserables and Mamma Mia had incredible final multiples – over 5x&nbsp;– finishing with $148 and $144 million, respectively. La La Land grossed over $151 million. This past December,&nbsp;The Greatest Showman opened to just $8.8 million in 3,006 venues and ended up with the second highest-multiple ever (19.79x) for a film to open on over 2,500 theaters in that month. (Highest ever is&nbsp;Titanic‘s&nbsp;20.97x). So, with basically only The Spy Who Dumped Me and Crazy Rich Asians geared towards women next month, Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again should be enjoying healthy returns until at least mid-August, if not past Labor Day. It has grossed an additional $42.4 million outside the U.S. already.Rotten Returns: The Dark Web Put Back In The Shadows(Photo by Blumhouse)Universal got Blumhouse’s Unfriended: Dark Web into just 1,546 theaters this weekend, considerably&nbsp;fewer than the 2,739 the first film opened with in 2015, where it grossed $15.8 million on its opening weekend. That three-day start is likely going to be more than what Dark Web finishes with in total after just a $3.49 million weekend. It’s 57%&nbsp;Tomatometer&nbsp;is not much lower than the first film’s 63%, but this is a low-end departure for the production company whose recent releases include Insidious: The Last Key ($29.5 million opening), Happy Death Day ($26 million), The First Purge ($19.9 million from Wednesday-Friday), and Truth or Dare ($18.6 million), all of which opened in over 3,000 screens. Perhaps it was a smart move for Sony to move its Sundance pickup (and computer-windows narrative),&nbsp;Searching, from August 3 to August 24. The John Cho-starring thriller currently stands with a 95% Tomatometer.Beyond the Top Ten: Eighth Grade Keeps Momentum and Blindspotting Opens StrongBo Burnham’s Eighth Grade&nbsp;moved from 4 into 33 theaters this weekend and grossed another $794,370 at $24,072 per theater, boasting the second-highest per-theater-average of the weekend behind documentary&nbsp;McQueen&nbsp;(which had a $24,232 average from four theaters). Lionsgate’s Blindspotting&nbsp;pulled in a $23,750 average in 14 theaters, and a total of $332,500 in its first weekend. As for documentaries, Neon’s&nbsp;Three Identical Strangers&nbsp;added 166 theaters and has now grossed $4.5 million; Focus’s&nbsp;Won’t You Be My Neighbor?&nbsp;is now at $18.4 million and is now the 14th highest-grossing doc ever.This Time Last Year: Dunkirk and Girls Trip&nbsp;Succeeds, Valerian Fails(Photo by Warner Bros)Christopher Nolan’s Dunkirk took the top spot with a $50 million opening, Girls Trip struck gold&nbsp;with over $31 million as well. Dunkirk would become the 5th highest-grossing film of the summer while Girls Trip would finish a surprising 10th. Luc Besson’s Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets opened to just $17 million on its way to becoming the second-biggest loser of the summer, behind King Arthur: Legend of the Sword. Last year’s Top 10 haul of $172.9 million for this weekend, with an average critical score of 77.3% on the Tomatometer, is well ahead of 2018’s $154.2 million and 67.4%, but this is still the strongest summer for Hollywood since 2015. And that’s without the first week haul of Avengers: Infinity War being factored in.On the Vine: Mission: Impossible Set To Rule Into August(Photo by Paramount)Next week is the action film everyone is waiting for. Skyscraper&nbsp;was a local bust and Equalizer 2 did fine, though neither were embraced roundly by critics. Mission: Impossible – Fallout is likely to get the money along with the good reviews.&nbsp;Also opening is Teen Titans Go to the Movies, which has only generated 10 reviews so far (compared to M:I’s 67) but they add up to a perfect 100% so far.

Chu’s film would hold its number 1 spot this week against a challenge from a bunch of dirty puppets, but even the most optimistic estimates did not plan on CRA&nbsp;nearly equaling its opening weekend with $25 million. That’s the best second weekend, in terms of drops, for a box office winner this year. With the upcoming Labor Day weekend – which it pretty much has all to itself – the first chapter of what we assume will now be a cinematic trilogy is headed towards numbers that live up to its title.King of the Crop:&nbsp;Crazy Rich Asians&nbsp;on path to all-time August greatness(Photo by © Warner Bros. )&nbsp;A 5.7% drop from its opening weekend! That’s all&nbsp;Crazy Rich Asians&nbsp;experienced this weekend, earning&nbsp;$25 million following last weekend’s haul of $26.5 million. How does that track against past August over-performers? The previous five best (that is smallest) drops in August for films opening with $20 million or more, on more than 2,000 screens, are as follows: The Sixth Sense (-3.4%), The Fugitive (-5.6%), Clear and Present Danger (-21.5%), The Help (23.1%), and The 40 Year Old Virgin (-24%). All of those films were solid hits with total domestic grosses ranging from $109 million all the way up to $293 million. Crazy Rich Asians will likely settle somewhere in-between – though we’d be foolish to underestimate it at this point.But let’s break the numbers down even further.As of Friday, Crazy Rich Asians was on par with where 2013’s&nbsp;We’re the Millers and 2011’s&nbsp;The Help were sitting at this stage in their runs&nbsp;(both August releases earned $57.1 million in their first 10 days; CRA&nbsp;had&nbsp;$58.8 million). We’re the Millers,&nbsp;which&nbsp;would have been sixth&nbsp;on that drop list above, with a solid -32%, had grossed $69.6 million by the end of its second weekend, and finished with over $150 million. The Help had $71.3 million by the end of its second weekend and went on to earn $169.7 million. Crazy Rich Asians&nbsp;is at an estimated $76.8 million as of Sunday. If the pattern holds, Warner Bros. should be smiling.Rotten Returns:&nbsp;A.X.L. Proves&nbsp;Nobody’s Best Friend(Photo by Global Road)Global Road, formerly known as Open Road Films, continues its streak of box office disappointments. As reported here before,&nbsp;it has not opened a film to $10 million since Halloween weekend 2014, with Nightcrawler, starring Jake Gyllenhaal. Of the 31 films the studio has opened in over 2,000 screens in its nearly six-year history, only six&nbsp;have reached that $10 million opening mark. This weekend Global Road&nbsp;released A.X.L.&nbsp;(22% on the Tomatometer) in just 1,710 theaters, and it grossed $2.9 million. That is a per-theater-average of just $2,060. On the bright side, it is the best opening-weekend PTA under the Global Road banner for the year: their 2018 releases include Show Dogs ($1,875 PTA), Midnight Sun ($1,843), and Hotel Artemis ($1,343).The rest of the Top 10 and Beyond:&nbsp;Happytime&nbsp;Fails to Connect As&nbsp;Mission&nbsp;Shows Few Signs of Falling(Photo by © STX)For the second week in a row, STX put out a film that will come up significantly short of its cost. Last weekend’s Mile 22 took a 56% tumble and is barely going to get over $30 million when all is said and done. Now The Happytime Murders, with a reported $40 million budget (not including prints and advertising), opened to just $10 million. Laying this at the feet of Melissa McCarthy is a little unfair, since this is more of a dirty-puppet vehicle, but her previous lowest opening as a leading human was this summer’s Life of the Party with $17.8 million. The average gross of films opening in the&nbsp;Happytime&nbsp;range in August is $35.2 million, but word-of-mouth coupled with its 23%&nbsp;Tomatometer score&nbsp;may make even that goal unattainable.Mission: Impossible – Fallout will be crossing the $200 million line next weekend. It&nbsp;has earned over $538 million worldwide and is well into profit for Paramount with China coming next week. Warner Bros.’ big-budgeted The Meg crossed the $100 million mark domestically and $400 million worldwide, and is likely to keep swimming forward with big earnings across Labor Day domestically. Spike Lee’s BlacKkKlansman took in another $5 million this weekend after Focus expanded it once again to an additional 126 theaters. At this rate it should become the&nbsp;third&nbsp;highest-grossing film of&nbsp;Lee’s career and amongst the&nbsp;15 biggest domestic grossers for Focus Features. Bleecker Street’s 546-theater release of the remake of Papillon (54% on the Tomatometer) grossed just $1.1 million, which is less than their 2016 August release of spy film, Anthropoid, which made $1.23 million in just 452 theaters.This Time Last Year:&nbsp;Leap&nbsp;Can’t Compete with Hitmen and Horror Dolls(Photo by © Warner Bros. )The final weekend of August was led by holdovers, The Hitman’s Bodyguard and Annabelle: Creation. The best of the new releases was the second-to-last wide release of the disgraced Weinstein Company. Animated ballet flick&nbsp;Leap!&nbsp;grossed just $4.7 million on its first weekend, but had a reasonable final turnover with nearly $22 million in the U.S. The Bruce Lee tale, Birth of the Dragon,&nbsp;mustered $2.7 million, just $80,000 more than the&nbsp;Mayweather vs. McGregor fight grossed on 532 screens. Last year’s total top 10 box office for this weekend came to $46.1 million; this year’s estimates come to $85 million.On the Vine: Kin&nbsp;Makes Play for Sci-Fi Fans, Acclaimed&nbsp;Searching&nbsp;Goes Wide(Photo by © Screen Gems)Summer limps into Labor Day weekend with its widest release in Kin, Lionsgate’s modern answer to Laserblast, co-starring Miles Truitt, James Franco, Dennis Quaid, Jack Reynor, and Zoë Kravitz. The highly acclaimed Sundance Audience Award winner, Searching, with John Cho and Debra Messing, expands into over 1,000 theaters. The thriller currently sits at 92%&nbsp;on the Tomatometer and grossed $360,000 this weekend in just nine locations – that’s a killer average of $40,000 per theater. Finally, Focus puts The Little Stranger, Lenny Abrahamson’s follow-up to his Oscar-winning Room, into limited release.The Full Top 10: August 24-August 26Crazy Rich Asians –&nbsp;$25 million ($76.8 million total)The Meg – $13 million ($105.3 million total)The Happytime Murders –&nbsp;$10 million ($10 million totalMission: Impossible – Fallout&nbsp;–&nbsp;$8 million ($193.9 million total)Christopher Robin&nbsp;–&nbsp;$6.3 million ($77.6 million total)Mile 22 –&nbsp;$6 million ($25.1 million total)Alpha – $5.6 million ($20.1 million total)BlacKkKlansman&nbsp;–&nbsp;$5.3 million ($32 million total)A.X.L.&nbsp;– $2.9 million ($2.9 million total)Slender Man&nbsp;–&nbsp;$2.8 million ($25.4 million total)Erik Childress can be heard each week evaluating box office on WGN Radio with Nick Digilio as well as on Business First AM with Angela Miles and his Movie Madness Podcast.[box office figures via Box Office Mojo]","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"joker, FirstLook, Trek, Worst, in, Hear, comedy, Watching, Captain, Pixar, Plus","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/26083851/Crazy-Rep.jpg","slug":"weekend-box-office-results-crazy-rich-asians-number-1-for-second-week-with-25-million"},{"id":"47509126068036","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: The Vow Leads Booming Box Office","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: The Vow Leads Booming Box Officeby Gitesh Pandya | February 13, 2012 |  CommentsAudiences poured into North American multiplexes sending grosses sky high as for the first time in box office history, four new releases simultaneously opened north of $20M each over a non-holiday frame. Plus, existing films managed relatively good holds despite the new competition. In fact, overall business even beat out the levels seen recently over the busy Thanksgiving, Christmas, and New Year’s weekends.Leading the busy frame was the spectacular debut of the romantic drama The Vow which bowed to an estimated $41.7M as the Channing Tatum-Rachel McAdams love story connected with its target audience of young women. Inspired by a true story, the PG-13 film about a man who must make his newlywed wife fall in love with him again after she loses her memory in an accident soared above expectations and was successfully made into an event film for the female audience by Sony’s marketing. Starpower was a major factor as Tatum scored with this audience two years ago with Dear John which debuted to $30.5M over Super Bowl weekend. McAdams has had her own share of romance hits with The Notebook and The Time Traveler’s Wife giving Vow a one-two punch of big names for both lead roles.Sony knew its audience and aggressively promoted the film creating lots of anticipation especially on social media platforms. The release date right ahead of Valentine’s Day was not an accident and sales should continue to stay solid in the coming days. A marketplace filled with action movies created a void that the romance took full advantage of. Vow opened in 2,958 theaters and averaged a sizzling $14,097 delivering the sixth best February debut ever. Reviews were not very positive and audiences were only moderately pleased with what they got as the film’s CinemaScore grade was only a B. Studio research showed that the crowd was 72% female and 55% under 25. Energizing the box office, the $30M production generated the best opening weekend of any film since the latest Twilight installment last November which coincidentally debuted on home video this weekend.Though he didn’t take control of first place, Denzel Washington did score the second largest opening of his career with his latest action offering Safe House which collected an estimated $39.3M from 3,119 locations for a muscular $12,610 average. Universal’s $85M CIA thriller co-starring Ryan Reynolds also beat out industry expectations – as so many films this year have been doing. Reviews were mixed but Washington’s reliable fan base came out in full force thanks in part to a strong marketing push by the studio. The only film in the Oscar-winning actor’s career to open better was 2007’s American Gangster with $43.6M. Safe House, Gangster, and Training Day all featured Denzel Washington in “bad guy” roles. The bankable actor is one of those very rare stars in Hollywood who can consistently draw paying audiences in both good and bad roles. Fans love to root for his anti-hero characters.A hefty investment into marketing paid dividends for the R-rated pic. Licensing music from Jay Z and Kanye West for the TV spots could not have been cheap and buying a Super Bowl ad added to the marketing costs too. Washington hit the pavement promoting the film on each coast sitting down with both Letterman and Leno this past week in the days leading up to the opening. Washington and Reynolds both have sex appeal which broadened the audience for the action film as males and females were split evenly 50/50. That is impressive for a violent action film with lots of killing and gunplay promised in the ads. Safe House skewed older and ethnic as expected with 62% of the audience being 30 or older and 69% being non-white. The CinemaScore grade was an A- and Saturday increased by a nice 20% putting it just $100,000 behind The Vow that day.With Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson replacing Brendan Fraser as the anchor, Journey 2: The Mysterious Island enjoyed a strong debut in third place with an estimated $27.6M from 3,470 locations for a superb $7,939 average. The 3D follow-up to 2008’s summer pic Journey to the Center of the Earth was high on adventure and special effects and played well to the family crowd as evidenced by the astounding 94% surge on Saturday over the opening day. Island earned mixed reviews from critics but fared better with paying audiences who gave the PG-rated actioner a good A- CinemaScore. With the Presidents Day holiday coming up next week, many schools having week-long winter breaks in February, and no major kidpics coming until March’s The Lorax, the road ahead looks promising for the Warner Bros. sequel.Yet another new release followed in fourth place as the 3D upgrade of Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace opened to an estimated $23M from 2,655 theaters for a solid $8,663 average. The latest franchise re-release for George Lucas upped the lifetime domestic haul for Menace to $454.1M allowing the Jar Jar Binks pic to rise two spots to number five on the list of all-time domestic blockbusters. The director’s intention is to bring 3D versions of all six Star Wars films to the big screen, one year at a time. Fifteen years ago, Lucas and Fox collected a hefty $251.1M from the re-releases of the original trilogy – dubbed Special Editions – which were spaced about a month apart. Menace had a frontloaded weekend as fans rushed out on opening day as Friday saw $8.7M while Saturday dipped by 1%. All other new releases saw jumps on Saturday.With this new quartet, the number of $20M+ openers this year jumped to nine which is well ahead of last year’s four and 2010’s five. Total ticket sales every weekend this year have been better than the corresponding frame from last year with most cruising ahead by more than 20%. However, every weekend has also been down versus 2010 when Avatar was crushing box office records in the first quarter. Still, the industry has bounced back better than expected compared to the end of 2011 when so many films were underperforming. This year has seen at least seven films blow past expectations on opening weekend and the feverish spending has led to this weekend becoming the second largest February frame ever trailing only Presidents Day 2010 when three pics debuted to $30M+.The found-footage super hero hit Chronicle followed with an estimated $12.3M dropping only 44% in its second weekend which was terrific given the level of new action competition. The $12M production has banked an impressive $40.2M in ten days and should finish with about $65-70M for Fox. Rival sophomore The Woman in Black fell by 51% to an estimated $10.3M for a ten-day cume of $35.5M. It was a good hold for a film that had its core audience of young women yanked away by Channing Tatum. Look for the CBS Films title to reach roughly $55M.Qui-Gon Jinn popped up again in the top ten with The Grey which declined by 45% to an estimated $5.1M for a $42.8M total for Open Road. Drew Barrymore’s whale tale Big Miracle suffered a big drop falling 50% in its second weekend to an estimated $3.9M. With $13.2M in ten days, Universal’s $40M pic should end its run with a disappointing $20M.The Descendants, the only Best Picture contender still in the top ten, took ninth with an estimated $3.5M, off 23%, for a $70.7M sum to date for Fox Searchlight. Rounding out the top ten was Sony’s Underworld: Awakening with an estimated $2.5M, down 55%, for a $58.9M sum.Two of the three Best Picture nominees in wide release outside of the top ten posted decent holds on the road to Oscar Night. Front-runner The Artist collected an estimated $2.3M, down 13%, for a cume of $24M for The Weinstein Co. Its main challenger Hugo dipped 21% to an estimated $1.8M raising the total to $64.5M for Paramount. Things were not as promising for the Tom Hanks-Sandra Bullock drama Extremely Loud &amp; Incredibly Close which tumbled 60% to an estimated $1.5M. Warner Bros. has taken in $29.4M thus far and does not look to add much more to the total. Hanks has now had two clunkers in less than a year as last summer’s Larry Crowne was also rejected by ticket buyers.The top ten films grossed an estimated $169.1M which was up a hefty 32% from last year when Just Go With It opened in the top spot with $30.5M; but down 8% from 2010 when Valentine’s Day debuted at number one with $56.3M over the three-day portion of the long Presidents Day frame.","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"San, Tomatazos, Kids, Warner, and, Crackle, Syfy, razzies, canceled, watch, show, Spectrum, Epix","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-The-Vow-Leads-Booming-Box-Office"},{"id":"47509097575983","title":"Box Office: Cars 3 Revs Up Father’s Day Weekend","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office: Cars 3 Revs Up Father's Day Weekendby Sujit Chawla | June 18, 2017 |  CommentsHappy Father’s Day to all Dads out there past, present and future! Disney laid claim to the top spot once again this year with Cars 3, albeit with a somewhat disappointing opening, while the juggernaut named Wonder Woman continued its impressive run.Only the second Pixar franchise to get a third film (behind Toy Story), Cars 3 opened in the top spot this weekend with an estimated $53.5M from 4,256 theaters for a per screen average of $12,582. This is below the openings of both previous Cars films: the original Cars opened to $60.1M in 2006 and Cars 2 took in $66.1M in 2011. It’s the second worst Pixar opening during the summer months, ahead of only 2007s Ratatouille which opened to $47M. Critics have never been kind to the Cars franchise giving the films some of Pixar’s worst reviews. This iteration is only at 65% positive on Rotten Tomatoes, a step down from the 74% of the original but leagues ahead of the sequel which is at 39%. The target audience dug it though as it has an A rating on CinemaScore. Overseas Cars 3 started with an estimated $21.3M from a handful of locations with most major countries opening throughout the summer and early fall.Continuing its strong run and landing in second place was Wonder Woman which slipped only 30% in its third weekend to an estimated $40.8M, bringing its total up to $274.6M. Gitesh currently has it finishing its run at over $370M which would crush the totals of all the other films in the current DC Extended Universe. Internationally it added an estimated $39.5M bringing its total to $297.2M overseas and $571.8M globally. Its $40.8M weekend is the fourth best third weekend for a comic book film behind The Avengers, Spider-Man and The Dark Knight. Rarified air indeed.Opening above expectations in third place was the Tupac biopic All Eyez On Me which debuted with an estimated $27M from only 2,471 theaters for a per screen average of $10,947. Despite poor reviews (24% positive on Rotten Tomatoes), audiences loved what they saw giving the film an A- CinemaScore grade. Releasing the film on what would have been Tupac’s 46th birthday was a smart move and this shows that even two decades after his death, there is still appeal in his story.Cratering in its second weekend was the Dark Universe kick-off film, The Mummy which fell 56% to an estimated $13.9M, bringing its total up to $56M. A finish in the $85M range is likely. Overseas the film is doing much better raking in another $53M, according to estimates, bringing its international total to $239M. Only time will tell how much of an impact this makes on Universal’s future plans.Another film that opened above expectations was the shark attack thriller 47 Meters Down from Entertainment Studios. The PG-13 film starring Mandy Moore and Claire Holt took in an estimated $11.5M from 2,270 theaters for a per screen average of $5,066. Overcoming so-so reviews and a C CinemaScore grade, it looks like during the summer, sharks sell.Johnny Depp and Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales fell only 21% in its fourth weekend to an estimated $8.5M bringing its total to $150M. Internationally the film crossed the $500M mark this weekend.Having a rough weekend and debuting poorly in seventh place was Rough Night which opened to an estimated $8M from 3,162 theaters for a per screen average of only $2,543. Critic reviews were mixed but audiences were definitely not happy as the film has a poor C+ grade on CinemaScore. The future does not bode well for this one.Holdovers filled in the rest of the top 10. In its third weekend, the animated Captain Underpants took in an estimated $7.35M bringing its cume up to $58M. In ninth place was the number two film of the year, Guardians of the Galaxy Volume 2, which shot up an additional $4.9M, according to estimates, for a total of $374.8M. And in tenth place was the well reviewed horror film It Comes At Night which scared up $2.6M, according to estimates, in its second weekend, a fall of 56% from its opening. Total now stands at $11M with not much left in the tank.The top ten films grossed $146.8M which was down 20% from from last year when Finding Dory opened at number one with $135M; and down 25% from 2015 when Jurassic World remained in the top spot in its second weekend with $106.6M.","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"Biopics, lee, Shondaland, History, BET, Witch, cats, movies, camera","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/18145504/600Cars33.jpg","slug":"box-office-cars-3-revs-up-fathers-day-weekend"},{"id":"47509098902079","title":"Box Office: Get Out Scares Up a Huge Opening Weekend","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office: Get Out Scares Up a Huge Opening WeekendThe LEGO Batman Movie and John Wick: Chapter Two round out the top three.by Gitesh Pandya | February 26, 2017 |  CommentsCritics and audiences were both wildly happy with the new horror film Get Out which soared to number one over the Oscar frame with a sensational $30.5M launch, according to studio estimates. Blowing past expectations, the R-rated fright flick averaged a stellar $10,976 from 2,781 locations and is showing all the signs of a bright future ahead.Reviews were positive across the board and paying crowds polled by CinemaScore gave an A- grade which is extraordinary for the horror genre. Plus grosses went up 17% on Saturday from Friday’s opening day figure which included Thursday night pre-shows. A dip would be normal. The film scored the biggest Oscar weekend opening in seven years.Broad appeal is also helping the Universal hit. Studio data showed that the audience was split evenly between males and females and those over 25 made up 51% of the crowd. 39% were black, 36% were white, and 17% were Latino. Get Out tells of a black man meeting his white girlfriend’s parents during a weekend getaway only to face surprisingly horrific circumstances. Jordan Peele, known for his comedy series Key &amp; Peele, made his writing and directing debut here.Get Out is the latest moneymaker for Blumhouse which also produced Split which held the number one spot for three weeks this year. In both cases, a small budget plus creative freedom were given to a talented filmmaker to come up with a scary movie with a unique concept that works. Get Out cost under $5M to produce and reaching a domestic gross of $100M can’t be ruled out right now. Together, Split and Get Out were made for just $14M and are on track to deliver combined worldwide grosses of more than $400M.Dropping to second place after a two-week run on top was the toon hit The LEGO Batman Movie which fell a reasonable 42% to an estimated $19M pushing the total up to $133M. International markets have added $93M to date giving Warner Bros. $226M worldwide with China opening this Friday.John Wick: Chapter Two is holding up nicely for an action sequel and collected an estimated $9M, off 45%, putting Lionsgate at $74.4M. The big budget Matt Damon epic The Great Wall declined by 53% in its sophomore frame to an estimated $8.7M. Universal has grossed $34.4M from North America, a less important market for this pic, but has hit $300M worldwide so far with Japan still to come in April.The studio scored another $100M hit this weekend with Fifty Shades Darker which crossed into nine-digit territory with its weekend take of an estimated $7.7M. Off a sharp 62%, the R-rated romance has banked $103.6M domestically and $328.3M globally. Warner Bros. followed with the comedy Fist Fight which took in an estimated $6.4M, down 48%, for $23.3M after its second round.Oscar weekend saw audiences flock to see high profile Best Picture contenders before the big night. Hidden Figures, the top grossing of the nine nominees for the film industry’s top honor, slipped only 19% to an estimated $5.9M boosting Fox’s cume to $152.8M. Front-runner La La Land suffered no drop from last weekend and collected an estimated $4.6M lifting Lionsgate to $140.9M. Global stands at $369M which is the studio’s best ever outside of the Hunger Games and Twilight franchises.The profitable fright smash Split dropped 43% to an estimated $4.1M for a new sum of $130.8M for Universal. That’s more than three times its opening weekend gross. The low-budget thriller has done an incredible $221.2M worldwide to date. Rounding out the top ten was Best Picture nominee Lion with an estimated $3.8M, down only 9%, and $42.8M overall for The Weinstein Co.Two new releases opening in over 2,000 theaters each were utterly rejected by audiences and debuted outside the top ten with dismal numbers. Lionsgate had the animated offering Rock Dog which bowed to an estimated $3.7M and weak $1,781 average. Open Road saw an estimated $1.5M debut for the action title Collide and a puny $753 average. Both earned lackluster marks from critics.The top ten films grossed an estimated $99.7M which was up 9% from last year when Deadpool stayed at number one with $31.1M in its third frame; and up 12% from 2015 when Focus opened in the top spot with $18.7M.Get earlier box office updates and analysis by following&nbsp;BoxOfficeGuru.com&nbsp;on&nbsp;Twitter.&nbsp;","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"Critics, Grammys, Bros., language, 78th, Bravo, Video, spanish, Writers, service, Netflix, stoner, period, all-time, Bowl","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/02180822/Get-Out-Box-Office.jpg","slug":"box-office-get-out-scares-up-a-huge-opening"},{"id":"47509098891837","title":"Box Office: Kong Conquers #1 Spot with $61M Launch","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office: Kong Conquers #1 Spot with $61M LaunchGet Out is Quickly Becoming One of the Largest Grossing Fright Films of All Time.by Gitesh Pandya | March 12, 2017 |  CommentsThis weekend, Warner Bros. enjoyed a strong debut for its monster reboot Kong: Skull Island which soared to an estimated $61M from 3,846 locations for a muscular $15,865 average. While not among the top ten March openings of all-time, the PG-13 film did drive in more business than expected and more importantly gave the studio and Legendary successful “reinventions” for both Godzilla and King Kong properties. The monster epic Godzilla vs Kong is slated for release in summer 2020 following a Godzilla sequel in 2019. The strategy is not unlike what Marvel has made with the cinematic universe for its well-known characters.Skull Island played 56% male, according to studio data, while 65% were over 25. Reviews were generally good and audiences gave a decent B+ CinemaScore grade. Legs going forward should be average for this type of big-budget action tentpole. The production budget is estimated at $185M with aims of a global audience powering it to box office heights.Kong roared overseas in its debut grossing a superb $81.6M for a global launch of $142.6M. Many markets opened bigger than Godzilla and leading the way were the U.K. with $7.6M and Korea with $7.3M. China and Japan will open the film two weeks from now. A final global box office close to the $529M of Godzilla is possible.Bumped out of the top spot in its second weekend was the comic book hit Logan which fell 57% to an estimated $37.9M. Given the strong reviews and word-of-mouth, some expected a smaller drop. However, Kong did take away a sizable part of the action audience this weekend plus Logan‘s decline still was less than sophomore drops for recent outings for his Wolverine character. 2013’s The Wolverine fell 60% while 2014’s well-reviewed X-Men: Days of Future Past tumbled 64% after coming off of a holiday launch. Logan stands tall at $152.7M and may end in the $240M range. International markets are rocking with another $70.3M this weekend boosting the overseas tally to $285.6M and global to $438.3M. Reaching $700M is a possibility.Jordan Peele’s runaway blockbuster Get Out is quickly becoming one of the highest grossing horror films of all-time. The low-budget Universal release declined by an incredibly low 25% in its third weekend as stellar word-of-mouth keeps broadening the audience. This weekend saw an estimated $21.1M in grosses allowing the cume to bust through the $100M mark and reach $111.1M which is more than any Paranormal Activity or Saw film ever made. The road ahead for Get Out should lead to a final of more than $160M domestic on a production cost of only $5M.The faith-based film The Shack enjoyed a good hold in its second weekend sliding 38% to an estimated $10.1M giving Lionsgate $32.3M to date. A final of $55-60M may result. The LEGO Batman Movie keeps bringing in kids slipping only 33% to an estimated $7.8M in its fifth weekend. With $159M so far from North America, global now sits at $275.5M with Australia and Japan remaining.The teen flop Before I Fall fell 34% to an estimated $3.1M in its second frame putting the cume at a mere $9M for Open Road. The rest of the top ten was filled with winners, though. Hidden Figures slipped only 28% to an estimated $2.8M and $162.9M to date for Fox. Keanu Reeves saw his action sequel John Wick: Chapter Two bank an estimated $2.7M, off 44%, for a new sum of $87.4M for Lionsgate.The Oscar shine is fading for La La Land which dropped 41% to an estimated $1.8M putting Lionsgate at $148.4M. Universal’s erotic drama Fifty Shades Darker followed with an estimated $1.6M, down 54%, for $112.9M to date which is 30% behind the pace of its 2015 predecessor. Global totals stand at $416.8M and $368.8M, respectively.The top ten films grossed an estimated $149.8M which was up 27% from last year when Zootopia stayed at number one with $51.3M; and up 30% from 2015 when Cinderella debuted in the top spot with $67.9M.Get earlier box office updates and analysis by following&nbsp;BoxOfficeGuru.com&nbsp;on&nbsp;Twitter.&nbsp;","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"comics, The, king, Mary, we, San, series, demand","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/13010608/kong-fea1.jpg","slug":"box-office-kong-conquers-1-spot-with-61m-launch"},{"id":"47509098870329","title":"Box Office: Boss Baby #1 Again","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office: Boss Baby #1 AgainBlue Smurfs Come in Third; Christ Opens to $3.9M.by Sujit Chawla | April 9, 2017 |  CommentsThis weekend, in yet another close race The Boss Baby once again edged out Beauty and the Beast&nbsp;for the top spot at the box office while a trio of new films opened to mediocre results.Falling 48% from its debut, The Boss Baby took in an estimated $26.3M in its second weekend, bringing its total up to $89M. &nbsp;A finale in the range of $150M is likely with many sequels likely in the works. &nbsp;And coming in close behind for another week was the Disney powerhouse Beauty and the Beast which took in another $25M this weekend for a total take of $432M already with the $1 billion worldwide mark right around the corner.Debuting in third place was the latest from the little blue people&nbsp;Smurfs: The Lost Village which opened to an estimated $14M from 3,610 theaters for a per screen average of only $3,882. &nbsp;Audiences dug it, giving it an A CinemaScore; critics on the other hand hated it as it’s currently at 39% positive&nbsp;on Rotten Tomatoes.Another debut landed in fourth with a bunch of old guys Going in Style. &nbsp;The film opened to an estimated $12.5M from 3,061 theaters for a per screen average of $4,084. &nbsp;Audiences were OK with it giving it a B+ CinemaScore while critics were also so-so with it as it stands at 44% positive at Rotten Tomatoes.Holdovers took the next few spots in the top 10.&nbsp; Ghost in the Shell cratered in its second weekend falling 61% to an estimated $7.35M, bringing its total up to $31M. &nbsp;Look for a finale in the $45-50M range.&nbsp; Power Rangers continued its freefall dropping 57% in its third weekend to an estimated $6.2M and bringing its total up to $75M. &nbsp;Doesn’t seem good enough for sequels, but we shall see.Kong: Skull Island continues its strong run landing in seventh place this weekend with an estimated $5.8M, bringing its total up to $156M. &nbsp;Could have been better, but good enough (when including international numbers) to warrant sequels. &nbsp;Another film that I’m sure would love a sequel (but wrote itself into a corner) is&nbsp;Logan which took in an estimated $4.05M bringing its total up to an impressive $218M. &nbsp;And the surprise hit thriller Get Out banked another $4.02M this weekend taking its total up to an outstanding $162.8M.Rounding out the top ten was the debut of another religious flick in the Easter corridor,&nbsp;The Case for Christ, which took in an estimated $3.9M from 1,174 theaters for a per screen average of $3,322. &nbsp;Audiences approved as they gave the film an A+ CinemaScore while critics have gifted it with a 71% positive score on Rotten Tomatoes.The top ten films grossed an estimated $109.2M which was up 20% from last year when&nbsp;The Boss opened at number one with $23.6M; but down 11% from 2015 when Furious 7 remained in the top spot with $59.5M.Get earlier box office updates and analysis by following&nbsp;BoxOfficeGuru.com&nbsp;on&nbsp;Twitter.&nbsp;","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"cancelled","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/09124141/bossbo-fea.jpg","slug":"box-office-boss-baby-1-again"},{"id":"47509100568145","title":"Box Office: Madea Returns to #1 with Halloween Humor","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office: Madea Returns to #1 with Halloween HumorNew Jack Reacher and Ouija Sequels Don't Do Boo in Comparisonby Gitesh Pandya | October 23, 2016 |  CommentsThis weekend, the wise old lady defeated the blue collar hero in the latest box office election as the Tyler Perry comedy Boo! A Madea Halloween&nbsp;opened with strength at number one while Tom Cruise’s new action sequel Jack Reacher: Never Go Back did well, but finished in second place. The polls had predicted a tighter race, but when the public showed up at the multiplexes, it was not even close.After a two-and-a-half-year break from the director’s chair (an eternity in Tyler Perry land), the mogul was back with a commanding performance for Boo!which grossed an estimated $27.6M from 2,260 locations for a muscular $12,212 average. It was Perry’s first number one hit in seven years which for most filmmakers would span three or four films. TP had eight films in between his last and current number one hits. After doing roughly two films per year his grosses eventually settled down and the break was needed to get his fan base excited for his return with new content.Madea has been Perry’s most popular character but the last one, 2013’s A Madea Christmas, was an underperformer with a $16M debut. The previous two&nbsp;Madea comedies opened to just over $25M a piece so Boo reverted back to drawing out that same size crowd. The PG-13 Halloween comedy from Lionsgate earned a solid A grade from CinemaScore – the fourth Madea flick to get that.Tom Cruise settled for second place with his action sequel Jack Reacher: Never Go Back which debuted to an estimated $23M from 3,780 sites for a good $6,085 average. The Paramount release improved upon the $15.2M opening weekend of the last film, 2012’s Jack Reacher, which was released in December when films debut softer but enjoy great holiday legs.Reviews were mixed for the PG-13 entry but paying crowds were satisfied as the CinemaScore grade was a commendable B+. Studio data showed that older men led the way. 57% of the crowd was male and 82% were over 25.Overseas, Never Go Back launched to $31M and took the number one spot in 20 markets with most debuts beating the last film. China opened day and date with North America grossing $5.6M over three days compared to the two-day $4.8M debut of the first film from February 2013, two months after the domestic release. The first Jack Reacher grossed $218M globally and this $60M-budgeted sequel is likely to reach that mark, if not surpass it. Key markets Germany, Japan, Spain, Korea, Brazil, and Mexico are still to open in November.In a virtual tie for third place, this year’s only October horror movie Ouija: Origin of Evil opened to an estimated $14.1M from 3,167 locations for a moderate $4,439 average. The Universal sequel was down 29% from the $19.9M bow of its 2014 predecessor which attacked on this very same weekend. Studio data showed that the audience was 57% under 25, 61% non-white, and split evenly between genders. Reviews were quite good but like with many fright sequels, the opening weekend turnout shrank.Ben Affleck faced direct competition from Tom Cruise but his latest crime drama The Accountant fared well against it dipping a reasonable 43% to an estimated $14M in its sophomore frame. With $47.9M to date, Warner Bros. may reach about $80-85M. Dropping 41% in its third weekend was The Girl on the Train with an estimated $7.3M pushing the total to $58.9M for Universal.Fox saw a 33% slide for the kidpic Miss Peregrine’s Home for Peculiar Children which collected an estimated $6M boosting the sum to $74.4M. Global rose to $224.4M. The studio saw no luck getting ticket buyers to show up for the Zach Galifianakis comedy Keeping Up with the Joneses which flopped with an estimated $5.6M from 3,022 locations for a weak $1,853 average. Galifianakis also failed to draw up a crowd for his other recent comedy Masterminds&nbsp;which bowed to just $6.5M last month. Studios will have to rethink whether he is leading man material.In its second weekend, Kevin Hart: What Now? tumbled 65% to an estimated $4.1M giving Universal $19M in ten days. That is down 18% from the ten-day start of Hart’s last standup comedy concert film Let Me Explain from 2013 despite having three times as many theaters this time around. Finishing at about $25M seems likely which will still be a profitable level for the low-cost project.The toon Storks followed with an estimated $4.1M, off just 28%, for a new cume of $64.7M for Warner Bros. It still has one more week of having kids to itself before Trolls arrives at the beginning of November. Worldwide is $147.8M. Rounding out the top ten was the pricey disaster thriller Deepwater Horizon&nbsp;which fell 43% to an estimated $3.6M putting Lionsgate at $55.3M.In limited release, the critically acclaimed indie Moonlight generated an explosive launch in platform release selling out shows and grossing an estimated $415,000 from just four theaters for a scorching $103,685 average per site. A24 expands next weekend before going nationwide on the third weekend. The faith-based drama I’m Not Ashamed posted a mild debut with an estimated $900,000 from 505 theaters for a soft $1,782 average.The top ten films grossed an estimated $109.4M which was up 22% from last year when The Martian reclaimed number one with $15.7M; and up 13% from 2014 when Ouija opened in the top spot with $19.9M.Follow Gitesh on Twitter.","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"TV, Schedule, The, of, Walt, series, movie, composers, play, Fantasy","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/23123043/boo-rep.jpg","slug":"box-office-madea-returns-to-1-with-halloween-humor"},{"id":"47509100551754","title":"Box Office: Moana Rules as Disney Dominates 2016","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office: Moana Rules as Disney Dominates 2016by Gitesh Pandya | December 11, 2016 |  CommentsThis weekend, for a third consecutive time, Disney’s hit animated comedy Moana ruled the North American box office this time grossing an estimated $18.8M with a good hold that saw a drop of only 33%. After its third weekend, the island adventure boosted the cume to $145M for the studio with the lucrative holiday season still to come.So far, Moana has been running at a pace similar to the studio’s Tangled from 2010. Both toons launched impressively over the five-day Thanksgiving holiday weekend and have held up relatively well in the second and third frames. Moana is currently running 26% ahead and a final domestic gross in the $240M range is possible. Worldwide total sits at $238.8M with half of the international market’s top 12 countries still to open.The Disney machine has been flexing its end-of-year muscles and the studio is set to have the number one film over eight of the nine weekends of November and December this year with Doctor Strange, Moana, and next weekend’s Rogue One: A Star Wars Story. This caps off a banner year that saw records shatter thanks to all divisions coming through with stellar hits including Marvel, Lucasfilm, Pixar and the live-action and animation departments of Disney proper. The studio’s outlook for 2017 looks equally impressive.Coming close to the number one spot but settling for runner-up was the R-rated comedy Office Christmas Party which bowed to an estimated $17.5M from 3,210 locations for a good $5,452 average. Paramount used the all-star pic as counter-programming to all the kid fare and tentpole action movies that have ruled the box office this holiday season and hopes to keep finding audiences during the upcoming run of Rogue One. Jennifer Aniston and Jason Bateman headline the cast.Reviews for the $45M-budgeted pic were lackluster and audiences polled by CinemaScore gave a so-so B grade. Moviegoers often find comedies like these later during the holidays so Office certainly has the potential to reach beyond $70M by the end of its domestic run. That would make it second best this year among live-action R-rated comedies behind Bad Moms.Fantastic Beasts and Where To Find Them slipped 41% in its fourth weekend and got to within striking distance of the double century mark. The first of five films from this new Warner Bros. franchise grossed an estimated $10.8M boosting the sum to $199.3M. Beasts is running 23% behind Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1, the last film from the wizard world to open in this same pre-Thanksgiving corridor. A domestic final in the $235M neighborhood seems likely.Remaining films in the marketplace all came in under $6M each. The leggy sci-fi drama Arrival declined by only 23% to an estimated $5.6M lifting Paramount’s cume to $81.5M. The Amy Adams film has been getting some notices during the end-of-year awards season. Marvel’s latest success Doctor Strange followed with an estimated $4.6M, down 31%, giving Disney $222.4M to date.The Brad Pitt war drama Allied dropped 43% to an estimated $4M for Paramount with the total rising to $35.6M. Amy Adams enjoyed a second film in the top ten with her dark thriller Nocturnal Animals which expanded to 1,262 locations and grossed an estimated $3.2M. The Focus title averaged a mild $2,531 and upped its cume to $6.2M.Also going after serious-minded adults looking for awards contenders was Manchester By The Sea which jumped into the top ten with its solid expansion taking in an estimated $3.2M from only 366 sites for a superb $8,620 average. That was the best per-theater average for any film in the top ten. From Amazon Studios and Roadside Attractions, the Casey Affleck film has earned eight Critics Choice Award nominations and was named best film of the year by the National Board of Review. Next weekend sees the nationwide expansion.The DreamWorks Animation title Trolls is headed for the $150M mark and this weekend collected an estimated $3.1M, off 34%, for a new cume of $145.5M for Fox. Mel Gibson’s Hacksaw Ridge continues to show good legs dipping 31% in its sixth round to an estimated $2.3M for $60.9M to date for Lionsgate.Jessica Chastain’s new gun lobby thriller Miss Sloane misfired in its national expansion grossing an estimated $1.9M from 1,648 locations for a lousy $1,153 average landing just outside the top ten. Buzz was never too strong, reviews were mixed at best, competition was fierce for smart fare, and dramas aimed at adult women tend to be challenged in early and mid December. Cume for EuropaCorp including the two weeks of limited play is a mere $2M with dull prospects ahead.Lionsgate enjoyed a sensational debut for its original musical La La Land which has set Oscar buzz ablaze. Showered with praise by film critics, the Ryan Gosling-Emma Stone film opened to an estimated $855,000 from only five theaters in New York and Los Angeles generating a jaw-dropping $171,000 average – one of the best in industry history. La La Land has already won Best Picture from the New York Film Critics Circle and is a top contender in the same category for the Academy Awards.Theaters are programming multiple screens for the much talked about PG-13 pic. On Sunday alone, the three L.A. sites offered a total of 76 showtimes to absorb all possible business. The distrib will expand Friday into 200 theaters in 40 markets and then play nationally on Christmas Day for what should be a leggy winter run as Golden Globe and Oscar nominations roll out in the coming weeks.The top ten films grossed an estimated $73.1M which was up 10% from last year when The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 2 stayed at number one for a fourth time with $11.4M; but off 1% from 2014 when Exodus: Gods and Kings opened in the top spot with $24.1M.Follow BoxOfficeGuru.com on Twitter.","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"Shudder, unscripted, Pixar, killer, Showtime, screen, Company, Kaling","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/11121403/moana-disney-rep.jpg","slug":"box-office-moana-rules-as-disney-dominates-2016"},{"id":"47509095977511","title":"Box Office: Annabelle Scares Up Top Spot","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office: Annabelle Scares Up Top SpotWarner Bros. successfully continued their Conjuring franchise as Annabelle: Creation easily took the top spot this weekendby Sujit Chawla | August 13, 2017 |  CommentsWarner Bros. successfully continued their&nbsp;Conjuring&nbsp;franchise as&nbsp;Annabelle: Creation&nbsp;easily took the top spot this weekend while a couple of other new films opened between mediocre and horrendous.Creepy dolls during the doldrums of summer seem to sell as&nbsp;Annabelle: Creation&nbsp;powered itself to the number one position with an estimated $35M from 3,502 theaters for a per screen average of just over $10,000. The original film opened in October of 2014 to $37M so this is an impressive debut. Critics were mostly positive and audiences gave the film a solid B CinemaScore so the road ahead will be decent. With a budget of only $15M I’d expect more of&nbsp;Conjuring&nbsp;Universe to appear quickly. According to tracking, the film’s audience was 52% female with 54% of the audience 25 years or older.Early Oscar frontrunner&nbsp;Dunkirk&nbsp;held on well once again, dropping only 33% in its fourth weekend to an estimated $11.4M, bringing its cume up to $153.7M so far. Overseas the film stands at $210M making for a worldwide total of $363M with big box office countries like China and Japan still to come.Back in 2014, Open Road had a surprise hit with&nbsp;The Nut Job&nbsp;which opened to $19.4M on its way to a solid $64M total. They decided to release a sequel into an ultra-wide 4,003 theaters and&nbsp;The Nut Job 2&nbsp;crashed and burned on impact with an estimated $8.9M for a per screen average of only $2,232.Last week’s box office champ&nbsp;The Dark Tower&nbsp;lived down to its poor reviews dropping 59% to $7.9M bringing its cume up to only $34M. How this bodes for the projected TV series is anyone’s guess but the movie certainly isn’t exciting anyone. Look for a final total in the $45-50M range. In fifth place was Sony’s&nbsp;The Emoji Movie&nbsp;which made an estimated $6.6M this weekend bringing its total up to $63.6M after three weeks.The year’s top grossing comedy held up well in its fourth go-around as&nbsp;Girls Trip&nbsp;made an additional $6.5M this weekend, according to estimates, bringing its cume up to $97M with the $100M club just around the corner. Another successful summer entry landed in seventh place as&nbsp;Spider-Man: Homecoming&nbsp;took in an estimated $6.1M bringing its total up to $306.4M after six weeks. Its 31% slide from last weekend was the best hold in the top 10. Eighth place belonged to Halle Berry’s&nbsp;Kidnap&nbsp;which dropped 47.8% in its second weekend to an estimated $5.2M bringing its total up to $19.4M. Look for a final total in the $25-30M range.Debuting in ninth place was&nbsp;The Glass Castle. Based on the best-selling novel by Jeannette Walls, the Lionsgate release made an estimated $4.9M from 1,461 theaters for a per screen average of $3,337 – decent, but not great. Reviews were mixed, so the road ahead will be a small, side road but one that you take to your grandmother’s house in the country. Rounding out the top 10 was the hot and heavy action of&nbsp;Atomic Blonde&nbsp;which raked in an additional $4.5M, according to estimates, bringing its total after three weeks to $42.8M.The top ten films grossed an estimated $97.1M which was down 37% from last year when&nbsp;Suicide Squad&nbsp;remained at number one with $43.5M; and down 25% from 2015 when&nbsp;Straight Outta Compton&nbsp;shocked the world with a $60.2M opening.","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"hollywood, talk, El, Hallmark, Best, foreign","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/13151425/Anabelle-RT_BoxOffice_Title_600X314.jpg","slug":"box-office-annabelle-scares-up-top-spot"},{"id":"47509097562666","title":"Box Office: Dunkirk Nabs the Top Spot; Girls Trip Earns #2 with Strong Debut","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office: Dunkirk Nabs the Top Spot; Girls Trip Earns #2 with Strong DebutMeanwhile, Luc Besson's space odyssey Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets posts less than stellar earnings, and Spider-Man: Homecoming holds on.by Gitesh Pandya | July 23, 2017 |  CommentsRyan FujitaniThis weekend,&nbsp;brand name director Christopher Nolan topped the box office with his World War II thriller Dunkirk which easily led the marketplace with an opening of an estimated $50.5M. It was the first non-franchise movie to reach the top spot all summer long. Warner Bros. averaged a strong $13,575 from 3,720 locations for a film which was not an easy sell. It more than doubled the $23.7M debut of Brad Pitt’s acclaimed WW2 film Fury.Nolan has long been a fan of shooting with IMAX cameras and fans flocked to those screens to see the complete vision for his latest story. A very high 23 percent of the weekend gross came from those 402 screens, about double the rate of usual action tentpoles. The PG-13 film earned stellar reviews and even some Oscar buzz which helped to excite fans and beat out the $47.5M of the filmmaker’s last movie,&nbsp;Interstellar.Studio data showed that the audience was 60 percent male and 76 percent over 25 — not surprising for a period war story. Overseas, Dunkirk bowed to $55.4M from 46 markets making for a global opening weekend of $106M. Several major international territories are still to open between now and September.Dazzling the box office with a fantastic debut was the raunchy buddy comedy Girls Trip, which grossed an estimated $30.4M which was the best opening for an R-rated comedy in two years. The Universal hit averaged a potent $11,721 from 2,591 locations and has plenty of potential ahead of it. In only its first two days of release it grossed more than this summer’s other R-rated women’s party trip movie Rough Night has in its entire run. Reviews were solid and audiences loved the bold envelope-pushing party humor, giving it a fabulous A+ CinemaScore grade.Opening weekend demographics show that plenty of moviegoers haven’t yet been reached, as studio data indicated that the crowd was 79 percent female and 59 percent black. It was an even split between those over and under 30. As buzz spreads, many who did not feel the need to see Girls Trip in the first three days may become convinced and show up in the days and weeks ahead. And the lucrative summer playtime means this laugh riot, which cost about $20M to produce, could be headed north of the $100M mark. Regina Hall, Jada Pinkett Smith, Queen Latifah, and breakout star Tiffany Haddish led the cast.Leading the crop of holdovers was Spider-Man: Homecoming with an estimated $22M, falling 50 percent in its third round. Sony has crossed the quarter-billion domestic mark for the fifth time across its six-pack of webslinger films with a new cume of $251.7M. Reaching the $310-320M range seems possible. Overseas grosses climbed to $320M this weekend giving Homecoming a $571.7M worldwide total with China and Japan still to open. Passing $800M may be in the cards.Last week’s top film War for the Planet of the Apes took a sharp fall in its second weekend dropping 64 percent to an estimated $20.4M in fourth place. Fox has collected $97.8M to date. Despite being called by many as the best film in the Apes trilogy, War will end up as the lowest-grossing chapter domestically. Global is now $174.9M. Despite sensational reviews and strong word-of-mouth from audiences, franchise films can tumble by large amounts in the second weekend, especially if a major new film targeting the same audience opens. Homecoming was in the same boat last week with a 62 percent sophomore tumble.The expensive sci-fi adventure Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets opened poorly and ranked fifth with an estimated $17M. Averaging $4,790 from 3,553 locations, the PG-13 space flick never excited audiences that much and entered a marketplace jam-packed with bigger options for action fans. Reviews were mixed for the EuropaCorp production, there was no starpower to tap into, and the property was not well known in America. The production budget was at least $150M, but international markets are where the real business is expected to be.2017’s highest grossing toon followed as Despicable Me 3 banked an estimated $12.7M, down 34 percent, for a new total of $213.3M. Universal smashed the half-billion mark overseas where the cume rose $514.1M for a sturdy $727.4M worldwide.Successful R-rated original films followed with low declines. Sony’s Baby Driver slipped 31% to an estimated $6M for a sum of $84.2M to date on its way to breaking $100M. The romantic comedy The Big Sick grossed an estimated $5M, off just 34 percent, giving Amazon Studios and Lionsgate $24.5M.In its eighth weekend in the top ten, the super hero smash Wonder Woman claimed the summer box office crown becoming the top-grossing film of the season. Sliding just 32 percent to an estimated $4.6M, the leggy Warner Bros. hit upped its cume to $389M passing the $387.3M of the summer kickoff movie Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2. which started its run with an opening weekend that was actually $43M bigger. International sales on Wonder Woman continue to run even with domestic at $390.4M for a new global gross of $779.4M. Breaking $400M domestic and $800M worldwide are guaranteed.Rounding out the top ten was the fright flop Wish Upon with an estimated $2.5M, down 55 percent, and just $10.5M after the second weekend for Broad Green.The top ten films grossed an estimated $171.1M which was off 4 percent from last year when Star Trek Beyond opened at number one with $59.3M; but up 24 percent from 2015 when Ant-Man stayed in the top spot with $24.9M.","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"Emmy, Western, FX, your, marvel, thriller, comic, of, A24","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/23235629/Dunkirk-BO-600x314.jpg","slug":"box-office-dunkirk-nabs-the-top-spot-girls-trip-earns-2-with-strong-debut"},{"id":"47509097579057","title":"Box Office: Wonder Woman Muscles $100m Opening Weekend","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office: Wonder Woman Muscles $100m Opening Weekendby Gitesh Pandya | June 4, 2017 |  CommentsWarner Bros. and DC Entertainment enjoyed a thunderous opening for its new super hero epic Wonder Woman which captured the number one spot with an estimated $100.5M grossing more than all other films in the marketplace combined. The PG-13 pic averaged a stellar $24,131 from 4,165 theaters and delivered the third biggest opening weekend of 2017 after Beauty and the Beast‘s $174.8M and the $146.5M of Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2.Super hero origin story films usually do not reach this height at the box office. Last November’s Doctor Strange bowed to $85.1M while the first Captain America and Thor movies debuted to just over $65M each in 2011. Based on a character that is more of a household name, Wonder Woman had broader appeal and also excited female audiences more than most films of this genre have. In fact, studio data showed that women were the dominant group making up 52% of the crowd. Normally a comic book movie would skew around 60% male. Diana’s performance was more like 2008’s Iron Man (also a well-reviewed origin story for a well-known comic brand) which banked $102.1M in its first weekend including pre-shows.Anticipation for this film kicked off last year with Gal Gadot’s debut of the role in Batman v Superman. Many said Wonder Woman was the best part of that super hero smackdown. The Warner Bros. marketing push was terrific and exceptional reviews from critics boosted consumer interest. Ticket buyers have been very pleased with what they got with the CinemaScore grade being a solid A. The Patty Jenkins film also posted the biggest debut of all-time for a female-directed movie.The sturdy opening weekend kicked off with a $38.8M Friday including $11M from Thursday night pre-shows beginning at 7pm. Saturday slipped a reasonable 8% to $35.8M. GOTG2 had the same Saturday slide. Sunday is projected by the studio to decline by 28% to about $25.9M. $9M of the weekend take came from the 343 IMAX screens and there was more from other premium formats including the 4DX experience.With strong word-of-mouth spreading, ample kid appeal, and schools closing for summer vacation throughout the June weeks ahead, good legs should be in store. A domestic final in the $275-300M range is possible.Wonder Woman also took off overseas with an international debut of $122.5M resulting in a hefty global opening weekend of $223M. China led international markets with a 3-day start of $38M while Korea, Mexico, and Brazil followed with $8-9M a piece. France, Germany and Spain open later this month while Japan gets the comic hit in August. Breaking $700M worldwide seems likely and reaching $800M is a possibility as well for the tentpole which reportedly cost about $150M to produce.The DreamWorks Animation comedy Captain Underpants debuted in second place with an estimated $23.5M from 3,434 locations for a $6,843 average. Across 22 films over the past decade, the only one from the toon studio to open lower was Turbo‘s $21.3M in 2013. However, Underpants was produced at a significantly lower cost so it aims to follow an easier road to profitability when all revenue streams are counted. Featuring the voices of Kevin Hart and Ed Helms, the PG-rated film drew an audience that was 54% male and 65% under 25. Reviews were good for Fox and the CinemaScore grade was a B+.Audiences abandoned Johnny Depp’s ship as his latest tentpole Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men tell No Tales plunged 66% in its second weekend of play to an estimated $21.6M for third place. Disney has banked $114.6M which is 25% behind the pace of the last film in the franchise, 2011’s On Stranger Tides. A $150M domestic final may result which would be the worst for the five-film series. But overseas is where it’s at for this property. International markets grossed another $73.8M this weekend for a new offshore cume of $386.6M for a global tally of $501.2M. China, where Pirates had its star-studded world premiere, is the top-grossing territory globally with $142.6M.The Mouse House also landed in fourth with the well-liked Marvel super hero sequel Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 which took in an estimated $9.7M, sliding 53%. New totals are $355.5M domestic (number 38 all-time) and $816.6M worldwide.Posting a sophomore decline of 54% was the action-comedy Baywatch which collected an estimated $8.5M for a cume of $41.7M for Paramount. Fox’s sci-fi sequel Alien: Covenant fell 62% to an estimated $4M giving the space horror saga $67.2M to date with the global tally now at $173.8M.The teen romance Everything, Everything posted the best hold in the top ten – with the only dip below 50% – with a 45% decline to an estimated $3.3M for $28.3M overall for Warner Bros. The comedy Snatched took in an estimated $1.3M, down 66%, leaving Fox at $43.9M.Tumbling 73% due to the new options for kids this weekend was Diary of a Wimpy Kid with an estimated $1.2M. Fox’s sum is just $17.8M. King Arthur dropped 65% to an estimated $1.2M leading to a weak new total of $37.2M for Warner Bros.","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"Mirror, TCA, of, Mary, York","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/04152802/600WonderWoman.jpg","slug":"box-office-wonder-woman-muscles-100m-opening-weekend"},{"id":"47509098903104","title":"Box Office: LEGO Batman Dwarfs the Competition","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office: LEGO Batman Dwarfs the Competitionby Sujit Chawla | February 19, 2017 |  CommentsThis weekend, a&nbsp;trio of newcomers couldn’t break through with openings somewhere between mediocre and disastrous while the top two films from last week took the top two spots once again.Easily taking first place for a second straight weekend was the superhero adventure The LEGO Batman Movie which slipped a reasonable 35% to an estimated $34M bringing its total up to just under $100M at $98.8M. With nothing on the horizon for next weekend, it should threepeat before Logan is unleashed on March 3rd. LEGO Batman is currently running about 25% behind The LEGO Movie from 2014. That film ended up with $257.7M which would mean about a $195-200M finale for LEGO Batman.Falling 55% was Fifty Shades Darker, taking in an estimated $21M this weekend, bringing its total up to $89M. Comparisons to Fifty Shades of Grey are difficult as that film opened on Presidents Day Weekend two years ago, but look for the sequel to end its run somewhere in the $125M range, around 25% less than the original.Matt Damon’s controversial Chinese epic The Great Wall opened to a middling $18M this weekend, according to estimates, from 3,326 theaters for a per screen average of $5,436. Normally opening to $18M on a $150M budget film would be terrible but this is one of those films that has done great numbers overseas with its international gross sitting at $245M already. Anything it picks up domestically is just icing on the cake. A ‘B’ CinemaScore and 36% positive reviews on Rotten Tomatoes does not bode well for its future here.Landing in fourth place was the hard-hitting action film John Wick: Chapter 2 which fell 46% in its second weekend to an estimated $16.5M, bringing its total up to $58.7M. In just two weeks it has passed the lifetime gross of the original surprise hit which made $43M in the fall of 2014. Look for final numbers in the $80M range which is more than good enough for Chapter 3 to happen.Debuting in fifth place to less-than-stellar numbers was the Ice Cube comedy Fist Fight which opened to an estimated $12M from 3,185 theaters for a per screen average of $3,772. Reviews were on the low end with a Rotten Tomatoes score of 32% positive, and audiences didn’t care much for it as well, giving it a ‘B’ CinemaScore. This is the worst wide release opening for an Ice Cube film since 2010’s Lottery Ticket which opened to $10.6M.Oscar hopeful Hidden Figures continued its strong run slipping only 11% to an estimated $7.1M bringing its total to an impressive $142M a week before Oscar Sunday. 3-time box office champ Split took in an estimated $7M this weekend bringing its total up to $123.6M after five weeks. It is now M. Night Shyamalan’s fourth highest grossing film, sandwiched in between 2004’s The Village ($114M) and 2010’s The Last Airbender ($131M).A Dog’s Purpose came in eighth place this weekend with an estimated $5.5M bringing its total up to $50M for Universal, which has four films in the top 10 this weekend. Oscar favorite La La Land had the best hold in the top 10 taking in an estimated $4.5M, a drop of only 9% from last weekend, bringing its cume up to $133.5M. If as expected it sweeps the Oscars next weekend it’ll be interesting to see what kind of bump it gets seeing as how it has been in theaters for nearly three months already.Rounding out the top 10 was the debut of A Cure for Wellness which imploded taking in only $4.2M, according to estimates, from 2,704 theaters for a per screen average of only $1,553. Critics and audiences alike both disliked the film, with critics giving it only 38% positive reviews on Rotten Tomatoes and audiences giving it a ‘C+’ CinemaScore. This was a complete misfire.The top ten films grossed an estimated $130.2M which was down 40% from last year when Deadpool remained at number one with $56.5M; and down 33.6% from 2015 when Fifty Shades of Grey repeated in the top spot with $22.2M. Both of those years were the weekend after the Presidents Day holiday frame.Get earlier box office updates and analysis by following BoxOfficeGuru.com on Twitter.","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"fresh, TV, Pop, quibi, transformers","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/19135934/legobat-fea.jpg","slug":"box-office-lego-batman-dwarfs-the-competition"},{"id":"47509102045784","title":"Box Office: Don’t Breathe Inhales #1 Spot in 2016’s Lowest Weekend","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office: Don't Breathe Inhales #1 Spot in 2016's Lowest Weekendby Gitesh Pandya | September 4, 2016 |  CommentsWith summer coming to a close and Hollywood having served up one mediocre film after another, the North American box office slumped to its worst level of 2016 over Labor Day weekend. Last week’s hit horror offering Don’t Breathe remained at number one for a second straight time while many of the more well-liked offerings enjoyed the best holds as audiences caught up on movies they heard good things about. New releases were ignored.Sony easily retained the crown with Don’t Breathe which slipped 41% to an estimated $15.7M pushing the cume up to a sturdy $51.1M. The home invasion thriller has now grossed over five times its low $10M budget and is on track to finish its run near the $80M mark.Moviegoers were still taking interest in the bad boys (and girls) of DC Comics as Suicide Squad came within striking distance of the $300M mark. The Warner Bros. blockbuster grossed an estimated $10M in its fifth weekend, off 18%, boosting its cume to a rowdy $297.4M. By the end of Labor Day Monday, Squad may just smash the triple century mark on its way to north of $315M.The Harley Quinn vehicle is already the second highest-grossing movie of all-time to come out of August behind just the $333.2M of fellow bad-guys-become-heroes comic book team-up smash Guardians of the Galaxy from two years ago. Both chose the first weekend of the month as its launching pad. International grosses for Suicide Squad rose to $375.5M this weekend propelling the global cume to $672.9M and that’s with no release in China. Finishing in the neighborhood of $750M seems likely as the final market of Japan is set to open next weekend. Had Squad been allowed into China, a global final of over $800M probably would have resulted. By comparison, Guardians finished at $774M including over $95M from China.The rest of the films in the top ten this weekend were left picking up scraps with each grossing between $4-7M over three days. A pair of well-liked family-oriented films followed with good holds and an estimated $6.5M a piece. Disney’s Pete’s Dragon slipped 13% and has banked $64.2M to date – not too big for this pricey remake. Focus saw its animated hit Kubo and the Two Strings slide by only 18% with a cume to date of $34.3M. Breaking $50M like past Laika films is possible. Dropping 30% to an estimated $5.3M for fifth place was Sausage Party which has taken in a solid $88.4M for Sony. Joining the century club is still a possibility.Disney’s release of the DreamWorks drama The Light Between Oceans was met with a soft debut grossing an estimated $5M from 1,500 locations for a mild $3,323 average. The PG-13 title was not given too big of a push and arrived in the marketplace with little buzz. Studio data showed that the crowd was 66% female and a whopping 92% was over 25. 44% of the audience was older than 50. Reviews were mixed and the CinemaScore grade was a decent B+.Bad Moms became the first R-rated comedy of 2016 to crack $100M as the popular and leggy pic slipped just 15% in its sixth round to an estimated $4.7M boosting the cume to a robust $102.5M. STX should see the $20M production reach about $115M by the end. The military weapons-themed comedy War Dogs fell 33% to an estimated $4.7M putting Warner Bros. at $35.2M to date.Expanding well and jumping into the top ten for the first time was Hell or High Water with an estimated $4.3M and a respectable $3,454 average from 1,303 locations. CBS and Lionsgate have grossed $14.7M with their critically acclaimed film. Mechanic: Resurrection rounded out the top ten with an estimated $4.3M, down 43%, and a $14.4M sum for Lionsgate.Sci-fi fans had no interest in Kate Mara’s Morgan which opened poorly with an estimated $2M from 2,020 theaters for a dismal $970 average for Fox. Lionsgate scored the best average of the weekend among films in national release opening its Mexican comedy No Manches Frida to an estimated $3.7M from 362 sites for a potent $10,083 average.The top ten films grossed an estimated $67.1M over the Friday-to-Sunday portion of Labor Day weekend which was up 12% from last year when War Room rose to number one with just $9.5M; but down 19% from 2014 when Guardians of the Galaxy was in the top spot with $17.1M.Follow Gitesh on Twitter.","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"nbcuniversal, Academy, concert, Classic, Month, godzilla, OneApp, Watching, worst, best, psycho, television, Family, ABC","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/04140211/600DontBreathe.jpg","slug":"box-office-dont-breathe-inhales-1-spot-in-2016s-lowest-weekend"},{"id":"47509102068324","title":"Box Office: Conjuring 2 Hits #1, Warcraft Rocks China","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office: Conjuring 2 Hits #1, Warcraft Rocks Chinaby Gitesh Pandya | June 12, 2016 |  Comments&nbsp;This weekend, proving to be about as popular as the first hit film, the supernatural sequel The Conjuring 2 opened at number one with an impressive gross of an estimated $40.4M. Warner Bros., which has been in need of a hit, enjoyed a fantastic $12,070 average from 3,343 locations.Both Conjuring films have opened north of $40M which is an astonishing feat for the horror genre. Director James Wan and stars Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson all returned and the marketing promised another spooky story with a PG-13 rating that can attract teens and young adults. And having a quality product was key to the success too. Reviews were very strong and audiences were quite pleased as the CinemaScore grade was an A-. These are incredible results for a fright sequel.Conjuring 2 enjoyed the best opening weekend for any horror film since the first pic opened three summers ago to $41.9M. Studio research on the sequel showed that the crowd was 52% female and 57% over 25. Good word-of-mouth helped the first chapter have legs which led to a terrific $137.4M domestic final and $318.4M worldwide take. Longevity may once again be a factor here given the good will the sequel is generating.Overseas, The Conjuring 2 launched with an estimated $50M from 44 markets with 26 of them seeing the best horror movie opening of all-time. Breaking $300M global is possible again especially since most top European markets have not opened yet. That means a pair of films that cost $60M combined to produce will end up grossing more than $600M together.The pricey video-game-inspired adventure film Warcraft opened in second place with an estimated $24.4M which normally would be a disappointing performance, but with the film’s massive success in China, the U.S. numbers will not be so important. Universal opened the PG-13 actioner in 3,400 locations and averaged $7,164 per site. Reviews were lousy and consumer interest never really materialized outside the gamer community.Demo data indicated that the audience was very male (66%) and 54% were under 30. The CinemaScore grade was a B+ which was decent. Films like&nbsp;Warcraft are made to draw their fan bases upfront so a final domestic total of around $60M seems likely which is even worse than the new Alice movie.But the North American market is essentially gravy for Warcraft. China leads the way as the most critical territory for this film and will probably contribute more than half of the final global gross. With a Wednesday holiday launch, the orc pic grossed a staggering $156M in its first five days there putting it about even with last summer’s Furious 7 which set all-time industry records at the time on its way to a jaw-dropping $391M final there. The game has been immensely popular in that country and the casting of Chinese-American actor Daniel Wu (who got the ‘and’ credit) helped. 292 IMAX screens in China delivered a robust $20M as the visual effects made it a prime movie to experience in a premium format.Other international markets have contributed $105.7M to date. Add in China and North America and the Warcraft global cume now stands at $286.1M and climbing rapidly. Produced for $160M, the final global gross could approach the $600M mark with a whopping 85-90% coming from outside North America.Another new release followed in third place. The magic sequel Now You See Me 2 debuted well with an estimated $23M from 3,232 locations for a solid $7,124 average. Lionsgate saw lackluster reviews for its PG-13 pic. In the summer of 2013, Now You See Me was an unlikely hit opening to $29.3M on its way to $117.7M. The all-star sequel’s debut was an acceptable amount smaller than its predecessor’s. A $20.1M international bow put the global total at $45.8M. NYSM2 opens in China in two weeks and expects a healthy run there given that half the film is set in Macau.Falling 58% in its second weekend was Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows with an estimated $14.8M putting Paramount at $61M to date. A domestic final of $90-100M seems likely amounting to only half of the $191.2M of its 2014 predecessor. The international cume rose to $55.3M for a current global tally of $116.3M.Another summer sequel declining hard was X-Men: Apocalypse which fell 56% to an estimated $10M putting Fox at $136.4M through the third weekend. The latest mutant saga is running 28% behind the pace of 2014’s Days of Future Past. Apocalypse grossed another $25M overseas this weekend boosting the international haul to $342.1M and the worldwide sum to $478.5M. China leads all markets with $96M which beats what Batman v Superman did there.The romance Me Before You followed with an estimated $9.2M dropping 51% in its second weekend. Warner Bros. has banked $36.8M to date. With an estimated $6.7M, The Angry Birds Movie took seventh place sliding only 34%. Sony has collected $98.2M from North America and $312.1M worldwide. China leads all overseas markets by a mile with $72M while all other territories have grossed under $14M each.Rounding out the top ten was Disney with three big-budget films — two megahits and a flop. Alice Through the Looking Glass dropped 51% to an estimated $5.5M for a weak cume of $62.4M. A dismal domestic final of about $75M is likely which would be a disturbing fall of 78% from the $334.2M of 2010’s Alice in Wonderland.Top hit Captain America: Civil War grossed an estimated $4.3M, down 45%, with a new cume of $396.9M. The global run is winding down now and the cume stands at $1.14 billion. The Jungle Book cracked $350M domestic and $900M worldwide this weekend. The effects-driven adventure took in an estimated $2.7M, off 39%, pushing the sum to $352.7M. It passed American Sniper and Transformers: Dark of the Moon to reach number 34 on the list of&nbsp;all-time domestic blockbusters and will surpass Furious 7 within a day or two.The top ten films grossed an estimated $141M which was down 47% from last year when Jurassic World broke the all-time opening weekend record with $208.8M; and down 21% from 2014 when 22 Jump Street debuted in the top spot with $57.1M.Follow Gitesh on Twitter.","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"ABC, Netflix, The, Shondaland, BBC, biography, sequel, Fox, e., archives","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/12125520/con2-rep.jpg","slug":"box-office-conjuring-2-hits-1-warcraft-rocks-china"},{"id":"47509104700023","title":"Box Office: Kung Fu Panda 3 Rolls Into #1 Spot","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office: Kung Fu Panda 3 Rolls Into #1 Spotby Gitesh Pandya | January 31, 2016 |  CommentsA computer-animated panda bear bumped a computer-generated grizzly bear from the number one spot at the North American box office as the toon sequel Kung Fu Panda 3 debuted on top with an estimated $41M. Averaging a solid $10,367 from 3,955 theaters, the PG-rated DreamWorks Animation offering posted the lowest opening weekend for the series, but also the third highest bow for the month of January which typically does not see large launches.Reviews were solid and word-of-mouth from audiences is stellar with an A CinemaScore grade. With most schools taking a winter recess at some point in February, and no major competitors for several weeks, the road ahead looks promising. Many past kidpics opening in January have gone on to finish with four times their debuts so Kung Fu Panda 3 definitely has a shot as matching the $165.2M domestic final of its 2011 predecessor which played in the summertime. That film debuted on the Thursday before Memorial Day weekend with the Friday-to-Sunday portion contributing $47.7M.Fox estimates that international openings amounted to a stellar $75M this weekend including China, Russia, and Korea making for a potent $116M global debut. Many major markets will not open Panda 3 until closer to Easter so there is plenty of business still to come over the next two months. International markets have been a key part of the success of the franchise which has grossed $1.4 billion to date on its way to a possible $2 billion for the trilogy when this new one completes its journey.Academy Award contender The Revenant slipped back into its comfortable position at number two with an estimated $12.4M showing a great hold with a 23% dip. With DiCaprio solidifying his position as the Best Actor front-runner with Saturday’s big SAG win, the survival adventure upped its cume to an impressive $138.2M for Fox on its way to north of $175M. No other film has more Oscar nominations this year.Han Solo and friends posted a sturdy gross in third place collecting an estimated $10.8M for Star Wars: The Force Awakens slipping only 23% in the process. No film in the top ten dropped by more than 35% this weekend thanks in part to some business in the east getting snowed out last weekend and the marketplace picking up lost activity now. But the Force hold was impressive given the sci-fi pic’s kid appeal and the arrival of Panda.The new Star Wars climbed to a record $895.4M from North America while overseas grosses rose to $1.09 billion for a new worldwide haul of $1.98 billion. Look for the smash hit to break the $900M domestic mark this Friday with the global gross still on track for a finish of about $2.05 billion.Opening to soft results in fourth place was the Coast Guard thriller The Finest Hours with an estimated $10.3M from 3,143 locations for a mild $3,286 average. Chris Pine headlined the PG-13 film based on a true story but audience interest never took off. Mixed reviews hurt too. Studio research showed that the crowd was 53% male and 83% over 25. With a good A- CinemaScore, Disney hopes for some legs but the pricey $80M production will find it hard to break even since international appeal is not too strong.Taking fifth was the comedy sequel Ride Along 2 with an estimated $8.4M in its third weekend, off 33%, for a $70.8M cume for Universal. STX enjoyed a terrific hold for its thriller The Boy which defied horror movie gravity and dipped only 27% in its second weekend with no increase in screens. Total is $21.5M heading to near $40M.The raunchy comedy Dirty Grandpa followed with an estimated $7.6M, down 32%, for a new sum of $22.8M. Also falling 32% in its second round was the sci-fi dud The 5th Wave with an estimated $7M putting Sony at just $20.2M.50 Shades of Black, the latest spoof comedy from Marlon Wayans, opened poorly in ninth place with an estimated $6.2M. Averaging a lackluster $2,982 from 2,075 theaters, the R-rated pic was panned by critics, to nobody’s surprise, but also failed to please paying moviegoers with a lousy C CinemaScore grade. The debut was a third of the solid $18.1M that Wayans saw three Januarys ago for A Haunted House which was a Paranormal Activity send-up. Shades cost only about $5M to produce, but Open Road also has marketing costs to deal with.Soldier story 13 Hours rounded out the top ten by dropping 34% to an estimated $6M giving Paramount a nice $42.6M to date.Half of the Oscar contenders for Best Picture were just below the top ten pulling in business and displaying fantastic holds. These included The Big Short (-6% weekend dip, $60.9M cume), Brooklyn (-0.3%, $30.4M), Room (-9%, $9.9M), and SAG winner Spotlight (-12%, $34.7M).The top ten films grossed an estimated $117.5M which was up a hearty 47% from last year when American Sniper stayed at number one with $30.7M; and up a robust 78% from 2014 when Ride Along remained in the top spot with $12M.","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"TV, Cinematographers, of, reboot, supernatural, Cannes, Alien, justice, Podcast, TV, Brie","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/31125418/600KungFuPanda3.jpg","slug":"box-office-kung-fu-panda-3-rolls-into-1-spot"},{"id":"47509104712317","title":"Box Office: Star Wars Erupts with Record $238M Opening","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office: Star Wars Erupts with Record $238M OpeningStar Wars: The Force Awakens smashes all-time opening weekend box officeby Gitesh Pandya | December 20, 2015 |  CommentsThis weekend, moviegoers flooded the multiplexes for Han Solo’s first new adventure in 32 years as the hotly anticipated Star Wars: The Force Awakens smashed the all-time opening weekend box office record with a jaw-dropping estimate of $238M. That easily beat out the previous record of $208.8M set just this past June by Jurassic World.Intense fan demand made this one of the most frontloaded debuts too. Thursday night kicked off the release with pre-shows starting at 7:00pm which resulted in a mammoth $57M – a new record. The final Harry Potter held that record for over four years with $43.5M with shows starting later at midnight.Studios insist on bundling pre-shows into the opening day figure which for Force Awakens came in at an astounding $120.5M. That beat the $91.1M of the final Potter to become the new all-time best opening day ever. Both films featured 3D and IMAX, though Force‘s gross included five more hours worth of showtimes. The opening day tally accounted for a whopping 51% of the full weekend figure.The new Star Wars collected a staggering $68.7M on Saturday which represented a 43% drop from the THU/FRI opening day figure. Sunday is estimated to decline by 29% to $48.8M. At these box office heights, slight fluctuations in percentage drops can cause big changes to the grosses. It is possible that Sunday overperforms and the weekend finishes in $240M+ territory.The PG-13 Force arrived after years of hype. Star Wars fans unhappy with the prequels were hoping the new film would bring back the excitement they had with the first trilogy. Critics and fans have agreed that director J.J. Abrams succeeded. Force combined beloved characters from the old films with fun new characters all encompassed in the space Western packaging which made the first Star Wars in 1977 become such a runaway blockbuster.Reviews were sensational and moviegoer feedback has been electric. The CinemaScore grade was an encouraging A and other audience metrics also show extremely high levels of customer satisfaction. That will bode well for the weeks ahead in terms of attracting non-fans plus piling up repeat viewing over the holidays from the Jedi faithful. All six previous Star Wars episodes opened in May. For the seventh episode, Disney decided to shift to mid-December and open on the same weekend that kicked off record runs for both Titanic and Avatar with Christmas helping the second weekend and New Year’s aiding the third frame.The raw stats on Force are mesmerizing. The opening weekend generated an average of $57,571 from 4,134 theaters – the best ever for a wide release. 3D screens accounted for 47% of the gross which is impressive by today’s standards. The audience was 58% male and 63% over 25. Also coming out as winners this weekend – all the 2016 films lucky enough to get their trailers in front of the new Rey and Finn adventure.The road ahead could not be more promising. Given the record weekend start and the fact that people are taking off from work and school as the week progresses, mid-week daily grosses could be in the $30M vicinity with Thursday dropping down due to Christmas Eve. The second weekend should have a smaller than usual drop for a tentpole because of Friday being Christmas Day. Every day between December 25 and January 1 behaves like a Saturday at the box office and the film’s third frame will also be a holiday session. Star Wars: The Force Awakens could very well have more than $600M in the domestic bank coming out of New Year’s weekend with all of January to look forward to.Fans sought out IMAX screens in record numbers to maximize their experience. The 391 IMAX sites grossed a staggering $30.1M this weekend vaulting past the old record of $20.9M set by Jurassic World. That made for a scorching $77,000 screen average. Worldwide, 667 IMAX screens opened to a record $48M edging the $44.1M of Jurassic World which included China. Star Wars opens there next month so its global bow becomes even more impressive.Outside North America, Force debuted to a stunning $279M from international markets for an eye-popping global launch of $517M. Top markets were the U.K. with $48.9M, Germany with $27.3M, France with $22.7M, Australia with $18.9M, and Japan with $13.5M. Most every country opened this weekend with the exceptions of India and Greece which debut next weekend and China which is set for a January 9 opening. Star Wars: The Force Awakens stands an excellent chance of becoming only the second film ever to reach the $2 billion club joining Avatar.Of course, Disney has no plans to stop with just this film. The Force Awakens was intended to rejuvenate the Star Wars moviegoing experience and more installments are on the calendar to keep the billions rolling in. Next up is the spin-off Rogue One on this very same weekend next year followed by Episode VIII on Memorial Day weekend 2017. A Han Solo film is planned for Memorial Day weekend 2018, Episode IX is slated for 2019, and more films may also be announced later taking the franchise into its sixth decade.Moviegoers actually spent some cash on films not about Han Solo this weekend. Fox debuted its kidpic sequel Alvin and the Chipmunks: The Road Chip&nbsp;and took second place with an estimated $14.4M from 3,653 theaters for a $3,942 average. The PG-rated comedy delivered the lowest opening yet in the four-film franchise and is setting itself up as the alternative to the violent Star Wars for parents with smaller children. All of them opened in mid-December and the two sequels both finished with more than four times their openings. But competing against BB-8 will be a formidable task.Tina Fey and Amy Poehler joined forces again, this time for an R-rated comedy, and saw Sisters debut in third place with an estimated $13.4M averaging $4,530 from 2,962 playdates. Reactions to the Universal release have been mixed with critics giving somewhat decent marks and audiences feeling the same way. The CinemaScore grade was a mediocre B. With Star Wars out there, it was no surprise that Sisters skewed 79% female.Four-time champ The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 2 fell to fourth dropping 51% to an estimated $5.7M pushing Lionsgate to $254.4M to date. All four films in the franchise have now broken the quarter-billion mark. Global tally is up to $595.5M. Down 50% was the boxing hit Creed with an estimated $5.1M putting Warner Bros. at $87.9M.Disney’s Lucasfilm unit clobbered the competition and one of the victims was the studio’s other division Pixar. Its latest toon The Good Dinosaur tumbled 59% to an estimated $4.2M upping the cume to only $96.5M. After 26 days of play, the kidpic still has not broken the $100M mark. Universal’s horror-comedy&nbsp;Krampus followed with an estimated $3.8M, off 55%, for a $34.8M total. Ron Howard’s adventure In the Heart of the Sea got decimated in its second weekend crumbling 69% to an estimated $3.5M giving Warner Bros. another misfire this year with a weak $18.6M cume.The top ten films grossed an estimated $291.6M which was up a staggering 139% from last year when The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies opened at number one with $54.7M; and up 115% from 2013 when The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug stayed in the top spot with $31.5M.Follow Gitesh on Twitter!","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"dceu","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/21004207/StarWars-BoxOffice.jpg","slug":"box-office-star-wars-erupts-with-record-238m-opening"},{"id":"47509104690805","title":"Deadpool Scores Huge Opening Weekend Grosses","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Deadpool Scores Huge Opening Weekend GrossesKung Fu Panda 3 and How To Be Single round out the top three.by Gitesh Pandya | February 15, 2016 |  Comments&nbsp;With a jaw-dropping opening that shattered all industry expectations, the super hero action-comedy Deadpool conquered the global box office with a stunning $300M launch – a gross more than five times its production cost.In North America, Deadpool crushed records with a mammoth $150M four-day holiday debut, according to estimates, and $132.8M over the Friday-to-Sunday portion. That was by far the biggest Presidents’ Day weekend launch ever soaring past the $93M of last year’s Fifty Shades of Grey and also the best ever for the month of February.Based on the Marvel comic book character and released by Fox, the Ryan Reynolds smash generated the best opening day, three-day, and four-day weekends ever for any R-rated film. In a world where box office records are broken constantly, no R film has managed to break the high bar set by The Matrix Reloaded back in 2003. Until now. That heavily hyped sequel bowed to $42.5M on its opening day – a Thursday including Wednesday night pre-shows starting at 10pm. Deadpool beat that record with $47.5M including pre-shows. The Neo sequel posted a Friday-to-Sunday of $91.8M and a four-day Thursday-to-Sunday bow of $134.3M. Of course, ticket prices were lower back then but as a sci-fi sequel, anticipation was sky high at the time.Superhero films make much of their money from younger kids so Deadpool‘s performance was exceptional considering the large number of people who may have wanted to go, but were not taken to see it. Instead of a brand that was universally known, this blockbuster scored the old fashioned way – they made a damn good movie. Studios have oversaturated the market with super hero films both from the recent past and the numerous ones that fans know are littered on the upcoming calendars. Deadpool offered something new, refreshing, and edgy. Critics responded with fantastic reviews. The studio embargoed those reviews until right before the Super Bowl knowing they would prompt chatter among sports fans during the big game which would funnel right into the film’s release a few days later.Word of mouth has been through the roof and recommendations from those who saw it first have been a major selling tool to convince others. The CinemaScore grade was a terrific A and scores across all metrics are showing that customers absolutely love this product. That gives the action-comedy a bright future as many not familiar with the character may become convinced in the days and weeks ahead to take a trip. This is in stark contrast to 2011’s Green Lantern which Reynolds anchored on its way to a disappointing $116.6M domestic final. Deadpool grossed more than that in its first three days and its budget was significantly lower at just $58M which is very small by super hero movie standards. Deadpool averaged a jaw-dropping $42,159 over four days from 3,558 theaters and $37,310 over three days. Next weekend provides little competition as it charges towards the $200M mark.Among films based on Marvel comic book characters, Deadpool ranks fifth all-time behind The Avengers, Avengers: Age of Ultron, Iron Man 3, and Spider-Man 3. All were PG-13 films and three of those four were in 3D while Deadpool was 2D only. Higher ticket prices did come from IMAX and other PLF screens, though. 830 total screens delivered 25% of the gross as fans of the foul-mouthed anti-hero were happy to pay extra for a premium experience. IMAX generated records with $18.4M over four days in North America from 374 screens while 232 overseas screens brought in an additional $9M for a global $27.4M haul with much more to come.Also impressive is the fact that Deadpool posted the third biggest opening of all-time for a non-sequel after Avengers (kind of a sequel, but not fully) and The Hunger Games. The mercenary character comes from the X-Men franchise and Deadpool actually opened better than any movie from that series. The biggest debut for that property was the $122.9M four-day Memorial Day bow for the third pic, The Last Stand, and Deadpool made more in its first three days. It also opened bigger than every Captain America, Thor, Hulk, and Superman movie. The daily breakdown for Deadpool this weekend was $47.5M for Friday (including $12.7M from Thursday pre-shows starting at 7pm), $42.6M for Saturday, $42.7M for Valentine’s Day Sunday, and an estimated $17.3M for Presidents’ Day Monday.Moviegoers around the world were equally pumped for Deadpool as the overseas launch saw an estimated $150M through Monday from 12,241 screens in 61 markets. Leading the way was the U.K. with $20.1M followed by Russia with $12.4M and Australia with $10.1M. Italy, Spain, and South Korea open next weekend and Japan launches in June. Look for the worldwide tally to smash $500M sometime next week.Following its two-week run at the top, Kung Fu Panda 3 slipped to second place but still posted very healthy numbers thanks in part to the start of many school holidays. Fox hauled in an estimated $26M over the long weekend allowing the cume to break the century mark in 18 days with a figure of $100.3M. The Friday-to-Sunday portion of $19.8M dipped a mere 7% from last weekend. It is now running 21% behind the pace of its 2011 predecessor.North America is the world’s number two market for Panda 3. China is still tops with a new cume of $124.7M through Sunday allowing it to surpass the final $124.2M total of Star Wars: The Force Awakens. DreamWorks Animation planned the film’s release to be right ahead of the Lunar New Year holiday and the strategy paid off handsomely. With $262.5M worldwide already, and most major markets yet to open, the road ahead will see Po’s numbers swell this spring.Dakota Johnson and Rebel Wilson, who enjoyed big number one openers last year with Fifty Shades of Grey and Pitch Perfect 2 respectively, delivered a moderate opening for their new dating comedy How To Be Single which grossed an estimated $20.6M over four days. The Warner Bros. release averaged $6,162 over the long holiday weekend from 3,343 locations. Reviews were mixed for the R-rated pic.Produced by New Line and MGM, Single played heavily to the gals. Exit polls showed that the crowd was a whopping 82% female while 61% were under 35. Word-of-mouth is lukewarm as the CinemaScore grade was a B. Valentine’s Day helped as Sunday was the highest grossing day of the four-day period with plenty of girls-night-out group business.Critics and audiences both gave a thumbs down to Ben Stiller’s comedy sequel Zoolander 2 which had a disappointing opening in fourth place with an estimated $16M over four days from 3,394 locations resulting in a mild $4,714 average over the long weekend. The Friday-to-Sunday portion took in $14M for a $4,110 three-day average which fell below the opening of the first Zoolander from 2001. That well-liked pic bowed to $15.5M over a non-holiday weekend in the weak month of September soon after the 9/11 tragedy plus had much lower ticket prices and 26% fewer theaters.Reviews were harsh for Zoolander 2 which reunited main cast members like Stiller, Owen Wilson, and Will Ferrell plus added Penelope Cruz and Kristen Wiig. The lousy C+ CinemaScore grade indicated that paying customers were not happy with what they invested their time and money on. Paramount saw an audience that was 51% female and 62% over 25. With better comedy options over the long weekend, customers went elsewhere for laughs. The PG-13 film, which Stiller also directed, cost over $50M to produce and its final domestic gross will not reach that mark. On a weekend when something fresh and new dominated, this recycled material offered the same old thing.Having the top two films in the country was not enough for Fox which also had a third film in the top five with Oscar contender The Revenant which collected an estimated $7.8M over four days to boost its tally to $160.1M. Worldwide, the Leonardo DiCaprio hit has taken in $362.1M and even swept the BAFTAs over the weekend with five wins including Best Film, Director, and Actor.From a franchise that used to be at Fox for decades, Star Wars: The Force Awakens was bumped from the top three for the first time. BB8 and friends saw an estimated $7.6M this weekend in its ninth round and shot its domestic cume up to $916.3M. The worldwide haul now sits at $2.03 billion with the next official sequel Episode VIII just now starting its shooting schedule for a targeted release date of December 15, 2017. Another $2 billion could be in store that winter.Suffering the worst drop among holdovers in the top ten was the Coen Brothers comedy Hail, Caesar! which placed seventh in its sophomore frame with an estimated $7.2M. Universal has banked $22M in 11 days and looks headed for a $30-33M final. Among wide releases from the directors playing in 1,500 or more theaters, this is their worst performance. Valentine’s Day helped the romance The Choice hold up well with an estimated $6M over the long weekend. Cume to date is $14M for Lionsgate going to about $22M.Universal’s sequel Ride Along 2 followed with an estimated $5M while the STX thriller The Boy scared up an estimated $3.6M. Totals are $83.6M and $31.4M, respectively.The top ten films grossed an estimated $249.8M over four days which was up 11% from last year’s Presidents’ Day frame when Fifty Shades of Grey opened at number one with $93M; and up a healthy 22% from 2014’s holiday when The LEGO Movie remained in the top spot with $63.5M.&nbsp;Get earlier box office updates and analysis by following BoxOfficeGuru.com on Twitter.","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"American, 93rd, on, Out, America, natural, Witch, Baby, Adult, Mindy, facebook","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/10225311/DeadpoolCC.jpg","slug":"box-office-deadpool"},{"id":"47509102050907","title":"Box Office: Squad Still #1, Sausage Strong #2","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office: Squad Still #1, Sausage Strong #2Florence Foster Jenkins debuted to an estimated $6.6M.by Gitesh Pandya | August 14, 2016 |  CommentsThis weekend, in its second round, the super villain pic Suicide Squad&nbsp;took a nosedive tumbling 67% but still was strong enough to be the number one movie in North America grossing an estimated $43.8M. That was a bit better than the 69% for Batman v Superman from earlier this year, but larger than what most comic book movies see on the second weekend.Squad now sits at $222.9M and still hopes to crack $300M by the end of its domestic run. Competition over the coming weeks will not be too harsh. Overseas this weekend, Warner Bros. took in an estimated $58.7M, down 56%, raising the international cume to $242.5M and the global gross to $465.4M. Germany and Japan are still to come.The animated pic Sausage Party scored the biggest opening weekend of the year for an R-rated comedy grossing an estimated $33.6M for second place. Sony’s food pic voiced by Seth Rogen, Kristin Wiig and many others averaged a stellar $10,828 from 3,103 theaters. Good reviews and a unique concept helped lure in adults looking for original raunchy humor. The road ahead looks bright.Disney opened its latest family adventure Pete’s Dragon and was met with a decent $21.5M launch from 3,702 sites for a $5,808 average. The PG-rated entry earned good reviews and hopes to connect with kids on their final weeks of summer vacation throughout the August days ahead. A nice A grade from CinemaScore bodes well for the road ahead.Universal’s Jason Bourne followed with an estimated $13.6M falling 39% and bumped its domestic cume up to $126.8M. Global stands at $246M. The hit comedy Bad Moms held up very well slipping only 18% to an estimated $11.5M for a terrific new cume of $71.5M for STX.The Secret Life of Pets dropped just 23% to an estimated $8.8M putting Universal at $335.9M to date and a worldwide total of $592.6M. Paramount’s Star Trek Beyond grossed an estimated $6.8M, down 32%, and raised its tally to $139.7M so far.Meryl Streep’s new comedy Florence Foster Jenkins debuted to an estimated $6.6M from 1,528 locations averaging a so-so $4,306 per theater. The PG-13 film co-starring Hugh Grant earned good reviews but played mostly to one quadrant – older females.The Kevin Spacey family comedy Nine Lives dropped 44% to an estimated $3.5M upping its sum to a weak $13.6M for EuropaCorp. The horror flick Lights Out fell 46% to an estimated $3.2M giving the low-budget fright flick $61.1M to date for Warner Bros.The specialty marketplace saw an impressive debut from the Jeff Bridges-Chris Pine film Hell or High Water which made off with an estimated $592,000 from 32 locations for a solid $18,500 average. Critics praised the film across the board and next weekend will see an expansion. CBS Films is distributing in partnership with Lionsgate.The top ten films grossed an estimated $152.9M which was up 18% from last year when Straight Outta Compton opened at number one with $60.2M; and up 22% from 2014 when Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles stayed in the top spot with $28.M.Compared to projections, Sausage Party opened ahead of my $23M forecast while Pete’s Dragon was close to my $19M prediction. Florence Foster Jenkins&nbsp;was also near my $8M projection.Follow Gitesh on Twitter.","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"2017, Apple, 78th, Returns, travel, Yoda, Winter, documentaries, YouTube, Awards, Sneak, america, Annual, TV+","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/14150005/PETes-sausage-rep.jpg","slug":"box-office-squad-still-1-sausage-strong-2"},{"id":"47509103612524","title":"The Jungle Book Runs Wild Over the Competition","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})The Jungle Book Runs Wild Over the CompetitionBarbershop: The Next Cut and The Boss round out the top three.by Gitesh Pandya | April 17, 2016 |  CommentsCrushing industry expectations and proving once again that summer numbers can happen in spring, Disney’s The Jungle Book opened at number one with a humongous $103.6M, according to estimates. The PG-rated adaptation of the popular Rudyard Kipling story averaged a massive $25,712 from 4,028 theaters. 3D and IMAX screens contributed heavily for this VFX-driven visual feast.It was the second largest April opening weekend of all-time trailing only the $147.2M of last year’s Furious 7. The Jungle Book also generated the seventh best debut in history for a non-sequel which was especially impressive. The studio has used spring in the past for epic live-action stories for families most notably with 2010’s Alice in Wonderland starring Johnny Depp which bowed to $116.1M and last year’s Cinderella with Cate Blanchett which debuted to $67.9M.The weekend kicked off with $32.4M on Friday including $4.2M from Thursday night pre-shows. Saturday rose 27% to $41.1M while Sunday is projected to drop by an optimistic 27% to $30M. March Disney titles Cinderella and Oz The Great and Powerful declined by 33-34% on their first Sundays.Jungle Book did not have any known stars on screen but the CG-heavy film did offer the voice talents of Bill Murray, Ben Kingsley, and Idris Elba as the computer-generated animals. Broad appeal brought in all audiences and while younger children may have been scared away by the promise of animal attacks, the non-family crowd more than made up for the loss as they showed up just as much as the family audience did.Reviews were fantastic for the Jon Favreau-directed pic and paying customers were very pleased as evidenced by the glowing A grade from CinemaScore. The road ahead is promising and breaking the $300M domestic mark is very possible. If it reaches that height, The Jungle Book will become the fourth 2016 hit to do it following Deadpool, Batman v Superman, and Zootopia – all before the May kickoff of the summer movie season.After a few international markets opened a week earlier, The Jungle Book stormed into its major global launch this weekend and saw fantastic grosses everywhere. The weekend delivered a stunning $136.1M from 49 territories, both new and holdover, pushing the offshore total to $187.4M and the global gross to $291M. China rocked to a $50.3M opening weekend easily leading all markets. After ten days in India, Book took in $20.1M making it the third biggest Hollywood hit of all-time there after Furious 7 and Jurassic World. With strong buzz worldwide plus Korea and Japan still to open, The Jungle Book has a shot at joining the billion dollar club.Ice Cube’s second comedy sequel of the year, Barbershop: The Next Cut, debuted in second place with an estimated $20.2M from 2,661 locations for a solid $7,595 average. The PG-13 pic from MGM and Warner Bros. was the first chapter in a dozen years for this franchise and came in below the $20.6M of 2002’s Barbershop (from a thousand fewer theaters) and the $24.2M of its 2004 sequel. Reviews were positive and audiences also were happy as the CinemaScore grade was a good A-. Studio research showed that the audience was 54% female and 66% over 25.Melissa McCarthy’s latest comedy The Boss fell sharply in its second weekend dropping 57% to an estimated $10.2M pushing the cume to $40.4M. Bad buzz is causing this one to fade fast and a final of about $65M seems likely. That’s not bad for a film that cost only $29M. However, it ranks last among McCarthy’s star vehicles as she is normally capable of drawing a larger audience. She hits the screens again this summer in the reboot of Ghostbusters.Warner Bros. suffered another sharp fall for its comic book epic Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice which fell 61% to an estimated $9M in its fourth weekend. The domestic cume rose to $311.3M cracking the all-time domestic Top 50. Negative buzz has led to rapid erosion despite a massive start. Look for a final North American total of near $330M making the opening weekend account for a whopping 51% of the sum.Overseas audiences are also moving on to other films. Justice grossed an estimated $15.1M from international markets this weekend, dropping 56%. The cume now sits at $516M led by China’s $95M. All markets have opened so a final global tally of about $880M seems likely with the colossal opening weekend repping a very high 48% of the pie. While definitely not a failure, this result is disappointing given the size of the first weekend and the fact that two of the most iconic super heroes of all-time were put together on screen for the first time, along with a heavily-promoted third popular character.2016’s highest-grossing worldwide blockbuster followed as Zootopia slipped 43% to an estimated $8.2M in its seventh weekend in the top five. With Disney launching another major family tentpole, the decline was the largest yet for the bunny cop toon. Domestic climbed to $307.5M. International grosses rose to $574.8M led by China which is nearing the end of its run with a jaw-dropping $234.2M. The worldwide tally now stands at $882.3M with Japan set to open next weekend. That market has seen tremendous grosses for Disney toons and should send Zootopia right into the billion dollar club.With Zootopia in March, The Jungle Book in April, Captain America: Civil War in May, and Finding Dory in June, Disney could have in its stable billion-dollar grossers in each of four consecutive months. Add in Marvel’s Doctor Strange, the Thanksgiving weekend toon Moana, and Rogue One: A Star Wars Story and the Mouse House’s many lucrative divisions could give the studio its best box office year in company history. A key component has been high quality products.The new Kevin Costner actioner Criminal failed to excite moviegoers opening in sixth place with only $5.9M, according to estimates. The R-rated Lionsgate release was panned by critics and averaged just $2,180 from 2,683 theaters.The rom-com sequel My Big Fat Greek Wedding 2 fell 50% to an estimated $3.3M putting Universal at $52.1M. Sony’s faith-based hit Miracles from Heaven followed with an estimated $1.9M, down 60%, lifting the total to $56.9M.Two more low-cost films rounded out the top ten. God’s Not Dead 2 fell 58% to an estimated $1.7M for Pure Flix while Helen Mirren’s Eye in the Sky dipped 46% to an estimated $1.6M for Bleecker Street. Totals are $17M and $13.1M, respectively.The top ten films grossed an estimated $165.5M which was up 52% from last year when Furious 7 stayed at number one for a third time with $29.2M; and up 42% from 2014 when Captain America: The Winter Soldier remained in the top spot over the Easter frame with $25.6M.Get earlier box office updates and analysis by following BoxOfficeGuru.com on&nbsp;Twitter.","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"biography, 24, Awards, harry","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/17201717/JungleBookBO.jpg","slug":"the-jungle-book-runs-wild-over-the-competition"},{"id":"47509103611499","title":"Box Office: It’s Still A Jungle Out There","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office: It's Still A Jungle Out Thereby Sujit Chawla | April 24, 2016 |  CommentsDisney’s The Jungle Book held on strong in its second weekend while The Huntsman: Winter’s War was met with middling results.The Jungle Book remained in the top spot this weekend with an estimated $60.1M, a drop of 41% from last weekend’s $100M+ opening, bringing its total up to $191.5M. This will be the second of a possible six $300M+ plus grossers for the Mouse House this year after Zootopia accomplished that result last weekend. And looking ahead in 2016 there’s still Captain America: Civil War, Alice Through the Looking Glass, Finding Dory and Rogue One: A Star Wars Story to look forward to, all of which should find massive audiences. Eventually, Disney will run out of theme park rides and old classics to remake, but until then this should be a banner year for them.Second place belonged to the debuting The Huntsman: Winter’s War which captured $20.1M, according to estimates, from 3,791 theaters for a per screen average of $5,297. Critic reviews were very soft as it stands at only 17% positive at Rotten Tomatoes, but the CinemaScore was a B+, which is stronger than the B score the first film received back in the summer of 2012. That film opened to $56M on its way to a final total of $155M. will struggle to even reach the opening of the original. It’s unlikely they’ll make a third film unless they bring back Kristen Stewart for a trilogy ender since she clearly is the reason the first film was so successful. I’ll let you decide how sarcastic that last sentence may or may not have been.Falling 46.5% in its second weekend was Ice Cube’s , cutting up an estimated $10.8M, bringing its total to $36M. The first two films in the series had similar opening weekend but smaller second weekend drops. Look for The Next Cut to finish in the $55M range which would be the lowest in the series.Fourth place belonged to Disney’s Zootopia which fell only 19% in its eighth weekend to an estimated $6.6M, bringing its total up to a huge $316M. Is it possible this unheralded animated film could end up outgrossing the two biggest superheroes of all-time? Because in its fifth weekend, Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice slipped 39% to an estimated $5.5M, bringing its total up to $319.5M. It’ll be interesting to see if Zootopia can catch and pass the leaders of the Justice League. And sandwiched in between the two behemoths was Universal’s The Boss which took in an estimated $6M this weekend, bringing its cume up to $49.5M.In seventh place was Criminal, which made $3.1M this weekend, according to estimates, bringing its total up to $10.9M with not much left in the tank. In eighth place was My Big Fat Greek Wedding 2 which took in another $2.1M this weekend, according to estimates, bringing its cume up to a solid $55.3M. A far cry from the original’s $241M total, but not horrible.If you had to decide which movie would make more money based on the following descriptions, which would you choose: A) A bilingual Mexican/American buddy cop film with no recognizable American stars or B) A movie starring Tom Hanks? If you guessed A, good job! Despite opening on 69 fewer screens Compadres opened to $1.35M this weekend, according to estimates, from 368 playdates, for a per screen average of $3,668. Meanwhile, debuting outside the top 10 was Tom Hanks in the oddly named A Hologram for the King which opened to an estimated $1.2M from 401 theaters, for a per screen average of $3,010. And in the middle of those two debuts was the Bleecker Street thriller Eye in the Sky which picked up another $1.2M this weekend, according to estimates, bringing its total up to $15M. Bleecker Street was less successful with Elvis &amp; Nixon which opened on 381 screens but only managed to earn an estimated $456,793 for a poor average of only $1,199.The top ten films grossed an estimated $117.7M which was up 46.8% from last year when Furious 7 stayed at number one for a fourth time with $17.8M; and up 20.8% from 2014 when The Other Womano opened in the top spot with $24.7M. Compared to projections, The Huntsman: Winter’s War was dead on target with Gitesh’s $20M prediction.","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"Funimation, APB, Amazon, BBC","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/24150146/600JungleBook.jpg","slug":"box-office-its-still-a-jungle-out-there"},{"id":"47509103609450","title":"Box Office: Jungle Book Threepeats as Civil War Looms","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office: Jungle Book Threepeats as Civil War Loomsby Sujit Chawla | May 1, 2016 |  CommentsThis weekend, for the third time, Disney’s The Jungle Book was easily the top choice of North American moviegoers. The VFX-heavy family adventure grossed an estimated $42.4M and slipped a mere 31% lifting its cume to a spectacular $252.1M. It became only the seventh film in box office history to break $40M on its third weekend. Still averaging more than $10,000 per theater in its third frame, Jungle Book is on course to reach the neighborhood of $350M which would put it into the all-time Top 40 among domestic blockbusters.International markets continued to rock delivering $57.1M this weekend to boost the offshore sum to $432.7M and the global haul to an eye-popping $684.8M. China is still tops overseas with a stunning $129.8M tripling the next biggest market. Korea and Japan will open later this summer putting The Jungle Book&nbsp;into the exclusive billion dollar club – a rare feat for a non-sequel.Disney remained number one in the world over the weekend, but not with Mowgli this time. Instead, its Marvel division kicked off the global launch for&nbsp;Captain America: Civil War with openings in 37 international markets which resulted in a mammoth $200.2M launch. That was just a hair below the $201.2M overseas debut from 44 territories of last year’s Avengers: Age of Ultron. Both premiered around the world a week before the U.S. release as is usually the case with Marvel’s summer kickoff films which are able to take advantage of holidays like May Day which is a non-factor in America.Leading the way was Korea with a huge $28.9M followed by Mexico’s $20.6M and the U.K.’s $20.5M. Factoring in the same territories and changes in exchange rates from a year ago, Disney reports that the Civil War opening was only 5% below Ultron‘s. Civil War should play out less like a third Captain America film, and more like a third Avengers movie given the cast which includes most all of the assembly of super heroes minus Hulk and Thor, but with the addition of Spider-Man in a small part. All remaining markets open next weekend including the U.S., China, and Russia.The North American opening weekend is expected to challenge the $191.3M of Ultron from this weekend last year. Currently, reviews and advance ticket sales are both higher than those of all past Marvel movies. Worldwide, Civil War has a shot at reaching the vicinity of Ultron‘s final tally of $1.4 billion. In fact by next Sunday, it may already be halfway there.Universal’s epic fairy tale prequel The Huntsman: Winter’s War dropped a sharp 52% in its second weekend following a lackluster debut. The $100M+ budgeted picture collected an estimated $9.4M in the sophomore frame boosting the total to just $34M for the pricey pic featuring big stars and plenty of visual effects. International sales rose to $97M for a current global take of $131M which is disappointing. With Japan as the only significant market left, reaching a $200M worldwide final is not guaranteed.The stars of Comedy Central’s hit sketch comedy show Key &amp; Peele drew in modest results for their first major movie project Keanu which opened in third with an estimated $9.4M from 2,658 locations for a mild $3,518 average. The R-rated comedy won reviews that were generally positive and the audience, not surprisingly, was more male. Audience data from Warner Bros. showed that the crowd was 53% male and 71% over 25.Opening a notch below was a different kind of comedy – the female-skewing all-star vehicle Mother’s Day – which grossed an estimated $8.3M from 3,035 sites for a weak $2,735. The PG-13 film packed starpower from Jennifer Aniston, Julia Roberts, and Kate Hudson but was panned by film critics across the board which repelled audiences. Open Road witnessed an opening below the $13M of 2011’s New Year’s Eve and well below the $56.3M of 2010’s&nbsp;Valentine’s Day. All three were ensemble comedies directed by Garry Marshall.Barbershop: The Next Cut dropped 42% to an estimated $6.1M giving Warner Bros. $44.7M to date. After two months in the top five the toon smash&nbsp;Zootopia fell to sixth place with an estimated $5M, off a slim 24% in its ninth round. Disney has amassed $323.5M domestically and a staggering $931.4M worldwide. The studio is going overboard this year with potential billion dollar blockbusters and its Pixar and Lucasfilm divisions still have films to supply later this year.Rival animated offering Ratchet &amp; Clank crashed and burned in its opening weekend bowing to an estimated $4.8M from 2,891 locations for a dismal $1,668 average. The PG-rated pic had too much competition from Disney to deal with and will find its audience on home entertainment platforms.Melissa McCarthy’s The Boss dropped 32% to an estimated $4.3M for Universal upping the sum to $56.1M. This will end up as her lowest gross ever in a lead role. Off only 31%, Batman v Superman followed with an estimated $3.8M putting Warner Bros. at $325.1M to date. Overseas grosses are slowing and the new cume of $537.8M gives the superhero smackdown a global tally of $863M. Rounding out the top ten was Criminal with an estimated $1.3M, down 58%, for a cume of only $13.5M for Lionsgate.The top ten films grossed an estimated $94.8M which was down 58% from last year when Avengers: Age of Ultron opened at number one with $191.3M; and down 33% from 2014 when The Amazing Spider-Man 2 debuted in the top spot with $91M. The summer kickoff weekend falls one week later on the calendar this year.Compared to projections, Keanu opened a bit below my $11M forecast while Mother’s Day was on target with my $9M prediction. Ratchet &amp; Clank debuted with half of my $9M projection.Get earlier box office updates and analysis by following BoxOfficeGuru.com on twitter.","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"Walt, service, Seed, America","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/01125738/jb-rep.jpg","slug":"box-office-jungle-book-threepeats-as-civil-war-looms"},{"id":"47509112756932","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: Record-Shattering $94M Bow for Guardians","content":"\n\n                                            Weekend Box Office\n                                        \n                        \n                        \n                            var mps=mps||{}; mps._queue=mps._queue||{}; mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[];\n                            mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function() {\n                                mps.rt.insertlogo('#article_sponsorship_ad', 'ploc=articlesponsorship');\n                            });\n                        \n                    \n                    \n                        Box Office Guru Wrapup: Record-Shattering $94M Bow for Guardians\n                        \n                        by Gitesh Pandya | August 3, 2014                          | \n                          \n                              Comments\n                          \n                     \n\n                     \n\n                     \n                       \n                         \n                           \n                         \n                           \n                         \n                           \n                         \n                           \n                       \n                     \n\n                    \n                                                Marvel enjoyed one of the film industry’s most amazing openings in recent years, and silenced any doubters, with a record-breaking top spot debut for the new super hero adventure Guardians of the Galaxy which led the overall box office to the largest August weekend in box office history.\nBlasting off with a sensational weekend estimate of $94M, Guardians seized control of the marketplace and beat out all expectations as it gave birth to a brand new movie franchise. Averaging a stellar $23,039 from 4,080 locations, the PG-13 band of misfits had the third biggest opening weekend of 2014 trailing only Transformers: Age of Extinction (about $100M in late June) and Captain America: The Winter Soldier ($95M in early April). It also shattered the August opening weekend record set in 2007 by The Bourne Ultimatum’s $69.3M. The location count was also a record for this month.\nIt was especially impressive since Guardians is not a sequel and is not based on any property known to a broad mainstream audience. Certainly, popular super heroes like Captain America, Thor, Green Lantern, Hulk and X-Men are more known to non-comic fans but Galaxy attracted a bigger opening in its movie franchise debut than any of those. In fact, the only super hero franchise kickoff films to open bigger were 2002’s Spider-Man ($114.8M) and 2008’s Iron Man ($98.6M) which both launched on the more lucrative first weekend of May. Among all non-sequels, Guardians had the seventh best opening weekend of all-time which was remarkable.\nWith a good product, the Disney release connected with audiences and brought in a breath of fresh air at a time when sequel fatigue was kicking in. Plus most recent action offerings were very serious in tone while Galaxy promised fun, humor, and laughs as it put something new on the table. Ticket buyers responded. Reviews were terrific and helped to draw in those curious to know what this new comic franchise was all about. James Gunn directed and the cast included Chris Pratt, Zoe Saldana, Dave Bautista plus voice contributions from Bradley Cooper and Vin Diesel. Marvel can now open its library doors even wider for more future films – as long as the movies are rock solid and marketing is effective.\nStudio research showed that Star-Lord and company drew a crowd that was very common for this genre, but appeal to women was stronger than usual. 56% of the audience was male and 55% was over 25. Male shares for the recent Captain America and Thor sequels were higher at 64% and 62%, respectively. 45% of the business came from 3D screens which is pretty good nowadays for a conversion. 354 IMAX screens contributed a solid $11.7M, or 12%.\nThe weekend for Guardians of the Galaxy started with $37.8M on Friday which included $11.2M from Thursday night pre-shows starting at 7pm which was the best for any film all year. Saturday dipped by 18% to $31M which was a good hold for a comic flick with a large built-in fan base. Sunday is projected to dip another 19% to $25.2M. Word-of-mouth has been strong and the A grade from CinemaScore shows that moviegoers are liking what they are paying for which bodes well for coming weeks.\nThanks to Guardians, the summer box office ended its seven-week streak of down weekends when compared to last year which was a big relief for exhibitors who need bodies in those multiplexes. In fact, the top ten soared to over $180M marking the best weekend ever seen during the month of August. It was even stronger than any of the July frames from last month.\n3D and IMAX contributed to much of the opening weekend figure as ticket prices are much higher these days. Strip those out and the actual number of tickets sold for Galaxy was just over 10 million. To put that into perspective, it was roughly even with the number of tickets sold during the opening of another franchise debut with an ensemble cast of misunderstood Marvel heroes – the first X-Men from July 2000. That hit spawned a series with seven films and counting that has grossed over $3 billion worldwide so Marvel and Disney have a lot to look forward to with the Groot gang. A Guardians sequel is already on the calendar to open three years from now on July 28, 2017.\nWhat Guardians also did this weekend was instantly become the odds-on favorite to become the highest grossing movie of this summer, and quite possibly for 2014 so far. With stellar reviews and audience scores, schools still out for summer vacation, a large potential audience that has not come out yet, plus no major tentpole competition next week, a final gross of more than $250M seems likely. Even $300M domestic cannot be ruled out.\nOpening in 42 international markets this weekend, Guardians grossed an estimated $66.4M overseas for a powerful $160.4M worldwide launch. The best performances came from Russia ($13M) and the U.K. ($10.8M). Key markets like Australia, France and Germany open over the weeks ahead while China, which has been very receptive to Marvel super hero films, has not been dated yet.\nFalling from the top spot was the Scarlett Johansson action hit Lucy with an estimated $18.3M, down 58%, for a cume to date of $79.6M which is roughly twice the pic’s $40M budget. The Universal release’s decline was understandable considering the arrival of Guardians and the low audience scores that Lucy received on opening day. A final of about $120M from North America seems likely (close to Angelina Jolie’s $118.3M for Salt) while international appeal for the Luc Besson-directed thriller is strong. Lucy began its overseas roll-out this weekend with a top spot bow in Australia which will be followed by other market launches across August and September.\nUniversal took third place too with its new James Brown drama Get On Up which bowed to an estimated $14M from 2,468 locations for a moderate $5,685 average. It was a decent performance for a film that never generated that much heat to begin with, but was also about half of the openings for star Chadwick Boseman’s 42 ($27.5M in April 2013) and director Tate Taylor’s The Help ($26M in August 2011).\nOlder black women made up the dominant audience for Get On Up. Studio research showed that the crowd was 63% female, 70% African American, and 90% over 25. Reviews were generally positive and audiences too were happy with the film as it earned an encouraging A CinemaScore grade.\nHercules took a beating in its second fight. The Dwayne Johnson-led action epic collapsed 64% and grossed an estimated $10.7M for a cume to date of $52.3M for Paramount. The $100M-budgeted pic should finish its domestic run in the vicinity of $75M. Overseas sales have brought in a decent $56.5M from 35 markets with most key territories yet to open. Russia leads with $18.8M after its second weekend.\nDawn of the Planet of the Apes took a hit thanks to Star-Lord and pals crashing into the marketplace. The sequel to the 2011 prequel fell 48% to an estimated $8.7M for fifth place. With $189.3M to date, Dawn has surpassed the final domestic tally of Rise of the Planet of the Apes and looks on course to finish in the $210M range for Fox.\nPlanes: Fire and Rescue eased just 33% in its third round thanks to very little else for smaller children to see right now. The Disney toon grossed an estimated $6.4M and raised its cume to $47.6M on its way to around $65M. Universal’s sequel The Purge: Anarchy dropped 47%, to an estimated $5.6M for a new total of $63M. The comedy Sex Tape followed with an estimated $3.6M, off 41%, for a lackluster $33.9M to date for Sony.\nMature-skewing films rounded out the top ten with identical grosses. The Michael Douglas-Diane Keaton comedy And So It Goes held up well in its second weekend but still was attracting modest crowds. The Clarius release dipped only 28% to an estimated $3.3M and has collected $10.5M to date. Philip Seymour Hoffman’s well-reviewed spy thriller A Most Wanted Man doubled its screens and grossed an estimated $3.3M as well from 729 sites for a good $4,560 average. Cume is $7.1M for Roadside Attractions.\nMichael Bay’s Transformers: Age of Extinction was booted out of the domestic top ten this weekend, but worldwide it shattered the coveted $1 billion mark on Sunday. The fourth Optimus Prime flick is losing stamina quickly overseas, but the sixth weekend gross of $19.1M boosted the international tally to $763.8M. Add in domestic’s $241.2M and Extinction has now reached $1.005 billion with key markets Japan and Spain to open next weekend. Those two markets combined for $65M in box office on the last Transformers in 2011. Unless Paramount sets up a re-release, the latest Autobots tale looks on a trajectory to end with around $247M from North America with worldwide likely to surpass $1.1 billion just as Dark of the Moon did three years ago. That means one thing – more robots in disguise to come!\nThe top ten films grossed an estimated $168M which was up a sturdy 42% from last year when 2 Guns opened at number one with $27.1M; and up a fantastic 51% from 2012 when The Dark Knight Rises stayed on top for a third time with $35.7M.\nFollow Gitesh on Twitter, y’hear?!!!\n                                            \n                \n            ","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"Marvel, lord, Video, furious, Netflix, green, Mary, SXSW, Pictures","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-RecordShattering-94M-Bow-for-Guardians"},{"id":"47509112777420","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: The Fault in Our Stars Shines in Debut","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: The Fault in Our Stars Shines in DebutPlus, Maleficent hangs on in #2 and Edge of Tomorrow settles into third.by Gitesh Pandya | June 8, 2014 |  CommentsThis weekend, teen girls and young women ruled the multiplexes as the tearjerker The Fault In Our Stars generated a spectacular opening, grossing an estimated $48.2M which quadrupled its production cost. The PG-13 film based on the best-selling romance novel was mostly a one-quadrant film, but the turnout was so incredible that it was able to beat every other film in the marketplace, including Angelina Jolie’s smash hit Maleficent and Tom Cruise’s new action tentpole Edge of Tomorrow.Fault averaged a sizzling $15,191 per theater from 3,173 locations and had no help from 3D or IMAX prices as films that open at number one often have. However, Fox did hold special showings on Thursday night which included a live simulcast with the cast and crew which became a hot event for fans. Giving customers a direct link to celebrities holds a lot of value, and this tactic paid off. Tickets were $25 each and numerous shows were sold out. Look for other studios to copy this stunt.Weekend business was incredibly front-loaded as $26.1M of the take was generated on opening day Friday which, included $8.2M from Thursday night shows which itself included both the $25 tickets and regular pre-shows from 9pm onwards. Fault came into the marketplace with electric buzz and potent social media chatter. It was a can’t-miss event for fans and they came out in droves. Fans liked what they got, as the CinemaScore grade was a solid A. Reviews were generally good. Studio research showed that Fault skewed 82% female and 79% to an under-25 audience. This crowd has become increasingly difficult to get into a movie theater so the film demonstrated how strong the book’s brand was.Angelina Jolie enjoyed a respectable hold for her fairy tale adventure Maleficent which settled for second place in its second weekend with an estimated $33.5M. The 52% drop was reasonable given the huge debut it was coming off of — Jolie’s biggest ever. The Disney hit actually ranked number one on both Saturday and Sunday, but lost the weekend crown thanks to Fault‘s massive upfront showing on Thursday night and Friday. With $127.4M to date, Maleficent looks to be on course to finish with around $210M in North America.Overseas markets once again delivered muscular numbers. The family-friendly pic grossed an estimated $59.7M, boosting the international total to $208.1M and the global haul to $335.5M with plenty more to go as China and Japan have yet to open. Just as her fiancé Brad Pitt did last summer with World War Z, Jolie is set to surpass all previous films in her career and see Maleficent become her highest grossing film of all-time.Not setting career records, Tom Cruise’s latest big-budget action film Edge of Tomorrow opened in third place with an estimated $29.1M which was about right for what he attracts these days in these kinds of movies. The Warner Bros. release averaged $8,340 from 3,490 locations and played to a crowd of sci-fi-loving adult men. Studio research showed that the crowd was 61% male and 73% over 25.Film critics were praising Edge but popcorn crowds thought it was just ok. The CinemaScore was a decent B+. Now in his fourth decade of entertaining the masses, Cruise does not attract as broad of a moviegoing audience as he used to, in North America at least. Plus this was the fourth action tentpole in just six weeks. But the fans that did come out for Edge spent solid amounts on the PG-13 film’s premium options. 47% of the gross came from 3D screens and 14% came from the 349 IMAX locations. Both are impressive shares by today’s standards.Edge of Tomorrow was built to make the bulk of its money from around the world and so far the action pic is delivering strong numbers. This weekend saw a solid $82M in sales boosting the international take to $111M, including the handful of markets which debuted a week earlier. This weekend was ruled by strong bows in China, Korea, and Russia. With $140.1M to date and Japan (a big market for Cruise) still to come on July 4, Edge should be able to surpass at least $350M globally.The mutant tentpole X-Men: Days of Future Past fell 55% in its third weekend to an estimated $14.7M pushing the cume to $189.1M. That’s about even with the 53% drop that 2006’s X-Men: The Last Stand saw on its third weekend after releasing at the same time on the calendar. Future is running 7% behind the pace of Stand which is the top-grossing film domestically for the seven-film franchise.Seth MacFarlane’s Western misfire A Million Ways to Die in the West followed its underwhelming opening with a sharp 57% tumble in the sophomore frame. Universal took in an estimated $7.2M for the R-rated comedy putting the cume at $30.1M on its way to $45-50M. Godzilla was off 51% to an estimated $6M lifting the total tally to $185M for Warner Bros. Global gross is $393.7M.The Seth Rogen-Zac Efron hit Neighbors followed with an estimated $5.2M, off just 36%, for a $137.8M cume for Universal. The R-rated pic has now surpassed studio stablemate Ride Along to become the top-grossing comedy of 2014. A film not making people laugh is Adam Sandler’s Blended which fell 50% to an estimated $4.1M for a lackluster $36.5M to date.A wide expansion for Jon Favreau’s indie hit Chef kept it in the top ten with sales of an estimated $2.6M, up 36%. Open Road has banked $10.4M to date and may be headed for around $17M or so. Summer kickoff film The Amazing Spider-Man 2 fell 50% to an estimated $1.9M for $196.3M domestic and a hefty $699.3M worldwide. A large 72% of global box office has come from outside of North America.The first weekend of June has come and gone but no May film has crossed $200M yet. This hasn’t happened since 2006. Future Past will easily get there, Godzilla has a shot, and the webslinger sequel will probably squeak by the double century mark. Normally there is at least one megahit at this stage of the season capable of crossing $250M, but none of the summer films so far will do it.The top ten films grossed an estimated $152.4M which was up 8% from last year when The Purge opened at number one with $34.1M; but off 11% from 2012 when Madagascar 3 debuted on top with $60.3M.Follow Gitesh on Twitter!","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"Fox, classics, streaming, 2016, Disney+, movies, Martial, Yoda, foreign","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-The-Fault-in-Our-Stars-Shines-in-Debut"},{"id":"47509114357455","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: Godzilla Stomps the Competition in Debut","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: Godzilla Stomps the Competition in DebutAlso, Million Dollar Arm limps into the fourth spot, and Neighbors stays strong.by Gitesh Pandya | May 19, 2014 |  CommentsThis weekend, Warner Bros. and Legendary Pictures smashed expectations with its monster reboot Godzilla as a different type of super hero conquered the worldwide box office with a mammoth global debut. The PG-13 action tentpole grossed an estimated $93.2M in North America from 3,952 locations for a spectacular $23,584 average. Premium-priced options fared very well as the 352 IMAX screens generated an incredible $14.1M for an eye-popping $40,000 average and very high 15% of the overall weekend tally. 51% of the gross came from 3D screens which was also a commendable figure by today’s standards. The radioactive beast generated the year’s second best debut trailing closely behind the $95M of Captain America: The Winter Soldier.The Godzilla property has been around for 60 years and has been popular in the U.S. for many decades. Sony’s big-budget 1998 take from director Roland Emmerich, who was following up his worldwide smash Independence Day at the time, underperformed creatively and commercially so it was unclear if there was enough consumer demand for another try with this character, which is obviously tailor-made for a big-screen effects-driven adaptation. Reviews were generally good and a strong marketing campaign intrigued audiences. Positioned as a disaster movie with an ensemble cast, Breaking Bad‘s Bryan Cranston was marketed heavily to give this Godzilla credibility.Friday kicked off the weekend with an incredible $38.5M including $9.3M from Thursday night pre-shows starting at 7:00pm. Fanboys rushed out on the first day and Saturday fell 17% to $32.2M. The studio projected a Sunday decline of 30% to $22.5M. Thursday night pre-shows accounted for 10% of the overall opening weekend which was the exact same ratio as last summer’s Japanese-influenced monster movie Pacific Rim.The B+ CinemaScore indicates that fans were mainly satisfied with what they got, but word-of-mouth is not strong enough to prevent the usual declines that these type of front-loaded action tentpoles see. Next weekend will have the help from the Memorial Day holiday, but will also see direct competition from the super hero event film X-Men: Days of Future Past. Still, Godzilla should be on track to surpass $200M during its domestic run, even if it falls hard next weekend. The budget was about $160M with Legendary covering 75% of it. Unlike the version from 16 years ago, this Godzilla should spawn sequels.The weekend performance was truly phenomenal. Among movies that are not direct sequels, the new Godzilla‘s opening ranks as the seventh biggest of all-time ranking right behind the first Iron Man. Studio research showed that the crowd was 58% male and 60% over 25. It also smashed this year’s previous record for best IMAX opening weekend, held by Winter Soldier, by more than 50%.Godzilla’s roar was easily heard around the world as Warner Bros. consolidated most of the international roll-out onto the same weekend with a sensational $103M grossed from 64 markets resulting in an eye-popping $196.2M worldwide launch. IMAX accounted for a scorching $22M globally. Like in North America, the overseas 3D share was 51%. Leading markets were the U.K. with $10.4M, Russia with $9.1M, and Mexico with $8.9M. China is allowing Godzilla to release on June 13 just as the World Cup starts and in Japan, rights holder Toho will open on July 25 after the tournament finishes.The raunchy comedy Neighbors fell from first place but landed in second with a solid amount of sales grossing an estimated $26M in its sophomore frame. That would be a strong performance for an R-rated laugher in its opening weekend. Universal witnessed a moderate 47% decline and has amassed a stellar $91.5M to date. A final gross in the $150M range seems likely making it the comedy to beat this year.The Amazing Spider-Man 2 followed with an estimated $16.8M falling 53%. That was slightly higher than third-weekend declines for other Marvel sequels that launched on the first weekend of May. Iron Man 3 was down 51% last year, Iron Man 2 was off 49% in 2010, and Spider-Man 3 fell 50% in 2007. None of those faced a monster debut like Godzilla‘s, though. Fading at roughly the same levels, the new Amazing looks to end its domestic run with around $205M which would be by far the worst ever for the Spider-Man franchise.But overseas markets continue to make up for shortfalls in the U.S. The studio enjoyed an estimated $31.5M this weekend boosting the international total to $461M (including $78.5M from China) and the global gross to $633.2M. With all major markets open, the Electro flick should finish in the $730-750M range ending up very close to the $754M of the 2012 reboot.The baseball drama Million Dollar Arm debuted in fourth place with a soft bow grossing an estimated $10.5M from 3,019 locations for a mild $3,482 average. The PG-rated picture telling the true story of a sports agent (Mad Men‘s Jon Hamm) who holds a contest in India to bring top athletes to America for a shot at a Major League contract skewed to an audience of older men. Studio research showed that 54% of the audience was male and 52% was over 35.Historically, baseball movies do not open all that well. Million earned mixed reviews from critics, but paying moviegoers were mostly satisfied as the CinemaScore was an encouraging A-. The debut was about a third of what last year’s baseball drama 42 opened with when it bowed to $27.5M. Disney hopes that the older audience will find the film in the weeks ahead and that solid buzz will spread and reach more customers next weekend over the long Memorial Day holiday frame.The female-skewing comedy hit The Other Woman continued to play as successful counter-programming to May’s action tentpoles with an estimated $6.3M in its fourth weekend. Down only 34%, the Fox release has grabbed an impressive $71.7M to date. Faith-based winner Heaven Is For Real grossed an estimated $4.4M, off 41%, for a $82.2M total for Sony.The animated sequel Rio 2 followed by dipping only 24% to an estimated $3.8M in its sixth round. Fox has banked $118.1M so far making it the second highest-grossing toon of the year behind The LEGO Movie which still stands at number one among all films in 2014.Also holding up well despite the arrival of another action tentpole this weekend was Captain America: The Winter Soldier which dropped 35% to an estimated $3.8M pushing the cume past the quarter-billion mark to $250.6M. The worldwide tally broke the $700M barrier with $452.8M from international markets (led by China’s giant $116.3M) for a new worldwide tally of $703.4M. That makes it the seventh biggest Marvel movie ever, trailing The Avengers, Iron Man 3, and the first four Spider-Man movies. With all markets open, a final haul of around $720M seems likely with the popular character returning next year in the Avengers sequel and then again in 2016 for the third installment of its own stand-alone franchise.Underperforming animated film Legends of Oz dropped 48% in its second weekend of play to an estimated $2M. With just $6.6M in ten days, the Clarius release looks headed for around $11M. The comedy Moms’ Night Out tumbled 56% in its sophomore round to an estimated $1.9M for a weak $7.3M thus far. Sony should end up with a disappointing $11M as well.The top ten films grossed an estimated $168.6M which was up 15% from last year when Star Trek Into Darkness opened at number one with $70.2M; and up 26% from 2012 when The Avengers remained on top for a third time with $55.6M.","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"GIFs, in, Signature, live, CW, Awards, Arrowverse, halloween","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-Godzilla-Stomps-the-Competition-in-Debut"},{"id":"47509109403307","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: American Sniper Stays Strong At Number One","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: American Sniper Stays Strong At Number OneThe Boy Next Door and Paddington round out the top three.by Gitesh Pandya | January 25, 2015 |  CommentsMoviegoers continued to flock to the multiplexes in record numbers to see the runaway smash American Sniper which once again led the box office by a mile and quickly became the highest-grossing film of Clint Eastwood’s 60-year career. The Warner Bros. blockbuster grossed an estimated $64.4M in its second weekend of nationwide play, slipping only 28% in the process, and making as much as the next seven films combined. Fueled by six Academy Award nominations, patriotism, great marketing, and starpower, the R-rated soldier story posted the fourth biggest second weekend gross in box office history for a non-sequel. The only bigger ones in their sophomore frames were The Avengers, Avatar, and Spider-Man which were all mega-budgeted epics. For Sniper to join this type of company is phenomenal.The Chris Kyle saga has now grossed a total of $200.1M domestically which already beats the $148.1M of Eastwood’s top grossing film ever, Gran Torino which he directed and starred in. Playing in 3,705 locations including 333 with IMAX screens, the controversial hit averaged a spectacular $17,372 this weekend. With such a low decline plus continued heat from Oscar buzz and word-of-mouth, American Sniper should be able to soar past $350M and may even challenge the record for the top grossing R-rated film of all-time. That mark is still held by 2004’s The Passion of the Christ at $370.3M.Sniper has sparked much talk in many circles and has its fans and detractors. This type of debate is so lucrative and attracts ticket buyers across several groups, helping grosses swell. Though it is not among the favorites to actually win the Best Picture Oscar, Sniper will continue to enjoy many weeks of being a contender which is good enough to keep smashing box office records and help theaters sell more popcorn. Only two times has any film ever grossed more on a January weekend – Sniper last weekend, and Avatar‘s $68.5M over the New Year’s holiday weekend in 2010 when it was in its third session. Movies just don’t draw in this large of a crowd at this time of year.American Sniper also continued its international roll-out where patriotism is not as big of a factor in pulling in cash. Still it is posting new career highs for Eastwood. This weekend saw openings in 17 new territories including Australia, Hong Kong, and Scandanavia for a $17.6M frame raising the offshore total to $47.5M and the global gross to $247.6M. Five of the world’s top ten overseas markets are still to open between now and Oscar night.Jennifer Lopez anchored her first hit movie in nearly a decade with the thriller The Boy Next Door which took second place with an estimated $15M. Averaging a solid $5,765 from 2,602 locations, the low-budget $4M production earned an opening weekend gross that was nearly four times its production cost. Despite bad reviews, audiences came out for the starpower as well as the effective trailers and TV spots. The R-rated pic took advantage of Lopez’s appeal as studio research showed that the audience was 71% female, 51% over 30, and 45% Latino. Moviegoers were not too thrilled with the product and its lackluster B- CinemaScore grade indicates a fast fade ahead for Universal.Well-reviewed kidpic Paddington fared nicely in its second weekend grossing an estimated $12.4M, off 35%. The Weinstein Co. title has banked an impressive $40.1M to date heading to the $75M neighborhood. Kevin Hart’s comedy The Wedding Ringer dropped a reasonable 44% to an estimated $11.6M, also in its sophomore session. Sony has collected $39.7M and should find its way to around $65M.Liam Neeson’s franchise hit Taken 3 dropped 48% to an estimated $7.6M for fifth place and raised its cume to $76.1M for Fox. Breaking $100M domestic seems unlikely for the third and final chapter. Oscar contender The Imitation Game expanded again and saw its weekend take rise 5% to an estimated $7.1M. The Weinstein Co. release has taken in $60.6M surpassing rival The Grand Budapest Hotel to become the second highest-grossing Best Picture nominee after Sniper. Reaching $90M is possible.The animated film Strange Magic bombed in seventh with an estimated $5.5M from 3,020 sites for a wimpy $1,832 average. Produced and conceptualized by George Lucas, the PG-rated fairy flick earned poor reviews and failed to generate any kind of excitement with families. Plus competition from the well-liked Paddington which was only in its second week was a big factor.Best Picture contender Selma followed with an estimated $5.5M, down 37%, for a new cume of $39.2M for Paramount which is still an underwhelming figure for an Oscar contender with so much love from both critics and audiences. Over 300,000 tickets have been given away to students for free, paid for by local business leaders, contributing about $2-3M of the gross. Even with many getting to see the acclaimed MLK movie at no cost, Selma looks on track to end its run below such real-life dramas as Ray, Coach Carter, 42, and The Butler. Three weeks into its wide release and its total is still below the $48.2M final of Malcolm X from 22 years ago when ticket prices were half as much.More bad news for Johnny Depp who has seen his star wattage fade consistently over the past few years. His umpteenth kooky role in Mortdecai drew yawns with a dismal opening of an estimated $4.1M. Averaging an awful 1,558 from 2,648 theaters, the R-rated pricey $60M comedy never excited audiences and attracted bad reviews across the board. Competition for adults was fierce with mainstream films plus Oscar contenders hogging up the spotlight. There was just no reason for interested ticket buyers to choose this option. This follows terrible results for last April’s sci-fi flop Transcendence, 2013’s big budget disaster Lone Ranger, and 2012’s Dark Shadows which also did not impress. Picking better projects will help the star.Rounding out the top ten was Depp again with his tiny role in Into The Woods which fell 43% to an estimated $3.9M bumping the domestic total to a nice $121.5M.Below the top ten, Jennifer Aniston’s Cake failed to make much of a dent in its debut opening to an estimated $1M from 482 locations for a weak $2,075 average. Generating plenty of attention from Aniston’s many talk show appearances as well as her acclaimed performance being snubbed by the Oscars, the R-rated drama could not compete in a marketplace where adults had so many interesting Academy Award-endorsed options to choose from. Plus reviews were not encouraging.The top ten films grossed an estimated $137.1M which was up 47% from last year when Ride Along stayed at number one with $21.3M; and up 69% from 2013 when Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters debuted on top with $19.7M.Follow Gitesh on Twitter!","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"Tour, Academy, Golden, Returns, news, saw, Best, godzilla, Reality, Elton, ABC, Tomatazos, 2020","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-American-Sniper-Stays-Strong-At-Number-One"},{"id":"47509112745663","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: Galaxy Leads Worst Weekend in 13 Years","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: Galaxy Leads Worst Weekend in 13 Yearsby Gitesh Pandya | September 7, 2014 |  CommentsWith kids back in school, football returning, and studios opting not to open any major films, the North American box office slumped to its worst performance in 13 years. The Top 20 struggled to reach a miserable $58.8M – the lowest point the film industry has seen since the weeks just after the 9/11 tragedy in 2001.Once again it was the super hero smash Guardians of the Galaxy which led the way grossing an estimated $10.2M in its sixth weekend. Off a reasonable 41%, the Marvel juggernaut has now spent four of its six weekends in the top spot and has raised its domestic total to an incredible $294.6M. Guardians has now become the highest-grossing film to ever come out of August surpassing the $293.5M of 1999’s The Sixth Sense. That ghost story sold significantly more tickets, however. Galaxy also inched ahead of Sense on the list of all-time domestic blockbusters to take the number 50 spot. It is the first movie all year to reach the all-time Top 50 showing how devoid this year has been so far of mega-hits.Star Lord and his misfit pals continue to win over new fans. The film is running 2% ahead of the first Iron Man which had grossed $288.8M at the same point in its release, though it had a weaker sixth weekend gross of $7.5M. In fact, among sixth weekend grosses for all super hero films ever, Guardians trails only The Avengers ($11.2M), The Dark Knight ($10.5M) and 2002’s Spider-Man ($10.3M). A North American final of about $320M seems likely for Guardians of the Galaxy which has spent more weekends at number one than any past Marvel film. Weak competition in the dog days of summer contributed to that record.Overseas, Groot and company are still raking it in. The international cume rose to $291.6M keeping in close proximity to the domestic tally. Worldwide stands at $586.2M and will smash the $600M mark next weekend when the film opens in Japan. China has been given a release date of October 10 and Marvel films have an outstanding track record there. Reaching $800M is possible.Posting the lowest gross all year for a film in second place, Paramount’s hit adventure Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles took in an estimated $6.5M for a 46% decline. The successful action entry has now banked $174.6M and seems headed for a domestic finish of around $190M. That’s incredibly high for a film coming out of August – and competing head to head with a monster action smash like Guardians. Turtles upped its international tally to $125.6M for a new global haul of $300.2M with most top ten international markets not even open yet.Down 38% in its third weekend was the teen romance If I Stay with an estimated $5.8M lifting the Warner Bros. cume to $39.7M. Fox followed with an estimated $5.4M for its raunchy comedy Let’s Be Cops in its fourth lap. The R-rated pic has now banked a sturdy $66.6M.Pierce Brosnan’s spy thriller The November Man fell 47% in its second weekend to an estimated $4.2M. With only $17.9M to date, the Relativity title looks to end with just under $30M. The Universal horror pic As Above/So Below followed with an estimated $3.7M, off a sharp 57% in its sophomore frame, for a cume of $15.6M. A $22M final seems likely.The inspirational football flick When the Game Stands Tall dropped 39% to an estimated $3.7M while the sci-fi pic The Giver dipped by 35% to an estimated $3.6M. Totals are now $23.5M for Sony and $37.8M for The Weinstein Co.A pair of summer winners led by women rounded out the top ten. Helen Mirren’s The Hundred-Foot Journey slipped 33% to an estimated $3.2M and has banked $45.7M so far for Disney and DreamWorks. Lucy, headlined by Scarlett Johansson, suffered only a 31% slide to an estimated $1.9M. Universal’s domestic haul is $121.2M passing the $118.3M of Angelina Jolie’s own one-woman summer action hit Salt from 2010.The dismal weekend’s only new wide release The Identical stumbled to a dismal debut. Released by Freestyle, the PG-rated music drama opened to an estimated $1.9M from 1,956 theaters for an embarrassing $971 average. Among new films launching in over 1,000 theaters, it was the worst opening weekend of 2014. Reviews were horrendous, starpower was low, and targeted outreach to the faith-based audience did not result in any turnout.Paramount released an IMAX version of Forrest Gump which is celebrating its 20th anniversary this year. But the result was weak as the film grossed an estimated $405,000 from 337 premium screens for a poor $1,202 average. The Oscar winner’s lifetime gross inched up to $330.1M.The top ten films grossed an estimated $48.1M which was down 22% from last year when Riddick debuted at number one with $19M; but up 3% from 2012 when The Possession opened on top with $9.3M.","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"talk, Avengers, See, york","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-Galaxy-Leads-Worst-Weekend-in-13-Years"},{"id":"47509112757957","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: Lucy‘s Brains Beat Hercules‘ Brawn","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: Lucy's Brains Beat Hercules' BrawnDawn of the Planet of the Apes rounds out the top three.by Gitesh Pandya | July 27, 2014 |  CommentsScarlett Johansson’s brains beat Dwayne Johnson’s brawn in a head-to-head showdown between star-driven summer action films. The sci-fi thriller Lucy attracted a larger crowd and captured the number one spot while the epic adventure Hercules enjoyed a fine debut in the runner-up spot connecting with its own fan base. Overall ticket sales were about even with last week, but fell below last year’s levels for the seventh consecutive weekend.Universal scored a number one debut with Lucy which opened ahead of expectations to an estimated $44M from 3,173 theaters for a potent $13,875 average. It was especially impressive given that there was no 3D to boost grosses, no brand with a built-in audience to tap into, and no track record of Johansson ever anchoring an action movie on her own before. Plus reviews were not that strong either for the R-rated pic.The actress has built herself up as an action hero over the years playing Black Widow in a handful of Marvel films in a supporting role. Last April’s Captain America: The Winter Soldier featured her prominently in the film – and marketing – making moviegoers ready to see her headline her own action vehicle. Johansson’s appeal is broad and the film’s concept was sold effectively in slick trailers and TV spots which engaged audiences.Lucy‘s broad appeal was evident in the demographic breakdown. Studio research showed that males and females were evenly split 50/50 (that’s a big female share for the action genre) and turnout across all races was strong. 65% was non-white. Age-wise it skewed older with a very high 65% being over 25. Angelina Jolie has been the only woman in Hollywood who consistently was bankable as an action lead in all projects. ScarJo sells and is now ready to take the baton.As strong as the opening weekend was, Lucy should have a troubling road ahead. Paying audiences were not entirely satisfied as the CinemaScore grade was a discouraging C+. And Marvel, the very company that made her an action star, will attack the box office this Thursday night with guns blazing as it unleashes its next comic property Guardians of the Galaxy which it is investing heavily into as the company prepares to launch what it hopes will be a lucrative new franchise. Guardians reviews are sensational so far.Still, budgeted at only $40M, Lucy has a good chance of breaking $100M in domestic sales. Set in many cities across the globe including Taipei and Paris, the Luc Besson-directed hit should enjoy a healthy international run as well. No release date has been secured for China yet and with the country’s quota system for imported movies, and the film’s prominent setting in Taiwan, it is not guaranteed to be allowed into the mainland.Opening in second place with respectable results was the historical epic Hercules starring Dwayne Johnson with an estimated $29M. The PG-13 pic averaged a good $8,067 from 3,595 locations and was helped by 3D and IMAX ticket prices. Not surprisingly, adult men made up the bulk of the crowd as studio data showed that the audience was 58% male and 64% over 25. The CinemaScore grade was a decent B+ and $4M of the take came from IMAX screens.It was more than triple the size of the other film this year about this muscle man. January’s The Legend of Hercules starring Kellan Lutz bowed to a weak $8.9M on its way to a puny $18.8M final. The Rock’s new movie made more than that in its first two days alone. Among films the wrestler-actor has anchored solo, Hercules scored his second best opening ever after the $36.1M of 2002’s The Scorpion King which was his first starring vehicle.Hercules launched in 25 markets overseas this weekend and captured an estimated $28.7M with Russia’s huge $12M debut accounting for a massive share of the gross. Budgeted at about $100M, the Brett Ratner-directed adventure film earned mixed reviews.With two new action vehicles entering the marketplace, two-time champ Dawn of the Planet of the Apes took a tumble and fell 55% to an estimated $16.4M pushing the new cume up to a solid $172.1M – just $4.7M shy of its predecessor’s domestic final. 2011’s Rise of the Planet of the Apes had little competition in its third lap that summer following two weeks at number one and slipped only 42% in the third frame. Dawn still seems on track for a final North American take of around $215M.When is a 67% plunge good news? When you are the horror sequel The Purge: Anarchy and your predecessor fell 76% in its sophomore session. The Universal title held up better thanks in part to weaker competition – last year’s Purge faced in its second weekend the monster $116.6M opening of Man of Steel. With an estimated $9.9M weekend and $51.3M total to date, Anarchy looks likely to finish with around $65-70M which is a great take for a $9M-budgeted sequel with a marketing tab that was not outrageous. Plus it will be slightly better than the $64.5M final of last year’s installment.Disney’s animated sequel Planes: Fire and Rescue declined by 47% to an estimated $9.3M in its second flight and lifted its sum to $35.1M. Look for a $55-60M final. Animation has been the weakest sector at this summer’s box office as the season’s toons to date have grossed only $201M which is down an alarming 72% from the $725M at this same point last summer. That’s a whopping $524M of less spending on toons this summer. With Pixar sitting it out for the first time in nine summers, and nobody really filling that void, this genre has been a main factor in this summer’s alarming deficit from last year with total box office down about 20%.The Cameron Diaz film Sex Tape dropped by a hefty 59% after a weak debut with only $6M this weekend, according to estimates. With a lackluster $26.9M so far, the Sony title should end its run with a lackluster $40M or so.Plunging 53%, Transformers: Age of Extinction nabbed an estimated $4.6M giving Paramount $236.4M to date from the franchise’s increasingly less important market of North America. Overseas, the China total broke the $300M barrier, the first film to ever do that – Chinese or American. The international cume rose to a staggering $730M pushing the worldwide haul up to $966.4M with the billion dollar mark ready to be smashed in the coming days. With Japan and Spain still to open, Extinction’s overseas gross is still on track to end up in the same neighborhood as the $895M of The Avengers.The Michael Douglas-Diane Keaton comedy And So It Goes was the latest clunker for director Rob Reiner opening in eighth place with a lousy $4.6M, according to estimates. The Clarius release averaged a wimpy $2,583 from 1,762 locations and never generated much interest – or awareness – in the marketplace. Reviews were dreadful, though the CinemaScore was a decent B+.Warner Bros. collected an estimated $3.4M for Tammy, off 54%, for a new cume of $78.1M. Opening well in tenth place was the new spy thriller A Most Wanted Man starring the late Philip Seymour Hoffman with an estimated $2.7M from only 361 locations for a solid $7,526 average. The German-set suspense film earned stellar reviews for Roadside Attractions and played to an upscale audience of older adults. It was the type of film Focus often released in late August targeting the same crowd.The most-talked-about film in the indie world, Richard Linklater’s critical darling Boyhood, expanded again in its third weekend going from 34 to 107 locations grossing an estimated $1.7M, up 47% from last weekend. The average for the IFC Films release was a solid $16,121 and more cities will open next weekend. Cume is $4.1M.New domestic totals for summer’s recent blockbusters dropping out of the top ten include $232.1M for Maleficent, $231.3M for X-Men: Days of Future Past, $185.7M for 22 Jump Street, $165.6M for How to Train Your Dragon 2, and $122.7M for The Fault In Our Stars.The top ten films grossed an estimated $129.9M which was down 14% from last year when The Wolverine opened at number one with $53.1M; but up 5% from 2012 when The Dark Knight Rises stayed on top with $62.1M.Follow Gitesh on Twitter!","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"CNN, Christmas, Chilling, Walt, Sundance, natural, impossible, Thanksgiving, 2016, FX, renewed, docuseries, First","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-Lucys-Brains-Beat-Hercules-Brawn"},{"id":"47508629415237","title":"24 Best Movie Families","content":"24 Framesgoogletag.cmd.push(function(){googletag.unitIds.push(\"article_sponsorship_ad\"),googletag.defineSlot(\"/55153744/rottentomatoes/article/sponsorship\",[[150,80]],\"article_sponsorship_ad\").addService(googletag.pubads())})24 Best Movie Familiesby RT Staff | June 12, 2018 |  CommentsWith the Parrs reuniting for Incredibles 2, we’re looking at 24 more great families from movie history!The Royal Tenenbaums (2001, 80%)Just goes to show the only thing you need to mend family troubles is a little love, a lot of patience, and a few well-placed Nico songs.Mrs. Doubtfire (1993, 71%)The dad learns to back off, and the stepdad-to-be is actually a really nice guy.

Three other films that debuted in limited release in December tried their luck with mainstream audiences as well by expanding into wide play, but they were met with varying results with more offbeat pictures delivering dull results. The frame’s only brand new wide release, the adventure epic The Legend of Hercules, opened in fifth place with lackluster results.Doubling expectations, Lone Survivor seized the top spot with an estimated $38.5M giving the Universal release the second biggest January opening weekend of all-time. Movies rarely debut to more than $30M in the first month of the year with 2008’s Cloverfield being the best ever with $40.1M. Playing in 2,875 theaters, the R-rated hit averaged a sizzling $13,395 per site. Cume including two weeks of play at solo runs in New York and Los Angeles is $38.9M.What was surprising was not that it took the number one slot; it was widely expected to do that. It was the amazing amount of ticket sales that really blew the industry away. A debut in the high teen millions was expected, which itself would have been solid and enough to take the top spot. But audiences responded favorably to the patriotic themes of this story of American soldiers in peril and to the strong reviews. Survivor follows in the footsteps of other military movies with good reviews that platformed in December and then waited for mid-January to attack nationwide. Last year, Zero Dark Thirty did the same thing this very weekend, while in 2002, Black Hawk Down used that strategy to great success. All opened wide at number one with well over $20M each.Dropping to the bridesmaid position, but still holding up exceptionally well, was Disney’s mammoth blockbuster Frozen which dipped only 23% in its seventh wide weekend to an estimated $15.1M. The animated smash has hauled in a stellar $317.7M setting a new record for the studio as the highest gross ever for a toon in its initial release. The old record has been held for nearly 20 years by The Lion King which grossed a staggering $312.8M from the summer of 1994 through early 1995 during its first run in theaters. Of course, Frozen benefits from higher ticket prices and 3D surcharges. With subsequent IMAX and 3D releases, King still is the studio’s top toon with a lifetime gross of $422.8M. Anna and Elsa have now climbed up to number 34 on the list of all-time domestic blockbusters.With great audience buzz and no competition for kids, Frozen has been raking in the dough from Thanksgiving through Christmas and beyond. The international run has been equally impressive with the snow sisters breaking the $700M global mark this weekend with much more still to come. Overseas, the cume has risen to $394.6M putting the worldwide tally at $712.3M with big runs still to come from top-tier markets where Disney animation really sells. On February 5, China will gets its launch while Japan closes out the international run when it opens on March 15. Disney/Pixar’s Monsters University grossed over $90M in Japan last year.The Wolf of Wall Street scored another good round of sales with an estimated $9M in its third weekend. Down 32%, the Paramount release has banked $78.6M to date and is headed past the $100M mark — the third straight Martin-Scorsese-Leonardo DiCaprio film to that. Also holding up well and playing to much of the same audience was American Hustle with an estimated $8.6M, down 31%, for a $101.6M total as the Sony release crossed the century mark over the weekend. Both films could earn Academy Award nominations for Best Picture this Thursday and will have plenty of weeks of awards season still ahead to turn those nods into extra box office.Opening in fifth place was the frame’s only brand new wide release, The Legend of Hercules. The epic PG-13 adventure did not make much of a dent at multiplexes as it bowed to an estimated $8.6M from 2,104 theaters for a mediocre $4,087 average. 49% of the business came from 3D screens and the audience was predictably more male. Studio research showed that the Lionsgate release played 57% male and 55% 25 and older. The CinemaScore grade was a dull B-. Another Hercules movie is on tap for this summer with Dwayne Johnson headlining a bigger project set for July 25 from director Brett Ratner.Dropping 49% in its fifth weekend was The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug with an estimated $8M for a new domestic cume of $242.2M. The Middle Earth tentpole is running 13% behind its predecessor. Overseas, Smaug pushed its international tally to $566M as the global gross surged past the $800M mark to $808.2M with China and Japan still to open on February 21 and 28, respectively.Oscar winners Meryl Streep and Julia Roberts saw their collaboration August: Osage County enjoy a good national expansion this weekend with an estimated $7.3M from 905 locations for a $8,083 average. Cume for the The Weinstein Co. including the platform release since late December is $7.9M. Reviews have been good but not exceptional.Disney’s Saving Mr. Banks followed with an estimated $6.6M, off only 24%, for a $68.9M cume. A Best Picture nod from the Academy could give Tom Hanks yet another $100M+ hit. Paramount rounded out the top ten with a pair of franchise flicks. Horror pic Paranormal Activity: The Marked Ones fell an understandably steep 66% in its second weekend to an estimated $6.3M while Will Ferrell’s Anchorman 2 dropped 43% to an estimated $6.1M. Totals are $28.5M and $118.5M, respectively.The acclaimed Spike Jonze film Her fared poorly in its nationwide expansion grossing an estimated $5.4M from 1,729 locations for a weak $3,129 average. Failing to crack the top ten, the R-rated film starring Joaquin Phoenix and the voice of Scarlett Johansson did not connect with mainstream audiences due to low starpower (on-screen) and an offbeat concept. Reviews have been sensational and Her has also picked up many awards and nominations during awards season, but multiplex crowds did not pay to try it out. The CinemaScore grade was a disappointing B-. But if the Warner Bros. release were to land a Best Picture Oscar nomination this week, its commercial fortunes could change somewhat.The Coen brothers did not fare well in national release either with their critics darling Inside Llewyn Davis which expanded from 156 to 729 locations grossing an estimated $1.9M for a weak $2,573 average. The CBS Films release has banked $9.3M to date. Davis and Her were both wildly loved by film critics, but their arthouse casts and offbeat stories limited their appeal to paying mainstream moviegoers. Extended releases like these are risky given how many weeks of national TV ads must be purchased to support them.Faring well outside the top ten was the juggernaut The Hunger Games: Catching Fire which last week surpassed Iron Man 3 to become the highest grossing film released in 2013. This weekend added another $4.6M, according to estimates, pushing the cume up to $414M putting it at number 13 on the all-time domestic list. A final of about $425M seems likely with another installment being prepped for release this November.The top ten films grossed an estimated $114.1M which was up 2% from last year when Zero Dark Thirty opened wide at number one with $24.4M; and up 8% from 2012 when Contraband debuted in the top spot with $24.3M.Follow Gitesh on Twitter!","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"71st, WGN, Spring, Cinematographers, anime, YouTube, PaleyFest, Action","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-Lone-Survivor-Scores-a-Surprisingly-Impressive-Debut"},{"id":"47509116197604","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: Hobbit Tops Anchorman in Sequel Showdown","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: Hobbit Tops Anchorman in Sequel Showdownby Gitesh Pandya | December 22, 2013 |  CommentsPlenty of new faces popped up in the North American top ten but the Middle Earth tentpole The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug remained at number one with an estimated $31.5M falling a reasonable 57% in its second round. After ten-plus days, the Warner Bros. release has amassed $127.5M which is off 15% from the $150.1M that last year’s An Unexpected Journey grossed over the exact same period. That film dropped by a similar 56% in its second weekend. Hobbit collected a massive $96M overseas this weekend pushing the international haul to $276.3M and the global gross to a potent $403.8M with much more to come over the holiday weeks ahead.Opening in second place was the comedy sequel Anchorman 2 with an estimated $26.8M weekend and $40M since its debut on Tuesday night. The Paramount release averaged $7,635 from 3,507 locations and had a Friday-to-Sunday take that was just below the $28.4M of its 2004 predecessor. The midweek launch diluted down the weekend numbers, however ticket prices were much lower nine years ago.With only a $50M budget, the new installment of the Will Ferrell franchise should have no problem turning a profit from its worldwide run. The audience this weekend was much more male (62%) and 56% over 25. Reviews were generally good (considering it is a comedy sequel) but the B CinemaScore grade indicates that paying fans were only moderately satisfied. Oscar hopeful American Hustle may have put a little dent into sales with its expansion as it also played to adults looking for a laugh, and had more cross-gender appeal too. But with the holidays coming up soon when everyday from Christmas to New Years behaves like a Saturday at the turnstiles, Anchorman still has plenty of potential ahead.Disney’s animated blockbuster Frozen slipped only 15% in its fourth weekend of wide release to an estimated $19.2M bumping the cume up to a stellar $191.6M. Elsa and Anna may crack $200M on Christmas Day. The global gross has climbed up to $344.2M thanks to more overseas traction led by Europe.The all-star package American Hustle followed its sizzling platform debut with a solid nationwide expansion coming in an inch behind at number four with an estimated $19.1M from 2,507 theaters. The Sony awards player starring Christian Bale, Amy Adams, Bradley Cooper, Jennifer Lawrence, and Jeremy Renner averaged a commendable $7,619 per site. Reviews from critics have been sensational, but paying audiences were a little less impressed giving it a B+ grade from CinemaScore. Adult moviegoers are expected to keep coming out over the holidays for Hustle which has earned seven Golden Globe nominations. Total with the limited run is $20.2M.Disney’s own awards hopeful Saving Mr. Banks went national after a week in limited play and saw results that were respectable but not amazing. The Tom Hanks-Emma Thompson pic grossed an estimated $9.3M from 2,110 sites for a mediocre $4,418 average. It is not the most urgently awaited film so the PG-13 pic will attempt to draw its audience over time over the holidays banking on word-of-mouth to make the buzz spread. Cume is $9.9M and the A CinemaScore bodes well for its future. Skewing much older, 61% of the crowd was 35 or older while 57% was female.Off 36% was The Hunger Games: Catching Fire with an estimated $8.8M raising the total to $371.7M. Fellow Lionsgate title A Madea Christmas dropped 47% in its sophomore frame to an estimated $8.5M for $28.3M to date.The animated film Walking with Dinosaurs got off to a soft start debuting to an estimated $7.3M from 3,231 theaters for a weak $2,259 average. The PG-rated adventure faced stiff competition from the still-strong Frozen but will aim to reach its target audience of families slowly over the next two weeks when children will be out of school most of the time.Generating the biggest opening weekend ever for a Bollywood film in North America, the action sequel Dhoom 3 took ninth place with an estimated $3.3M from 236 locations for a $14,004 average for Yash Raj Films. Rounding out the top ten was Thor: The Dark World with an estimated $1.3M, down 53%, for a $200.8M cume thus far. Worldwide tally is now $627.1M for Disney and its Marvel unit.The top ten films grossed an estimated $135M which was up 39% from last year when The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey stayed at number one with $36.9M; and up 12% from 2011 when Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol debuted wide in the top spot with $29.6M.Follow Gitesh on Twitter!","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"2015, Pet, Kids, Moore, spain, Chilling, Anna, movies","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-Hobbit-Tops-Anchorman-in-Sequel-Showdown"},{"id":"47509117924078","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: Gravity Holds Strong at Top Spot","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: Gravity Holds Strong at Top SpotAlso, Captain Phillips performs well, but Machete Kills doesn't.by Sujit Chawla | October 13, 2013 |  CommentsThis weekend, Alfonso Cuaron’s space thriller Gravity easily held on to the box office crown, Tom Hanks had his biggest opening in nearly five years, only one family film is playing in over 500 theaters, and those were the only films to make more than $4M this weekend.Dropping a slim 21% from its record opening weekend, Warner Brothers Oscar shoo-in Gravity took in an estimated $44.3M this weekend bringing its total to a stunning $123M in 10 days. Buoyed by some of the best reviews of any film this year, the Sandra Bullock/George Clooner-starrer has become the must-see film of the season. And talks of the demise of 3D have been put on hold as 85% of all moviegoers have been willing to pay extra for the visual spectacle. Gravity‘s second weekend gross is the 3rd highest of the year, behind only Iron Man 3 and Monsters University, both of which were released during the lucrative summer season. Look for Gravity to end its run with at least $225M and possibly more as the awards start to roll in. Universal executives must be kicking themselves for selling the rights to Warner.Tom Hanks had his biggest live-action opening since the summer of 2009 (Angels &amp; Demons/$46.2M) with Captain Phillips which opened to $26M, according to estimates, for a per screen average of $8,609. The PG-13 drama was directed by Paul Greengrass and is based on the true story of Somali pirates that hijacked an American container ship. Last year’s eventual Best Picture winner Argo, another critical favorite based on a true story that involved Americans in peril internationally, opened this same weekend in second place to $19.5M and an average of $6,020. Could a similar run be in place for the Sony picture, which sees Hanks return to the critical and commercial success that audiences are used to seeing him in, after a series of misfires over the last few years?Third place belonged to the sole family film in the top 10, Sony’s animated sequel Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2 which took in another $14.2M, according to estimates, bringing its cume to $78M. After 17 days, Cloudy 2 is running about 4% behind the original, which ended its run with $124.8M in 2009. With no family fare on the menu until November 1st (Free Birds), Cloudy 2 is still in position to match the final gross of the first film.No other film managed to gross even $4M so the top 10 was very closely bunched together and final rankings could easily change when the final numbers come out on Monday. Currently in fourth place with a hugely disappointing $3.8M, according to estimates, is Robert Rodriguez’s violent revenge thriller Machete Kills, which collected a poor per screen average of $1,496. Even with three years of a cult following, tons of extra star power and higher ticket prices, the Open Road pic could barely muster one-third of the opening weekend of Machete, which opened to $11.4M in September of 2010. Rodriguez is great at making films on the cheap so the final chapter in the trilogy is still a possibility but this has to be a kick in the ego for the director as Machete Kills becomes his lowest grossing opening weekend ever for a film in wide release.Dropping 51% from its tame opening was the Justin Timberlake/Ben Affleck gambling drama Runner Runner which took in an estimated $3.7M this weekend bringing its total to just $14M. Look for a final cume in the $20M range which is likely less than what Affleck will be making for playing Batman in the Superman vs. Batman flick due out in 2015. I don’t image he’s crying too much right now.Warner Brothers’ other star-laden fall drama Prisoners fell 36% this weekend to sixth place with an estimated $3.6M, bringing its total to $53.6M. Horror breakout Insidious Chapter 2 continued its strong run falling 32% to $2.6M, according to estimates, bringing its total to $78M. Universal’s former Oscar hopeful Rush continued its disappointing run falling 47% to an estimated $2.4M bringing its cume to only $22M.A couple of different romantic comedies rounded out the top 10. Ninth place belonged to triple threat Joseph Gordon-Levitt’s directorial debut Don Jon which brought in an additional $2.3M, according to estimates, bringing its total to $20M. And Fox Searchlight’s Baggage Claim followed close behind with an estimated $2.1M bringing its cume to $18.2M.The top ten films grossed $106.7M which was down 9% from last year when Taken 2 remained at number one in its second weekend with $21.8M; but up 47% from 2011 when Real Steel also remained in the top spot in its second weekend with $16.3M.Folow Gitesh on the Twitter will ya!","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"Purge, Trek","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-Gravity-Holds-Strong-at-Top-Spot"},{"id":"47509114379985","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: The Amazing Spider-Man 2 Swings to Number One","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: The Amazing Spider-Man 2 Swings to Number OneThe Other Woman and Heaven Is For Real round out the top three.by Gitesh Pandya | May 4, 2014 |  CommentsWhile not breaking any major records, the super hero sequel The Amazing Spider-Man 2 did kick off the summer movie season with a strong debut delivering the second best opening weekend of 2014. However, it did not drive the overall marketplace the way studio tentpoles usually do on this particular frame as the Top 20 slumped to the worst showing in eight years for the first weekend of May which since 1999 has marked the start of the summer blockbuster season.Sony’s fifth webslinger movie, and second of the current incarnation, opened to an estimated $92M from 4,324 locations for a $21,277 average. Comparisons to the last Amazing Spider-Man‘s opening weekend would be pointless since that one opened on a Tuesday ahead of a holiday week with $62M collected over its Friday-to-Sunday span – its fourth, fifth, and sixth days of release. But looking into the days ahead, the new sequel may find itself in the vicinity of $115M in its first seven days of play. That would be down 20% from the $144.5M that the last pic registered in its first full week in theaters on its way to $262M domestically and $754M worldwide.Even among tentpoles starting off the summer on the first weekend of May, the new webslinger does not rank up very high. It is only seventh best trailing The Avengers, the first and third Spider-Man films from Sam Raimi, and all three Iron Man pics. And only two of those films had the benefit of 3D ticket prices.This lucrative piece of release estate on the calendar is generally claimed years in advance because of its grossing potential. Disney has already claimed the next three for The Avenger: Age of Ultron opening in 2015, Captain America 3 opening in 2016, and an untitled Marvel film in 2017. Warner Bros. also has put its hat in the ring for the first May weekend of 2016 with its next Superman/Batman film, although one studio is sure to eventually move. Meanwhile, Sony already planted its flag on 2018 for The Amazing Spider-Man 4 with part three slated for June of 2016. Audiences can show up in masses — if you provide a movie they are genuinely crazy for.The weekend for the latest Andrew Garfield film began with an opening day Friday of $35.5M including $8.7M from Thursday night shows beginning at 7pm. Saturday slipped 7% to $33.1M and Sunday is projected to fall 29% to $23.4M. Studio data showed that the audience was 61% male (about right for a comic flick) and 51% under 25.$9.3M of this weekend’s gross came from 353 higher-priced IMAX screens. With China’s IMAX venues opening Sunday, the record global count of 703 locations will raise its cumulative worldwide gross to $25M+ and counting.Audience excitement for the rebooted Spider-Man in 2012 was not exactly sky high and not much has changed this time. Plus Captain America: The Winter Soldier just hit the marketplace a month ago doing summer-like business in April satisfying the demands of many action movie fans who did not need another comic book story so soon. Peter Parker will not threaten Steve Rogers for the top-grossing film of 2014 even though the opening weekend difference was only $3M.Still, breaking $90M on opening weekend is nothing to be disappointed with for The Amazing Spider-Man 2. Reviews were not so great and the CinemaScore grade from paying fans was a decent B+. Looking at current results and the road ahead, it seems that the new Electro flick will end up with the lowest domestic final of any Spider-Man installment (possibly around $225M) despite a budget of over $200M. But with so many action franchises, dwindling domestic ticket sales can be offset by growing international revenue and Spidey remains immensely popular around the globe.Overseas, Spider-Man 2 has been building on its earlier roll-out from two weeks ago. This weekend added several Asian debuts and the weekend generated a stellar $116M from all international markets raising the tally to $277M and the global cume to $369M. China saw a rare Sunday launch which was better than the release for the last Amazing which was forced to open day-and-date on a Monday against The Dark Knight Rises in that country. The rebooted Peter Parker won that opening day battle. The $10.4M first-day for part 2 in China bodes well for the rest of the run there and a cast visit to Beijing is paying off too. In the end, TASM2 may still be able to beat TASM1‘s global box office gross.Cameron Diaz and her gal pals got bumped down to the bridesmaid spot as former number one The Other Woman enjoyed a solid hold in its second weekend of play. The Fox hit dropped a reasonable 43% to an estimated $14.2M giving the revenge flick a solid $47.3M to date. Finishing with $80M seems very possible for this film which did not win over critics, but sparked strong buzz with female moviegoers looking for a fun time out with likable stars.Sony took third place with the uplifting drama Heaven Is For Real which dropped only 39% to an estimated $8.7M. With a sturdy $65.6M to date, Sony’s faith-based hit looks on track to finish in the $80-90M range – a huge achievement for a film with no major stars among its cast and crew.The spring’s ruling super hero juggernaut Captain America: The Winter Soldier followed in fourth with an estimated $7.8M, down 52% thanks to the arrival of his Marvel brother. Disney’s latest comic smash has now banked a stellar $237.1M making it bigger than every installment in the X-Men franchise. It has already beaten the performances of all past Thor, Hulk, Fantastic Four, and Captain America films. Breaking $250M still seems likely.Winter Soldier continued to watch its global tally soar despite Spider-Man establishing itself in all markets now. The overseas total rose to $442.7M pushing the worldwide haul to $679.8M with the $700M mark ready to fall in the next week or so. China leads all international markets by a mile with $115.8M making it the fifth biggest Western film of all-time. No other single country has broken $31M yet.The toon sequel Rio 2 cracked the $100M domestic mark and took in an estimated $7.6M in its fourth frame, off 45%. The Fox film has banked $106.5M and is heading to the vicinity of $125M. Paul Walker’s action entry Brick Mansions tumbled 63% in its sophomore round to an estimated $3.5M giving Relativity $15.5M to date.Book adaptation Divergent still held up well despite the new tentpole opening and grossed an estimated $2.2M, down 41%, for a new cume of $142.7M for Lionsgate. The distributor’s horror flop The Quiet Ones followed with an estimated $2M, down 49% in its second weekend, with a puny $6.8M to date.Next up was the second low-cost faith-based hit in the top ten – God’s Not Dead. The Freestyle release eased just 37% to an estimated $1.8M in its seventh round jumping back onto the list. Cume is a robust $55.6M. Faith-based films have appeared in the top ten for ten consecutive weeks now. Also rejoining the elite list this weekend was Wes Anderson’s The Grand Budapest Hotel with an estimated $1.7M, off 29%, for a $51.5M total so far. By next weekend, the indie smash will surpass the $52.3M of The Royal Tenenbaums to become the director’s top-grossing film ever.The top ten films grossed an estimated $141.5M which was down 32% from last year when Iron Man 3 opened at number one with $174.1M; and down 43% from 2012 when The Avengers debuted on top with a record-shattering $207.4M.Follow Gitesh on Twitter!","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"comiccon, comedies, kong, Toys, TCM, finale","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-The-Amazing-SpiderMan-2-Swings-to-Number-One"},{"id":"47509116199653","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: The Hobbit Debuts at the Top","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: The Hobbit Debuts at the TopFrozen drops to second, while The Hunger Games falls to fourth.by Gitesh Pandya | December 15, 2013 |  CommentsThis weekend, audiences powered the latest Middle Earth saga The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug into the number one spot, but fewer of them took the journey this time. The Warner Bros. release opened to an estimated $73.7M which was about $11M less than the $84.6M debut for the first chapter An Unexpected Journey from this same week a year ago.The first installment was helped by nine years of anticipation since the last Lord of the Rings movie debuted. This time around, the second pic was not as big of an event. Also, there were some who were not fully satisfied with Journey and dropped out this time. Bad weather and snowstorms in parts of the country also had an impact on the overall marketplace.3D screens accounted for 49% of the take which was identical to last year’s Hobbit. But more women were lost this time around. This weekend’s male share was 60%, up from the 57% for Journey last year. The CinemaScore was an A- which was a notch below the A from last time.Overseas, Smaug was more even with Journey, with a big weekend debut of $131.2M since Wednesday from 49 markets, which was seven fewer than what Journey had in its debut frame. That put the global premiere for Smaug at $204.9M. Journey went on to collect over $1 billion worldwide last year. Though the domestic results for the new film are smaller, international markets are showing roughly the same interest, so hitting the billion mark cannot be ruled out just yet.Dropping one notch to second place but still doing gangbusters was the Disney smash Frozen with an estimated $22.2M for a small 30% slide. After its third weekend of wide play, the animated pic has grossed a sensational $164.4M and is running a whopping 43% ahead of the pace of 2010’s Tangled at this same point in time with the same calendar. With the holiday break still to come, Frozen should race past the $250M mark domestically.Tyler Perry’s latest comedy A Madea Christmas sank to a new low and debuted in third with an estimated $16M. It was the worst opening ever for a Madea film and considerably less than the $25M neighborhood that the last two premiered in. Female-skewing comedies and dramas tend to open softer in mid-December but have better legs when audiences are finished with weekend distractions like holiday shopping. Playing in 2,194 theaters, Madea Christmas averaged $7,293 — solid, but subpar by Tyler Perry standards. The audience for the Lionsgate release was 67% female and 63% 25 and up. The CinemaScore grade was an A-.Falling 50% in its fourth weekend was The Hunger Games: Catching Fire with an estimated $13.2M, boosting the cume to $357M. The second Katniss flick is running 6% ahead of the pace of its predecessor, though that gap is closing quickly as the sequel is seeing larger declines. The first Hunger Games grossed a much stronger $21.1M in its fourth weekend.Catching Fire continued its stellar international run with the overseas take climbing to $372.9M and the worldwide sum reaching $739.9M. The new installment has now surpassed the $691M final global take of the first Hunger Games and has a shot at breaking the $800M mark with most of the growth coming from foreign markets.Thor: The Dark World followed in fifth with an estimated $2.7M, down 44%, for a $198.1M domestic cume. The Disney release has taken in $421.8M overseas for a robust worldwide tally of $619.9M.Falling 56% in its second weekend was the Christian Bale drama Out of the Furnace with an estimated $2.3M. The Relativity title has collected a measly $9.5M and looks headed for a final of about $15M.Four films rounded out the top ten with modest grosses of under $2M each. Vince Vaughn’s Delivery Man dropped 50% to an estimated $1.9M and has given Disney $28M to date. With three Golden Globe nominations including Best Picture and Best Actress in the Drama category, Judi Dench’s Philomena held up very well, sliding only 20% to an estimated $1.8M without any expansion of screens. The Weinstein Co. release has made $11M so far from under 900 theaters.Fox’s The Book Thief took in an estimated $1.7M, down 36%, for a modest total of $14.9M so far. The Jason Statham action entry Homefront tumbled 52% to an estimated $1.6M for $18.4M to date for Open Road.Exploding in platform release as one of the hottest tickets in town was David O. Russell’s latest film American Hustle, which opened to an estimated $690,000 from only six theaters for a jaw-dropping $115,000 average. Nominated for seven Golden Globes, including Best Picture – Comedy or Musical, the all-star film drew audience interest with its glowing reviews and stellar cast which includes Christian Bale, Amy Adams, Bradley Cooper, Jennifer Lawrence, and Jeremy Renner. Sony is well-positioned to take Hustle nationwide which happens on Friday when it expands to over 2,500 runs, though it will be a competitive frame with Paramount’s launch of its all-star comedy Anchorman 2 this Wednesday in 3,400 locations.Disney enjoyed a good limited bow of its own with the Tom Hanks-Emma Thompson pic Saving Mr. Banks which grossed an estimated $421,000 from 15 locations for a $28,067 average. The figure included special $50 tickets in Southern California which included a studio tour on the Disney lot. Reviews have been good for the PG-13 film which expands nationally on Friday into 2,200 locations.The top ten films grossed an estimated $137M which was up 8% from last year when The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey opened at number one with $84.6M; and up 29% from 2011 when Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows debuted in the top spot with $39.6M.Follow Gitesh on Twitter!","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"Grant, Sabrina, Writers, cars, show, Book, Fire, witnail, Mudbound, fiction, story, Pet","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-The-Hobbit-Debuts-at-the-Top"},{"id":"47509114461914","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: Non-Stop Takes the Top Spot","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: Non-Stop Takes the Top SpotSon of God and The LEGO Movie round out the top three.by Gitesh Pandya | March 2, 2014 |  CommentsLiam Neeson conquered the North American box office with his latest action thriller Non-Stop which exceeded expectations debuting at number one with an estimated $30M. Universal’s third top spot debut of the year averaged a muscular $9,715 from 3,090 locations and reinforced the 61-year-old actor’s reputation as one of the most bankable and reliable box office draws around. Over the past five years, Neeson has had six action movies open at number one. That’s more than Matt Damon, Tom Cruise, and Will Smith – combined!The Oscar-nominated actor’s newest film earned mixed reviews from critics, but moviegoers instead responded to starpower and an intriguing story. In Non-Stop, Neeson plays a U.S. air marshal on board a trans-Atlantic flight who must seek out and capture a mysterious criminal who will kill a passenger every 20 minutes if his demands are not met. Also helping were thrilling trailers and TV spots which effectively communicated the plot to audiences.The stellar opening weekend came thanks to broad support across many demos. Studio research showed that cross-gender appeal was tremendous with 51% being female. Mature adult couples contributed significantly. Broad appeal across races also made a difference as 54% of the audience was non-white. The only group lacking were young people – which has become common these days – as 65% of the crowd was over 25. A good A- CinemaScore and older audience base suggests that the road ahead could be promising.Fox’s Son of God debuted strong in second place with an estimated $26.5M from 3,260 locations for a solid $8,129 average. The PG-13 film was actually an edit that took material from the History Channel mini-series The Bible which was viewed by millions last spring. This version compiled footage mostly pertaining to Jesus Christ and turned them into a stand-alone feature film intended to be an event movie in theaters for audiences. The plan worked and a targeted push towards the faith-based audience succeeded. Despite the Oscar broadcast, Sunday is expected to generate strong sales from the post-church service crowd.Paying moviegoers gave very positive feedback. The CinemaScore was an A- while the PostTrak survey showed that 91% of those polled called the film either excellent or very good. Older women made up the core audience with data showing that the crowd was 62% female and 82% over 25. 22% of the audience was Latino and a Spanish-language version of the film played in over 200 of the theaters. Reviews were mostly negative, but customers responded more to a big-screen version of an important story.The LEGO Movie was knocked out of the top spot after a three-week reign, however it still held up well and even crossed the $200M barrier in the process. The animated action-comedy, which includes Liam Neeson in the voice cast as Good Cop and Bad Cop, declined by only 33% to an estimated $21M in its fourth round. LEGO is the first film since Gravity to gross over $20M in each of its first four weekends. Even megahits Frozen and The Hunger Games: Catching Fire did not accomplish that.Warner Bros. has now collected a massive $209.3M for its animated sensation making it the studio’s biggest toon of all-time beating the $198M of 2006’s Happy Feet. LEGO may be able to reach the vicinity $260M from North America alone and will finally face some direct competition next weekend with the arrival of the animated comedy Mr. Peabody &amp; Sherman from Fox followed two weeks later by Disney’s Muppets Most Wanted.The rest of the top ten was filled with holdovers each collecting modest amounts. George Clooney’s The Monuments Men held up well again in its fourth weekend grossing an estimated $5M, off 37%, for a $65.7M cume for Sony. Relativity’s Kevin Costner action pic 3 Days to Kill got punched hard by Liam and tumbled 60% to an estimated $4.9M putting the ten-day total at $20.7M. A $30M final may result.A pair of effects-heavy action films from Sony followed. The remake RoboCop fell 54% to an estimated $4.5M boosting the domestic tally to $51.2M. It opened to muscular numbers in China this weekend (helped by IMAX screens) with an estimated $20.5M which nearly matched its domestic debut. Worldwide tally sits at $187.2M with 73% of that coming from international markets. Pompeii dropped 58% to an estimated $4.3M for a weak $17.7M after ten days. Look for a lousy $25M final.It was a landmark weekend for Disney’s animated sensation Frozen which shattered the one billion dollar mark at the global box office as it headed into Oscar night hoping for two wins. The snow toon dipped only 18% in its 14th weekend of domestic release to an estimated $3.6M raising the cume to $388.7M. Overseas, Frozen broke the $600M barrier and rose to a staggering $611.5M putting the worldwide gross a tad bit above $1B. How impressive is that for an original story? Frozen is now only the third film in history not based on a major brand to top the billion dollar mark after James Cameron’s Avatar and Titanic. With its final market of Japan still to come later this month, Frozen may just finish above the $1.1B mark.Kevin Hart rounded out the top ten with his two recent hit films. The romantic comedy About Last Night grossed an estimated $3.4M while the cop pic Ride Along followed with an estimated $3.1M. The Sony film fell 55% and has banked $43.8M to date while the Universal smash dipped a smaller 33% putting its total at $127.2M. Ride Along has now grossed more than this winter’s star-driven sequel Anchorman 2 starring Will Ferrell.As is often the case on Oscar weekend, audiences caught up on Best Picture contenders in the final days before the big ceremony. Most saw their weekend grosses increase from last week such as 12 Years a Slave (+72%), Dallas Buyers Club (+44%), Gravity (+3%), American Hustle (+11%), and Philomena (+2%). Paramount’s two horses in the race both dipped, The Wolf of Wall Street by 6% and Nebraska by 5%.Foreign films enjoyed some activity at the domestic box office this weekend. Russia’s top-grossing blockbuster of all-time Stalingrad launched exclusively on IMAX 3D screens and opened to an estimated $500,000 from 308 locations for a weak $1,623 average. India’s The Lunchbox platformed in New York and Los Angeles to an estimated $51,325 from three sites for a $17,108 average ahead of an expansion into more major cities on Friday. And Miyazaki’s The Wind Rises, Japan’s highest grossing film of 2013, expanded nationally to an estimated $1.6M from 496 theaters for a $3,234 average. Disney’s cume is $2M for the Oscar nominee for best animated feature.The top ten films grossed an estimated $106.3M which was up 21% from last year when Jack the Giant Slayer opened at number one with $27.2M; but down 27% from 2012 when The Lorax took the top spot with $70.2M.Follow Gitesh on Twitter!","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"blockbusters, drama, Tomatazos, cops, Series","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-NonStop-Takes-the-Top-Spot"},{"id":"47509116208874","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: Thor Crushes the Competition","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: Thor Crushes the CompetitionBad Grandpa, Free Birds, and Last Vegas essentially tie for second.by Gitesh Pandya | November 10, 2013 |  CommentsThis weekend, making more money than all other films combined, the super hero sequel Thor: The Dark World descended upon the box office and crushed all rivals delivering the fourth biggest opening weekend of the year. Distributed by Disney, the Marvel tentpole bowed to an estimated $86.1M from 3,841 locations for a muscular $22,418 average including higher-priced tickets from 3D and IMAX screens.The Dark World opened 31% mightier than the $65.7M bow of its 2011 predecessor, which was slightly better than the jump that the second Iron Man film enjoyed following two years after the first movie from that series. For both Avengers-related franchises, the first chapter tackled the origin story while the sequel saw the hero take on a new mission against a new villain.The new Thor got the weekend started with a stellar $31.6M on Friday which included $7.1M from Thursday night shows beginning at 8:00pm. For most comic book flicks and sequels it is common for Saturday to dip from a supercharged opening day with earlier Thursday preview shows. A slide of around 10% would be normal since fanboys rush out to the first possible shows. But The Dark World actually remained flat on Saturday with a remarkable $31.7M — an incredible hold. Disney projected a 28% decline on Sunday to $22.8M helped in part by Monday being Veterans Day, a school holiday.Only three films opened stronger this year — Iron Man 3 with $174.1M, Man of Steel with $116.6M ($128.7M including Thursday evening group sales) and Fast &amp; Furious 6 with $97.4M. The demographic breakdown of the Dark World audience was almost identical gender-wise to the first Thor‘s, but there was a noticeable shift towards younger moviegoers this time. Males made up 62% of the crowd while 61% were over 25 for the sequel. Those figures compared to 63% and 72%, respectively, for the 2011 predecessor. And while the first Thor was more of a critic-pleaser, the humor-filled followup played as more of a crowd-pleaser. Reviews were not as sensational this time around; however, the CinemaScore grade from paying audiences was a solid A- compared to the B+ for the first Thor.With no major competition to face in its second weekend, Thor: The Dark World will be able to bank an impressive two-week gross before The Hunger Games: Catching Fire debuts to what might be record levels. The first Thor went on to gross $181M domestically and $449M worldwide (60% from international) and its sequel should have no problem beating both of those numbers.Overseas, the new Thor raked in an estimated $94M this weekend from holdover markets that launched last week as well as a few new markets led by China’s potent $19.6M Friday-to-Sunday bow. The international total now stands at $240.9M led by Russia’s $24.1M, $22.6M from the U.K., China’s $19.6M from only three days, Brazil’s $15.9M, and Mexico’s $15.7M. Thor: The Dark World has grossed a fantastic $327M worldwide in under two weeks and may be on its way across the $700M barrier by the end of its global run.It was a three-way race for the bridesmaid position as a bunch of holdovers all projected just over $11M in weekend business. Final chart positions might change. Paramount’s hit prank flick Jackass Presents: Bad Grandpa dropped 44% in its third round (another nice hold for this kind of movie) to an estimated $11.3M, lifting the cume to a stellar $78.7M. The Johnny Knoxville film cost only $15M to produce.The animated film Free Birds declined by only 29% in its second weekend thanks to no new competition for young children. The Relativity release banked an estimated $11.2M, upping the total to $30.2M heading to about $60M. Also holding well was the star-driven comedy Last Vegas with an estimated $11.1M, off just 32%, for $33.5M to date. CBS Films may end in the $60M range too.As widely expected, the sci-fi film Ender’s Game took a beating in its second weekend with the arrival of Thor. Lionsgate suffered a 62% tumble to an estimated $10.3M putting the ten-day sum at $44M — disappointing for a pricey effects-driven adventure meant to launch a new franchise. A $60-65M final seems likely.The space blockbuster Gravity fell from the top five for the first time in its six-week run taking sixth place with an estimated $5.4M sliding 35%. The decline was about the same as for the last two frames which was amazing given the huge footprint Thor left this weekend. The Warner Bros. overperformer has now grossed a sensational $231.1M domestically while the international haul rose to $241.2M putting the new worldwide tally at an impressive $472.3M. Next week’s China opening on November 20 is expected to keep things going, especially with the popularity of 3D and IMAX there.Awards hopeful 12 Years A Slave expanded nationwide after three weeks of successful limited play and landed in seventh for the weekend with an estimated $6.6M from 1,144 locations for a good $5,769 average. Fox Searchlight nearly tripled the run this weekend and its total is now $17.3M. Sony’s Captain Phillips followed with an estimated $5.8M, down 31%, for a $91M sum for Sony on its way to the century club.Universal expanded its sci-fi romance About Time across North America following one week of limited release and saw lackluster results. The Rachel McAdams drama grossed an estimated $5.2M from 1,200 sites for a mild $4,310 average. The studio reported an aggressive estimate expecting its core female audience to come out strong on Football Sunday and be helped by Monday’s Veteran’s Day holiday. However, its slim 7% projected Sunday drop is far smaller than the 28-43% predicted by every other film in the top ten so the final weekend figure may come in lower. Universal research showed that About Time skewed 71% female and 56% 40 and older. Cume is $5.2M and reviews were mixed.Rounding out the top ten was the toon sequel Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2 which dropped 33% to an estimated $2.8M giving Sony $110M to date.Below the top ten, Fox platformed its Nazi Germany-set drama The Book Thief in just four theaters and debuted to an estimated $108,000 for a strong $27,000 average. With mixed reviews, the PG-13 film heads into additional cities throughout the month. Focus found solid results with its second weekend expansion of Matthew McConaughey’s Dallas Buyers Club which collected an estimated $629,000 from 35 locations for a good $17,971 average. Total is $985,000.The top ten films grossed an estimated $158.7M which was off by less than 1% from last year when Skyfall opened at number one with $88.4M; but up 28% from 2011 when Immortals debuted in the top spot on 11.11.11 with $32.2M.Follow Gitesh on Twitter.","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"street, book, live, TV, BBC, transformers","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-Thor-Crushes-the-Competition"},{"id":"47509117930225","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: Prisoners Captures the Top Spot","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: Prisoners Captures the Top SpotInsidious Chapter 2 and The Family round out the top three.by Gitesh Pandya | September 22, 2013 |  CommentsNorth American audiences drove the well-reviewed kidnapping thriller Prisoners to the number one spot with a solid opening of $21.4M, according to estimates. The Warner Bros. release averaged a commendable $6,574 from 3,260 locations and marks the studio’s fifth top spot debut of the year.Mature adults made up the audience for this R-rated pic which used strong marks from critics and starpower from Hugh Jackman and Jake Gyllenhaal to attract a debut that was especially good for this normally weak time of year. Cross-gender appeal helped too as evidenced by the breakdown of 52% female and 48% male. A very high 72% was over 25. The thriller cost $46M to produce.Moviegoers liked what they saw. The CinemaScore grade was a respectable B+ while Saturday sales shot up 29% from Friday’s launch indicating good word-of-mouth and an older audience. That could bode well for future weeks although competition for mature adults will get fierce very fast and furious. One advantage Prisoners may end up having at the domestic box office is that it is a very American story compared to the more international-themed adult dramas coming soon.Fright sequel Insidious Chapter 2 tumbled an understandable 64% to an estimated $14.5M in its second weekend and pushed its ten-day total to a robust $60.9M which already exceeds the $54M of its predecessor. Look for FilmDistrict to end at about $85M with a third chapter now in development.Fellow sophomore The Family dropped 50% to an estimated $7M and has banked $25.6M to date for Relativity. A $40-45M final may result. The Spanish-language hit Instructions Not Included enjoyed another wonderful frame and actually saw sales climb by a healthy 17% to $5.7M putting the Lionsgate release at $34.3M.The 3D international dance flick Battle of the Year was rejected by young adults and limped into fifth place with only a $5M opening weekend, according to estimates. The Sony release averaged a weak $2,490 from 2,008 locations and saw an audience that was 60% female and 55% 21 and older. Reviews were horrible, but on the bright side the paying crowd did like what they got. Its Cinemascore was an A-.Sleeper hit We’re the Millers remained in over 3,000 theaters for an incredible seventh consecutive week and followed with an estimated $4.7M, dipping a mere 14%. The Warner Bros. hit has banked $138.2M to date and is headed north of $150M. Oscar hopeful The Butler grossed an estimated $4.3M, down just 22%, for a $106.5M cume for The Weinstein Co. Universal’s actioner Riddick followed falling 46% to an estimated $3.7M and $37.2M overall.Opening in limited release to strong results in ninth place was the IMAX 3D version of The Wizard of Oz which grossed an estimated $3M from 318 large screens for a potent $9,503 average. The classic film is celebrating its 75th anniversary and Warner Bros. scheduled a one-week stunt in theaters intended to help promote next week’s Blu-ray release on October 1.Rounding out the top ten was the Disney toon Planes which slipped a scant 8% to an estimated $2.9M boosting the sum to $86.5M.A pair of critically-acclaimed films that premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival enjoyed strong debuts in platform release ahead of wider play next weekend. Fox Searchlight unveiled the mature romantic comedy Enough Said starring Julia Louis-Dreyfus and James Gandolfini in four theaters in New York and Los Angeles and bowed to an estimated $240,000 for a sensational $60,000 average. Enough expands to major markets across North America on Friday widening to around 200 total locations.Oscar winner Ron Howard saw his latest directorial effort, the Formula One racing drama Rush, collect an estimated $200,000 from five locations for a solid $40,000 average. Universal hopes to use this momentum when it expands nationwide Friday into 2,200 theaters against three other new wide openers. Rush‘s budget was $38M and the pic was Howard’s first independently-financed film in three decades.More awards hopefuls will release in the weeks to follow including Gravity on October 4, Captain Phillips on October 11, and The Fifth Estate on October 18 making for a crowded fall box office for mature adults next month.The top ten films grossed an estimated $72.2M which was even with last year when End of Watch debuted at number one with $13.2M; but down 30% from 2011 when The Lion King 3D stayed in the top spot with $21.9M.Follow the Gitesh on the Twitter.","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"rotten, President, Fire, TV","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-Prisoners-Captures-the-Top-Spot"},{"id":"47509119441662","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: Monsters University Schools the Competition","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: Monsters University Schools the CompetitionWorld War Z and Man of Steel round out the top three.by Sujit Chawla | June 24, 2013 |  CommentsWith two new monster hits combining to take in nearly $150M alone, the North American box office exploded this weekend with the top 10 grossing $226M becoming the second highest grossing weekend of the year and one of the top grossing weekends of all time.Leading the way in the now traditional mid-June slot was the Disney/Pixar prequel Monsters University which grossed an estimated $82M this weekend, becoming the second highest opening for all Pixar films behind only 2010’s Toy Story 3 which opened to $110M. Pixar films for the most part have opened in the $60-70M range as 8 of their now 14 releases have hit that mark. All 14 films by the way have opened #1 during their first weekend of wide release. Monsters University tapped into the love for the Monsters characters which were launched way back in 2001 with Monsters Inc. which opened to $62.5M on its way to a lifetime total of $255.8M. Monsters Inc. was only the 4th Pixar release so not only did Monsters University use the nostalgia pop for their own characters, they were able to use over a decade of goodwill for the Pixar brand itself. Monsters U. also opened in 35 territories internationally and took in an additional $54.5M for a worldwide total of $136.5M so far. And with an ‘A’ CinemaScore from viewers, look for the family film to eat up box office receipts the rest of the summer.Second place belonged to a different kind of monster as Paramount unleased the zombie flick World War Z to impressive results. The Brad Pitt starrer took in an estimated $66M this weekend, crushing industry expectations. Bad buzz had circled the film for months after word got out the entire third act was being re-filmed, but audiences didn’t care as they gave the film a solid ‘B+’ CinemaScore grade and obviously came out in droves to get a taste of Pitt and the zombies. Z now becomes Pitt’s highest opening weekend soundly defeating 2005’s Mr. &amp; Mrs. Smith (co-starring Angelina Jolie) which opened to $50.3M on its way to $186.3M, currently Pitt’s highest grossing film overall. Internationally World War Z has amassed $46M for a worldwide total to date of $112M with many territories still to open.Third place belonged to Man of Steel which fell an understandable 65% from its record-breaking opening last weekend to an estimated $41.2M bringing its cume to $210M, or, $10M more than Superman Returns made in its entire run. While Man of Steel fell a little bit harder than anticipated considering the largely positive reviews and obvious audience response, it still has a good chance of hitting the $300M mark. In fourth place was the R-rated comedy This is the End which fell a slim 37% to an estimated $13M bringing its cume to $57.8M, with the $100M milestone still within range.In fifth place was arguably the surprise hit of the summer, Now You See Me, which took in $7.9M this weekend, according to estimates, for a total gross of $94.4M, within ear shot of the $100M club. Remarkable for a film that had almost zero buzz coming into the summer season. Sixth place belonged to a film everyone had heard of, Fast &amp; Furious 6 which took an another $4.7M this weekend, according to estimates, bringing its cume to $228M.Comedy flop The Internship landed in seventh this weekend with an estimated $3.4M, bringing its total to a disappointing $38M. It’ll be lucky to even hit its production budget of $58M by the end of its run. On the opposite end of the spectrum was another surprise hit, the horror-thriller The Purge which took in an estimated $3.4M this weekend bringing its total to an impressive $59M, off of a budget of only $3M. While star power certainly helps some films, this summer people are also lining up for concepts they like.Rounding out the top 10 were two expected smashes in Star Trek Into Darkness (estimated $3M this weekend for a total of $216.6M) and Iron Man 3 which added an additional $2.2M to its already overflowing coffers, bringing its total up to a remarkable $403.1M. It now stands at #15 on the all-time list, just a hair behind fellow Marvel superhero Spider-Man.Outside of the top 10 The Bling Ring expanded to 650 theaters and grossed an estimated $2M for a somewhat disappointing $3,077 per screen average. The expansion was actually poorer than the last major release from studio A24, Spring Breakers, which went wide in March and had a per screen average of $4,401. That film ended up with a $14M total gross.The top ten films grossed $226.8M which was up a stellar 49% from last year when Brave opened at number one with $66.3M; and up 38% from 2011 when Cars 2 debuted in the top spot with $66.1M.Follow Sujit on Twitter!","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"of, Comedy, Awards, heist, ESPN, spider-man, Brie, true, TV","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-Monsters-University-Schools-the-Competition"},{"id":"47508941837503","title":"Fall TV Scorecard 2015","content":"Fall TV Scorecard&nbsp;2015The 2015 fall TV season has brought us a plentiful harvest of new shows — a few movie adaptations, a couple of TV reboots, and a whole lot of Rob Lowe.

That’ll end this weekend, when director Gareth Edwards brings the big guy roaring back to life with an all-new Godzilla, and in honor of his return, we’ve compiled a list of some of the many other films to put supersized stars to good use. Go big or go home — it’s time for Total Recall! 95%The Beast From 20,000 FathomsThe Monster: The Beast.It Came From: North of the Arctic Circle.Stomping Grounds: Manhattan.Approximate Size: 30 feet tall and 100 feet long.Method of Mayhem: Given its size, the Beast’s mere presence in the big city was bound to sow destruction, but its overall bad mood spelled doom for any building (or foolish human) in its path. Also, it bled all over the streets after being shot in throat with a bazooka, poisoning the populace with a prehistoric germ.Who tried to stop it? The U.S. military.The monster is an allegory for… The dangers of nuclear weaponry.Exceedingly rare is the giant monster movie that does not owe a giant debt to The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms. Directed by Eugène Lourié and featuring some remarkable early work by stop-motion special effects legend Ray Harryhausen, Beast traces the aftermath of an Arctic nuclear blast that rouses a hibernating dinosaur from its 100-million-year slumber — and sends the beast rumbling toward Manhattan, where it wreaks hundreds of millions of dollars’ worth of damage in retaliation. A major hit, it inspired a horde of like-minded subsequent releases — including the original Godzilla — and impressed critics like A.H. Weiler of the New York Times, who wrote, “Despite more than a suspicion of palaver, it generates a fair portion of interest and climactic excitement.” 68%The BlobThe Monster: The Blob.It Came From: Outer space.Stomping Grounds: Downingtown, Pennsylvania.Approximate Size: It starts small, but ends up being big enough that the Air Force has to use a heavy-lift cargo plane to drop it off in the Arctic.Method of Mayhem: Blobbin’ stuff up.Who tried to stop it? Steve McQueen. In other words, it didn’t stand a chance.The monster is an allegory for… Plenty of people believe it’s a stand-in for the Communist threat that Americans felt in the 1950s, but it’s worth noting that co-writer Rudy Nelson, for one, has vigorously denied that claim.Like a lot of the classic creature features, The Blob can be interpreted on a number of levels; one popular view of the Steve McQueen-led 1958 original holds that the titular gelatinous mass is a goopy stand-in for the Soviet Union. But you don’t need a poly sci degree to appreciate the spectacle of an alien ooze growing to enormous size while sucking the life out of small-town America; as Rob Humanick wrote for Suite101.com, “It’s exuberant and extraordinary, and just nasty enough.” 100%The Call of CthulhuThe Monster: Cthulhu.It Came From: Beyond the stars.Stomping Grounds: All of Earth, eventually.Approximate Size: Several hundred feet tall.Method of Mayhem: Reducing all of human consciousness to a senseless state of jibbering madness; welcoming the return of the Great Old Ones.Who tried to stop it? The Elder Things, who were ultimately responsible for sending Cthulhu to his watery (yet temporary) grave in the submerged city of R’lyeh.The monster is an allegory for… “The most merciful thing in the world,” sneered H.P. Lovecraft, “is the inability of the human mind to correlate all its contents.”For a certain type of giant monster fan, nothing beats Cthulhu, the octopus-faced horror dreamed up by H.P. Lovecraft and unleashed upon his hopelessly matched characters in various works. Although most attempts to bring the Cthulhu mythos to the screen have ended in embarrassing failure, the 2005 short film The Call of Cthulhu proved it’s far from unfilmable — and while it seems unlikely that the character’s cinematic destiny lies in fan-made silent movies like this one, it does hint at the possibilities awaiting filmgoers if and when Guillermo del Toro ever gets the green light on his proposed adaptation of Lovecraft’s Cthulhu-related At the Mountains of Madness. Until then, this remains what GreenCine’s Sean Axmaker called “more than simply a love letter to the stylized artificiality of silent expressionist horror… the most faithful screen translation of the author’s work to date.” 78%CloverfieldThe Monster: Unnamed, though the production crew referred to it as Clover.It Came From: The depths of the ocean.Stomping Grounds: New York City.Approximate Size: 25 stories tall — and it’s just a baby.Method of Mayhem: Going nuts and smashing everything in sight. The only thing worse than an angry giant monster? One that’s freaked out.Who tried to stop it? The U.S. military.The monster is an allegory for… Uncertain. Perhaps the destruction soon to be wrought by the found-footage phenomenon upon just about every film genre?Bring producer J.J. Abrams, director Matt Reeves, and screenwriter Drew Goddard together for a project, and odds are pretty high you’re going to end up with a fairly potent blast of filmgoing fun. Case in point: 2008’s Cloverfield, a found footage/giant monster movie mashup that depicts a catastrophic creature invasion through the panicked eyes of a group of young New Yorkers. The shaky first-person perspective is enough to send more sensitively stomached viewers into convulsions, but it also ramps up the tension by keeping much of the chaos, destruction, and visual horror off-camera while adding a bit of savvy 21st century commentary. “Cloverfield captures the chronic self-absorption of the Facebook generation with breathless, cleverly recycled media savvy, and then it stomps that self-absorption to death,” wrote Ty Burr for the Boston Globe. “These days, that’s entertainment.” 97%GhostbustersThe Monster: The Stay Puft Marshmallow Man.It Came From: An interdimensional portal opened by those creeps Zuul and Vinz Clortho.Stomping Grounds: Manhattan.Approximate Size: A little over 100 feet tall.Method of Mayhem: Pounding the streets with his big marshmallow feet.Who tried to stop it? Our friends Venkman, Stantz, Spengler, and Zeddemore, who ain’t afraid of no ghost.The monster is an allegory for… “The most harmless thing” Stantz can think of. Or possibly a physical manifestation of pent-up sailor lust.Strictly speaking, Ghostbusters is more of a ghost movie than a monster movie — it says so right there in the title — but this classic 1984 horror-comedy isn’t without its share of giant beasties, including the nasty-looking Zuul the Gatekeeper. But Zuul isn’t the main reason we decided to make room for ghostbusting Drs. Peter Venkman (Bill Murray), Raymond Stantz (Dan Aykroyd), and Egon Spengler (Harold Ramis) — plus their buddy Winston Zeddemore (Ernie Hudson) — on our list. That honor goes to the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man, a monstrous manifestation of Ghostbusters villain Gozer the Gozerian, who makes his brief (yet oh so memorable) appearance in the movie’s final act before being blown up all over the streets of New York City, drenching the insufferable EPA inspector Walter Peck (William Atherton, owning the role he was born to play) in the process. As Richard Schickel wrote for TIME, “Whoever thought of having evil’s final manifestation take the form of a 100-ft. marshmallow deserves the rational mind’s eternal gratitude.” 93%GojiraThe Monster: Godzilla.It Came From: The Pacific Ocean.Stomping Grounds: Tokyo.Approximate Size: 164 feet tall.Method of Mayhem: Breathes fire, swings a spiked tail, stomps on stuff.Who tried to stop it? The Japanese army.The monster is an allegory for… The dangers of nuclear weaponry — specifically those faced by the survivors of the atomic bombings in Hiroshima and Nagasaki.Before the slew of vs.-enhanced sequels, and long before the regrettable Godzilla 1985 and/or 1998’s Roland Emmerich-directed reboot, audiences cowered before the mighty original Gojira. If the special effects haven’t aged particularly well, the nuclear-powered subtext in Ishirô Honda’s 1954 classic is still plenty powerful, lending the movie a degree of sobering potency uncommon in films starring dudes in rubber suits. Tim Brayton of Antagony &amp; Ecstasy is just one of the many critics who have deemed it a “masterpiece,” adding, “even in its most generic elements, it’s never just a monster movie, but a fantastic depiction of how humans survive and struggle.” 93%The HostThe Monster: Unnamed, though director Joon-ho Bong referred to it as “Steve Buscemi.”It Came From: The Han River in Seoul.Stomping Grounds: We just told you.Approximate Size: About the size of a large truck.Method of Mayhem: Jumping out of the water to commit vandalism and murder; kidnapping children.Who tried to stop it? The world’s baddest snack bar worker.The monster is an allegory for… The dangers — and the moral wrongness — of pollution.What if the Loch Ness Monster lived in Seoul — and was really ticked off? That’s kind of the premise behind 2006’s The Host, a killer South Korean import that imagines a giant, scaly water beast lurking in the depths of the River Han, waiting to wreak havoc on an unsuspecting populace. But the creature makes a bad move when it decides to kidnap a little girl whose father’s day job at the local snack bar belies a tenacious willingness to whoop monster butt. Enthused Terry Lawson of the Detroit Free Press, “The film’s limber and inventive director Joon-ho Bong keeps The Host creeping and leaping for its entire two hours, which are filled with incident after incident, alternately terrifying, ridiculous, suspenseful and wry.” 91%Jurassic ParkThe Monsters: The mighty Tyrannosaurus Rex and a bunch of sneaky velociraptors.They Came From: The distant past.Stomping Grounds: The tropical paradise of Isla Nublar.Approximate Size: Dinosaur-sized, from the giant T-rex to the smaller (but no less lethal) velociraptor.Method of Mayhem: Just kind of being dino-like and asserting themselves back at the top of the food chain.Who tried to stop it? Paleontologist Dr. Alan Grant (Sam Neill) and paleobotanist Dr. Ellie Sattler (Laura Dern).The monsters are an allegory for… There are any number of theories, but they all seem fairly far-fetched. Perhaps they were simply intended to get butts in seats — a goal they’ve more than fulfilled.Modern CG-assisted monster movies have far better special effects than entries from the genre’s heyday, but they often lack the infectious fun that still makes those campy classics such a treat. Not so with Steven Spielberg’s Jurassic Park, which adapts Michael Crichton’s 1990 bestseller about a scientist (Richard Attenborough) who finds a way to clone dinosaurs and decides it’d be a really great idea to breed a bunch of them for an island paradise amusement park. Things go horribly awry, of course, but his loss is the audience’s gain — Jurassic Park doesn’t skimp on thrilling visuals, but neither does it forget to anchor its gee-whiz moments with a smart plot and characters we care about. Even a seasoned vet like the Observer’s Philip French found himself in thrall to Spielberg’s spell, writing, “I loved every fascinating, suspenseful, frightening, skilfully calibrated minute of it.”[ 98%King KongThe Monster: King Kong, the Eighth Wonder of the World.It Came From: Skull Island.Stomping Grounds: Manhattan.Approximate Size: Kong’s official height for the original is listed as 50 feet.Method of Mayhem: Have you ever seen that old commercial starring a gorilla who beats the tar out of a suitcase? Kind of like that, only bigger.Who tried to stop it? The U.S. military.The monster is an allegory for… That depends who’s answering the question, but one popular theory holds that the story offers veiled commentary on the slave trade.The grandaddy of all giant monster movies, King Kong works on a purely visceral level, unleashing a torrent of awesome (and now iconic) images that include the titular ape battling everything from prehistoric creatures to a squadron of military biplanes. But like all the best creature features, it anchors its eye candy with a storyline rich in interpretive possibilities — which is why, long after the thrill of watching Fay Wray plucked from a skyscraper by a giant hand has worn off, we keep returning to the original Kong even though it’s been remade with color film, more naturalistic acting, and more expensive special effects. “There are very few works of cinema that stand up to repeated viewings and decades of changing film mores and audience expectations,” wrote Christopher Null for Filmcritic.com. “Most notable among these is the classic King Kong.” 73%Monsters vs. AliensThe Monsters: Let’s see… there’s a giant woman, a gelatinous blob, a giant cockroach, a fish-ape hybrid, and, oh yeah, some aliens.It Came From: The pages of the comic book Rex Havoc, although the characters ultimately ended up being created more or less from scratch.Stomping Grounds: San Francisco and outer space.Approximate Size: The largest monsters, Ginormica and Insectosaurus, are 49 feet tall and 350 feet long, respectively.Method of Mayhem: Varied.Who tried to stop it? The alien warlord Gallaxhar, although he was the bad guy in the story.The monsters are an allegory for… It’s a modern animated feature, which means everything is an allegory for learning how to accept yourself for who you are and respect other people’s differences.In most movies, giant monsters are feared and hunted in equal measure, but if you had to choose between them and an alien invasion, you’d probably choose the former — and that’s the rather brilliant idea behind Monsters vs. Aliens, the 2009 DreamWorks Animation feature that rounds up some of Earth’s more cooperative monsters (including Ginormica, a 50-foot-tall woman voiced by Reese Witherspoon, and a 350-foot grub nicknamed Insectosaurus) into a government task force to help thwart the efforts of the alien king Gallaxhar (Rainn Wilson). Like most modern cartoons, it’s rainbow-colored and stuffed to the gills with madcap gags, but a lot of its best bits are really pretty funny, and it also serves as a fairly tender, surprisingly effective homage to 1950s sci-fi. As Mike Edwards wrote for What Culture, “As a child who loathed the wholesomeness of Disney and wholeheartedly embraced the madcap antics of Bugs Bunny, Wile E. Coyote and Daffy Duck, this film was perfect for me.” 72%Pacific RimThe Monsters: The Kaiju.They Came From: An interdimensional portal at the bottom of the Pacific Ocean.Stomping Grounds: Earth.Approximate Size: Varied, but the biggest of the bunch, nicknamed Slattern, was estimated to be 596 feet tall and weigh 6,750 tons.Method of Mayhem: Teeth, claws, spikes, sheer tonnage — you name it.Who tried to stop it? The Pan Pacific Defense Corps, a multinational coalition representing the last of humanity’s military might.The monsters are an allegory for… Allegory has no place here.High art certainly has its place in the cinema. But when it comes down to it, there’s a cinematic itch that can only be scratched by indulging in the spectacle of giant robots duking it out with giant monsters while the fate of humanity hangs in the balance — and few films can scratch it as satisfyingly as Guillermo del Toro’s Pacific Rim. One of the most gleefully effective gateway drugs for 10-year-old movie geeks of all ages, Rim isn’t exactly the most well-acted or emotionally resonant entry on our list, but it boasts more than enough gee-whiz CG effects to make up for any highfalutin sociopolitical subtext — not to mention its fanboy-friendly director’s deft hand. “Del Toro is a dreamer,” observed Wesley Morris for Grantland. “He’s a visionary. If you give him a pile of money to make enormous robots fight enormous monsters at the end of civilization, he will work to make Pacific Rim a movie that makes you feel all the enormousness.” 86%TremorsThe Monsters: The Graboids.They Came From: DUDE RIGHT WHERE YOU’RE STANDING.Stomping Grounds: The tiny town of Perfection, Nevada.Approximate Size: 30 feet long and six feet across, weighing 10-20 tons.Method of Mayhem: Bursting through the ground and messing you up.Who tried to stop it? The intrepid residents of Perfection, including a survivalist played by television’s Michael Gross and an exquisitely mulleted handyman played by Kevin Bacon.The monsters are an allegory for… You’ve got us. For the studio, they were an allegory for “direct-to-video sequels” and “spinoff TV series.”A small desert town. A disgusting breed of giant subterranean flesh-eating worms. A cast full of outstanding character actors. Put them all together, and what do you have? 1990’s Tremors, which affectionately nodded to the corny B-movie monster flicks of the past with over-the-top acting and silly dialogue while keeping the audience on the edge of its collective seat with through-the-fingers thrills. It’s a tricky balance to maintain — just ask anyone who’s watched the progressively less effective sequels — and it still stands as one of the more effective, and purely entertaining, low-budget horror homages in Hollywood history. “I think there should be a lot more movies like Tremors out there,” wrote Scott Weinberg for FEARnet. “And no, I don’t mean more sequels.” 82%TrollhunterThe Monsters: Giant trolls!They Came From: The fjords of Norway. (Note: We’re not really sure whether that’s accurate, but this is probably the only chance we’ll have to use the phrase “the fjords of Norway” in a Total Recall, and we’re taking it.)Stomping Grounds: The Norwegian countryside.Approximate Size: Around 650 feet tall.Method of Mayhem: Smashing, stomping, et cetera.Who tried to stop it? A group of brave and/or stupid college students.The monsters are an allegory for… Playwright Henrik Ibsen used trolls to represent the dark side of humanity; here, they’re mostly an excuse for an awesome time at the movies.Forget about the pencil toppers with the funny hair: In the 2011 Norwegian import Trollhunter, the titular beasts are depicted as enormous, nasty-looking monsters who terrorize the countryside under cover of a government conspiracy. It’s a terrific premise, and one done right by writer-director André Ovredal’s decision to shoot mockumentary-style with handheld cameras and largely improvised dialogue; the end result is a movie that’s shot through with an appropriate level of creeping dread, but one that also benefits from generous helpings of dry wit. “The more you watch,” wrote Rob Vaux for Mania.com, “the more deeply its funky vibe works on you.”Take a look through the rest of our Total Recall archives.

But with no other new films opening in wide release, and with Halloween dampening ticket sales on Saturday, the Top 20 slumped to its lowest point of 2009 with just $83M.Sony scored its seventh top spot debut of the year with This Is It, a look at preparations the music superstar was making for his sold-out London concerts, which grossed an estimated $21.3M over the weekend and $32.5M over five days since its Wednesday launch. Worldwide, the Kenny Ortega-directed pic grossed an estimated $101M with 68% of the total coming from overseas markets where Jackson’s popularity has remained stronger over the years despite his many legal troubles. Domestically, This Is It averaged a solid $6,119 from 3,481 theaters over the Friday-to-Sunday span.The studio has reported that the Jackson pic has broken the all-time record for top-grossing concert film worldwide beating the $71.3M of last year’s Hannah Montana/Miley Cyrus 3D concert flick. But that’s not much of an achievement since very few concert films get wide releases in the first place and even fewer are given massive global launches like This Is It which unspooled on over 15,000 screens worldwide simultaneously. Montana bowed in North America on a Friday in just 683 3D locations (albeit with higher $15 tickets) and grossed $31.1M for a scorching $45,561 average on its way to a $65.3M domestic final representing a whopping 92% of its final global take. Its international release was much more limited.Still, for a documentary of any kind to open at number one is quite remarkable. This Is It was in a unique position as it entered the marketplace and was one of the most unpredictable films of the year at the box office. The weekend grosses did not measure up to pre-release forecasts that were published in media reports though. Some suggested the film could gross as much as $600M worldwide in its two-week run. But these numbers that were tossed around in news stories were utterly ridiculous and not plausible.[rtimage]MapID=1218058&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=1&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Causing further confusion for a film that could not truly be compared to any past box office hit were reports from online ticketing sites of the amount of showtimes that had sold out well before the opening day of the film. Fandango reported that over 1,000 shows were sold out on its site a full two weeks before the film opened and that its advance ticket sales were twice as strong as the Hannah concert’s, although no admissions or gross figures were revealed. Stats like these fueled media hype creating false expectations that were beyond realistic.Over 100 hours of rehearsal footage was bought by Sony for a hefty $60M with the studio also kicking in the cost of prints and advertising. From the worldwide income, it will recoup its costs first and then take a fee for its distribution services. Any remaining amount will be split 90/10 between the Jackson estate and concert promoter AEG.Outside of North America, This Is It grossed a stellar $68.5M from 97 overseas markets. Leading the way were Japan ($10.4M), the United Kingdom ($7.6M), Germany ($6.3M), France ($5.8M), Australia ($3.6M), and China ($3.2M) which together represented more than half of the overseas box office for the pic.As seen with other two-week runs, This Is It will now play beyond the initial limited period and will remain in theaters through Thanksgiving in the U.S. Other countries will also extend their runs soon. Disney used the ‘two-weeks-only’ stunt to promote the Hannah Montana concert film and this fall’s Toy Story double feature, only to extend both of those runs after they opened. The gimmick helps to create must-see-right-now buzz.Being a fan-driven film, This Is It is likely to see the bulk of its grosses upfront meaning it may not have very good legs in the weeks ahead. But with the global box office likely to surpass $200M and with additional revenue to come pouring in from DVD, TV, and other streams, Jackson’s big screen extravaganza looks to become a profitable venture for all involved.Paramount expanded its horror sensation Paranormal Activity for the fifth time going from 1,945 to 2,404 locations and ranked second for the weekend with an estimated $16.5M. Off only 22% on Halloween weekend, the R-rated overachiever raised its total to an incredible $84.8M and became the top-grossing horror film of 2009 – a stunning feat for a film that cost a mere $15,000 to produce. On Halloween Day it trailed This Is It by only $600,000 as it increased its gross from Friday by 10% while the Jackson doc fell 8%. Paranormal now looks certain to smash the $100M mark.Halloween falling on a Saturday made that day perform more like a Friday. The top ten films grossed $26.7M on Friday and inched up only 1% to $27M on Saturday. Usually the increase would be over 20% depending on the types of films that were out, but trick-or-treating and parties give people other options on the pumpkin day making it especially harmful to the multiplexes when it falls on Saturday, the busiest day of the week.[rtimage]MapID=1218012&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=5&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Jamie Foxx and Gerard Butler continued to be popular choices at the box office as their revenge thriller Law Abiding Citizen performed well for the third straight weekend. The Overture release took in an estimated $7.3M, falling 41%, and put its 17-day cume at a solid $51.4M. A $70M final could result.The lack of adult comedies helped Couples Retreat again as the Vince Vaughn vehicle declined by 43% and took fourth place with an estimated $6.1M. Universal has banked $86.7M to date and is heading for a $100M finish. Saw VI tumbled in its sophomore frame, but the drop was the smallest that the franchise has seen since Saw III. The latest torturefest plunged 61% to an estimated $5.6M giving Lionsgate $22.8M in ten days. Saw movies gross about 75-80% of their totals in the first ten days so Saw VI looks to end its run with roughly $30M which is less than what the last four installments all grossed in their opening weekends.[rtimage]MapID=1205735&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=13&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Tumbling 64% in its third weekend was Where the Wild Things Are with an estimated $5.1M for a $61.8M total in 17 days. The Warner Bros. kidpic was especially hurt by trick-or-treating on Halloween as Saturday sales slumped 13% from Friday. Sony’s The Stepfather followed with an estimated $3.4M, down 45%, for a cume of $24.7M.[rtimage]MapID=1205735&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=13&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Two films tied for eighth place with $3M each, according to estimates. Summit’s animated actioner Astro Boy fell a steep 55% in its sophomore frame and has collected a dismal $10.9M in its first ten days. Fox Searchlight expanded its Hillary Swank starrer Amelia from 818 to 1,070 theaters and saw sales dip only 23% putting the ten-day tally at $8.3M. The per-theater average of $2,804 was third best among all films in wide release. Rounding out the top ten was the fright flop Cirque Du Freak: The Vampire’s Assistant which dropped a sharp 55% to an estimated $2.8M. Universal has taken in only $10.5M to date.The top ten films grossed an estimated $74.1M which was up 7% from last year when High School Musical 3 stayed in the top spot with $15.3M; but down a hefty 37% from 2007 when American Gangster debuted at number one with $43.6M during the typically strong first weekend of November.Author: Gitesh Pandya, Box Office Guru!","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"Valentine's, Network, cancelled, 2015, Set, cancelled, New, Kimmy, transformers, fresh, CNN, Comic, scene","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-This-Is-It-Tops-Box-Office-Worldwide"},{"id":"47508703137777","title":"100 Best Movies on Hulu to Watch Right Now (May 2021)","content":"(Photo by Columbia/courtesy Everett Collection.

Some good Hulu movies include blockbusters (Bumblebee, Mission: Impossible – Fallout), funny comedy hits (Booksmart), and a few classics.&nbsp;Hulu’s scary movie offerings&nbsp;includes&nbsp;The Cabin in the Woods and A Quiet Place, and if you’re looking for kids movies to watch with the family, check out Chicken Run or Hot to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World. And, of course, we’ve got Hulu originals mixed up in there, like The Beatles: Eight Days a Week, and Palm Springs.We only included only movies that are Certified Fresh, and then ranked them by Tometometer. Even then, movies at the bottom of the list have pretty high Tomatometers, and it only goes up from there.

Nelson), some of Hollywood’s funniest fellows trying to touch one another without permission (Tag, starring&nbsp;Ed Helms,&nbsp;Jeremy Renner, and Jon Hamm), and a remade blast from the blaxploitation past (Superfly, starring Trevor Jackson&nbsp;and Jason Mitchell).&nbsp;What are the critics saying?Incredibles 2 (2018)  93%If you’re going to try and follow up an acclaimed blockbuster, you might as well take your time getting the sequel right — and in animation, where time can stand still forever, you have the added benefit of not needing to rush your cast back in front of the camera. Still, after waiting nearly 15 years for a second installment of The Incredibles, fans can be forgiven a certain amount of impatience; while the creative teams at formerly franchise-averse Pixar dreamed up new stories for the characters in Toy Story, Cars, Finding Nemo, and Monsters Inc., the ability to return to theaters continued to elude the superpowered Parr family. All that waiting has finally paid off with Incredibles 2, which reunites the original voice cast for a new adventure serving up more of the domestic turmoil, superhero satire, and brilliantly animated action that made the first one such a hit. It’d be tough to improve on the original Incredibles, and critics say that while this sequel doesn’t quite pull off that feat, it comes impressively close, adding yet another acclaimed entry to Pixar’s already estimable filmography. If you were a kid when The Incredibles&nbsp;came out, you might have kids of your own now — and like all the best stuff the studio has put out, the whole family can look forward to enjoying Incredibles 2.Tag (2018)  56%On one hand, it’s easy to believe Hollywood has long since exhausted most of the reasonable possibilities for comedy that exist in movies about grown men acting like boys. On the other, when you’ve got the Wall Street Journal writing about a real-life group of guys who take a month off every year to continue the game of tag they’ve been playing since they were kids, well, it’s awfully hard to resist the temptation to turn that into a film. Enter the descriptively titled Tag, starring Hannibal Buress, Jon Hamm, Ed Helms, Jake Johnson, and Jeremy Renner as the fellows in question — a talented bunch whose commitment to the story was reflected in the set injury Renner sustained, breaking both of his arms and necessitating some last-minute CGI limb replacements in post-production. It would be wonderful to report that Renner’s suffering came in service of one of the year’s best-reviewed action comedies; alas, the truth is that critics are kinda meh on Tag, which reviews describe as funny and engaging in fits and starts, but ultimately not consistent or committed enough to fully deliver on its premise. Still, this is one talented cast, and even the critical pans say the movie isn’t without its moments, so if you’re in the mood for some arrested development laughs, you may want to check your local listings.Superfly (2018)  51%Released in 1972, the original Superfly&nbsp;helped lead the blaxploitation wave with a thoughtful Harlem-set drama about a drug dealer looking for one last big score; the movie’s trappings may look somewhat dated today, but thanks to Ron O’Neal‘s performance as main character Youngblood Priest — not to mention a killer Curtis Mayfield soundtrack — it still feels fresh. It’s easy to understand why music video veteran Director X wanted to take a shot at updating the story, and its themes are just as relevant as they were more than 45 years ago; unfortunately, critics say those themes have mostly been lost in this new version, which is far more focused on style than substance. Starring Trevor Jackson as Priest, the 2018 edition moves the action to Atlanta, but the basic contours of the story remain the same — which is part of why a number of reviews have outlined pundits’ disappointment with the lost social subtext. This Superfly&nbsp;will make its fortune by and by, thanks to Director X’s way with an artfully arranged scene or set piece, but as is so often the case with remakes, the original still reigns supreme.What’s New on TVThe Bold Type: Season 2 (2018)  100%The Bold Type presents an aspirational yet refreshingly realistic portrait of young women’s careers, friendships and love lives in a big city.Strange Angel: Season 1 (2018)  71%A beautiful slow burn, Strange Angel shoots for the stars, but gets a little lost in its own orbit.Also&nbsp;Opening This Week In Limited Release Eating Animals (2018) , a documentary about the commercial factory farming industry and its various impacts, is at 100%.

I suppose that’s a rather generic introduction to a new column, but alas. Imagine something clever and insert it here, then, I guess. An introduction to the column is most definitely in order, however, so here it is, in neat order: each Friday, I will serve you up a dozen or so of the week’s most pertinent bits of movie development news, in my opinion, with as much commentary as I can muster, which is basically how I will pick the items.I know you really want to just get to the meat and potatoes of this column, so I won’t dwell too long on a further introduction to myself. In fact, if you want one, it’s down below, as a good bye of sorts instead of a hello. With that said, let’s get to this thing.This week’s column starts off with the answer to a question posed by one of last week’s big stories: whither The Wolf Man? Director Mark Romanek (One Hour Photo, starring Robin Williams), who had been shepherding the atmospheric remake of the Universal classic monster, recently separated ways with the project (he wanted more time for rewrites, the studio… not so much). So, Universal Pictures started courting nearly every director in Hollywood not currently working on something, it seemed, and the name that seemed to jump out of most of the lists that surfaced was one Brett Ratner, a director known for stepping in after other directors, but not necessarily, you know… being particularly good at it (watch the X-Men trilogy back-to-back, and I think you will get my drift). Good news came this week, however, that it is not Ratner, but director Joe Johnston who will start work very soon on finishing what Romanek nearly started on The Wolf Man. Joe Johnston has never really emerged as a “name director” that fans follow the way they do others (either positively or negatively), but the seven films he has directed in the last 20 years, which include Jumanji, Jurassic Park III and two greatly underrated movies (The Rocketeer and October Sky), are all solid and demonstrate an ability to deliver mainstream popcorn movie entertainment. One could interpret Johnston’s filmography as a negative, since his films don’t reflect the darkness that one might expect from a revival of The Wolf Man. However, he’s certainly got suspense chops, and much of the preproduction is already done (ie, a lot of that stuff that helps establish the “look and feel” of a movie anyway).JOSH BROLIN NEVER MET A GOVERNOR HE COULDN’T PLAYJust a few weeks after Oliver Stone announced his imminent plans to direct, for a release in the next several months, a Bush movie starring Josh Brolin (yes, Barbra’s stepson) as our current president (and the former governor of Texas), McG recently revealed he has plans for Brolin of his own, which involve another governor, sort of. The director, best known for the Charlie’s Angels movies, talked online recently (http://www.the213.net/php/article.php?id=977) about his plans for the awkwardly-titled Terminator Salvation: The Future Begins, which will star Christian Bale as John Connor, and stated his philosophy of how he wants to move the Terminator franchise past Arnold Schwarzenegger. Saying that a lot of today’s actors are “effeminate”, McG mentioned Josh Brolin as someone he’d like to work with as the Terminator of the 21st Century. As a rising star, Brolin is probably a lot cheaper than all those stars that McG thinks are such girly men stars, too.CONANAnother franchise that got its start with Arnold Schwarzenegger, but is being recast as it is revived (and re-imagined) for the 21st century is Conan, which by all reports will strive in future films to be closer to the original tales by Robert E. Howard, and less like… whatever the Schwarzenegger movies were. Usually, the news I’ve heard about Conan, as it has gone through a very long road over the course of the last several years is who might play the Cimmerian in question. The news this week, however, is a bit more related to the actual reality of the movie being made, which is namely that Lionsgate has worked a deal with the WGA to proceed with script development during the strike, and that they are continuing to meet with directors, with the most recent one apparently being none other than Rob Zombie. Zombie definitely has a handle on visceral violence, which the Conan stories are thick with, but he has not yet shown a knack for movies that are of a larger scope than low budget horror slashers. Of course, directors like Peter Jackson and Guillermo del Toro have gone down nearly the exact same path, with great effect, so maybe Rob Zombie really can pull it off. If nothing else, he’s certainly one of the coolest directors one can imagine for Conan. With word that the upcoming Age of Conan MMO, which this movie will undoubtedly be tied to, is ultra-violent and sex-filled (decaptiations and nudity being included), Lionsgate is probably looking to make a film that will be like the Saw of sword and sorcery movies. I have a feeling Rob Zombie would love doing just that.STAR WARS 7 IN 2008?Coming as quite a surprise out of left field, and definitely to be taken with a grain of salt, is the news via a British toy site that Star Wars may be returning to the big screen in 2008 as a 7th original story… an animated story, that is. The new animated series, Star Wars: The Clone Wars, has been known about for some time, but according to this latest story, there are plans to release the first three episode of the series in theaters first, in this coming September, and then continue the story on TV. The “but” to this story is that the site’s information appears to just concern the U.K. Now, it seems likely that if this plan is going to happen in England, it is probably going to happen in the USA too, but for now, that’s not confirmed. Check out http://www.starwars.com/theclonewars/ to see what the show, and potential movie, looks like.VENOMAnother movie rumor that is worth mentioning, but in my opinion, hopefully unfounded, is a report at IESB.net that Marvel is meeting with writers about a potential solo movie for Spider-Man villain, Venom, who made his big screen debut in the vastly disappointing Spider-Man 3. Venom is a character that is sort of like a generational divide for comics fans, and representational of the type of character that made its debut in the 1980s just in time to become popular in the early 1990s, when comic book quality is seen by many (like, say, me) to have hit its low, even as sales actually hit record highs. Venom is a big, monstrous “anti-hero” that has always screamed style over substance to me. Add in the fact that even with a huge budget and Sam Raimi at the rein, Venom’s big budget debut still didn’t do much for me, and it’s really hard to get very excited about an entire movie about the gooey black monster-as-hero.NEUROTIC TV COMEDIES TO FILM NEWSTwo movies were announced this week that are oddly coincidental to each other’s timing, given their shared roots in a certain type of TV comedy. First, there is word that the creative forces behind the cult favorite comedy series, Arrested Development has started development, which hopefully won’t become arrested (yes, a terrible turn of a phrase, but how could I resist?), on a big screen adaptation (or continuation, more likely) of the series known for its huge ensemble cast of eccentric characters. The other project that seems related, somehow, is the news that Woody Allen is finally ready to return to New York after a few movies abroad, for his next project, and he’s recruited the comedian who may be the root of the archetypal “neurotic Jew” as the type it’s been known on TV over the last two decades, whether it be in Seinfeld or Curb Your Enthusiasm, and that is of course, Larry David. Woody Allen directing a movie starring Larry David is almost like a “dream team”, if your sense of humor skews in a certain direction, but it just seems too good to be true, and possibly doomed, at the same time, somehow. Although he has an occasional film that works, it has been far too long since Woody Allen’s output was consistently great. But, if you are a Woody Allen fan, you cross your fingers every time the reviews for his next project start surfacing. I’d love to get a hilarious moviegoing experience from Larry David channeling Woody. Here’s to crossing those fingers.BIOPICS ABOUT PEOPLE KNOWN FOR LARGE WHITE EYEBALLSReally, how do movies get announced in the same week that have such wonderfully odd things in common? I’m pretty sure no one actually sets out to time these things this well. But, hey, it gives me a great story to end the column with. The two movies are both biopics about people famous for creations that had large white eyeballs. First, there is Big Eyes, an eccentric sounding look at the life of painter Margaret Keane, who will be played by Kate Hudson. Normally, my breadth of trivia is pretty wide, but I have to admit I didn’t know who Margaret Keane was, but it turns out her work is extremely famous. Remember those super-treacly paintings from the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s of women and children with super huge eyes (see her official site at http://www.keane-eyes.com for a reminder)? Perhaps not all of them were by Keane herself (her style easily imitated, I think), but it appears she definitely set the standard, such as it is. Personally, as with the large eyes seen in anime and manga, eyes that large sort of freak me out, but I can see the strange appeal somehow, too. Big Eyes will be directed by the writing team of Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski, who are well known for biopics about eccentric personalities like Ed Wood, The People vs Larry Flynt and Man in the Moon (Andy Kaufman), with filming possibly starting this coming June.And that other biopic involving large white eyeballs? I speak of Henson, about Jim Henson, the creator of the Muppets, many of whom, like Cookie Monster, had big white googly eyes. Hey, I take coincidental connections where I find them. A production company has announced plans to start filming possibly later this year, on a budget of $30 million, although they do not yet have a director or a star, and the screenwriter has only one low budget, relatively obscure feature (2005’s Come Away Home) to his credit thus far. Jim Henson is definitely a figure whose impact reached millions of people, especially of a certain generation (although obviously his characters continue to touch kids today), whether it be strictly as comedy (The Muppets) or his contribution to early education (Sesame Street). As CHUD.com points out, however, one problem with Jim Henson’s story, from a writing perspective, is that it’s hard to see where the drama and conflict comes from. So, one has to wonder if any attempt to dramatize his life is doomed to be (here’s that word again) treacly and lightweight. Of course, it would be very interesting to find out how Henson came up with some of his classic characters, but a documentary could probably do that just as well as a dramatic feature.YOU SAY GOODBYE, I SAY HELLOAh yes, so that’s the week as it was. I promised you a hello as a goodbye, and here it goes. My name’s Greg Dean Schmitz, and I got my start in movie news back in 1997 with a site called Upcomingmovies.com that tracked movie news, information and such, starting right around the time that sites like Ain’t it Cool News got their start. Things went well, and then I brought my “thing” to Yahoo! Movies in 2002, where my former site still resides as Greg’s Previews of Upcoming Movies. Between there and here, however, I had some medical problems that lasted a few years, which made maintaining the site as a one man operation simply impossible on a daily basis. So it became weekly, and then less than weekly, and then it stopped.The old site will be missed by me at least, but things have changed since 1997, and these days there is less of a need to keep up with doing 200 movie updates a week (thanks to sites like Wikipedia and the like). If I was born with a mutant ability, it was probably that I was ever able to do that. Well, somewhere along the line, I lost that power, and now I’m a mere mortal, but instead, I can give you the best of the week, here at Rotten Tomatoes, which I guess, to borrow the site’s metaphor, is to say that you will get the freshest of movie news in this column. My apologies if that isn’t a particularly fresh analogy.Greg Dean Schmitz, for Rotten Tomatoes","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"Hulu, 93rd, Out","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Weekly-Ketchup-Joe-Johnston-takes-on-The-Wolf-Man-and-Rob-Zombie-may-take-on-Conan"},{"id":"47508774894189","title":"Critics Consensus: Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters Not Screened — Guess the Tomatometer!","content":"Critics Consensusvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Incredibles 2 Is Certified FreshPlus, Tag is mildly entertaining and Superfly is more style than substance.by Jeff Giles | June 14, 2018 |  CommentsThis weekend at the movies,&nbsp;we have a belated sequel to a Pixar classic (Incredibles 2, featuring the voices of&nbsp;Holly Hunter&nbsp;and&nbsp;Craig T. Nelson), some of Hollywood’s funniest fellows trying to touch one another without permission (Tag, starring&nbsp;Ed Helms,&nbsp;Jeremy Renner, and Jon Hamm), and a remade blast from the blaxploitation past (Superfly, starring Trevor Jackson&nbsp;and Jason Mitchell).&nbsp;What are the critics saying?Incredibles 2 (2018)  93%If you’re going to try and follow up an acclaimed blockbuster, you might as well take your time getting the sequel right — and in animation, where time can stand still forever, you have the added benefit of not needing to rush your cast back in front of the camera. Still, after waiting nearly 15 years for a second installment of The Incredibles, fans can be forgiven a certain amount of impatience; while the creative teams at formerly franchise-averse Pixar dreamed up new stories for the characters in Toy Story, Cars, Finding Nemo, and Monsters Inc., the ability to return to theaters continued to elude the superpowered Parr family. All that waiting has finally paid off with Incredibles 2, which reunites the original voice cast for a new adventure serving up more of the domestic turmoil, superhero satire, and brilliantly animated action that made the first one such a hit. It’d be tough to improve on the original Incredibles, and critics say that while this sequel doesn’t quite pull off that feat, it comes impressively close, adding yet another acclaimed entry to Pixar’s already estimable filmography. If you were a kid when The Incredibles&nbsp;came out, you might have kids of your own now — and like all the best stuff the studio has put out, the whole family can look forward to enjoying Incredibles 2.Tag (2018)  56%On one hand, it’s easy to believe Hollywood has long since exhausted most of the reasonable possibilities for comedy that exist in movies about grown men acting like boys. On the other, when you’ve got the Wall Street Journal writing about a real-life group of guys who take a month off every year to continue the game of tag they’ve been playing since they were kids, well, it’s awfully hard to resist the temptation to turn that into a film. Enter the descriptively titled Tag, starring Hannibal Buress, Jon Hamm, Ed Helms, Jake Johnson, and Jeremy Renner as the fellows in question — a talented bunch whose commitment to the story was reflected in the set injury Renner sustained, breaking both of his arms and necessitating some last-minute CGI limb replacements in post-production. It would be wonderful to report that Renner’s suffering came in service of one of the year’s best-reviewed action comedies; alas, the truth is that critics are kinda meh on Tag, which reviews describe as funny and engaging in fits and starts, but ultimately not consistent or committed enough to fully deliver on its premise. Still, this is one talented cast, and even the critical pans say the movie isn’t without its moments, so if you’re in the mood for some arrested development laughs, you may want to check your local listings.Superfly (2018)  51%Released in 1972, the original Superfly&nbsp;helped lead the blaxploitation wave with a thoughtful Harlem-set drama about a drug dealer looking for one last big score; the movie’s trappings may look somewhat dated today, but thanks to Ron O’Neal‘s performance as main character Youngblood Priest — not to mention a killer Curtis Mayfield soundtrack — it still feels fresh. It’s easy to understand why music video veteran Director X wanted to take a shot at updating the story, and its themes are just as relevant as they were more than 45 years ago; unfortunately, critics say those themes have mostly been lost in this new version, which is far more focused on style than substance. Starring Trevor Jackson as Priest, the 2018 edition moves the action to Atlanta, but the basic contours of the story remain the same — which is part of why a number of reviews have outlined pundits’ disappointment with the lost social subtext. This Superfly&nbsp;will make its fortune by and by, thanks to Director X’s way with an artfully arranged scene or set piece, but as is so often the case with remakes, the original still reigns supreme.What’s New on TVThe Bold Type: Season 2 (2018)  100%The Bold Type presents an aspirational yet refreshingly realistic portrait of young women’s careers, friendships and love lives in a big city.Strange Angel: Season 1 (2018)  71%A beautiful slow burn, Strange Angel shoots for the stars, but gets a little lost in its own orbit.Also&nbsp;Opening This Week In Limited Release Eating Animals (2018) , a documentary about the commercial factory farming industry and its various impacts, is at 100%.

In more than twenty years of screen acting he’s defined himself as a hard-working, engaging talent.His latest film, Surveillance, opens in UK cinemas this week. Directed by Jennifer Lynch, it casts Pullman as one of a pair of FBI agents (with Julia Ormond) tracking down the culprit of a grisly collection of seemingly unpremeditated murders. With a fine ensemble cast it’s an original crime thriller; only Lynch’s second film since her 1993 debut Boxing Helena. It will open in the US on 26th June.Of his five favourite films, Pullman says his choices depend on mood and context. “I always feel like there are a lot of different types of favourites,” he tells RT. “there are some that I look to for interesting things, some that I look to for acting things, others that I watch again and again. I don’t know if this is in any sort of order!”Lawrence of Arabia“This is always the first choice when people say they have a new television set or home cinema system and they want to watch a great visual movie.

It’s such a ‘film’ film. It wasn’t required viewing, it was just a film playing on campus and I hadn’t been interested in film before then. Nowadays people are deciding to get into film at age five when they’re sitting, watching the Oscars. I really didn’t come out of that culture — I was pretty much a John Wayne fan and that was it. Zabriskie Point was a time when I was in a lot of change and flux and these incredible visuals hit me like they had rearranged the organs in my body. The ending and the free-floating debris and everything is an image that burned itself in my consciousness.”Click on a thumbnail below.Lawrence of ArabiaThe SearchersZabriskie PointAmerica, AmericaScenes from a MarriageAmerica, America“It’s a little bit of a Slumdog movie in a way of somebody coming from incredibly unlikely beginnings and climbing through a lot of incredibly hard challenges to get somewhere.

But Hollywood has a rich history of telling stories on and about trains, almost from the very beginning, so we thought it would make sense to take a look back at the best train movies to grace the silver screen.The Great Train Robbery (1903, 100%)One of the most influential films from the silent era, Edwin S. Porter’s 12-minute Western is widely considered one of the first action films ever made.The General (1927, 93%)Critics Consensus: Brilliantly filmed and fueled with classic physical comedy, The General captures Buster Keaton at his timeless best.Shanghai Express (1932, 100%)Marlene Dietrich, Anna May Wong, and Clive Brook star in Josef von Sternberg’s romantic thriller about an old flame that reignites between passengers aboard a Chinese train during a time of civil unrest. Shanghai Express was the highest grossing film in the US in 1932.Twentieth Century (1934, 88%)John Barrymore and Carole Lombard star in Howard Hawks’ classic romantic comedy about a struggling film producer who attempts to win back the actress he helped make into a star. This film not only helped popularize the screwball comedy but also turned its own lead actress, Lombard, into a star herself.The Lady Vanishes (1938, 98%)Critics Consensus: One of Alfred Hitchcock’s last British films, this glamorous thriller provides an early glimpse of the director at his most stylishly entertaining.Night Train to Munich (1940, 93%)Carol Reed’s taut espionage thriller stars Margaret Lockwood as a Nazi prisoner of war and Rex Harrison as the British Intelligence officer who attempts to infiltrate Berlin undercover to save her and her scientist father.Brief Encounter (1945, 89%)This David Lean masterpiece, written by Noël Coward and based on his own play, charts the forbidden romance between a man and woman, both married, that develops from a chance encounter at a railway station.Strangers on a Train (1951, 98%)Critics Consensus: A provocative premise and inventive set design lights the way for Hitchcock’s diabolically entertaining masterpiece.The Narrow Margin (1952, 100%)Charles McGraw, Marie Windsor, and Jacqueline White star in this twisty, Academy Award-nominated noir about an LAPD detective who squares off with gangsters aboard a train as he escorts a mob widow from Chicago back to Los Angeles to testify in court. It was less successfully remade in 1990 with Gene Hackman and Anne Archer.The Train (1965, 100%)This World War II spy thriller from John Frankenheimer centers on a French railway inspector (Burt Lancaster) who is convinced by a museum curator (Suzanne Flon) to sabotage the train that a Nazi colonel (Paul Scofield) plans to use to transport priceless art back to Germany.Von Ryan’s Express (1965, 89%)The same year The Train came out, Frank Sinatra and Trevor Howard also starred in a World War II thriller set aboard a train, playing a pair of Allied prisoners who escape an Italian war camp and hijack a train to hightail it to Switzerland.Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969, 89%)Critics Consensus: With its iconic pairing of Paul Newman and Robert Redford, jaunty screenplay and Burt Bacharach score, Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid has gone down as among the defining moments in late-’60s American cinema.Murder on the Orient Express (1974, 96%)Of course, this list wouldn’t be complete without a mention of the first adaptation of Agatha Christie’s novel, which stars Albert Finney as brilliant detective Hercule Poirot and features a sparkling supporting cast that includes Ingrid Bergman, Lauren Bacall, Sean Connery, Anthony Perkins, Vanessa Redgrave, and John Gielgud, among others.The Taking of Pelham One Two Three (1974, 100%)Critics Consensus: Breezy, thrilling, and quite funny, The Taking of Pelham One Two Three sees Walter Matthau and Robert Shaw pitted against each other in effortlessly high form.Silver Streak (1976, 83%)Richard Pryor and Gene Wilder first paired up on the big screen for this comedy thriller about a book editor who teams up with a thief to clear his name when a prominent art historian is murdered on his train. Pryor and Wilder would go on to make three more films together, but none of them was as well received as their debut collaboration.Runaway Train (1985, 87%)Jon Voight and Eric Roberts were both nominated for Academy Awards for their work in this tense thriller about a pair of prison escapees who make a quick getaway on a speeding train, only to discover its engineer is dead, and it’s barreling towards derailment. Fun fact: legendary Japanese director Akira Kurosawa penned the original script, which was shelved for a decade and a half due to financing difficulties.Back to the Future Part Three (1974, 100%)It doesn’t take place entirely on a train, but a train does figure importantly in the film’s plot, as Doc Brown (Christopher Lloyd) and Marty (Michael J. Fox) have no other means to get their DeLorean up to 88mph. Part Three isn’t quite as beloved as its two predecessors, but it marks a satisfying end to one of the 1980s’ most enduring trilogies.Kontroll (2005, 82%)Hungarian-American writer-director Nimród Antal’s debut behind the camera is this smart, gritty, and funny comedy thriller following Budapest transit officials as they deal with customers and a possible killer on the loose.Transsiberian (2008, 93%)Critics Consensus: Traditional in form yet effective in execution, this taut thriller updates the “danger on a train” scenario with atmospheric sense.The Midnight Meat Train (2008, 72%)Critics Consensus: A creative and energetic adaptation of a Clive Barker short story, with enough scares and thrills to be a potential cult classic.Unstoppable (2010, 86%)Critics Consensus: As fast, loud, and relentless as the train at the center of the story, Unstoppable is perfect popcorn entertainment — and director Tony Scott’s best movie in years.Source Code (2011, 91%)Critics Consensus: Finding the human story amidst the action, director Duncan Jones and charming Jake Gyllenhaal craft a smart, satisfying sci-fi thriller.Snowpiercer (2014, 95%)Critics Consensus: Snowpiercer offers an audaciously ambitious action spectacular for filmgoers numb to effects-driven blockbusters.Train to Busan (2016, 95%)Critics Consensus: Train to Busan delivers a thrillingly unique — and purely entertaining — take on the zombie genre, with fully realized characters and plenty of social commentary to underscore the bursts of skillfully staged action.","section":"24 Frames","tags":"Awards, USA, Studios, movies, Out, science, TV, sequel, Marvel, drama, Superheroe, Cinematographers, Rocky, on, song","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/07233138/Train-Movies-24-Frames.jpg","slug":"24-greatest-train-movies"},{"id":"47508631087445","title":"Every Stop-Motion Movie Tomatometer From Best to Worst","content":"(Photo by Focus Features/Courtesy Everett Collection. Thumbnail: DreamWorks SKG, Buena Vista Pictures, Fox Searchlight, Paramount Pictures/Courtesy Everett Collection)30 Best Stop-Motion Animated Movies of All TimeTangible and physical, stop-motion animation is the art of manipulating objects and figures frame by frame, creating the illusion of fluid movement. It’s an almost atavistic art form of ours: Instinct tells us if you have a lump of clay in your hands, start making stuff out of it. Shape a chicken and a fox, mold some pirates, heck, make a movie. It’s what filmmakers have been doing for over a century, so we’re taking a look through time with the 30 best stop-motion animated movies ever made.In this guide, we’ll come in contact with the different materials and styles used in stop motion. Clay has led to the creation of one of animation’s most enduring man-and-canine duos, Wallace and Gromit, created by Nick Park. His films and studio, Aardman, have an outsized presence in that scene, with the likes of Chicken Run and Shaun the Sheep. Paper cutout stop-motion animation is less frequently used. See it at its trippy best with Fantastic Planet, and in The Adventures of Prince Achmed, the oldest surviving animated film.Puppet stop-motion animation has been the preferred method for venerable directors like Tim Burton (producer of The Nightmare Before Christmas), Charlie Kaufman (Anomalisa), and Wes Anderson (Fantastic Mr. Fox). Anderson collaborated with Nightmare-director Henry Selick to animate the marine fauna in The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou; afterwards, Selick set up shop at studio Laika, where he gave them their first big hit, Coraline. Laika has been a stop-motion powerhouse since, using a cutting-edge mix of puppets, clay, and computer enhancements to fuel a string of Certified Fresh films, including The Boxtrolls and Kubo and the Two Strings.We included only movies where stop motion is a majority of the presentation, which opened the way for James and the Giant Peach and Jan Švankmajer’s twisted Alice. So while we adore the individual creature effects by Ray Harryhausen in Jason and the Argonauts and the Sinbad movies, or ED-209 in RoboCop, and even the aforementioned Life Aquatic, you won’t be seeing them here. After we collected the 30 highest-rated movies, we sorted the list by Adjusted Tomatometer, which accounts for the movie’s number of reviews and release year.Now, read on to discover the 30 best stop-motion animated movies!#30Consuming Spirits (2012) 89%#30Adjusted Score: 67.021% Critics Consensus: No consensus yet.Synopsis: Christopher Sullivan's animated dystopia is about as far from a cartoon-for-kids as they come.

For Steve, all it takes is a few tokes and a killer soundtrack to get ready for anything life throws at him.American Pie (1999, 60%)Who else but Jim’s dad treated teenage pie-diddling with such understanding and empathy?Road to Perdition (2002, 81%)Tom Hanks’ Michael Sullivan has made a living off of being a mob strongman, a brutal fate he steers his son away from.Bicycle Thieves (1949, 98%)A bleak masterwork of Italian neorealism, saddling the viewer with a man who searches for work and dignity with his son in tow.Boyhood (2014, 98%)Fatherhood, just like boyhood, is a multi-year commitment, and it’s a mini-revelation seeing Ethan Hawke’s lackadaisical dad character emerge as a stand-up dude.Midnight Special (2016, 83%)Michael Shannon is on the run when the government learns his kid has mysterious kinetic powers. Shannon gets a cool line: “I’ll always worry about you. That’s the deal.”Finding Nemo (2003, 99%)Notice how a parent always dies in a Disney animated movie? Pixar upped their game by wiping out an entire unborn brood, sending a worrywart clown fish (Albert Brooks) on a cross-ocean trip for his last remaining son.Kramer vs Kramer (1979, 88%)Dustin Hoffman cracks eggs and jokes, and goes a little cracked himself as he struggles to keep up his custodial end after an acrimonious divorce.The Pursuit of Happyness (2006, 67%)Will Smith earned an Oscar nomination for his heartbreaking performance as a homeless man going from job interview to job interview while imparting life lessons upon his son.Paper Moon (1973, 91%)Grifting across the nation during the Great Depression: Daddy-daughter combos really do have the most fun.The Road (2009, 75%)It can’t be for nothing: Viggo Mortensen plays the unnamed hero who guards his kid from all manner of danger in the post-apocalypse.My Life (1993, 44%)You wanna get sappy?

And you know what he did…?”Father of the Bride (1950, 93%)Spencer Tracy in a screwball classic, but, honestly, you can’t go wrong either with the 1991 Steve Martin edition.Despicable Me (2010, 81%)Because not all fathers are blood, just like not all fathers have high-tech weaponry and gadgets of destruction tucked away in the tool shed.Boyz n the Hood (1991, 96%)Furious Styles: A character with a performance so good, Laurence Fishburne finally got Hollywood to stop calling him Larry in the credits.Taken (2009, 58%)Okay, if your daughter and wife get kidnapped that often, maaaaybe you’re a bad father.","section":"24 Frames","tags":"Britbox, Baby, RT, Discovery, 2020, Star","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/15180736/600IndianaJones.jpg","slug":"24-best-movie-fathers"},{"id":"47508637234582","title":"24 Favorite TV Doctors","content":"24 Framesgoogletag.cmd.push(function(){googletag.unitIds.push(\"article_sponsorship_ad\"),googletag.defineSlot(\"/55153744/rottentomatoes/article/sponsorship\",[[150,80]],\"article_sponsorship_ad\").addService(googletag.pubads())})24 Favorite TV Doctorsby Alex Vo | October 20, 2016 |  CommentsAfter a detour into the dark world of arms dealing for AMC’s&nbsp;excellent The Night Manager, Hugh Laurie is back with a medical degree — to the delight of&nbsp;House fans everywhere. Except this time, he’s playing for thrills in Hulu original Chance, based on the acclaimed novel by Kem Nunn&nbsp;and now available on the streaming service. In honor of the new release, let’s review&nbsp;some of our favorite doctors from TV history.Gregory House from House (2004-12)One of the first on the scene of our current addiction to star misanthropes and anti-heroes, House tackled unsual diseases via subtle observation and unconventional practice. The bloodier the orifice, the better for this guy!Doogie Howser from Doogie Howser, M.D. (1989-93)Precocious to say the least, Doogie (Neil Patrick Harris) graduated from Princeton in 1983 at age 10, started medical residency at 15, left the hospital four years later and resurfaced in 2008 to steal John Cho’s car.Michaela “Mike” Quinn from Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman (1993-98)Giving desperate housewives something to do on Saturday evenings, Dr. Quinn (starring Jane Seymour) demonstrated the tenacous American spirit as a frontierswoman who sets up a practice in the wild west.Benjamin “Hawkeye” Franklin Pierce from M*A*S*H (1972-83)Alan Alda played Korean War Army doctor “Hawkeye” Pierce for 11 seasons on M*A*S*H, who behind his sad eyes imbued the character with weary cynisim, quick wit, and empathy.Dr. John Thackery from The Knick (2014-2015) Clive Owen brought the drug-addled doctor to life in director Steven Soderbergh’s early 1900s–set medical drama, which saw two seasons on Cinemax.Trapper John McIntyre from Trapper John, M.D. (1979-86)M*A*S*H has a few spinoffs, the most (only) successful one following Trapper John to his own private medical practice in San Francisco. Pernell Roberts played the affable character in this series, which is noted for its more dramatic writing compared to the previous incarnations of this universe.Doug Ross from ER (1994-2009)ER was the longest-running medical drama in American history, catapaulting many of its actors into stardom, including George Clooney, who played the womanizng but highly generous and ethical Doug Ross.John Carter from ER (1994-2009)John Carter of Chicago was played by Noah Wyle, who was there the longest of the original cast. Carter is compassionate but green at the beginning of the show, making his arc the most accessible for viewers.Meredith Grey from Grey’s Anatomy (2005-present)A forerunner in taking the longest-running medical drama crown away from ER, Grey’s Anatomy has starred Ellen Pompeo for the last 12 seasons as the eponymous Meredith Grey, an ambitious doctor initially living in the shadow of her world-renowned surgeon mother.Derek Shepherd from Grey’s Anatomy (2005-present)The relationship between Grey and hot doc Derek Shepherd aka McDreamy (Patrick Dempsey) is one of the critical highlights of the show, though certain recent events in season 11 have put the kibosh on that.Mark Sloan from Grey’s Anatomy (2005-present)Continuing our “Hot Docs” series, here’s Mark Sloan aka McSteamy (Eric Dane) whose friendship with McDreamy was once the most preeminent medical bromance on TV (outside of J.D. and Turk on Scrubs).Mark Sloan from Diagnosis: Murder (1993-2001)Turns out if your name’s Mark Sloan, you ought to pursue a career in this field. This Dr. Mark Sloan is played by Dick Van Dyke, who would help his police officer son solve cases outside the hospital.Leo Spaceman from 30 Rock (2006-13)Chris Parnell uses his indoor authoratative voice to dispense all sorts of medical quackery as Dr. Spaceman, whose lack of ethics is matched only by his nonexistent professional knowledge.Beverly Crusher from Star Trek: The Next Generation (1987-94)Crusher was the chief medical officer aboard the starship Enterprise and harbored a not-so-secret infatuation with Captain Picard. Actress Gates McFadden was fired after the first season, but came back for season three with the writers subsequently giving more depth to her character. Beverly: crushing it since 1987.Leonard McCoy from Star Trek (1966-69)The original medical officer of the Enterprise, Bones is an old-fashioned feller who gave the world a great catchphrase: “I’m a doctor, not a!”James Kildare from Dr. Kildare (1961-66)Emulating the template of MGM’s Kildare movies of the ’30s and ’40s, Dr. Kildare starred Richard Chamberlain starred as the titular intern working his way up the medical chain and improving the lives of his patients both inside and outside the hospital.Nick Riviera from The Simpsons (1989-present)Hi, everybody! Here’s Hollywood Upstairs Medical College’s most famous alumni Dr. Nick, a man whose hilarious incompetence often leaves a pile of bodies for the coroner to deal with.Julius Hibbert from The Simpsons (1989-present)Though that’s not to say Springfield’s other doctor is perfect. The Simpsons’ longtime family physician, Dr. Hibbert, is trusted in the community but shows occasional flashes of derangment, like subtly offering to sell baby Maggie on the black market for $60,000.John E. Zoidberg from Futurama (1999-2013)By far the most accurate portrayal of a doctor in this gallery, Zoidberg is a hiedous upright crustacean that is poor, eats garbage, and usually lives in the streets. Need someone to maim you due to his lack of understanding in human anatomy? Why not Zoidberg?Marcus Welby from Marcus Welby, M.D. (1969-76)Starring Robert Young as the title doctor, Marcus Welby came out at the tail end of the hippie era and dealt with once taboo subjects like homosexuality and STDs with medical acumen.R. Quincy from Quincy, M.E. (1976-83)Jack Klugman was Dr. Quincy, whose emphasis on forensic pathology would pave the way for future shows like CSI and Bones.Phillip Chandler from St. Elsewhere (1982-87)Denzel Washington was there for every episode of St. Elsewhere as Philip Chandler, a highly ethical but stiff and uptight doctor.Jill Brock from Picket Fences (1992-96)Picket Fences was a police show set in the quirky town of Rome, Wisconsin with a habit for quirky deaths. Kathy Baker, as the warm and friendly Jill, also played wife to main cop Jimmy (Tom Skeritt).The Literal Doctor from Arrested Development (2003-13)Dr. Wordsmith aka the Literal Doctor had a penchant for turning phrases on their heads, and delivering good news as bad and bad news as good to the Bluth family, frequent visitors to his hospital.","section":"24 Frames","tags":"green, drama, kong, psycho, Turner, finale, Toys, TV, documentary, Carpet, Writers, Book","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/20162133/chance_hugh-laurie-600x262.jpg","slug":"24-favorite-tv-doctors"},{"id":"47508637231509","title":"The Club Is Open: 27 Certified Fresh Rock Documentaries","content":"24 Framesgoogletag.cmd.push(function(){googletag.unitIds.push(\"article_sponsorship_ad\"),googletag.defineSlot(\"/55153744/rottentomatoes/article/sponsorship\",[[150,80]],\"article_sponsorship_ad\").addService(googletag.pubads())})The Club Is Open: 27 Certified Fresh Rock Documentariesby RT Staff | October 25, 2016 |  CommentsFor those about to doc, we salute you! Because this week you’ll be joining the king of merciless cool, director Jim Jarmusch, whose new documentary Gimme Danger&nbsp;captures the raw power and influence of Iggy Pop and the Stooges.

These movies serve&nbsp;as the inspiration for this week’s&nbsp;24 Frames: Certified Fresh rock documentaries…and remember, a gallery like this goes to 11 (and by 11, we mean 27).Kurt Cobain: Montage of Heck (2015, 98%)Critics Consensus: Makes a persuasive case for its subject without resorting to hagiography — and includes plenty of rare and unreleased footage for fans.The Punk Singer (2013, 89%)Critics Consensus: It verges on hagiography, but given the deeply compelling nature of its subject’s story, The Punk Singer can be forgiven its lack of objectivity.The Filth and the Fury (2000, 95%)Critics Consensus: A complete and completely unabashed look at The Sex Pistols, shot in suitably propulsive punk fashion.The Last Waltz (1978, 98%)Critics Consensus: Among one of, if not the best rock movie ever made, The Last Waltz is a revealing, electrifying view of The Band at their height.Janis: Little Girl Blue (2015, 93%)Critics Consensus: Inquisitive without being intrusive, LGB offers an insightful glimpse into the life of a rock ‘n’ roll legend, Janis Joplin.A Band Called Death (2013, 94%)Critics Consensus: Not only a fascinating portrait of a pioneering rock group, but also a tribute to family ties and perseverance in the face of hardship.It Might Get Loud (2009, 80%)Critics Consensus: An affectionate tribute to rock’s most distinctive instrument (the electric guitar), IMGL is insightful and musically satisfying.Shine a Light (2008, 87%)Critics Consensus: It may offer little new for fans, but Martin Scorsese’s document of the Rolling Stones’ electrifying live show should provide satisfaction to audiences.The Beatles: Eight Days a Week – The Touring Years (2016, 95%)Critics Consensus: We love them, yeah, yeah, yeah — and with archival footage like that, you know The Beatles: Eight Days a Week – The Touring Years can’t be bad.The Wrecking Crew (2015, 94%)Critics Consensus: May not achieve the greatness of the many classic songs its subjects helped bring to life, but it remains a heartfelt, overdue tribute to overshadowed brilliance.The U.S. vs. John Lennon (2006, 77%)Critics Consensus: Though it glosses over anything negative about Lennon, this documentary offers a lot of fascinating archival footage, plus its political issues still have relevance for today.Sound City (2013, 100%)Critics Consensus: Smart, affectionate, and unabashedly sincere, Sound City pairs a great soundtrack with a well-argued ode to one of rock ‘n’ roll’s most fondly remembered bygone eras.Muscle Shoals (2013, 96%)Critics Consensus: Essential for soul fans and entertaining for novices, Muscle Shoals offers a compelling, warts-and-all glimpse at one of the most fascinating stories in modern American music.20,000 Days on Earth (2014, 95%)Critics Consensus: Revealing yet respectful, 20kDoE is essential viewing for any Nick Cave fan.Anvil! The Story of Anvil (2009, 98%)Critics Consensus: A touching, uplifting and inspirational rockumentary about an aging metal band, both hilarious and heart-warming in equal measure.Metallica: Some Kind of Monster (2004, 89%)Critics Consensus: Fascinating behind-the-scenes look at how Metallica survived one of their more turbulent periods.I Am Trying To Break Your Heart (2002, 88%)Critics Consensus: Besides being a treat for Wilco fans, IaTtBYH also exposes the workings of a profit-driven music industry.American Hardcore (2006, 72%)Critics Consensus: An informative and highly entertaining look at the heyday of punk in the early 1980s.The Devil and Daniel Johnston (2006, 89%)Critics Consensus: Whether you think this mentally ill cult musician is worthy of being called a “genius,” this document of his life is crafted with sincere respect and is fascinating to watch.Lightning in a Bottle (2004, 87%)Critics Consensus: Pays dazzling tribute to the blues by capturing its power and excitement through backstage interviews and performance footage.Dig! (2004, 90%)Critics Consensus: Compellingly chronicles the ups and downs of the Dandy Warhols and the Brian Jonestown Massacre, two ambitious bands whose love/hate relationship embodies many of the potential pratfalls of the music business.Eat That Question: Frank Zappa in His Own Words (2016, 91%)Critics Consensus: An illuminating primer for Zappa novices as well as an entertaining retrospective for diehard fans.Everyday Sunshine: The Story of Fishbone (2011, 100%)Critics Consensus: An entertaining, heartwarming, and balanced documentary about the influential Los Angeles band, Fishbone.Joe Strummer: The Future Is Unwritten (2007, 89%)Critics Consensus: Succeeds as both an engrossing documentary and a comprehensive examination of one of music’s most legendary figures.Lambert &amp; Stamp (2015, 87%)Critics Consensus: A sharp accounting of an era framed through the early adventures of the Who and the managers who helped make them famous.Searching for Sugar Man (2012, 94%)Critics Consensus: A fascinating portrait of a forgotten musical pioneer, Searching for Sugar Man is by turns informative and mysterious.Air Guitar Nation (2006, 85%)Critics Consensus: It’s up for debate how serious or ironic its subjects are, but Air Guitar Nation is nonetheless a funny and exciting documentary with a killer soundtrack.","section":"24 Frames","tags":"Network, technology, Interview, hispanic, CNN","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/25161048/600RockDocs.jpg","slug":"the-club-is-open-27-certified-fresh-rock-documentaries"},{"id":"47508640513455","title":"24 Certified Fresh Live-Action Disney Movies","content":"24 Framesgoogletag.cmd.push(function(){googletag.unitIds.push(\"article_sponsorship_ad\"),googletag.defineSlot(\"/55153744/rottentomatoes/article/sponsorship\",[[150,80]],\"article_sponsorship_ad\").addService(googletag.pubads())})24 Certified Fresh Live-Action Disney Moviesby Alex Vo | April 12, 2016 |  CommentsInspired by Disney’s reimagining of The Jungle Book, get ready to set your heart cockles to “warmed” because here comes 24 Certified Fresh live-action Disney movies!Mary PoppinsYear: 1964Tomatometer: 100%Critics consensus: “A lavish modern fairy tale celebrated for its amazing special effects, catchy songs, and Julie Andrews’s legendary performance in the title role.”The Santa ClauseYear: 1994Tomatometer: 75%Critics consensus: “The Santa Clause is utterly undemanding, but it’s firmly rooted in the sort of good old-fashioned holiday spirit missing from too many modern yuletide films.”James and the Giant PeachYear: 1996Tomatometer: 93%Critics consensus: “The arresting and dynamic visuals, offbeat details and light-as-air storytelling make James and the Giant Peach solid family entertainment.”The Parent TrapYear: 1998Tomatometer: 86%Critics consensus: “Writer-director Nancy Meyers takes the winning formula of the 1961 original and gives it an amiable modern spin, while young star Lindsay Lohan shines in her breakout role.”The Straight StoryYear: 1999Tomatometer: 96%Critics consensus: “Slow-paced but heart-warming.”The RookieYear: 2002Tomatometer: 83%Critics consensus: “A heart-warming sports flick, The Rookie greatly benefits from understated direction and the emotional honesty Dennis Quaid brings to the role of Jim Morris.”Freaky FridayYear: 2003Tomatometer: 88%Critics consensus: “Jamie Lee Curtis and Lindsay Lohan charm in Mark Waters’ nicely pitched — and Disney’s second — remake of the 1976 hit.”HolesYear: 2003Tomatometer: 77%Critics consensus: “Faithful to its literary source, this is imaginative, intelligent family entertainment.”Ghosts of the AbyssYear: 2003Tomatometer: 80%Critics consensus: “The underwater footage is both beautiful and awe-inspiring.”MiracleYear: 2004Tomatometer: 80%Critics consensus: “Kurt Russell’s performance guides this cliche-ridden tale into the realm of inspirational, nostalgic goodness.”Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black PearlYear: 2003Tomatometer: 79%Critics consensus: “May leave you exhausted like the theme park ride that inspired it;

Kung Fu Panda 3&nbsp;inspires this week’s 24 Frames gallery, in which we explore the nearly two-decade history of DreamWorks Animation.AntzYear: 1998Tomatometer: 96%DreamWorks (founded by Steven Spielberg, David Geffen, and Jeffrey Katzenberg) partnered with Pacific Data Images to produce their debut animated feature: Antz. The movie, featuring the voices of Woody Allen and Sylvester Stallone, came out within months of similar A Bug’s Life, establishing the “rivalry” between DreamWorks and Pixar out of the gate.The Prince of EgyptYear: 1998Tomatometer: 79%DreamWorks produced a quartet of traditionally animated films: this, Road to El Dorado, Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron, and Sinbad: Legend of the Seven Seas. Egypt was successful enough to get a DVD-sequel but, as Disney also learned, this type of animation was no longer profitable by the early 2000s and abandoned these projects after 2003.Chicken RunYear: 2000Tomatometer: 97%DreamWorks co-financed Aardman’s first theatrical film, Chicken Run. The film was directed by Nick Park, the stop-motion darling who won several Oscars for his series of Wallace &amp; Gromit shorts throughout the ’90s.ShrekYear: 2001Tomatometer: 88%With its mix of pop culture savvy and slightly rude humor, fairy tale parody Shrek established the DreamWorks “identity” and gave the studio its first franchise player. The film also took home the inaugural Best Animated Feature Oscar.Shrek 2Year: 2004Tomatometer: 88%Breaking the rule that animation sequels don’t have to be worse than their predecessors, Shrek 2 got equally good reviews and broke the box office: it doubled what Shrek made by approaching $1 billion gross worldwide. The success of the movie formally established DreamWorks Animation as its own operating entity.Shark TaleYear: 2004Tomatometer: 35%DreamWorks’ first Rotten movie of the CG era, Shark Tale played into the rising trend of stunt casting celebrities as voices by modelling its character faces after stars like Will Smith and Martin Scorsese.MadagascarYear: 2005Tomatometer: 55%DreamWorks found its second franchise with Madagascar. Though slightly Rotten, the movie cost half of what Shrek 2 took to make and made over $500 million global.Wallace &amp; Gromit: Curse of the Were-RabbitYear: 2005Tomatometer: 95%The partnership between Aardman continued with their first feature-length Wallace &amp; Gromit adventure, which would also become the first (and only) stop-motion picture to win the Best Animated Feature Oscar. US box office was a disappointment ($56 million) but did well internationally, where the haplessly heroic duo had more popularity anyways.Flushed AwayYear: 2006Tomatometer: 72%The Aardman/DreamWorks partnership fell apart with Flushed Away, the story of a posh rat who gets sent into the sewers, once again stoking the rivalry with Pixar who were readying Ratatouille at the time. As Aardman’s first computer animated film, it cost $150 million to make and failed to make that back after considering marketing and promotion.Bee MovieYear: 2007Tomatometer: 51%After the very British Flushed Away, DreamWorks looked to American comic institution Jerry Seinfeld for this movie about a litigious bee who sues humans over honey consumption.Kung Fu PandaYear: 2008Tomatometer: 87%After the rocky box office performances of their last few movies, DW Animation breathed a sigh of relief with Kung Fu Panda, the first in the Certified Fresh series known for its stunning action sequences and lively vocal performances.Monsters vs. AliensYear: 2009Tomatometer: 72%DreamWorks goes to B-movie town with this monster mash-up of ’50s Hollywood sci-fi tropes.How to Train Your DragonYear: 2010Tomatometer: 98%The studio got the highest critical marks of its existence with this adaptation of the Cressida Crowell children’s books. Audiences were wowed by the 3D flying sequences and the story’s surprising emotional heft and, after grossing $500 million worldwide, it was a no-brainer to fast track a movie for the next in the book series.Shrek Forever AfterYear: 2010Tomatometer: 58%Shrek the Third came out in-between Flushed Away and Bee Movie, which saw diminishing returns on the Tomatometer and box office while ballooning in budget. Shrek Forever After was touted as the final theatrical journey to Far Far Away, though DreamWorks fortunately by this point had several other franchises to rely on.MegamindYear: 2010Tomatometer: 72%Will Ferrell and Brad Pitt turn the superhero narrative on its head with Megamind, which sees a megalomaniacal evil genius who destroys his archnemesis and finds himself leaning towards good afterwards. This one pairs nicely with the other 2010 anti-hero animated movie Despicable Me.Kung Fu Panda 2Year: 2011Tomatometer: 81%Though still supported by the critics, this sequel made less in the States, which in turn was completely made up for with the international box office. At $665 million, that was enough to make Kung Fu Panda 2 the highest-grossing movie directed by a woman (Jennifer Yuh Nelson) up until the release of 2013’s Frozen.Puss in BootsYear: 2011Tomatometer: 84%The Shrek franchise lives on with this spinoff starring Antonio Banderas as the fan-favorite kitty Casanova.Madagascar 3: Europe’s Most WantedYear: 2012Tomatometer: 79%Madagascar has quietly become the Fast &amp; Furious of the animation world: each subsequent entry in the series gets better and better reviews. While the original two were rated 55% and 64%, respectively, Europe’s Most Wanted was the first to go Certified Fresh and likewise has grossed the most in the series.Rise of the GuardiansYear: 2012Tomatometer: 74%Despite a Certified Fresh rating and an equally positive reaction from audiences (those who actually went out to see it), the fantasy holiday-themed Rise of the Guardians was a huge writedown for the production studio and triggered hundreds of layoffs. Fantastic home-release sales created some speculation for a sequel though nothing has come to fruition.The CroodsYear: 2013Tomatometer: 70%Another $500 million earner (generally the number necessary in order for an animated movie to be considered a success in today’s saturated market), the prehistoric Croods is getting a movie sequel in 2017, following a TV series that launched on Netfix last year.TurboYear: 2013Tomatometer: 67%This, along with 2014’s Mr. Peabody &amp; Sherman, were considered box office disappointments, representing another valley in DreamWorks fantastically up-and-down trajectory.How to Train Your Dragon 2Year: 2014Tomatometer: 91%Taking flight once more and soaring to new heights, this sequel improbably matched the critical and financial success of the original. Part 3 hits theaters in 2018.Penguins of MadagscarYear: 2014Tomatometer: 72%After a busy 2014 that saw Mr. Peabody &amp; Sherman and the second How to Train Your Dragon, DW closed the year with this spinoff of Madagascar. A true Madagascar sequel is in the works but with no release date yet.HomeYear: 2015Tomatometer: 47%Original property Home, starring Rihanna and Jim Parsons as a lonely young girl and the hyperactive alien she befriends, was a surprise success, opening to $50 million its first weekend.After Kung Fu Panda 3, DreamWorks has one more film lined up for the year: Trolls, due out in November.

Nelson), some of Hollywood’s funniest fellows trying to touch one another without permission (Tag, starring&nbsp;Ed Helms,&nbsp;Jeremy Renner, and Jon Hamm), and a remade blast from the blaxploitation past (Superfly, starring Trevor Jackson&nbsp;and Jason Mitchell).&nbsp;What are the critics saying?Incredibles 2 (2018)  93%If you’re going to try and follow up an acclaimed blockbuster, you might as well take your time getting the sequel right — and in animation, where time can stand still forever, you have the added benefit of not needing to rush your cast back in front of the camera. Still, after waiting nearly 15 years for a second installment of The Incredibles, fans can be forgiven a certain amount of impatience; while the creative teams at formerly franchise-averse Pixar dreamed up new stories for the characters in Toy Story, Cars, Finding Nemo, and Monsters Inc., the ability to return to theaters continued to elude the superpowered Parr family. All that waiting has finally paid off with Incredibles 2, which reunites the original voice cast for a new adventure serving up more of the domestic turmoil, superhero satire, and brilliantly animated action that made the first one such a hit. It’d be tough to improve on the original Incredibles, and critics say that while this sequel doesn’t quite pull off that feat, it comes impressively close, adding yet another acclaimed entry to Pixar’s already estimable filmography. If you were a kid when The Incredibles&nbsp;came out, you might have kids of your own now — and like all the best stuff the studio has put out, the whole family can look forward to enjoying Incredibles 2.Tag (2018)  56%On one hand, it’s easy to believe Hollywood has long since exhausted most of the reasonable possibilities for comedy that exist in movies about grown men acting like boys. On the other, when you’ve got the Wall Street Journal writing about a real-life group of guys who take a month off every year to continue the game of tag they’ve been playing since they were kids, well, it’s awfully hard to resist the temptation to turn that into a film. Enter the descriptively titled Tag, starring Hannibal Buress, Jon Hamm, Ed Helms, Jake Johnson, and Jeremy Renner as the fellows in question — a talented bunch whose commitment to the story was reflected in the set injury Renner sustained, breaking both of his arms and necessitating some last-minute CGI limb replacements in post-production. It would be wonderful to report that Renner’s suffering came in service of one of the year’s best-reviewed action comedies; alas, the truth is that critics are kinda meh on Tag, which reviews describe as funny and engaging in fits and starts, but ultimately not consistent or committed enough to fully deliver on its premise. Still, this is one talented cast, and even the critical pans say the movie isn’t without its moments, so if you’re in the mood for some arrested development laughs, you may want to check your local listings.Superfly (2018)  51%Released in 1972, the original Superfly&nbsp;helped lead the blaxploitation wave with a thoughtful Harlem-set drama about a drug dealer looking for one last big score; the movie’s trappings may look somewhat dated today, but thanks to Ron O’Neal‘s performance as main character Youngblood Priest — not to mention a killer Curtis Mayfield soundtrack — it still feels fresh. It’s easy to understand why music video veteran Director X wanted to take a shot at updating the story, and its themes are just as relevant as they were more than 45 years ago; unfortunately, critics say those themes have mostly been lost in this new version, which is far more focused on style than substance. Starring Trevor Jackson as Priest, the 2018 edition moves the action to Atlanta, but the basic contours of the story remain the same — which is part of why a number of reviews have outlined pundits’ disappointment with the lost social subtext.

Still, after waiting nearly 15 years for a second installment of The Incredibles, fans can be forgiven a certain amount of impatience; while the creative teams at formerly franchise-averse Pixar dreamed up new stories for the characters in Toy Story, Cars, Finding Nemo, and Monsters Inc., the ability to return to theaters continued to elude the superpowered Parr family. All that waiting has finally paid off with Incredibles 2, which reunites the original voice cast for a new adventure serving up more of the domestic turmoil, superhero satire, and brilliantly animated action that made the first one such a hit. It’d be tough to improve on the original Incredibles, and critics say that while this sequel doesn’t quite pull off that feat, it comes impressively close, adding yet another acclaimed entry to Pixar’s already estimable filmography. If you were a kid when The Incredibles&nbsp;came out, you might have kids of your own now — and like all the best stuff the studio has put out, the whole family can look forward to enjoying Incredibles 2.Tag (2018)  56%On one hand, it’s easy to believe Hollywood has long since exhausted most of the reasonable possibilities for comedy that exist in movies about grown men acting like boys. On the other, when you’ve got the Wall Street Journal writing about a real-life group of guys who take a month off every year to continue the game of tag they’ve been playing since they were kids, well, it’s awfully hard to resist the temptation to turn that into a film. Enter the descriptively titled Tag, starring Hannibal Buress, Jon Hamm, Ed Helms, Jake Johnson, and Jeremy Renner as the fellows in question — a talented bunch whose commitment to the story was reflected in the set injury Renner sustained, breaking both of his arms and necessitating some last-minute CGI limb replacements in post-production. It would be wonderful to report that Renner’s suffering came in service of one of the year’s best-reviewed action comedies; alas, the truth is that critics are kinda meh on Tag, which reviews describe as funny and engaging in fits and starts, but ultimately not consistent or committed enough to fully deliver on its premise. Still, this is one talented cast, and even the critical pans say the movie isn’t without its moments, so if you’re in the mood for some arrested development laughs, you may want to check your local listings.Superfly (2018)  51%Released in 1972, the original Superfly&nbsp;helped lead the blaxploitation wave with a thoughtful Harlem-set drama about a drug dealer looking for one last big score; the movie’s trappings may look somewhat dated today, but thanks to Ron O’Neal‘s performance as main character Youngblood Priest — not to mention a killer Curtis Mayfield soundtrack — it still feels fresh. It’s easy to understand why music video veteran Director X wanted to take a shot at updating the story, and its themes are just as relevant as they were more than 45 years ago; unfortunately, critics say those themes have mostly been lost in this new version, which is far more focused on style than substance. Starring Trevor Jackson as Priest, the 2018 edition moves the action to Atlanta, but the basic contours of the story remain the same — which is part of why a number of reviews have outlined pundits’ disappointment with the lost social subtext.

Teenagers did actually come close to dethroning Statham and The Rock, but it was not the kids most expected to lead the way among five new wide releases.King of the Crop: Hobbs &amp; Shaw Leads Weekend But Trails In Series(Photo by © Universal Pictures)Since the 50% drop of the surprise hit original back in 2001, the lowest drop among its sequels in their second weekend was the 59.1% for 2006’s Tokyo Drift. That was also the one film that didn’t feature&nbsp;Vin Diesel and Paul Walker, and it&nbsp;had the lowest opening ($23.97 million) and is the only film in the franchise to not gross $127 million or higher. It grossed $62.51 million, which Hobbs &amp; Shaw&nbsp;nearly bested in its opening weekend. Nevertheless, the film – which had the sixth&nbsp;best opening of the series – dropped 57.7% from its first weekend, putting it in the league of the sequels which have fallen 59.1%&nbsp;to 63.9% over time.That brings the film’s total to $108.5 million after 10 days, which is also the sixth&nbsp;best in the series, trailing the $116.49 million of the fourth entry, 2009’s&nbsp;Fast &amp; Furious. That film made $27.23 million in weekend two (after a 61.6% drop) and finished with $155.06 million. Hobbs &amp; Shaw&nbsp;is currently hovering just over Rise of the Planet of the Apes&nbsp;for the eighth&nbsp;best gross for an August release after 10 days, but that film also had a stronger second weekend with $27.83 million. The first spinoff of the Furious&nbsp;franchise is currently looking at a final gross between $150 million and $161 million. The global total for the $200 million production stands at $332 million.Fresh Surprise: Could There Be More Scary Stories To Tell?Joel MearesCBS Films, under the Lionsgate banner, look like they may have a little hit on their hands. The $25 million production&nbsp;Scary Stories To Tell In The Dark&nbsp;had a strong start with a $20.8 million opening. Lionsgate has had a back-and-forth summer, first with the weaker-than-expected performance of&nbsp;Charlize Theron/Seth Rogen romantic comedy, Long Shot, and then with Luc Besson’s Anna&nbsp;grossing less than $8 million. But in between that they had&nbsp;John Wick: Chapter 3 – Parabellum. The ending of Scary Stories&nbsp;suggests there is hope of turning this into a series (so many stories to still tackle), and&nbsp;surely Lionsgate&nbsp;hopes it can outlast some of its 2019 horror counterparts until It: Chapter Two&nbsp;opens after Labor Day and leaves them all in the dust.The Stories&nbsp;opening is slightly better than Annabelle Comes Home’s $20.26 million. (The Wednesday opener had $17.46 million in its first three days.) The Pet Sematary&nbsp;remake and The Curse of La Llorona (both “R”-rated) opened to $26.34 million and $24.50 million, respectively, and finished with nearly identical grosses of $54.73 million and $54.72 million. The “PG-13”-rated Escape Room&nbsp;opened to $18.23 million and finished with $57 million. Scary Stories&nbsp;ranks as the eighth&nbsp;best horror opening ever in August, ahead of The Last Exorcism&nbsp;($20.36 million) and Exorcist: The Beginning&nbsp;($18.05 million), both of which also&nbsp;finished with nearly identical totals of $41.03 million and&nbsp;$41.82 million, respectively. On first glance, Scary Stories&nbsp;sets a first estimate somewhere between $41 million and $59 million.Rotten Returns:&nbsp;A Rough Weekend for&nbsp;Stories About Crime and Unfair Punishment(Photo by Alison Cohen Rosa / © Warner Bros.)Audiences were either unaware or unwilling to attend the true story of a 2002 NFL prospect falsely accused of rape, Brian Banks. This was only the fifth wide opening in Bleecker Street’s five-year history and the $2.1 million start – not enough to crack the top 10 – translated into their third-worst per-theater-average ($1,492), ahead of only Elvis &amp; Nixon’s $1,224 PTA in 381 theaters back in 2016 and their release of Netflix’s Beasts of No Nation ($1,645 in 31 theaters). The studio had their fourth highest-grossing film ever this year back in March with Hotel Mumbai&nbsp;($9.65 million) and released The Art of Self-Defense&nbsp;last month, which has grossed $2.41 million to date.Looking even worse, though, is Warner Bros.’ The Kitchen. The movie’s 20% Tomatometer score makes&nbsp;it not just one of the worst-reviewed films of the summer – down with The Hustle &nbsp;(14%) and Men In Black International&nbsp;(22%) – but one of the 10&nbsp;worst-reviewed wide releases of 2019. Last year, WB did not have a film open to less than $10 million; with&nbsp;$5.51 million this weekend, The Kitchen&nbsp;becomes the third WB movie to open with less than $10 million this summer after The Sun Is Also A Star&nbsp;($2.51 million) and Shaft&nbsp;($8.90 million). They had four films open with less than $10 million in 2017. Last summer’s The Happytime Murders,&nbsp;with Melissa McCarthy, opened to $9.53 million. It was her lowest opening as a headliner to date – until&nbsp;The Kitchen.The Top 10 and Beyond: Dora Gets Slightly Lost as Disney Continues to Rack Up Milestones(Photo by © Paramount Pictures)There were still two more wide releases this week and the results were not great for either. Many actually gave Dora and the Lost City of Gold&nbsp;a puncher’s chance of knocking Hobbs &amp; Shaw from the top spot, but it could not even beat Scary Stories. A $17 million opening is not the end of the world, but the $49 million production is going to need some help to turn a profit. That opening is about on par with the August release of Spy Kids 2: The Island of Lost Dreams&nbsp;($16.71 million) back in 2002, a film which went on to gross $85.84 million. Though that would require a 5x multiple over opening weekend, something only four films opening in more than 2,000 theaters have achieved this millennium:&nbsp;Crazy Rich Asians&nbsp;(6.58x), The Help&nbsp;(6.51x), We’re the Millers&nbsp;(5.69x), and The 40 Year-Old Virgin&nbsp;(5.1x).The Art of Racing in the Rain,&nbsp;this week’s final wide release,&nbsp;did about half of Dora’s business, making just a little more ($8.1 million) than this summer’s sequel to A Dog’s Purpose, A Dog’s Journey&nbsp;($8.03 million). Advertised as being from the studio that brought you Marley &amp; Me, nobody expected it to reach that film’s heights. Though without any decent word-of-mouth, the film will likely not&nbsp;even reach the $32.64 million that Fox’s 2005 dog drama, Because of Winn-Dixie, made nor will it touch the $36.35 million that Marley grossed in its opening weekend.(Photo by Andrew Cooper / © Columbia Pictures)Over to some films that can certainly register as success stories.&nbsp;The Lion King&nbsp;has grossed $473.1 million, which is the ninth&nbsp;best ever after 24 days of release. Even though the top 15&nbsp;films on that list had stronger fourth weekends, the film is still&nbsp;headed for $530 million-to-$540 million domestic. With $1.33 billion worldwide, the film is just $12.3 million away from becoming one of the 10 highest-grossing films of all time. Then we have Toy Story 4,&nbsp;which is just $10 million away from crossing the billion dollar line and is currently the 43rd&nbsp;highest-grossing film ever; it is also just $7.3 million away from passing Captain Marvel&nbsp;to become the 3rd-highest domestic grosser of 2019. Spider-Man: Far From Home&nbsp;was already over the billion mark before the weekend; this week it will crack the $1.1 billion mark and is close to entering the top 25&nbsp;all-time earners, even if it will come up short of $400 million domestic.Then we have a film that is not a sequel, not a comic book film, not a live-action remake, and not a Pokémon. Quentin Tarantino’s Once Upon a Time…in Hollywood&nbsp;became the first original film of the summer – and just second of 2019 joining Jordan Peele’s Us – to gross over $100 million. Speaking of gross, Tarantino’s acclaimed film is actually right on pace with, of all films, Grown Ups 2, which grossed a virtually identical $11.6 million in its third weekend and had $101.76 million after 17 days. It ultimately grossed $133.66 million and there is a good chance that Hollywood will eventually pass that number, too.(Photo by © A24)Finally, A24 brought The Farewell&nbsp;into wide release this weekend, putting it in 704 theaters (up from last week’s 409). Lulu Wang’s film, Certified Fresh at 99% on the Tomatometer, grossed just $2.2 million this weekend, which pales in comparison to other fifth-week releases between 650-750 theaters. The bulk of them are films which got their expansions during awards season, which is an entirely different beast. But there are comparable summer releases out of Sundance like Zach Braff’s Garden State,&nbsp;which was in its second week of wide release in 745 theaters grossing $2.79 million,&nbsp;and the documentary sensation, March of the Penguins,&nbsp;which expanded into wide release on weekend five (695 theaters) and grossed $4.38 million.Though there is also a glass-half-full situation as well, as long as A24 continues to expand and keeps chipping its way forward with a million or two each week. Garden State&nbsp;had $8.85 million after a month of release (The Farewell&nbsp;is at $10.32 million), never grossed higher than $3.02 million in a weekend, and was never in more than 813 theaters. It ended up grossing $26.7 million.This Time Last Year: A Big Shark, A Slender Man, and a Black Klansman Opened(Photo by © Warner Bros. )All 75 feet of The Meg&nbsp;took the&nbsp;number 1&nbsp;spot at the box office. The giant shark film grossed $45.4 million and began a climb to over $530 million worldwide. The horror film&nbsp;Slender Man&nbsp;grossed $11.37 million for fourth place, while Spike Lee’s Oscar-winning BlacKkKlansman&nbsp;opened to $10.84 million. In milestones, Ant-Man and the Wasp&nbsp;crossed the $200 million mark and Mamma Mia: Here We Go Again&nbsp;passed&nbsp;$100 million. The top 10&nbsp;films grossed $126.97 million and averaged 64.7% on the Tomatometer; this year’s top 10&nbsp;grossed $120.32 million and averaged 67.1% with critics.On the Vine: Another Crowded Weekend Led by Potty Mouths And Angry Birds(Photo by © Universal Pictures)It is another packed weekend that could be led by&nbsp;Good Boys, the Seth Rogen production featuring the “R”-rated adventures of Jacob Tremblay, Brady Noon, and Keith L. Williams. Will audiences return for a second flock of The Angry Birds Movie 2&nbsp;or will it fall victim to the August animation trap right as kids return to school? The same question can be asked of 47 Meters Down: Uncaged, the sequel to the minor sharkbait hit of 2017. Richard Linklater teams with Cate Blanchett on the delayed Where’d You Go, Bernadette,&nbsp;which is his first film not to play any film festivals prior to release since his 2005 remake of Bad News Bears. Finally, one of the sensations of this year’s Sundance was Gurinder Chadha’s Blinded by the Light,&nbsp;starring Viveik Kalra as a guy who becomes inspired to live out his dream as a writer thanks to the music of Bruce Springsteen.The Full Top 10: August 9-11Fast &amp; Furious Presents: Hobbs &amp; Shaw (2019)  67% – $25.4 million ($108.51 million total)Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark (2019)  78% – $20.8 million ($20.8 million total)The Lion King (2019)  52% – $20 million ($473.1 million total)Dora and the Lost City of Gold (2019)  85% – $17 million ($17 million total)Once Upon a Time In Hollywood (2019)  85% – $11.6 million ($100.33 million total)The Art of Racing in the Rain (2019)  43% – $8.1 million ($8.1 million total)The Kitchen (2019)  24% – $5.51 million ($5.51 million total)Spider-Man: Far From Home (2019)  90% – $5.3 million ($370.97 million total)Toy Story 4 (2019)  97% – $4.4 million ($419.57 million total)The Farewell (2019)  97% – $2.21 million ($10.32 million total)Erik Childress can be heard each week evaluating box office on WGN Radio with Nick Digilio as well as on Business First AM with Angela Miles and his Movie Madness Podcast.[box office figures via Box Office Mojo]Like this?

Nelson), some of Hollywood’s funniest fellows trying to touch one another without permission (Tag, starring&nbsp;Ed Helms,&nbsp;Jeremy Renner, and Jon Hamm), and a remade blast from the blaxploitation past (Superfly, starring Trevor Jackson&nbsp;and Jason Mitchell).&nbsp;What are the critics saying?Incredibles 2 (2018)  93%If you’re going to try and follow up an acclaimed blockbuster, you might as well take your time getting the sequel right — and in animation, where time can stand still forever, you have the added benefit of not needing to rush your cast back in front of the camera. Still, after waiting nearly 15 years for a second installment of The Incredibles, fans can be forgiven a certain amount of impatience; while the creative teams at formerly franchise-averse Pixar dreamed up new stories for the characters in Toy Story, Cars, Finding Nemo, and Monsters Inc., the ability to return to theaters continued to elude the superpowered Parr family. All that waiting has finally paid off with Incredibles 2, which reunites the original voice cast for a new adventure serving up more of the domestic turmoil, superhero satire, and brilliantly animated action that made the first one such a hit. It’d be tough to improve on the original Incredibles, and critics say that while this sequel doesn’t quite pull off that feat, it comes impressively close, adding yet another acclaimed entry to Pixar’s already estimable filmography. If you were a kid when The Incredibles&nbsp;came out, you might have kids of your own now — and like all the best stuff the studio has put out, the whole family can look forward to enjoying Incredibles 2.Tag (2018)  56%On one hand, it’s easy to believe Hollywood has long since exhausted most of the reasonable possibilities for comedy that exist in movies about grown men acting like boys. On the other, when you’ve got the Wall Street Journal writing about a real-life group of guys who take a month off every year to continue the game of tag they’ve been playing since they were kids, well, it’s awfully hard to resist the temptation to turn that into a film. Enter the descriptively titled Tag, starring Hannibal Buress, Jon Hamm, Ed Helms, Jake Johnson, and Jeremy Renner as the fellows in question — a talented bunch whose commitment to the story was reflected in the set injury Renner sustained, breaking both of his arms and necessitating some last-minute CGI limb replacements in post-production. It would be wonderful to report that Renner’s suffering came in service of one of the year’s best-reviewed action comedies; alas, the truth is that critics are kinda meh on Tag, which reviews describe as funny and engaging in fits and starts, but ultimately not consistent or committed enough to fully deliver on its premise. Still, this is one talented cast, and even the critical pans say the movie isn’t without its moments, so if you’re in the mood for some arrested development laughs, you may want to check your local listings.Superfly (2018)  51%Released in 1972, the original Superfly&nbsp;helped lead the blaxploitation wave with a thoughtful Harlem-set drama about a drug dealer looking for one last big score; the movie’s trappings may look somewhat dated today, but thanks to Ron O’Neal‘s performance as main character Youngblood Priest — not to mention a killer Curtis Mayfield soundtrack — it still feels fresh. It’s easy to understand why music video veteran Director X wanted to take a shot at updating the story, and its themes are just as relevant as they were more than 45 years ago; unfortunately, critics say those themes have mostly been lost in this new version, which is far more focused on style than substance. Starring Trevor Jackson as Priest, the 2018 edition moves the action to Atlanta, but the basic contours of the story remain the same — which is part of why a number of reviews have outlined pundits’ disappointment with the lost social subtext. This Superfly&nbsp;will make its fortune by and by, thanks to Director X’s way with an artfully arranged scene or set piece, but as is so often the case with remakes, the original still reigns supreme.What’s New on TVThe Bold Type: Season 2 (2018)  100%The Bold Type presents an aspirational yet refreshingly realistic portrait of young women’s careers, friendships and love lives in a big city.Strange Angel: Season 1 (2018)  71%A beautiful slow burn, Strange Angel shoots for the stars, but gets a little lost in its own orbit.Also&nbsp;Opening This Week In Limited Release Eating Animals (2018) , a documentary about the commercial factory farming industry and its various impacts, is at 100%.

The month features several long-running summer favorites returning to the screen alongside several standouts&nbsp;hoping to avoid the sophomore slump. Catch up on the supernatural with&nbsp;iZombie and Lucifer, the character-driven with&nbsp;Deadwood and Fleabag, and the crime-ridden with&nbsp;Line of Duty and Elementary before new episodes drop in the coming weeks.iZombie  90%&nbsp;(The CW)What it is: A wonderfully original spin on the TV zombie craze started by The Walking Dead, iZombie stars Rose McIver as Olivia Moore, a med student-turned-zombie who helps the Seattle police solve homicides by eating victims’ brains and reliving their memories.Why you should watch it: There’s no limit to the creative turns TV writers can take the simple premise of “zombies exist” — hat tip to the dearly departed Santa Clarita Diet&nbsp;— but as&nbsp;iZombie&nbsp;heads into its fifth and final season, it remains&nbsp;one of the genre’s best, most off-kilter examples. Season 5 premieres May 2 on The CW.Where to watch it:&nbsp;Amazon, FandangoNOW,&nbsp;Google Play, Microsoft, Netflix, VuduCommitment:&nbsp;Approx. 42&nbsp;hours (for the first four&nbsp;seasons)Lucifer  86%&nbsp;(Netflix)What it is: Most people escape their locale to vacation where it’s warm, but where do you vacation when your home is in Hell? Los Angeles, apparently. That’s where our titular antihero Lucifer Morningstar (Tom Ellis) sets his sights, at least, after resigning his post as ruler of the underworld and wanting to spice up his life. Once in LA, he opens up a nightclub and stumbles into becoming a civilian consultant for the LAPD.Why you should watch it: Based on the DC Comics character created by Neil Gaiman, Sam Kieth, and Mike Dringenberg, Lucifer Morningstar is a protagonist like we haven’t seen before. Ruler of Hell, sure, but also charismatic as hell (and charming, witty, and handsome), proving himself to be the perfect right-hand man for homicide detective Chloe Decker (Lauren German). (Over the course of three seasons, their beguiling relationship is one of the reasons to stick around, too.) Lucifer was cancelled by Fox last year, but revived by Netflix, which will premiere its fourth season on May 8.Where to watch it:&nbsp;Amazon, FandangoNOW,&nbsp;Google Play, Hulu,&nbsp;Microsoft, Netflix, VuduCommitment:&nbsp;Approx. 42 hours (for the first three&nbsp;seasons)Easy  90% (Netflix)What it is: With Netflix’s romantic comedy series, it’s all in the name. That’s because there’s nothing, well, easy about modern love. Easy’s first two seasons follow an intertwining group of friends and couples living and loving in Chicago.Why you should watch it: The best of television is often character-driven, and Easy gives you plenty of characters to work with. While this Windy City–set series focuses on people and relationships that occasionally overlap, each episode largely stands on its own as a singular meditation on a given couple’s romantic dynamic and exploration of intimacy. And with Drinking Buddies writer-director Joe Swanberg at the helm, the whole thing goes down&nbsp;smoothly (you thought there was going to be another “easy” joke, didn’t you?). Plus, it’s just a hoot to see some of our favorite talents (from Judy Greer to Aubrey Plaza to Dave Franco to Orlando Bloom) pop in for a quick half-hour installment.Where to watch it: NetflixCommitment: Approx. 8 hours (for the first two seasons)Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.  95% (ABC)What it is: S.H.I.E.L.D. is the kind of agency you want at your back. Led by fan-favorite Phil Coulson (Clark Gregg, who caused uproar upon his character’s death in 2012’s The Avengers), Marvel Comics’ fictional Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement, and Logistics Division fights the behind-the-scenes battles that the average human wouldn’t dare face (see: Project Centipede and more). It’s wild, it’s crazy, and it’s a heck of a fun time for Marvel superfans.Why you should watch it: Sure, this puzzle piece within the Marvel Cinematic Universe maintains the franchise call-backs and tonally checks all the boxes of what we look for in a Marvel romp, but you don’t have to be a die-hard lover of Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, and co. to fall for S.H.I.E.L.D.’s extraterrestrial adventures and the now-beloved ensemble of characters it has built throughout its 100-plus episodes. Season 6 premieres on ABC May 10.&nbsp;Where to watch it:&nbsp;Amazon, FandangoNow, Google Play, Hulu, Microsoft, Netflix,&nbsp;VuduCommitment:&nbsp;Approx. 82 hours (for the first five seasons)Sneaky Pete  96% (Amazon Prime Video)What it is: Longtime character actor and standout supporter Giovanni Ribisi gets top billing as conman Marius who, once out of prison, takes on the identity of his cellmate, Pete. On the run from a cold-blooded mobster, Marius holes up with Pete’s unsuspecting small-town family.Why you should watch it:&nbsp;This Amazon original series from creators David Shore and Bryan Cranston (who also co-stars as the aforementioned mobster, Vince) will sneak up and floor you — and we don’t say that simply as a play on words. Each ensemble member (but especially Ribisi and series breakout Marin Ireland) delivers lived-in and moving dramatic turns with fast-paced scripts that don’t skimp on nuance or character. In other words, Sneaky Pete doesn’t have to con its way onto your must-watch list. Season 3 premieres May 10 on Amazon Prime.Where to watch it:&nbsp;Amazon, FandangoNow, Google Play, Microsoft,&nbsp;VuduCommitment: Approx. 18&nbsp;hours (for the first two seasons)Line of Duty  95% (Acorn TV)What it is: Netflix’s&nbsp;Bodyguard may have taken the world by storm last year (along with a Golden Globe win for star Richard Madden), but it’s another cop thriller from creator Jed Mercurio that has us itching for more: Line of Duty. Five seasons in, the series remains one of the U.K.’s highest-rated dramas. Line of Duty&nbsp;follows D.S. Steve Arnott after he’s transferred to an anti-corruption unit and is partnered with a brilliant undercover investigator, D.C. Kate Fleming.Why you should watch it: While dry in summary, the performances and procedural dramas here are absolutely astounding — some of the best nail-biters TV has to offer. Season 5 is already acclaimed overseas, but premieres for U.S. audiences May 13 on Acorn TV.Where to watch it: Acorn TV,&nbsp;Amazon, FandangoNow, Google Play, HuluCommitment:&nbsp;Approx. 23 hours (for the first four seasons)Fleabag  100% (Amazon Prime Video)What it is: Well it’s about time! Fleabag’s six-episode first season premiered to critical acclaim back in 2016 — which means we’ve been waiting for quite a while to reacquaint ourselves with creator and star Phoebe Waller-Bridge and her titular and adrift heroine, who is learning to cope with the death of her best friend&nbsp;in varying self-destructive ways while building a life in London.Why you should watch it: Few other creators are as exciting as Fleabag’s Waller-Bridge. The beloved and all-too-short first season of Amazon’s fuss-free comedy is based on the writer and actress’ hit one-woman play of the same name, which just wrapped a sold-out Off-Broadway run after its 2013 debut overseas. Crass, fearless, and heartbreaking in equal measure, the series trumpeted the arrival of a thrilling new creative voice. And now that Waller-Bridge has other hits with Killing Eve and an arc in Star Wars under her belt, she’s going into&nbsp;season 2 of Fleabag as a bonafide international superstar. Do yourself a favor and learn what the buzz is about. Season 2 premieres May 17 on Amazon Prime Video.Where to watch it:&nbsp;AmazonCommitment:&nbsp;Approx. 3 hours (for the first season)Elementary  95% (CBS)What it is: A contemporary (and gender-bending) update on the classic Sherlock Holmes, Elementary is a New York crime procedural starring Lucy Liu as Dr. Joan Watson and Jonny Lee Miller as the iconic Holmes. Watson begins as Holmes’ sober companion (the ex-Scotland Yard consultant is also a recovering drug addict), but as the series progresses, she becomes his apprentice and partner in solving NYPD’s most chin-scratching mysteries.Why you should watch it:&nbsp;Liu is endlessly watchable in just about anything, so her involvement in this Robert Doherty series is reason enough to tune in. But Elementary is more than just a spellbinding leading lady: it’s a solid, reliable procedural that puts a clever twist on an old classic. Season 7 premieres May 23 on CBS.Where to watch it:&nbsp;Amazon, FandangoNOW,&nbsp;Google Play, Hulu, Microsoft, VuduCommitment:&nbsp;Approx. 103 hours (for the first six seasons)Vida  100% (Starz)What it is: Set in&nbsp;the&nbsp;rarely depicted neighborhood of East Los Angeles, Vida follows estranged Mexican-American sisters Lyn and Emma Hernandez, who are forced to revisit their childhood home and memories after the sudden death of their mother. Familial secrets and personal growth abounds.Why you should watch it: Shows don’t get much more refreshingly original than Vida, Starz’s half-hour dramedy from showrunner Tanya Saracho. Centering queer, Latinx voices both in front of and behind the camera is a feat in and of itself, but the fact that the series is compellingly alive (and bingeable) is what will keep you sticking around. It’s wonderfully grounded by Melissa Barrera and Mishel Prada as the central reunited sisters. Season 2 premieres May 23 on Starz.Where to watch: Amazon, FandangoNOW, Google Play, Hulu,&nbsp;Microsoft,&nbsp;VuduCommitment: Approx. 3&nbsp;hours (for the first season)She's Gotta Have It  78% (Netflix)What it is:&nbsp;Spike Lee&nbsp;updated&nbsp;his&nbsp;original 1986 film in series form.&nbsp;She’s Gotta Have It is the story of Brooklyn-based artist Nola Darling and her three lovers — a love life she juggles while navigating her personal life in an ever-gentrifying Brooklyn and ever-shifting social and political climate.Why you should watch it: Talk about a star-making performance: you simply can’t take your eyes off&nbsp;the magnetic&nbsp;DeWanda Wise. While season 1 admittedly goes a bit off the rails with some of its sillier subplots,&nbsp;She’s Gotta Have It is&nbsp;a series that packs a timely, sociopolitical punch while laying the drama (and sexiness) on thick. With Lee at the helm and Wise front and center, She’s Gotta Have It is a televisual update that’s an absolutely engrossing joy to watch. Season 2 premieres May 24 on Netflix.Where to watch:&nbsp;NetflixCommitment: About 5&nbsp;hours (for the first season)Animal Kingdom  (TNT)What it is: Based on the 2010 Australian feature film of the same name from writer-director David Michôd, Animal Kingdom reconfigures itself in&nbsp;Southern California and showcases the city’s grittier side through a crime family led by iron-fisted matriarch Janine “Smurf” Cody (Ellen Barkin). Our point of entry is Joshua “J” Cody (Finn Cole), a 17-year-old who’s swept up into the family business after his mother dies of a heroin overdose.Why you should watch it: Ellen Barkin, Ellen Barkin, Ellen Barkin. The series’ thrilling writing and direction, led by creator Jonathan Lisco, is well worth the binge, but Barkin, a Tony and Emmy winner and two-time Golden Globe nominee, brings a conniving richness to Smurf that must be seen to be believed. Season 4 premieres May 28 on TNT.Where to watch: Amazon, FandangoNOW, Google Play,&nbsp;Microsoft,&nbsp;VuduCommitment: Approx. 27 hours (for the first three seasons)Archer  90% (FXX)What it is: Even the sleekest of action-packed espionage thrillers have&nbsp;an air of cartoonish hyperbole to them, but FXX’s Archer does away with that suspension of disbelief by making the whole thing a cartoon to begin with. The half-hour comedy from creator Adam Reed can land a joke as deftly as its titular man-child spy can land a punch, so expect to be thrilled while laughing yourself silly.Why you should watch it: Over nine hit seasons, Archer has never shied away from genre experimentation. Season 8’s Dreamland and last season’s Danger Island were particularly high-concept highlights. Season 10 continues the genre-jumping trend of Archer’s coma-dream with 1999, which sees Archer not as the ass-kicking spy of ISIS we know from earlier incarnations, but a futuristic explorer of space on the M/V Seamus alongside our longstanding favorite characters and the voice actors behind them. While it’s a bottle season and therefore easily accessible to newcomers, we still recommend you catch up on all things Archer that have come before it. That’s where the payoff is! Archer: 1999 premieres May 29 on FXX.Where to watch it: Amazon, FandangoNow, Google Play, Hulu, Microsoft, VuduCommitment: Approx. 38&nbsp;hours (for the first nine&nbsp;seasons)Deadwood  92% (HBO)What it is: In what is quickly proving to be one of the television events of the year, Deadwood’s long-awaited feature film finale is finally coming to HBO on May 31. The fan-favorite Western from creator David Milch reunites stars Timothy Olyphant as Seth Bullock and Ian McShane as Al Swearengen (along with the majority of the original ensemble) for a bookend installment set 10 years after the events of season 3’s unexpected ending.&nbsp;Why you should watch it: A fascinating, lurid, and original take on the classic Western genre, Deadwood built its devout fan base thanks to its ability to explore the human condition in tandem with the principles of early American society. With a smattering of scene-stealing performances from its expansive cast, it also has the writing, direction, and design to be one of the most gritty and authentic takes on America’s roots to ever hit the small screen. Deadwood: The Movie premieres May 31 on HBO.Where to watch it: Amazon, FandangoNow, Google Play, HBO Now,&nbsp;Hulu, Microsoft, VuduCommitment: Approx. 36&nbsp;hours (for all three&nbsp;seasons)Like this?

Luckily, there’s a lot of great stuff to catch on the small screen, too. With that in mind, here are five choices we think are worth your precious binge time in May.Penny Dreadful  91%What it is: Penny Dreadful creates a frightening variant of Victorian London, where horrific figures from classic literature such as Dr. Frankenstein, the Creature, and Dorian Grey co-exist and terrorize the city.Why you should watch it:&nbsp;It’s gory, it’s sexy, it’s action-packed, and it’s full of high drama, often with a supernatural twist, which makes for a highly addictive&nbsp;combination. Plus, it’s a lot of fun watching Eva Green vamp it up as a gothic femme fatale alongside Timothy Dalton, with his dignified swagger.&nbsp;Critics agreed, too:&nbsp;season one is Certified Fresh at 78 percent, and season two sits at 100 percent. With season three premiering on the first of May, you might as well get caught up before you tune in.Where to watch:&nbsp;Amazon, Google Play,&nbsp;iTunes, PlayStation Video,&nbsp;Vudu, Showtime Anytime with a cable subscription, and you can watch the season three premiere for free now on Rotten TomatoesCommitment:&nbsp;About 16&nbsp;hoursBloodline  62%What it is: A successful Florida family is forced to contend with dark secrets from their past when their troubled, estranged brother returns home and begins to shake things up.Why you should watch it: Bloodline is simply the latest drama to prove the folks over at Netflix know how to deliver high quality&nbsp;television. The cast — which includes Kyle Chandler, Ben Mendelsohn, Linda Cardellini, Sam Shepard, and Sissy Spacek, among others — is absolutely top notch, and the writing walks a fine line between psychodrama and crime thriller territory. Season two drops in its entirety on May 27, which gives you plenty of time to run through the first season’s 13 episodes.Where to watch:&nbsp;NetflixCommitment:&nbsp;13 hoursWayward Pines  60%What it is: A US Secret Service agent involved in a car accident wakes up in a small town he is mysteriously unable to leave and whose peculiar residents share a dark secret.Why you should watch it: Consider this a mix of David Lynch and M. Night Shyamalan; the former’s Twin Peaks series and overall aesthetic serve as a clear inspiration for Wayward Pines, while the latter infuses the show with his own twisted sensibilities as executive producer. Beyond that, the cast is peppered with vets like Matt Dillon, Carla Gugino, Melissa Leo, and Toby Jones, among others, and its sharp storytelling will keep you guessing. Season two premieres on May 25, so there’s plenty of time to jump on board this crazy train.Where to watch:&nbsp;Amazon,&nbsp;Google Play, Hulu,&nbsp;iTunes, Microsoft, PlayStation Video, and&nbsp;VuduCommitment:&nbsp;About 7 hoursAngie Tribeca  96%What it is: In the vein of Police Squad! comes this hysterical slapstick single-camera police procedural spoof created by Steve and Nancy Carell.Why you should watch it:&nbsp;An homage to the Leslie Nielsen school of deadpan farce, Angie Tribeca&nbsp;revels in its drop-dead serious devotion to ridiculous humor. Fans of silly sight gags and absurd one-liners will find lots to appreciate, and folks like Lisa Kudrow, Danny Trejo, and Gene Simmons turn in hilarious cameos to up the laugh factor. It’s unclear if TBS will make season two — which premieres on June 6 —&nbsp;available in full, like they did with season one, but those of you who missed out on it during its first run can catch it on DVD on May 17.Where to watch:&nbsp;Amazon,&nbsp;Google Play, iTunes, Microsoft, PlayStation Video,&nbsp;Vudu, and&nbsp;on tbs.com with a cable subscriptionCommitment: 3.5 hoursUnReal  81%What it is: As a behind-the-scenes look at the reality competition television industry, UnREAL&nbsp;is a darkly compelling exploration of humanity vs. commercial success.Why you should watch it:&nbsp;The fascination comes with the understanding that it is loosely based on the real life experience of showrunner Sarah Gertrude Shapiro. The show-within-a-show, Everlasting, can be compared to several reality dating competition shows currently airing, and the real tensions and drama occur behind the camera.Where to watch: Amazon, Google Play,&nbsp;Hulu, iTunes, Microsoft,&nbsp;PlayStation Video, and&nbsp;VuduCommitment:&nbsp;Just over 7 hours","section":"Binge Guide","tags":"dragons, CBS","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/29151235/Penny-Dreadful-May-Binge.jpg","slug":"5-tv-shows-you-should-binge-watch-this-may"},{"id":"47508685031250","title":"Batwoman Essentials: Meet Gotham’s New Caped Crusader","content":"Comics On TVvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Batwoman Essentials: Meet Gotham's New Caped CrusaderFrom the character's origin story to the villains she'll fight, find out all about the Arrowverse hero played by Ruby Rose.by Erik Amaya | October 4, 2019 |  CommentsIt feels&nbsp;as though the character Batwoman has been on TV for a while&nbsp;— what with&nbsp;her splashing around in summer 2018&nbsp;headlines and making a special appearance in last year’s Arrowverse “Elseworlds” crossover&nbsp;— but the debut episode of The CW’s&nbsp;Batwoman&nbsp;will be the real beginning of Kate Kane’s (Ruby Rose) television journey.You may already know&nbsp;Batwoman is&nbsp;Bruce Wayne’s only living relative, an accomplished fighter, and very out and proud. But that’s only a sliver of who she is, what she’s fighting for, and why she has a series all her own. And combined with her ties to the already-sprawling CW multiverse of superheroes, it might be helpful to get a primer on what to expect when you sit down to watch Batwoman. Here are a few things you should know about this hero&nbsp;as her series begins.1. It’s Set On Earth-1(Photo by Elizabeth Morris/The CW)Currently, The CW airs six superhero shows set on three different Earths. The Earth-1 of Arrow, The Flash, and DC’s Legends of Tomorrow, Supergirl’s Earth-38, and the undesignated Earth of Black Lightning. The latter two occur on different Earths because they were not developed as CW shows&nbsp;—&nbsp;Supergirl first aired on CBS and Black Lighting was developed for Fox&nbsp;— but their alternate universe homes also pay homage to DC Comics and its fascination with alternate realities.But as last year’s “Elseworlds” crossover made clear, Batwoman takes place on Earth-1. Which means it is possible for characters from The Flash and Arrow to make easy visits to Gotham City. Of course, that famous DC town was not always available to Arrowverse producer Greg Berlanti. Thanks in part to the way DC Entertainment handles film and television rights, the use of Gotham City icons had to be approved by several levels of management. Even a passing reference to Batman in an episode of&nbsp;Arrow&nbsp;a few years ago required executives at DC, Warner Bros, and Fox to sign off on it as Gotham was still on the air on Fox and Batman movies are always in development.Some of those barriers have been cleared to make&nbsp;Batwoman&nbsp;possible, but it means you may be waiting some time to see your favorite Gotham City villains on the show. Most of the marquee rogues are typically reserved or Batman feature films and, thanks to a deal made with 20th Century Fox in the 1960s, the Fox broadcast network always has first dibs to Batman characters on television. There are exceptions, though, like Tommy Elliot&nbsp;— the more recent villain known as Hush — who will appear in the form of actor Gabriel Mann in upcoming episodes and Magpie (Rachel Matthews), a fairly minor villain from the 1980s. Both appeared on Gotham, but are easier for the series to tap than, say, the Penguin.That said, Kate has her own rogues gallery, including the murderous and twisted Alice (Rachel Skarsten) and, if previews are anything to go by, the Crows private security firm run by her father Jacob (Dougray Scott).2. Gotham City Has Its Own Cast Of Characters(Photo by Kimberley French/The CW)Besides Kate, Jacob and Alice, the Gotham of Batwoman will be fairly populated from the first episode on. Other characters include Kate’s stepmother Catherine Hamilton-Kane (Elizabeth Anweis), stepsister Mary Hamilton (Nicole Kang), Wayne Industries caretaker Luke Fox (Camrus Johnson), and Crow agent Sophie Moore (Meagan Tandy).Applying the old evil-stepmother trope, Kate and Catherine do not get along. Kate is a loner who left home after high school, while Catherine is a mover-and-shaker in the Wayne-less Gotham. She does have a vested interest in reversing the city’s reputation as a crime-riddled hellhole, however, which is definitely compatible with Kate’s new job ridding her city of bad guys. Med student&nbsp;Mary, meanwhile, may be&nbsp;on better terms with Kate, but her real challenge is keeping her off-the-books health clinic in the tough part of Gotham a secret.As for Luke (based on the DC Comics Batwing character) and Sophie, it’s best you watch the debut episode without a great deal of background on either, as they are the people Kate ends up interacting with the most&nbsp;— and for very different reasons.And since we’re talking about Gotham citizens, it might helpful to mention Gotham itself is more a grounded Dark Knight place than the sometimes cartoonish city of Gotham. Which is to say, people behave a little more like everyday folks instead of the mad, wonderful, and shouting denizens of the former Fox television show. It’s an important contrast for a Gotham set on The CW’s Earth-1.3. The First Few Episodes Take Place Prior To “Elseworlds”(Photo by JSquared Photography/The CW)While Kate has a distinctive look, as seen in “Elseworlds,” it may be an episode or two before Rose is actually wearing that particular&nbsp;Batwoman super-suit. As revealed at screenings during San Diego Comic-Con this summer (and one at NYCC this weekend), the first episode takes viewers back to the moment Kate returned to Gotham after a self-imposed exile and discovers her cousin Bruce’s secret identity. Consequently, the complete Batwoman costume may not be seen on screen for a few episodes.From a narrative standpoint, this is the right way to go as it means things like the Batwoman wig and red cape get to mean something to the audience. But for those watching the continuity between Batwoman and the other CW superhero shows, this means a good chunk of the first season occurred prior to last year’s “Elseworlds” crossover.And just to make things even more confusing, the timeline has to sync up before December’s “Crisis on Infinite Earths” crossover, since Kate will be featured in the story.In its own strange way, this also honors DC Comics and the way it tells stories, just without a helpful editorial caption to tell you these events are taking a place a year and a half ago. As you actually watch Batwoman, this may not matter too much in the short term&nbsp;— it has to tell its own story after all&nbsp;— but it may come up in December.4. It Is An Origin Story(Photo by Kimberley French/The CW)As mentioned above, a large part of the show’s first season will form an origin story. It seemingly takes its cues from Batwoman: Elegy, a story by Greg Rucka and J.H. Williams III that really set the tone for Kate in the DC Comics universe. It reveals key details about Kate’s past — getting kidnapped with her twin sister at a young age, getting kicked out of the military when her same-sex relationship was exposed, etc.&nbsp;— and serving as a de facto origin tale even though Kate had been operating as Batwoman for a good year or two prior to Elegy’s publication in the pages of Detective Comics.On the show, some of these details are getting remixed, but it will depart from Elegy in a key way — it will spend far more time showing Kate becoming Batwoman. Back in the comics, the character was always fully formed. But for television, it is important to see Kate making certain choices, literally learning the ropes and cementing her identity.We have to admit that choice is dramatic satisfying for a series like this. And, as it happens, Berlanti pulled this off before on Arrow. Halfway through its second season it introduced Barry Allen (Grant Gustin), a visiting crime scene analyst who began a quasi-relationship with Felicity Smoak (Emily Bett Rickards). By the end of the season, he was struck by lightning and awarded with his own show. Thanks to the Arrow appearance, the audience had the chance to decide if they liked Barry while the first season of The Flash saw him discovering powers and hitting certain important milestones.And like Barry at the time of his debut, Kate is a person a lot of viewers only know through reputation or her brief appearance in the Arrowverse last year.&nbsp;Giving her&nbsp;a handful of&nbsp;episodes of self-discovery gives the new program&nbsp;— and the audience&nbsp;— plenty of time to obtain a clearer picture of Kate.5. It Is An Action Show(Photo by Robert Falconer/The CW)Thanks to the success of The Flash, the subsequent Arrowverse shows have been filled with metahumans and crazy super powers. Even the fairly grounded Black Lighting, which exists outside the Arrowverse framework, indulges in its super-power displays and, indeed, made the collection of metahumans a key part of its storyline. But Batwoman is a return to the pure action show roots of Arrow. Like that series’ early days, Kate, her associates, and her enemies will lack for big, bright powers.Granted, that’s baked right into the premise&nbsp;— members of the Batman family are generally conventional humans trained for peak performance&nbsp;— but it means the show will have a different feel than what you might expect. This is doubly true as Arrow finds itself dealing with alternate realities and a multiverse entity as part of its eighth and final season. Week-to-week, this means you should expect a lot more close-quarters fighting and, perhaps, a reliance on gadgets. Hopefully, the latter will set the program apart from Arrow, which avoided trick arrows for a long time.The return to action also means the show will be less tied to the campier elements of the DC Universe. That’s probably a good decision as Batwoman is paired on Sundays nights with Supergirl, a show filled with powered aliens and a generous helping of goofy camp to offset its often-serious stories. And considering the rumblings that a “World’s Finest” team-up between the two heroes may eventually happen, contrasting their worlds can only be a net positive. A similar difference in tone helped set The Flash apart from Arrow.But considering Batwoman’s comic book past includes some wild monsters, aliens, and prophecies, we wouldn’t put it past the production team to introduce something decidedly fantastical into the mix after “Crisis on Infinite Earths” or in the first season finale.Until that occurs, though, expect Batwoman to be a show about fighting for one’s identity. Whether or not that’s a meta-commentary on the show itself (and its place in the Arrowverse) remains to be seen.Batwoman airs Sundays at 8 p.m. on The CW.Like this?

That evolution is hardly surprising with the similarities the format shares with comic books. Both allow their audiences to grow intimately attached to characters over a long timespan. Both reveal their stories in installments, utilizing a certain pace within episodes (or issues) and a larger construction of momentum across a season (or story arc).And in 2019, television — particularly of the kind based on comic books —dominates the programming schedule with The CW’s superhero offerings taking over Ballroom 20 for most of Saturday and shows like The Walking Dead and Riverdale commanding Hall H-sized crowds. Additionally, HBO is setting up a Watchmen experience at the Petco Park Home Plate Gate (and at the parking lot on the corner of Sixth Avenue and Island Avenue) to promote their upcoming quasi-sequel to the landmark miniseries by Alan Moore, Dave Gibbons, and John Higgins. Trying to see all of the Comics on TV style programming may be impossible, but we imagine the most hard-core Comic-Con aficionados (and some of us contractually-obligated media types) are&nbsp;willing to try.With that in mind, join us as we take a look at all the panels highlighting Comics on TV at Comic-Con. It may help you choose your priorities.WednesdayWarner Bros. Television always brings a few sneak peeks to preview night. This year, Batwoman&nbsp;and Pennyworth are the notable premieres with a new episode of The 100 and a to-be-determined Rooster Teeth presentation rounding out the evening. If you’re done early with the exclusives hunting, it may be worth heading upstairs and talking a look.ThursdayTeen Titans GO! New Episode Premiere and Q&amp;A (Room 6DE, 3:15&nbsp;p.m.)The first full day of Comic-Con gets its Comics on TV content rolling with a new episode of Teen Titans GO! The animated shorts are somewhat divisive with fans of the older Teen Titans unimpressed with GO!’s anarchic comedy and format. Nonetheless, fun can be had as members of the voice cast and the crew will be on hand to debut the new episode. Expect some of the voice actors to switch into their roles during the Q&amp;A. It is traditional, after all.Marvel’s Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. (Hall H, 3:30&nbsp;p.m.)Marvel’s Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. survived bouncing around the schedule, a cancellation scare, and the Snap to make their way to Hall H this year. They definitely earned it as Season 6 has been its strongest year yet. Cast members Clark Gregg, Ming-Na Wen, Chloe Bennet, Elizabeth Henstridge, Iain De Caestecker, Henry Simmons, Natalia Cordova-Buckley, and Jeff Ward – and executive producers Maurissa Tancharoen, Jed Whedon, Jeff Bell, and Jeph Loeb – will be on hand to discuss alien psychoactive substances, the mystery of Sarge, and the Planet Kitson. They will also tease some events to come in Season 7.Stumptown (Indigo Ballroom, 4:15&nbsp;p.m.)Based on the comic book series by Greg Rucka, Matthew Southworth, and Justin Greenwood, the new ABC series focuses on Dex Parios, a sharp-witted Army veteran who takes up private investigations to pay off her gambling debts. She also looks out for her brother while solving cases and avoiding trouble. Star Cobie Smulders, along with co-stars Jake Johnson, Michael Ealy, Camryn Manheim, Tantoo Cardinal, Cole Sibus, Adrian Martinez, executive producer Jason Richman, and Rucka will introduce audiences to the TV version of Dex and the Portland, Oregon criminal underworld she knows far too well for her own good.Adapting Source Material For Film And TV (Room 6A, 4:15&nbsp;p.m.)But if you want to learn more about how TV producers adapt comics into television shows, The Walking Dead executive producer David Alpert, Deadly Class co-executive producer Maggie Bandur, former Iron Fist showrunner M. Raven Metzner, and former Luke Cage producer Akela Cooper will chat about how they walk fan-favorite comic books through the development process and on to cable channels or streaming services. It may explain why superhero costumes often disappear and why some shows look nothing like their four-color counterparts.FridayDuckTales (Room 6A, 11:45&nbsp;a.m.)Start your Friday at Comic-Con with DuckTales‘ executive producer Matt Youngberg, co-EP Francisco Angones, and stars Ben Schwartz, Bobby Moynihan, Kate Micucci, and Paget Brewster as they discuss the upcoming third season and show footage from a never-before-seen episode. Will it be a whole episode? You never know with the series inspired by the Donald Duck comics of Carl Barks.Fear The Walking Dead (Hall H, 12&nbsp;p.m.)Now a traditional Hall H staple, the cast and crew of AMC’s Fear the Walking Dead will grace the stage to dodge questions about upcoming episodes. Panelists include cast members Lennie James, Alycia Debnam-Carey, Maggie Grace, Colman Domingo, Danay Garcia, Austin Amelio, Alexa Nisenson, Karen David, Jenna Elfman, and Rubén Blades. Walking Dead boss Scott M. Gimple, showrunners and executive producers Andrew Chambliss and Ian Goldberg, executive producers Robert Kirkman, Gale Anne Hurd, Dave Alpert, and Greg Nicotero will also be on hand to help the cast avoid spoilers.DC Super Hero Girls New Episode Premiere And Q&amp;A (Room 6DE, 12:30&nbsp;p.m.)Last year, the DC Super Hero Girls team debuted the first of a planned series of shorts. Now, with the full series off the ground and airing on Cartoon Network, the cast and crew return triumphant with a new episode to show an appreciative crowd of fans. Last year’s panel was also a lot of fun, so we expect this to be no different.The Walking Dead (Hall H, 1 p.m.)Gimple, Hurd, Alpert, Nicotero, and Kirkman remain on the Hall H stage for the second hour of Walking Dead content. They are joined by Walking Dead showrunner Angela Kang and cast members Norman Reedus, Danai Gurira, Melissa McBride, Jeffrey Dean Morgan, Avi Nash, Cooper Andrews, Ryan Hurst, Nadia Hilker, Eleanor Matsuura, and Cailey Fleming. Expect more spoiler-evasion, but a pretty entertaining sort as this cast knows how to talk about their characters without giving anything away. McBride, in particular, is a master at this. The hour will also offer a first look at the Season 10 trailer.The Boys (Ballroom 20, 3:30&nbsp;p.m.)Stars Karl Urban, Jack Quaid, Antony Starr, Erin Moriarty, Laz Alonso, Chace Crawford, Tomer Capon, Karen Fukuhara, Jessie T. Usher, Elisabeth Shue, and executive producers Eric Kripke and Seth Rogen come together to discuss the upcoming Amazon Prime series based on the comic book by Garth Ennis and Darick Robertson. It takes place in a world where superheroes are as fallible as any pro athlete, movie star, or influencer. But when they get out of line, The Boys appear to teach them the folly of their ways.Pennyworth Special Video Presentation and Q&amp;A (Room 6BCF, 4:30&nbsp;p.m.)A series based around Batman’s butler may seem superfluous, but we think those going to this panel will be pleasantly surprised by this new take on Alfred Pennyworth. Stars Jack Bannon, Ben Aldridge, Paloma Faith, and executive producers Bruno Heller and Danny Cannon will be on hand to present footage from the series and answers questions about the craziest Batman prequel yet.Announcing The Fabulous Furry Freak Brothers Animated Series (Room 6BCF, 7&nbsp;p.m.)The underground comix classic is finally coming to TV! Showrunners Alan Freedland and Alan Cohen, producers Blake Anderson and Adam Devine, and writers Jeremy Lehrer and Daniel Lehrer will discuss their approach to Gilbert Shelton’s trio of counterculture stoners.Preacher (Hall H, 7&nbsp;p.m.)Preacher is reaching its endgame. Executive producer Seth Rogen and members of the cast will take to the Hall H stage to celebrate the program’s fourth and final season. We expect they will also have some footage from the Season 4 premiere if not the entire episode itself. They will also reminisce about the high-jinks that Jesse (Dominic Cooper), Tulip (Ruth Negga), and Cassidy (Joseph Gilgun) got up to while searching for the Almighty.SaturdayBatwoman Pilot Screening And Q&amp;A (Ballroom 20, 10:30 a.m.)If you missed the preview night premiere of Batwoman, you will have a second chance to catch the first episode during the first Ballroom 20 presentation on Friday, July 20th. Ruby Rose stars as the out and proud Kate Kane, cousin of a long-absent Bruce Wayne who learns the truth about his nighttime activities and takes the mantle of the Bat for herself. The cast and producers will also be on stage answering questions from soon-to-be fans of the show.Snowpiercer On TBS: Panel and Exclusive First Look (Indigo Ballroom, 3 p.m.)Based on the French comic by Jacques Lob and Jean-Marc Rochette, Snowpiercer takes viewers to a world where the remnants of humanity board a perpetually moving train. But all of the species’ emotional baggage is along for the ride. Stars Jennifer Connelly, Daveed Diggs, Alison Wright, Mickey Sumner, Lena Hall, Steven Ogg, and executive producer/showrunner Graeme Manson will offer an exclusive peek at the show and answer questions about its long route to the screen.Arrow Special Video Presentation And Q&amp;A&nbsp; (3:30 p.m.)It is hard to believe that this will be the final Arrow panel at Comic-Con. And yet, eight years, two attempts at Olicity, and one Ricardo Diaz later, this is the end. Join the cast and crew as they recall fond times and tease what lies ahead for Oliver Queen (Stephen Amell) as the 10-episode final season brings him inexorably to his final fate. We expect this to be the key panel during The CW’s takeover of Ballroom 20. We even think a trailer for the upcoming “Crisis on Infinite Earths” crossover will debut toward the end of it.Supergirl, Black Lightning, and The Flash Special Video Presentations and Q&amp;A (Ballroom 20, 4:15-6:30 p.m.)While we singled out Arrow because it is their final Comic-Con appearance, Supergirl, Black Lightning, and The Flash will all make their usual Saturday appearances, bringing the customary teases of their new seasons and answer fan questions about the oddest parts of the previous year. Some of those questions will no doubt concern “Crisis,” but we expect each group will have something to share bout the crossover — even the Black Lighting team, who stay out of the crossovers. As always, a large number of each cast will be in attendance. If you love these shows and want to see the Marvel Studios presentation, make your choice early and camp out in the appropriate hall.Syfy and IDW Entertainment: Wynonna Earp (Indigo Ballroom, 5&nbsp;p.m.)It’s been a crazy year for Earpers. At Comic-Con 2018, the cast and crew announced they would be back for a fourth season. But just as production was supposed to start, it smacked up against a long delay and obscure studio politics. But the show is coming back, and stars Melanie Scrofano, Katherine Barrell, Chantel Riley, Greg Lawson, and Michael Eklund – along with executive producer Emily Andras and Wynonna creator Beau Smith – return to Comic-Con once more to tease the definitely soon-to-be-in-production fourth season. Of course, if you’ve ever been to a Wynonna Earp panel, you know they tend feature a lot of fans expressing their love for the show. It will get loud.DC Universe Series Sneak Previews And Q&amp;A (Indigo Ballroom, 7&nbsp;p.m.)DC Universe is gearing up for its second year and it’s bringing previews of the upcoming Harley Quinn animated series, the second season of Titans, and more to its two-hour Comic-Con presentation. Talent and producers of the various series will appear and there will probably be a few surprises. We’re hoping we’ll get confirmation about Doom Patrol’s second season and even a last-second reprieve for Swamp Thing, which was cancelled before its second episode debuted, but continued to air the entirety of the first season and turned out to be our favorite comic book show of the early summer.Sunday(Photo by Marc Hom/The CW)Riverdale Special Video Presentation and Q&amp;AThe cast and crew of Riverdale close out Comic-Con’s Comics on TV presence with their yearly Hall H appearance. Expect fans to swoon over stars KJ Apa and Cole Sprouse. Also expect executive producer Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa to offer a bit of info which seems important, but ends up quite tangential to the Season 4 mystery. Will Jughead (Sprouse) be dead by spring break? Will Hiram Lodge (Mark Consuelos) exact his revenge on Veronica (Camilla Mendes)? The questions and more will be discussed even if they are not answered.Like this?

What do his actions mean for his father Charles Xavier and the X-Men?by Erik Amaya | August 12, 2019 |  Comments(Photo by FX)Since its debut three years ago, FX’s Legion has been one of the most compelling, mind-bending, and uniquely heartfelt series to spin out of a comic book. That it focused on a relatively minor character from the X-Men lore is even more remarkable. But by lifting David Haller from the pages of various X-Men titles into a weird and timeless television reality, show creator Noah Hawley was able to examine topics like mental illness, sexual assault, and the end of the world in a unique way.Often, it chose not to connect the dots, leaving that mutant ability for the viewer to use. In its place, it offered musical numbers, a couple of fantastic dance numbers, and David – as played by Dan Stevens – unraveling at least some of the secrets buried in his head. And it all led to a pivotal figure in X-Men history,&nbsp;Charles Xavier (Harry Lloyd),&nbsp;and a somewhat obscure, but vitally important background character,&nbsp;Amahl Farouk (Navid Negahban).Spoiler alert: This article includes plot details from the series finale of Legion. Stop here if you have not watched the final episode.Considering&nbsp;Charles and Amahl’s fight in the comics led to the formation of the X-Men, it would seem the end of Legion contains a beginning — or maybe it really ended with David destroying the world. Let’s take a look at what the ending has to offer. Negahban was kind enough to talk to Rotten Tomatoes about one of the ways the future could change — well, provided there is a future, of course.Why did Everyone Think David Would Destroy the World?(Photo by Pari Dukovic/FX)He’s done it before.There is a certain ambiguity in the show’s final shot — or limitless potential as it is a baby’s smiling face. But David’s role in bringing about an apocalypse is probably the third line on his Official Handbook to the Marvel Universe page after “Professor X’s son” and “Suffers from a mental illness.” Despite being a presence in the comic books for a number of years, Legion’s big moment came in 1995’s “Legion Quest” story line. The character – waking from a long coma – made a key decision: he was going to travel back to the 1960s and kill Magneto before he formed his Brotherhood. If successful, then only his father’s non-violent philosophy would hold sway and prevent much of the strife done by Erik Magnus Lehnsherr and his followers.Unfortunately, it all went badly and Legion ended up killing Charles Xavier instead of Magneto, unleashing a reality in which the world learned about Mutants decades too soon and Apocalypse, a powerful, ancient, and immortal mutant took control of the planet. Eventually, a team of familiar faces (led by the time-lost mutant Bishop) managed to travel back in time to prevent David’s error.Curiously enough, Bishop was able to show David the damage he caused. The troubled mutant apologized and apparently died.The Age of Apocalypse was undone and things went back to normal. Well, mostly, anyway. Blink, a fan favorite from the AoA timeline, eventually found herself crossing the multiverse with a group known as “The Exiles,” while Dark Beast, a mad-scientist version of founding X-Man Hank McCoy, and a few other characters found their way to the familiar Earth-616.(Photo by Suzanne Tenner/FX)Legion eventually reappeared (as no one stays dead in comics), but his most famous misadventure was always in Hawley’s mind, and a version of “Legion Quest” was the direction of the series from the first moment David flashed his wicked smile into camera.As Stevens put it when we talked to him on the set back in March, the show is&nbsp;not “directly adapting frame by frame any particular Legion story line. But I hope what we’re retaining is the playfulness.”Changing reality, if not destroying it, is always an aspect of the playfulness.Did David End the World?In a manner of speaking, yes. As his addition to Lessons in Time Travel indicated, the traveler is annihilated in the attempt to change his or her past. The David, Syd (Rachel Keller), Cary and Kerry Loudermilk (Bill Irwin and Amber Midthunder), and Amahl Farouk of the program’s “present” timeline all ceased to exist, as did anyone left there while the Time Eaters munched away. From their perspectives, David ended the world by traveling 33 years into the past — à la “Legion Quest.”Now, had a fourth season occurred, it is entirely possible we would’ve seen new versions of these characters grappling with echoes from the world before. Much like the way the omnipresent baseline at David’s cult compound invaded the minds of his parents, an image or song (likely from The Who) might have offered Syd or David some clue to the old timeline – much as Bishop survived in the Age of Apocalypse to form his own strike team. Maybe this is why the mainframe version of Ptonomy (Jeremie Harris) remained in stasis back in the present.But with Chapter 27 serving as the conclusion, we’re left with a blank slate. It is easy to consider what it might look like. We will even be charitable and assume the timeline we witnessed on Legion was a darker world where mutants mostly ran scared and had no unifying groups to help them with their powers.Will Charles Form the X-Men?Almost certainly. Upon his return from Morocco, Charles tells Gabrielle (Stephanie Corneliussen) that he always wanted to be a teacher. The implication is clear. Even their home has a certain X-Mansion flare to it. And that change is key in appreciating the series’ end-state. In the personal sense, Charles and Stephanie will be there to raise David — and help him cope with the mental health issues he inherited from Gabrielle. But in the larger sense, Charles came away from his journey with a new perspective. As Lloyd noted when we talked to him in March, “[Charles] is actually quite lost” when he arrives at the Shadow King’s palace. But having returned from a trip that saw him disappear entirely in the old timeline, he is now free to fulfill a destiny he never knew he had.Back in the comics, Professor X’s battle with the Shadow King led him to found the X-Men as a safe-guard against mutants who use their abilities for evil. But in Legion‘s history, the battle seemingly left Charles dead or utterly incapacitated. Altering this outcome may be more significant than David could imagine. Besides giving Charles the opportunity to be part of the a family unit with Gabrielle and David, he will also be able to teach others how to harness their gifts — no doubt after training David — leading to a very different world.(Photo by Suzanne Tenner/FX)We’re also going to note the total absence of Magneto from Legion’s structure as it means TV show David achieved what comic book Legion sought to accomplish: a world in which Charles made things better.Sure, Division 3 will likely observe the Xavier school, perhaps even come into conflict with a group of X-Men, just as they hunted people at Summerland. Nonetheless, Charles will offer something better than the Birds sought to create. Although, if you’ve read an X-Men comic or seen one of the movies, you know the tension between mutant and humans will always lead to fighting and giant robots. But at least Charles’s attempts with the school and the X-Men offer people like Syd and the Loudermilks something they may not have otherwise: family from an early age.Who Will the Shadow King Be in the New Future?When we spoke with Negahban recently, his thoughts turned toward the key moment in the finale: a handshake between David and the Shadow King. It evolved on set, but reflected the overall tone of the final moments. That is to say, a non-violent resolution after all the pain and trauma.“[Noah] was addressing how people are struggling to see each other, to understand each other, to find themselves,” Negahban explained, adding that some of Amahl’s apparent villainy in Chapter 26 may have been an expression of an extreme loneliness. “Even in his most evil moments, he is feeling very lonely being the most evil person.”But as Negahban saw it, the Shadow King’s future self gave him something key — an external awareness of his actions.“The way that I looked at it is that we can change the future by paying attention to our present or paying attention to what we are doing, how we are responding to other people,” the actor said.(Photo by Matthias Clamer/FX)For Amahl, that change came courtesy of the future Shadow King’s stylish glasses and the history they contained: “When [he] hands the glasses to Amahl — just by seeing what kind of impact we have on our future, we might change our behavior today.”Negahban imagines the Amahl who emerges in the new reality will be less lonely and offer his powers to a life of service.“Sometimes we are becoming so full of ourselves, we are becoming so arrogant that we think that we are controlling everything, that we are controlling the situation,” he said of Amahl up until the events of Chapter 27. “I think Amahl sees the effect that he’s going to have on the future. And at the end when he is thanking [David, Charles, and his future self] for allowing him to see the outcome of his actions, he is getting a second chance to change.”That apology echoes David’s back in “Age of Apocalypse.” And while it is easy to imagine a kinder Amahl Farouk finding peace in a new future, did David also earn a second chance?Was David Deserving of His Redemption?When we visited the set, we asked the cast if David deserved redemption. Midthunder, on the eve of shooting the final episode, still felt conflicted about David.“Everybody has a story and everybody has a side,” she said. “Everybody has reasons for doing what they do, but then everybody has the way that it affects them.”Meanwhile, she thought Kerry had a clearer point of view on the matter: he deserved to pay for his actions.Irwin, on the other hand, thought “that his service to the world — keeping the world going — is something we can all be grateful to him for” even if his actions left him as a dubious sort of hero.Lauren Tsai, whose character, Switch, allowed David the opportunity to change his past, thought the overall story of season 3 created enough ambiguity for viewers to question his redemption long after the finale.“I think that throughout the story you can believe that David is redeemable,” she said. “David deserves love and a normal life. But at the same time you can also feel like, Well, he did these horrible things.”(Photo by Pari Dukovic/FX)In Switch’s case, David’s exploitation of her powers led to a beneficial transformation. But David’s violation of Syd may be the greatest reason to deny him redemption. Even before he erased her memories of his darkest actions, he was causing her psychic damage.“So much of her life since she’s met this man has been in service to him,” Keller said during our set visit. “So many young women go through taking on egotistical and stupid and sick men, trying to right their wrongs or fix them.”This seemed to be an involuntary course of action for Syd up until the end. In March, Keller expressed a hope that Syd would be able to leave him in peace. But it seems time travel allowed her something better: the chance to protect a David brimming with potential. The David she knew deserved only oblivion, even if he did fix the world. That baby, though, definitely deserved better.And, hopefully, the end of the world (as Legion viewers knew it) will give him that chance.Like this?

Things kicked off with 1983’s The Keep, Michael Mann’s hard-to-find WWII fantasy-thriller, with subsequent highlights including early Will Smith drama Six Degrees of Separation, a 1930s-set adaptation of Richard III, and&nbsp;an appearance as Death in Last Action Hero, putting that theater gravitas to good use in a decidedly bad flick.His Oscar nomination for portraying director James Whale in 1998’s Gods and Monsters brought him to international prominence, setting the stage for one of the great career turns in movie history. In 2000, McKellen became one of comic books’ greatest villains, Magneto, in X-Men.&nbsp;He wouldn’t re-appear until the following year, as one of fantasy’s greatest heroes: Gandalf in 2001’s The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring. The two roles would keep McKellen sustained for the next decade and beyond, across three more X-Men movies and five more entries nestled within Middle-Earth.Playing the legendary detective in Mr. Holmes and putting in his time as Cogsworth in Beauty and the Beast are more notable recent works, along with more theater adaptations like The Dresser (opposite Anthony Hopkins, both delivering some career-best performances), as well as, er, Cats. At least he knew the nightmare cinematic hairball that was being coughed up! And now, you shall not pass until we rank all Ian McKellen movies by Tomatometer!#40Doogal (2006) 8%#40Adjusted Score: 8.914% Critics Consensus: Overloaded with pop culture references, but lacking in compelling characters and plot, Doogal is too simpleminded even for the kiddies.Synopsis: Legend tells of three magic diamonds that, if in the wrong hands, can be united to create a force powerful...

Though he only had a handful of confirmed kills – Ms. Grundy (Sarah Habel) and the latest Sugarman (Robert Baker) among them – he struck terror into the town while Betty (Lili Reinhart) and Jughead (Cole Sprouse) never found a suspect who “looked good” for the crimes.Not that they had time to remember the case amid break-ups, misdirections and Alice Cooper’s (Mädchen Amick) continued slide into Awesometown.And even though the killer was seemingly unmasked in the mid-season finale, Betty knows the darkness he unleashed is far from over. Also, let’s face it, the person revealed as the Black Hood was something of a letdown. He ticked all the boxes for knowledge and opportunity, but Joseph Svenson&nbsp;(Cameron McDonald) was, ultimately, a cipher who was introduced only two episodes ago and lacked the impact the Black Hood’s identity should have. There is also the fact Archie failed to identify Svenson when he starred him in the eye last week — a fact he was more than willing to dismiss while discussing it with the gang — and the ever-present possibility that Svenson did not work alone. With that in mind, we present five Riverdale characters we are leaving tacked up on our conspiracy board as Svenson’s conspirators or the true dark heart behind the Black Hood.Hiram LodgeHe’s been a suspect since the first season ended with Fred Andrews (Luke Perry) getting shot at Pop’s Chock’lit Shoppe. The motive was so simple then: revenge for Fred and Hermione’s (Marisol Nichols) affair. Now, the stakes are bigger. All season long, Hiram (Mark Consuelos) and Hermione have engaged in shady dealings to put the Southside in a very bad position. Their apparent intent: redevelop the whole district and reap the rewards of creeping capitalism. While it often seemed Hiram is just using the Black Hood situation (and Alice’s grandstanding) to his advantage, is it possible he was directing Svenson all along?We were told repeatedly in the first season that he is a powerful man. He even orchestrated the attack on Andrews Construction last season from inside his cell. At the time, it was viewed as retaliation for the affair, but perhaps he was not done hurting Fred and hired someone to kill him while still inside. Once Archie’s (KJ Apa) father survived the attack, Hiram turned the “random” assault into the Black Hood, using Svenson’s personal tragedy and guilt to give him a new lethal purpose. Also, directing a spree killer sure comes in handy when one wants to make the Southside look irredeemable so one can turn it into a giant Zara.Provided, of course, he was pulling Svenson’s strings all along.The big problem with Hiram as the mind behind Black Hood is the Betty connection. The killer knows a lot about her and states he was present for her speech during the first season finale, something Hiram definitely did not witness. Svenson could have been going off mission with Betty or, perhaps, he hid his fascination with her from Hiram. But that still leaves the question of what he and Hermione told Veronica (Camila Mendes) about the family business. Considering she flatly refused to do anything illegal, just how plausibly can one deny inspiring a serial killer?Sheriff KellerWhile Chapter Twenty, “Tales from the Darkside” explained away Sheriff Keller’s (Martin Cummins) strange behavior as a side effect of his affair with Mayor McCoy (Robin Givens), it doesn’t completely rule him out as a suspect either. Neither does appearing on the scene to shoot Svenson at the most convenient of moments. It is entirely possible to think he cracked under the pressure or, perhaps, was tied somehow to the men in Svenson’s photo. Maybe he knew all about the Riverdale Reaper and always fantasized about showing the town its own dark, black heart. Add in the details of Jason Blossom’s murder and you have the ignition for Keller’s long held wish to bathe the town in blood.Also, torturing Betty a few chapters ago could be viewed as Keller getting back at the pushy girl reporter who will not leave well enough alone.Granted, being the town sheriff, stepping out with the Mayor and becoming the Black Hood leaves precious little time for sleep or keeping up with his fitness regimen. He also provided Betty with enough alibis to exclude the whole sheriffs department. But Svenson could have been the triggerman while Keller planned the killings, the notes, and the phone calls. It would certainly explain why Archie never recognized his eyes whenever they crossed paths.Although, if you go back and look at the scene,&nbsp; Sheriff Keller’s T-Zone resembles the man who shot Fred far more than Svenson’s does.Comes to think of it, Archie’s eye-witness testimony was the crucial piece of evidence used to eliminate Svenson last week. Is his memory of the shooter’s eyes faulty? Midge (Emilija Baranac) recalled the Black Hood’s eyes as blank. And while we know Archie believes his memory of the killer’s green eyes to be true, 19 years of Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit has taught us that witness identification is often faulty.Hal CooperYes, we’ve been down this road before with Betty’s father Hal (Lochlyn Munro). Last time around, she suspected him of killing Jason and learned the harrowing Cooper secret: their relationship to the Blossoms. All that pent up anguish could lead a man to kill. Maybe, even, fabricate a whole ethos to obscure his true intention. When you consider the Betty connection and Hal’s overall creepiness, he starts to look good for it.Also, he’s been extremely quiet this season. He collected Betty from Keller’s office two episodes ago, but otherwise, he just stands in the background while Alice does something spectacular. Is it possible he is lashing out because of her behavior?To be fair, the characterization of Hal thus far does not suggest he is capable of murder. Then again, he is not a well-drawn character. But that brings us back to the Archie problem. If we assume his memory is not as shaky as a SVU day player, then he should recognize the eyes of Fred’s assailant as Betty’s father, right? If this one detail is so meaningful, then it cannot be dismissed as easily as it seemed to be in the mid-season finale.Or, perhaps, it’s just Hal’s fate to always be on the suspects lists as an eternal red herring.Betty’s Brother ChicThis suspect relies on two pieces of information: that fact we know the character is scheduled to appear and that incident at the Riverdale Reaper house.Shortly before the second season debuted in October, TVLine broke the news that actor Hart Denton would play Betty’s long lost brother Chic. While he has yet to appear, Chic’s story line was said to begin around the mid-season point. He has to fit into the show’s tapestry somehow. Perhaps it is just a reconciliation with Alice, who revealed last season that she gave up Chic for adoption as he was the result of her wild says at Southside High. But, perhaps, there is more to his return.With Chic established as an eventuality, let’s take another look at that night in the Reaper House and Betty staring into that mirror while wearing the Black Hood. &nbsp;As she saw herself, the killer said he wanted her to recognize that they were the same. If Chic is the Black Hood mastermind, then part of his plan is getting Betty — or Dark Betty — to join his twisted crusade.His overall motive is obvious: revenge on the entire society that cast him aside. He also connects back to Betty and happens to be someone Archie cannot eliminate because he has never seen Chic in person. But then why choose to shoot Fred Andrews? The Black Hood seems to know everything going on in town, so it is possible Chic has been spying on everyone for a very long time (he may even be the person spying on Archie and Veronica). Maybe he is using his reign of terror to push Archie toward Betty. Could his rampage also be a means to restore his favorite OTP?Also, he and Svenson both ended up at the Sisters of Quiet Mercy, which is just a bad news place all around.But then again, he also seems like an obvious suspect (for this or a future crime) by virtue of being absent. And to cast one last bit of doubt on this suspect: Denton looks nothing like Fred’s assailant. Although, Archie’s willingness to assume his memory was wrong definitely casts doubt on using the constant flashbacks to that scene as reliable evidence.The Riverdale ReaperIf Svenson knew he fingered the wrong man as the Riverdale Reaper, it is possible that older spree killer is still on the loose and, perhaps, inspired Svenson to kill with the same mindgames Svenson inflicted on Betty.And even if Svenson acted alone the whole time, the mystery of the Reaper’s identity is once again unsolved. An intolerable state in the Riverdale world.When Svenson was a boy, he identified a traveling preacher as the man who gunned down his family. A Riverdale posse made up of Betty’s (presumably paternal) grandfather, Cheryl’s Nana Rose (the always stellar Barbara Wallace) and three other unidentified men tracked the preacher down to a motel and, after telling Nana Rose to go home, buried the preacher alive. If Svenson is to be believed, this was the town’s original sin; from which Moose’s Jingle-jangle habit, the Lodges’ deviousness, the Blossoms’ whole V.C. Andrews shtick and Ms. Grundy’s penchant for boys all originate.It sounds grandiose, but if Svenson was correct to doubt his identification, than who really killed his family?One thing that makes the Reaper hard to track is his presumably advanced age. If Betty’s grandfather is dead and Nana Rose is often lost to old age dementia, than the Reaper — if he’s not the man Svenson identified — should still have shuffled off the stage long ago. Unless, of course, he is part of the weirdness in Greendale. Or if you want something more fitting the usual reality of Riverdale, the Reaper could have a descendant interested in sowing discord and fear around the town. Svenson may have just been the first part of a grander design. Perhaps this was the man who shot Fred Andrews while Svenson terrorized everyone else.And if all of Riverdale’s sins originate from this one crime, then it might behoove Betty to learn the identities of the other men in the photo.Though it would seem the Black Hood’s reign of terror is over, there are too many lingering doubts to definitely say Svenson was the sole perpetrator. The final moments of the mid-season finale seemed more than happy to wrap everything up — from Svenson’s ability to know about Grundy to Archie’s willingness to set aside his memory of the attack — and move on to something new. In fact, it was a little too happy to move on. But Betty’s reluctance to burn the hood she was given in Chapter Twenty suggests the Black Hood may still have a few surprise left to reveal.Riverdale returns on Wednesday, January 17 at&nbsp;8 p.m. ET/PT on The CW.","section":"Comics on TV","tags":"telelvision, cats, Mary, Originals, Christmas, AMC, Films, twilight, Stephen, FOX, Masterpiece, PaleyFest, Family, Fall","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/14162843/Riverdale-veronica-jughead-betty-600x314.jpg","slug":"riverdale-characters-who-still-look-good-for-the-black-hood"},{"id":"47508764065290","title":"Critics Consensus: The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies is a Solid Sendoff","content":"Critics Consensusvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Critics Consensus: The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies is a Solid SendoffPlus, Night at the Museum is so-so, Annie hits a sour note, and Wild is Certified Fresh.by Tim Ryan | December 19, 2014 |  CommentsThis week at the movies, we’ve got Middle-earth warriors (The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies, starring Martin Freeman and Ian McKellen), a world-travelling night watchman (Night at the Museum: Secret of the Tomb, starring Ben Stiller and Robin Williams), a streetwise orphan (Annie, starring Quvenzhane Wallis and Jamie Foxx), and a determined hiker (Wild, starring Reese Witherspoon and Laura Dern). What do the critics have to say?The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies 59%It would be nearly impossible for director Peter Jackson to top — or even equal — the sweep and grandeur of the Lord of the Rings movies, and while the reviews for the first two Hobbit films were generally positive, many found something lacking. Critics say The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies brings this trilogy to a close in reasonably rousing fashion, but while the battle scenes are visually striking, the story is more than a little thin. After going up against the fire-breathing dragon Smaug, Bilbo (Martin Freeman), Gandalf (Ian McKellen), and makeshift battalions of men, elves, and dwarfs must join forces to fight off an onslaught of orcs and restore order to Middle-earth. The pundits say that Jackson’s visual sense is as strong as ever, but this conclusion to The Hobbit saga lacks the human touch and weightiness that made the Lord of the Rings films such revered classics. (Check out our Hobbit Headquarters for much more on The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies, including features, interviews, and countdowns.)Night at the Museum: Secret of the Tomb 47%At this point, you pretty much know what you’re getting with a Night at the Museum movie: a few good laughs, a bunch of famous people playing historical figures, and little to offend — or stir — anyone in your family. Critics say that’s basically the deal with Night at the Museum: Secret of the Tomb, which offers up some decent slapstick and a few new faces but never quite coalesces into anything truly enchanting. This time out, Larry Daley (Ben Stiller) finally ventures outside the stuffy confines of those crazy museums; instead, he goes on a globe-trotting mission to preserve the magic that animates the museum’s historical populace. The pundits say Secret of the Tomb will probably please the kiddies, and Robin Williams shines in one of his last performances, but it’s largely a slack, so-so affair. (Take a look at this week’s Total Recall, in which we count down Stiller’s best-reviewed movies.)Annie 28%Annie is one of Broadway’s most durable and beloved productions, but it hasn’t fared nearly as well on the big screen. John Huston’s 1982 version drew decidedly mixed reviews, but critics say this update is even more of a misfire, a surprisingly tuneless, left-footed affair in which a number of big names deliver performances of wildly varying quality. Quvenzhané Wallis stars as the titular orphan, who lives with a mean foster mom until Will Stacks (Jamie Foxx), a businessman with political ambitions, takes her in. The pundits say that while Wallis is charming, the biggest problem is that this Annie is a musical starring talented people who, with a few exceptions, aren’t necessarily the best singers or dancers. (Watch our interviews with Wallis, Foxx, and co-stars Rose Byrne, Cameron Diaz, and Bobby Cannavale.)Wild 88%After winning strong reviews in limited release, Wild is going wide this weekend, and it’s already generating Oscar buzz for the strength of Reese Witherspoon’s lead performance. Based upon the bestselling memoir from Cheryl Strayed, Wild is the story of a woman reeling from the death of her mother and her recent divorce who decides to walk the entire Pacific Crest Trail by herself in an attempt to get back on track. The critics say this Certified Fresh drama is a thoughtful, emotionally potent character study with strong performances and beautiful natural locations.What’s Hot on TV:Homeland (Certified Fresh at 81 percent) wraps up its fourth season Sunday night, and critics say the show has had been smart, tense, and focused, making for the strongest iteration since its hard-hitting first season.Thanks to some smart, creative storytelling and spectacular performances, The Affair (Certified Fresh at 94 percent), which has its season finale on Sunday night, is a somber, bewitching exploration of truth and desire.Also opening this week in limited release:The Duke Of Burgundy, a drama about an erotic relationship between two entomologists in a lavish country estate, is at 100 percent.Tales Of The Grim Sleeper, Nick Broomfield‘s investigation into the infamous L.A. serial killer, is at 100 percent.Mike Leigh‘s Mr. Turner, starring Timothy Spall as the eccentric landscape painter J.M.W.

The British-born Cohen gained a cult following in the states with his cult hit Da Ali G Show, then went on to big-screen fame with the gut-busting, wince-inducing gonzo mock doc Borat. This week he’s back with another of his alter egos: the flamboyant Austrian fashionista Bruno. And since Bruno toys with narrative while tweaking real life, we at RT decided to do a brief history of the mockumentary (in chronological order of release).[tomatometer]MuzeID=1064143[/tomatometer]David Holzman’s Diary (1967)Jim McBride’s satire on cinema verite filmmaking may not be the first mockumentary — for example, Peter Watkins’ little-seen The War Game, a fake news doc about a nuclear attack on Britain, was produced two years before. Still, Diary was a remarkable formal breakthrough, and a key work of American independent cinema. In the movie, the unemployed and possibly Vietnam-bound cinephile David (L.M. Kit Carson) attempts to chronicle virtually every aspect of his life, but his endeavor is met with disdain (and sometimes violence) from the people around him. Shot over five days on a minuscule budget, McBride’s film was a goof on the hyper-seriousness of the documentary process, and laid the groundwork for movies that blurred the line between real life and fiction. “Where most independent productions are founded on self-righteous claims of truth and honesty, McBride’s film wittily observes that Hollywood has no corner on illusionism,” wrote Dave Kehr of the Chicago Reader.[tomatometer]MuzeID=1017281[/tomatometer]Real Life (1979)At this point, few viewers are likely to believe that reality television isn’t manipulated in some way, be it by heavy editing, music cues, or intentional omissions. Albert Brooks’ directorial debut Real Life satirized such conventions before they became commonplace. Brooks stars as an intrusive, egocentric filmmaker who decides to film the daily doings of an average American family. However, rather than allowing for journalistic detachment, he arrogantly attempts to control his subjects’ lives in order to make a more compelling movie. Made in the wake of PBS’s pioneering reality show An American Family, Real Life deftly demonstrates that reality is hard to come by when the cameras are rolling. Larry Carroll of Countingdown.com called it “a great, underrated, lost gem of a film that accurately predicted and lampooned reality television long before it ever came to be.”[tomatometer]MuzeID=1151480[/tomatometer]Cannibal Holocaust (1980)By their nature, mockumentaries make us uneasy; the dividing line between fact and fiction is part of the genre’s appeal. However, Cannibal Holocaust did more than disquiet audiences – its director, Ruggero Deodato, was arrested in Italy on charges he’d made a snuff film. Cannibal Holocaust is the story of four documentarians who go missing while filming indigenous peoples in the rainforests of South America. When an anthropologist finds their footage, he learns the distressing, depraved nature of their deaths. Despite the grisly realism of the murders depicted in the film, no humans were actually killed during the making of Cannibal Holocaust (a fact that allowed Deodato to be released from jail), but a number of animals were slaughtered on camera, which led the movie to be banned in several countries. “The effect is now familiar, but back then it was incredibly shocking, as most viewers believed every word of it,” wrote Christopher Null of Filmcritic.com.Warning: NSFW on any level.[tomatometer]MuzeID=1024428[/tomatometer]Zelig (1983)Woody Allen’s strange tale of a “human chameleon” is unique in his body of work; it’s also technically stunning. Allen stars as the title character, a 1930s-era man with the ability to transform himself to fit in with the people around him. Zelig’s story is told in the form of a contemporary documentary, with “academics” and “historians” providing insight into the life and fame of the protagonist. Made 11 years before Forrest Gump, Zelig utilized bluescreen technology to integrate Allen with archive footage; he shows up alongside such noteworthy figures as Charlie Chaplin, Babe Ruth, and Al Capone. Zelig is a “hilarious Woody Allen vehicle, a mockumentary with special effects ahead of its time,” wrote Steve Crum of Dispatch-Tribune Newspapers.[tomatometer]MuzeID=1021274[/tomatometer]This Is Spinal Tap (1984)This is Spinal Tap marks a turning point for the mockumentary form; what was once fodder for cinematic experimenting became a genre unto itself. Rob Reiner’s hilarious faux-chronicle of the decline of a clueless metal band was so spot on in its details that many failed to realize it wasn’t actually a doc; rock legends like Steven Tyler and Eddie Van Halen barely batted an eyelash at Spinal Tap’s misfortunes, and some close to Reiner asked him why he didn’t choose to follow a better-known band. In a modern-day example of life imitating art, the primary members of Tap — Christopher Guest, Michael McKean, and Harry Shearer — actually cut records and played stadiums, and the movie became a back-of-the-bus staple for touring bands. The film’s influence on the mock-doc is easy to spot; the Tap trio has gone on to create such fake flicks as Waiting for Guffman and Best in Show, while the hip hop-skewering Fear of a Black Hat mines similar satirical territory. “There had been countless documentary spoofs before This Is Spinal Tap, but this inspired put-on was the first to actually capture the texture and style of real documentary,” wrote Sean Axmaker of Seanax.com.[tomatometer]MuzeID=1041211[/tomatometer]Bob Roberts (1992)As played by Tim Robins, Bob Roberts is sort of a cross between Joe McCarthy and Woody Guthrie: a demagogue disguised as a guitar-playing populist. This mock record of Roberts’ run for a Pennsylvania senate seat has moments that would seem ludicrous were they not so similar to many modern political campaigns. Roberts sings songs that lampoon progressives while extolling greed; his ingratiating affect does much to disguise his mean-spiritedness. Bob Roberts features some hilarious Bob Dylan parodies, as well as a host of well-played small roles (including John Cusack, Susan Sarandon, James Spader, and, in his debut, Jack Black). Robbins may be an avowed left-winger, but his film is less a shot at conservatives than a satire of the ways in which politics has become another form of show business, with the mass media complicit in the spin cycle. “A sort of political This Is Spinal Tap, Bob Roberts is both a stimulating social satire and, for thinking people, a depressing commentary on the devolution of the American political system,” wrote Todd McCarthy of Variety.[tomatometer]MuzeID=1081197[/tomatometer]Forgotten Silver (1995)Before joining the ranks of superstar directors with the Lord of the Rings trilogy and King Kong, Peter Jackson (and co-director Costa Botes) made this fake tribute to Colin McKenzie, a non-existent New Zealand film pioneer and inventor. In Forgotten Silver, Jackson claims that his discovery of McKenzie’s work proves he’s the creator of modern film, with color and sound among his many cinematic innovations; in addition, Jackson “unearthed” pieces of McKenzie’s greatest achievement, an epic adaptation of the tale of Salome. The movie’s fake interviews and recreated archive footage were so effective that many viewers were stunned to learn it wasn’t real; indeed, Jackson subsequently made a 30-minute follow-up, Behind the Bull, to address Forgotten Silver‘s perplexed audience. “Quite aside from being perhaps the most elaborate prank in Jackson’s career to date (or since), Forgotten Silver is a brilliant piece of moviemaking,” wrote Rob Rob Gonsalves of efilmcritic.com.[tomatometer]MuzeID=1088399[/tomatometer]The Blair Witch Project (1999)The Blair Witch Project was a word-of-mouth sensation before the term “viral marketing” entered the mainstream lexicon. Directors Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sánchez’ low-budget, monster-free creepshow — purported to be found footage from three documentarians who were killed in the woods of Maryland on the trail of a legendary local apparition — was passed off as the real thing, and their guerrilla campaign was met with an alarming amount of credulity. It didn’t hurt that the film’s stars expertly improvised their way through many ominous scenarios, each time reacting with a level of increased terror that’s hard to fake. Equally effective (or stomach-churning, depending on one’s point of view) was the shaky, hand-held camerawork shot by the participants, which heightened the feeling of impending doom. “The movie’s unfinished, catch-as-catch-can look, complete with jiggly camerawork and sometimes blurred imagery, is one of the primary reasons it’s so disturbing and creepy,” wrote James Sanford of the Kalamazoo Gazette. (Click here for more on the making of the film from Myrick and Sánchez.)[tomatometer]MuzeID=1161544[/tomatometer]Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan (2006)Disarmingly clueless, heedlessly goofy, and loaded with prejudice, Sacha Baron Cohen’s alter ego Borat is quite a character. And by passing himself off as a TV journalist from Kazakhstan, Cohen was able to elicit some remarkably frank (and stunningly boneheaded) admissions from his subjects. Borat takes the form of a road movie, with its protagonist meeting well-known politicians and average folks across the USA while on a mission to meet (and hopefully wed) a certain Baywatch babe. Some find themselves bemused by this odd stranger, while others end up revealing a dark strain of intolerance in the American psyche. Borat is a serious work of social criticism,” wrote Joe Williams of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, “but it’s also the funniest movie I’ve ever seen.”[tomatometer]MuzeID=1170010[/tomatometer]Surf’s Up (2007)While most mockumentaries purport to tell “real” stories, the genre is remarkably flexible. Case in point: Surf’s Up, a CGI feature that documents the trials and tribulations of a surfing penguin. Cody Maverick (voiced by Shia LaBeouf) is a loner in Antarctica, where his obsession with riding the waves are mocked by his penguin peers. Surf’s Up follows Cody as he prepares to compete against a number of talented birds in Big Z Memorial Surf Off, named for Cody’s boyhood idol. The film parodies sports programming, talking-heads docs, and surf films like The Endless Summer; it’s remarkably sophisticated for a kids flick, but never forgets to entertain. “Many of the riffs in the mock documentary might be lost on little tykes, but the film’s feel-good message of perseverance, friendship and finding your own wave should be enjoyed by all,” wrote Kevin Crust of the Los Angeles Times.Take a look through the rest of our Total Recall archives.

At the time, America was mired deep in a losing Vietnam War slog just as its citizens lost faith in their social institutions, a mood reflected in Last House‘s success, announcing audiences’ new appetite for gritty, grubby, boundary-pushing cinema. Craven, already hardened beyond most normal sensibilities after a previous career directing pornographic films under different nom de guerres, knew how to push the violence, sex, and rage right up to the edge.With aspirations to emerge from the horror grotto, Craven nonetheless returned to the genre in 1977 with the agitated, belligerent The Hills Have Eyes, which transported the menace of Last House into the desert mountains.The ’80s were the golden age of slasher movies, with thanks in no small part to Craven. He dipped his toe into the subgenre with 1981’s Deadly Blessing, before making the enormous slashy splash with A Nightmare on Elm Street. Dozens of slashers were being released a year by 1984, but it was Craven’s bright idea to freshen things up by bringing the supernatural into the mix, thus creating one of horror’s great icons: Freddy Krueger, as portrayed by Robert Englund.Horror films had a tough go at it in the ’90s, both creatively and at the box office, with Craven one of few genre directors to survive with a career intact. Always one to infuse satire and literacy into&nbsp;the shocks wherever he could, Craven turned to meta-textual tricks for New Nightmare and Scream. The latter fit like a knife in snug flesh with the decade’s laid-back cynicism, ushering in a new age of teen slashers.Highlights of Craven’s post-Scream career include, of course, the well-received first sequel, directing Meryl Streep to an Academy Award nomination in Music of the Heart, and the Certified Fresh thriller Red Eye. Scream 4, in 2011, would become his final movie – and it just recently ticked over onto Fresh territory.

Wild, wonderful, wicked stuff. He did it in a way everyone could relate to: With clarity and purpose of thought, bursting from a deeply humanistic viewpoint, while tacking on an occasional one-liner that could knock a celebrity’s career off its tracks. His greatest gift was making film criticism accessible to the masses. Ebert pulled his profession out from literary magazines and newspaper back pages, popularizing the medium to the point where movie review aggregation websites could one day become a sustainable venture.\nBefore he passed away in 2013, he tactfully amassed a list of over 350 4-star/thumbs-up films that he called Great Movies.

Thumbnail image: Universal/courtesy Everett Collection; Warner Bros./courtesy Everett Collection.)All Michelle Pfeiffer Movies, Ranked By TomatometerIt was no instant&nbsp;rise to fame for Michelle Pfeiffer, who began her movie career with ’80s teen fluff like The Hollywood Knights and an ill-advised revival of Charlie Chan. Even when she moved up to star status just a year later with Grease 2, it did more harm than good to her career. Both Brian De Palma and Al Pacino resisted auditioning Pfeiffer for Scarface, until they were convinced by producer Martin Bergman. Reason prevailed and she was cast as Tony Montana’s drug-addled girlfriend, and Pfeiffer began to draw national attention thanks to the role.Pfeiffer’s immediate post-Scarface projects, like Ladyhawke and Sweet Liberty, reveal an actress trying get out of the bimbos-and-trophy-wives pigeonhole, eventually finding both commercial and critical success in 1987’s The Witches of Eastwick. The devilish John Updike adaptation showcased Pfeiffer as an arch comedic performer, able to pull off some strange material, which audiences would see more of in the following year’s Married to the Mob. This kicked off the most rewarding phase of Pfeiffer’s career, resulting in three Oscar nominations (Dangerous Liaisons, The Fabulous Baker Boys, and Love Field), working with Martin Scorsese (The Age of Innocence), and being crowned a box office queen with her pop culture-defining role as Catwoman in Batman Returns.Dramas would be her bread and butter (Dangerous Minds, A Thousand Acres, The Deep End of the Ocean, The Story of Us, I Am Sam, White Oleander) up until a hiatus in 2003. She returned in 2007 with three movies: Amy Heckerling’s I Could Never Be Your Woman, cult fantasy favorite Stardust, and the musical Hairspray, which put her together with original Grease alum John Travolta. Her following movies didn’t quite live up to that big re-emergence, including a Batman Returns reunion with Tim Burton on Dark Shadows, and she took another hiatus until 2017. That’s when we got another triple hitter with The Wizard of Lies as Ruth Madoff, Darren Aronofsky’s allegorical freakout mother!, and the opulent Murder on the Orient Express. She drew some of the best reviews of her career in 2018 with Where Is Kyra?, the same year she boarded the MCU as Janet van Dyne in Ant-Man and the Wasp. Her latest film was Maleficent: Mistress of Evil, as Queen Ingrith. And now we’ve gathered her body of work for all Michelle Pfeiffer movies ranked!#44New Year's Eve (2011) 7%#44Adjusted Score: 11.088% Critics Consensus: Shallow, sappy, and dull, New Year's Eve assembles a star-studded cast for no discernible purpose.Synopsis: New Year's Eve celebrates love, hope, forgiveness, second chances and fresh starts, in the intertwining stories told amidst the pulse...

The Paramount release saw its four-day gross dip 13% to an estimated $38.3M which lifted the cume to a sturdy $141.2M allowing the new chapter to surpass the $134M final domestic take of the previous film in the series, 2006’s Mission: Impossible 3, in a mere 18 days of release. Successfully reviving a franchise that was thought to be dead, the $145M-budgeted Ghost Protocol is now on track to reach the $200M mark while the global gross is on a trajectory to smash the $500M barrier.Overseas, the newest Mission: Impossible ruled for the third consecutive frame with an estimated $37M over the standard Friday-to-Sunday period from 54 markets for a robust international cume to date of $225.3M and global tally of $366.5M. Leading territory totals include $35.7M in Japan, $34.8M in Korea, $14.8M in France, $12.7M in the U.K., $12.2M in Russia, and $10.1M in India. With key markets like China and Italy still to open, the overseas tally will climb well above $300M.Finishing the long weekend in second place was the season’s other star-driven action sequel, Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows, which experienced a similar 15% slide to an estimated $26.5M over the Friday-to-Monday period. The big-budget Warner Bros. film has now grossed $136.5M after 18 days of play and is running 18% behind the $166.4M of its 2009 predecessor with Christmas and New Year’s included in both totals. A final of $175-200M seems likely putting it below the $209M of the first Sherlock.Following Robert Downey Jr. for the third straight weekend, the G-rated kidpic Alvin and the Chipmunks: Chipwrecked enjoyed a 8% bump to an estimated $21M boosting the sum to $97.4M. The Fox pic is running 34% behind the pace of the first Alvin from 2007 which also opened in mid-December before the big holiday bump family films receive when schools close for Christmas. Chipwrecked may end up in the $130-140M range.Holiday holdovers hope to keep the cash rolling in through mid-January since most college students are still out of school. Plus only one new film opens wide next weekend – the horror film The Devil Inside in 2,000+ theaters – so there will be little competition from new players until January 13 which is the start of the lucrative four-day Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. holiday weekend which tends to be very busy at multiplexes.In its first full weekend of release, Steven Spielberg’s War Horse grossed an estimated $19.2M over four days from 2,547 locations for a solid $7,546 average which was second best among wide releases after Ghost Protocol. Disney’s release of the DreamWorks production has resulted in $45.2M in the nine days since its Christmas Day debut last Sunday. A final take of around $75M may result unless it shows strong legs.Slipping a notch to fifth place was 2011’s top-grossing R-rated drama, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, which took in an estimated $19M over four days raising the 13-day total to $60M. The Friday-to-Monday take was off a scant 3% giving the Sony title a better hold than the other two major movies playing to mature adults – Mission: Impossible and Sherlock Holmes – which saw declines of 13% and 15% respectively. The American remake of the popular Swedish crime thriller should easily reach $90M and could possibly even hit the $100M mark in North America.Matt Damon’s family dramedy We Bought a Zoo followed with an estimated $16.5M representing a 13% jump over its Christmas weekend debut. The Fox title has banked $44M in 11 days. Close behind was Spielberg’s second offering of the season, The Adventures of Tintin, with an estimated $15M raising the total to $50.8M in 13 days. Unlike other films aimed at the family audience, this PG-rated adventure saw its weekend decline as the figure eased by 1%.The Warner Bros. dud New Year’s Eve profited from its namesake holiday and saw sales soar by 49% to an estimated $7.7M. With $47.4M to date, the all-star comedy should see its numbers tumble into the new year now that its story is no longer relevant. Bad word-of-mouth won’t help either.The 3D alien attack thriller The Darkest Hour ranked ninth with an estimated $5.3M, up 4%, giving Summit a modest $14.2M thus far. Oscar hopeful The Descendants rounded out the top ten surging 30% to an estimated $4.3M putting the Fox Searchlight hit at $40.3M with much of awards season still to go. Golden Globe wins and key Oscar nominations could keep the George Clooney film going all through January.Sneaking in right before the end-of-year Oscar deadline were some awards contenders in platform release. Leading the way with a bang was Meryl Streep’s Margaret Thatcher pic Iron Lady which bowed to an estimated $280,000 from just four locations for a scorching $70,102 average over four days for The Weinstein Co. Sony Classics opened the acclaimed Iranian film A Separation in three sites and grossed an estimated $79,000 for a strong $26,494 average over the long weekend. The film has been a dominant force during awards season in the foreign language race and is one of 63 films vying for the five Oscar nods in that category. The critically acclaimed lesbian drama Pariah bowed to an estimated $65,000 from four houses for a respectable $16,273 average and $102,000 since its Wednesday launch.The top ten films grossed an estimated $172.8M over four days which was up from last year’s three-day frame when Little Fockers stayed in the top spot with $25.8M; but down from 2009 when Avatar remained at number one with a huge $68.5M in is third round. The overall marketplace over the long holiday session was up only 3% from six years ago when New Year’s Day last fell on a Sunday indicating a substantial drop in attendance since ticket prices have climbed by more than 20% during that time.Follow Gitesh on Twitter!","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"child's","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-Mission-Impossible-Stays-On-Top"},{"id":"47508716407906","title":"All John Cusack Movies Ranked","content":"\n\n                        \n                            \n                            \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                    \n                                                \n(Photo by Buena Vista/ courtesy Everett Collection)\n\nAll&nbsp;John Cusack Movies Ranked\nJohn Cusack pulled off the tricky act of being one of those It kids of the ’80s without having that distinction become an albatross hanging across his career once the decade ended. Cusack found breakthrough roles in just about every permutation of the teen comedy in the spandex and big-hair era: the hormonal-driven (One Crazy Summer), the bizarro creations (Better Off Dead), the rom-com (The Sure Thing). But Cusack had an erudite quality that separated him from his contemporaries, drawing him to name directors like John Sayles (Eight Men Out) and Cameron Crowe, the latter&nbsp;of whom he worked with to close out the decade with perhaps the best romantic-comedy in a decade full of classics: 1989’s Say Anything….\nCusack of the 1990s represented a maturation that allowed him to fit into just about any mold: drama (The Thin Red Line), comedy (Bullets Over Broadway, The Grifters, Being John Malkovich), romance (Pushing Tin), and even action (Con Air). Some movies combined all the genres, like 1997’s Grosse Pointe Blank (in which he plays a hitman attending his high school reunion), one of those high-concept Hollywood movies that endures for decades after release.\n2000’s High Fidelity may have been the last we’ve seen of Cusack in classic rom-com leading man form, as in the ensuing years he’s been putting more work into genre fare, and playing shadowy figures and villains. Highlights from this ongoing period include 1408, 2012, and Grand Piano. Meanwhile, 2015’s Brian Wilson biopic Love &amp; Mercy is just about as good as anything he’s done in his career.

Nelson), some of Hollywood’s funniest fellows trying to touch one another without permission (Tag, starring&nbsp;Ed Helms,&nbsp;Jeremy Renner, and Jon Hamm), and a remade blast from the blaxploitation past (Superfly, starring Trevor Jackson&nbsp;and Jason Mitchell).&nbsp;What are the critics saying?Incredibles 2 (2018)  93%If you’re going to try and follow up an acclaimed blockbuster, you might as well take your time getting the sequel right — and in animation, where time can stand still forever, you have the added benefit of not needing to rush your cast back in front of the camera. Still, after waiting nearly 15 years for a second installment of The Incredibles, fans can be forgiven a certain amount of impatience; while the creative teams at formerly franchise-averse Pixar dreamed up new stories for the characters in Toy Story, Cars, Finding Nemo, and Monsters Inc., the ability to return to theaters continued to elude the superpowered Parr family. All that waiting has finally paid off with Incredibles 2, which reunites the original voice cast for a new adventure serving up more of the domestic turmoil, superhero satire, and brilliantly animated action that made the first one such a hit. It’d be tough to improve on the original Incredibles, and critics say that while this sequel doesn’t quite pull off that feat, it comes impressively close, adding yet another acclaimed entry to Pixar’s already estimable filmography. If you were a kid when The Incredibles&nbsp;came out, you might have kids of your own now — and like all the best stuff the studio has put out, the whole family can look forward to enjoying Incredibles 2.Tag (2018)  56%On one hand, it’s easy to believe Hollywood has long since exhausted most of the reasonable possibilities for comedy that exist in movies about grown men acting like boys. On the other, when you’ve got the Wall Street Journal writing about a real-life group of guys who take a month off every year to continue the game of tag they’ve been playing since they were kids, well, it’s awfully hard to resist the temptation to turn that into a film. Enter the descriptively titled Tag, starring Hannibal Buress, Jon Hamm, Ed Helms, Jake Johnson, and Jeremy Renner as the fellows in question — a talented bunch whose commitment to the story was reflected in the set injury Renner sustained, breaking both of his arms and necessitating some last-minute CGI limb replacements in post-production. It would be wonderful to report that Renner’s suffering came in service of one of the year’s best-reviewed action comedies; alas, the truth is that critics are kinda meh on Tag, which reviews describe as funny and engaging in fits and starts, but ultimately not consistent or committed enough to fully deliver on its premise. Still, this is one talented cast, and even the critical pans say the movie isn’t without its moments, so if you’re in the mood for some arrested development laughs, you may want to check your local listings.Superfly (2018)  51%Released in 1972, the original Superfly&nbsp;helped lead the blaxploitation wave with a thoughtful Harlem-set drama about a drug dealer looking for one last big score; the movie’s trappings may look somewhat dated today, but thanks to Ron O’Neal‘s performance as main character Youngblood Priest — not to mention a killer Curtis Mayfield soundtrack — it still feels fresh. It’s easy to understand why music video veteran Director X wanted to take a shot at updating the story, and its themes are just as relevant as they were more than 45 years ago; unfortunately, critics say those themes have mostly been lost in this new version, which is far more focused on style than substance. Starring Trevor Jackson as Priest, the 2018 edition moves the action to Atlanta, but the basic contours of the story remain the same — which is part of why a number of reviews have outlined pundits’ disappointment with the lost social subtext. This Superfly&nbsp;will make its fortune by and by, thanks to Director X’s way with an artfully arranged scene or set piece, but as is so often the case with remakes, the original still reigns supreme.What’s New on TVThe Bold Type: Season 2 (2018)  100%The Bold Type presents an aspirational yet refreshingly realistic portrait of young women’s careers, friendships and love lives in a big city.Strange Angel: Season 1 (2018)  71%A beautiful slow burn, Strange Angel shoots for the stars, but gets a little lost in its own orbit.Also&nbsp;Opening This Week In Limited Release Eating Animals (2018) , a documentary about the commercial factory farming industry and its various impacts, is at 100%.

The stylish, gritty descent into the criminal underworld rocked both sides of the Atlantic, which then gave Ritchie the opportunity to give his style an even slicker, international sheen with Snatch.So synonymous is Ritchie with this style and subject matter that no matter where his career takes him, whenever he returns to this topic it’s always celebrated as a back-to-basics comeback. RocknRolla, for example, helped sweep away the sour tastes of Swept Away and Revolver.And now The Gentlemen has arrived as counterpoint to the blockbuster bombast of Aladdin and King Arthur: Legend of the Sword.

That movie whose box office success could be described as mild, was utterly infinitesimal to Mahew’s other release that year: the original Star Wars. Despite never seeing his face, Mayhew and Chewbacca became synonymous with Force devotees, as he was among the most approachable and accepting of the fandom lifestyle between his co-stars.

She then solidified her Scream Queen status in films like Prom Night and The Fog, as well as a number of Halloween sequels, even as she&nbsp;switched gears to lend her talents to beloved comedies like Trading Places and A Fish Called Wanda. She even found time for family films (Freaky Friday) and action blockbusters (True Lies), proving her versatility extended far beyond simply surviving a slasher threat.

Studio estimates released on Sunday morning showed a slight edge for the Star Wars story, however final grosses on Monday will indicate which film takes the box office crown during the first full weekend of 2017 which also saw winter storms impact some grosses in the eastern parts.If estimates hold, Rogue One will spend its fourth consecutive frame on top, this time grossing an estimated $22M. The Disney smash tumbled a hefty 56%. By comparison, Star Wars: The Force Awakens dropped 53% a year ago when coming off of New Year’s weekend but grossed nearly twice as much with $42.4M in its fourth lap.Rogue One continues to run 41% behind the pace of TFA and has boosted its domestic cume to a fantastic $477.3M. The rebels have now broken into the Top 10 on the list of all-time domestic blockbusters sitting at number eight and bumping down Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace in the process. By the end of this week, Rogue One will surpass Finding Dory to become the highest-grossing film from 2016 and will eventually challenge The Dark Knight&nbsp;for number six on the all-time list.China finally got Rogue One this weekend and delivered a $31M opening weekend over three days. That’s down 48% from the first three days (Saturday-to-Monday) for Force Awakens a year ago this same weekend when it launched there. Star Wars movies skew heavily towards American audiences on the world stage, but more appeal in China was expected on Rogue One given the casting of Donnie Yen and Wen Jiang in the main cast. Overall, international markets grossed $56.6M this weekend raising the offshore cume to $437.1M and the global haul to $914.4M. Domestic accounts for 52%.With this weekend’s results, Disney now controls the five highest-grossing global blockbusters of 2016 with Captain America: Civil War, Finding Dory,&nbsp;Zootopia, The Jungle Book, and Rogue One. They have collected a combined $5.1 billion to date with the Mouse House pulling off jaw-dropping dominance of the film industry over the past year. Rogue One may have around $200M in worldwide box office still to come.Fox’s hit NASA scientist film Hidden Figures did stellar numbers in limited release over the holidays and used this weekend to catapult itself into national play and the strategy worked like gangbusters. Exceeding all expectations, the PG-rated pic grossed an estimated $21.8M from 2,471 locations for a sizzling $8,822 average. Cume is $24.8M.Powered by terrific reviews, solid buzz from the limited run, and a strong marketing push, Hidden Figures connected with audiences who overwhelmingly enjoyed what they saw. It earned a rare A+ CinemaScore which bodes very well for the road ahead as audiences recommend the film to others. Plus next weekend’s long Martin Luther King holiday frame should help make for a sturdy sophomore performance. And direct competition throughout January is not fierce.Anchored by Taraji P. Henson, Octavia Spencer and Janelle Monáe and co-starring Kirsten Dunst, Jim Parsons, Mahershala Ali, and Kevin Costner, Hidden Figures offered ample starpower while the true story of three African American women at NASA in the 1960s was a major draw too.Studio data showed that the audience for Hidden Figures was 64% female and 56% over 35. Given the story and the setting this was not surprising. But the racial makeup was broad with whites leading the way with 43% of the audience, blacks at 37%, and others at 20%. Produced for only $25M, a road leading to the $100M mark cannot be ruled out at this point given the promising month ahead.The animated blockbuster Sing cracked the $200M mark this weekend and stands as 2016’s top grossing movie to never reach the number one spot. Universal’s toon sensation fell 54% in only its third weekend to an estimated $19.6M lifting the cume to a robust $213.4M. Breaking a quarter-billion seems possible in North America and the new worldwide total sits at $356.9M with many key international markets yet to open.Kate Beckinsale’s latest vampire flick Underworld: Blood Wars posted a moderate opening weekend in fourth place with an estimated $13.1M from 3,070 locations for a so-so $4,267 average. That was by far the worst debut ever for the five-film franchise as all other installments opened in the $20-27M range from 2003 to 2012. But the Underworld series is more about international markets. The last two films that Beckinsale starred in – 2006’s Evolution and 2012’s Awakening – both grossed an identical $62.3M in North America, however, overseas grosses rose dramatically and overtook domestic on the latter chapter.Blood Wars will still try to be a little moneymaker for Sony and its Screen Gems unit. The production cost was $35M, nearly half of the previous pic’s budget. And international markets have matured even more. The studio began its roll-out abroad over a month ago launching two weeks ahead of Rogue One grossing over $45M from dozens of territories and many major markets (like much of Europe) are still to come.La La Land continued its successful expansion doubling its run from 750 to 1,515 locations this weekend just in time for the Golden Globes where it is expected to win lots of love. The Lionsgate release grossed an estimated $10M which was up 5% from last weekend and averaged a solid $6,601 per location. Cume is now $51.7M as the Ryan Gosling-Emma Stone hit dances its way towards the $100M mark. A special run on IMAX screens will debut next weekend adding even more to the purse.The sci-fi adventure Passengers fell 46% to an estimated $8.8M giving Sony $80.9M from North America with hopes of reaching the century club. Global is now up to $185M with China launching next weekend. The Fox comedy Why Him? followed with an estimated $6.5M, down 35%, for a new sum of $48.6M.Disney’s big animated hit Moana placed eighth in its seventh weekend with an estimated $6.4M, off 42%, pushing the domestic haul to $225.4M. Overseas saw $20M this weekend thanks in part to its debut in Brazil. International stands at $224.7M while the global tally is $450.1M with Korea opening next week and Japan to launch in March. For the studio’s other 2016 toon hit Zootopia, Japan was the second biggest foreign market behind only China.Denzel Washington’s Fences took a big hit falling 53% to an estimated $4.7M putting Paramount at $40.7M. Unless major Oscar nominations come its way, a final in the area of $55M seems likely which would be the lowest gross for Washington in a lead role in more than 13 years. Rounding out the top ten was the action title Assassin’s Creed with an estimated $3.8M, down 56%, for a $49.5M cume for Fox.The top ten films grossed an estimated $116.7M which was down 18% from last year when Star Wars: The Force Awakens stayed at number one with $42.4M; but up 11% from 2015 when Taken 3 opened in the top spot with $39.2M.Get earlier box office updates and analysis by following BoxOfficeGuru.com on Twitter.","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"Stephen, Diego, Company, Quiz, television, Network, Fall, Disney, Alien","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/08131441/rogure-fea.jpg","slug":"box-office-hidden-figures-challenges-rogue-one-for-1-spot"},{"id":"47508739498284","title":"Hellboy Fails to Catch Fire","content":"Critics Consensusvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Hellboy Fails to Catch FirePlus, Missing Link is another Laika triumph, Little is slight, and Fosse/Verdon season 1 is Certified Fresh.by Ryan Fujitani | April 11, 2019 |  CommentsThis weekend at the movies,&nbsp;we’ve&nbsp;got a&nbsp;snarky superhero (Hellboy, starring&nbsp;David Harbour&nbsp;and&nbsp;Milla Jovovich),&nbsp;a personable primate (Missing Link, featuring the voices of&nbsp;Zach Galifianakis&nbsp;and&nbsp;Hugh Jackman),&nbsp;the opposite of&nbsp;Big&nbsp;(Little, starring&nbsp;Issa Rae&nbsp;and&nbsp;Regina Hall), and&nbsp;a coed romance (After, starring&nbsp;Josephine Langford&nbsp;and&nbsp;Hero Fiennes Tiffin). What are the critics saying?Hellboy (2019)  18%Back in 2004, Guillermo del Toro had arguably his first true mainstream success with an adaptation of a Mike Mignola comic series about a half-demon superhero with a dark sense of humor; that movie was Certified Fresh and went on to spawn an even better-reviewed sequel. Fifteen years later, we get a reboot of the character, with Stranger Things‘ David Harbour taking over for Ron Perlman in the title role, and the reviews have been less than kind. Neil Marshall, the director behind celebrated fan-favorite horror flick The Descent, steps behind the camera here, recounting Hellboy’s origins and setting him against a centuries-old sorceress who just wants to make demon babies with him and rule the world. Unfortunately, critics say Hellboy certainly earns its R rating, but not necessarily in the right ways, mistaking F-bombs and mindless gore for humor and imagination. It’s an unfortunate reimagining of a normally fun character that strands him in a messy, poorly constructed story, then drowns him in blood and severed limbs and hopes the audience won’t notice.Missing Link (2019)  88%Animation studio Laika has put together an impressive string of acclaimed stop-motion projects, beginning with 2009’s Coraline and including, most recently, 2016’s Kubo and the Two Strings. So far, their latest film looks like another triumph. Zach Galifianakis provides the voice of a sasquatch-like creature living in the Pacific Northwest who meets an inquisitive adventurer (Hugh Jackman) and asks him to help him locate a rumored city of his Yeti cousins in the Himalayas. Along the way, they pick up a feisty ex-girlfriend (Zoe Saldana) of the adventurer and visit exotic locales en route to Asia. Critics say Missing Link benefits from exquisitely crafted sets and a pleasant, easygoing vibe that, for a change, doesn’t rely on life-or-death stakes and chooses instead to focus on the budding friendship at its center. It’s an agreeably understated family film that looks beautiful and should inspire a lot of smiles.Little (2019)  46%Remember that Tom Hanks movie from 1988 about a 12-year-old boy who makes a wish and turns into an adult overnight? That movie was Big, so it makes a lot of sense that a similar movie whose plot is basically the same thing in reverse would be called Little. Regina Hall plays a ruthless, verbally abusive CEO who crosses the wrong tween and, thanks to a magic curse, wakes up one day to discover she’s reverted back to her 12-year-old self (played by Marsai Martin). Insecure‘s Issa Rae co-stars as the put-upon assistant who’s not only tasked with figuring out a solution to the predicament, but also with shepherding her de-aged boss through middle school again. Critics are split on Little, which feels a bit safer and lighter on laughs than many would have liked, but which also features some outstanding performances and a few worthy lessons. It may strike some as familiar, but it may be light and breezy enough win over some fans.After (2019)  18%Hollywood is constantly on the hunt for the next literary property they can turn into a franchise, and this week’s After is the latest example. Based on a best-selling novel that began as a series of posts on the internet publishing platform Wattpad, the film follows a young woman (Josephine Langford) who enters college, falls for a rebellious classmate, and begins to question her relationship with her high school sweetheart. It’s the basic template for any young adult-focused romance, in other words, but since it wasn’t widely screened for critics, we can’t really tell you what they think about the movie. Time to guess that Tomatometer!What’s New on TVFosse/Verdon: Miniseries (2019)  81%Sam Rockwell and Michelle Williams give viewers plenty of razzle and dazzle in Fosse/Verdon — a straightforward miniseries that is hampered by rote biographical tropes, but still shimmies with the requisite glitz, grit, and all that jazz audiences crave.Also&nbsp;Opening This Week In Limited Release Penguin Highway (2019) , an animated film from Japan about a brilliant 4th-grader trying to figure out why his town is suddenly visited b penguins, is at 100%.

Her Smell (2019) ,&nbsp;starring Elisabeth Moss in a drama about a former punk rock icon who tries to put her life together after her demons catch up with her, is Certified Fresh at 85%.

Yet here we are, 40 years later, hitting the reset button and returning to the series’ origins. In this week’s Halloween, Jamie Lee Curtis and Nick Castle return to reprise their roles as Laurie Strode and the original Michael Myers, ready to face off again in a direct sequel to the first film that ignores the mythology established across all the previous sequels. Directed by David Gordon Green (Pineapple Express) and co-written by Danny McBride and Jeff Fradley, the film has pleasantly surprised the critics, who call it an effective — and unexpectedly funny — thriller that should satisfy both franchise fans and newcomers alike.The Hate U Give (2018)  97%Some of the most exciting cinema in recent years has come from filmmakers who approach movies as media instruments to enact social change, and the Certified Fresh The Hate U Give&nbsp;is no exception. Amandla Stenberg (a grown up Rue from The Hunger Games) stars as Starr Carter, a black 16-year-old girl straddling two worlds: the poor neighborhood she lives in and the rich white prep school she attends. The precarious balancing act is shattered when Starr witnesses her childhood friend gunned down by police, and she finds herself drawn more and more to activism as she finds her voice and stands up for justice. And this balancing act is coded directly into the movie itself, presenting rage with optimism and hope tempered by desperation — something critics say director George Tillman Jr. pulls of with full conviction, alongside Stenberg’s breakthrough performance.The Old Man &amp; the Gun (2018)  93%Hollywood has long held a fascination for career criminals, especially clever ones, so it’s a little surprising no one thought to adapt the story of Forrest Tucker, a real-life repeat prison escapee who, even at the ripe old age of 79, was arrested for robbing four banks on his own. This week, we get that film, and it stars Robert Redford in what’s being reported as his final role. The film itself focuses on Tucker’s escape from California’s San Quentin Prison at 70 years old and the subsequent string of heists he pulled, and critics are calling it a pleasant ride full of beautiful performances, not least by its retiring star. It remains to be seen if Robert Redford will keep his word about stepping down, but if he does, The Old Man and the Gun serves as a fitting sendoff.What’s New on TVThe Conners: Season 1 (2018)  93%The Conners offers the comforts of its source show, but more focus on the family’s ever-evolving dynamics adds a welcome layer of working-class empathy without losing any of the laughs.Marvel's Daredevil: Season 3 (2018)  97%The Man with No Fear returns to top form with a third season that begins tediously slow but gradually generates comic book thrills, immeasurably helped by the welcome return of Vincent D’Onofrio‘s menacing Kingpin.Wanderlust: Season 1 (2018)  71%Toni Collette creates comedy between the sheets in this unlikely sex-drama from acclaimed playwright Nick Payne for the BBC.Also&nbsp;Opening This Week In Limited Release Can You Ever Forgive Me?

Jordan), a claymation caveman (Early Man, featuring the voices of&nbsp;Eddie Redmayne&nbsp;and&nbsp;Tom Hiddleston), and the Bible’s prequel to Felicity&nbsp;(Samson, starring&nbsp;Taylor James&nbsp;and&nbsp;Jackson Rathbone).&nbsp;What are the critics saying?Black Panther (2018)  96%Over the course of a decade and nearly 20 films, the Marvel Cinematic Universe has proven that the superhero genre can be surprisingly elastic, sending viewers from World War II into the farthest reaches of the galaxy without breaking its blockbuster stride. It has not, however, always been terribly diverse, at least as far as leading opportunities for women and people of color are concerned — a state of affairs that changes in a major way with this weekend’s Black Panther. While we’ve seen the title character in action before — Chadwick Boseman made his debut in the role as part of 2016’s star-studded Captain America: Civil War&nbsp;— this solo coming-out party marks the first time an MCU feature has made room for an African-American hero in the lead, and arguably the first time anyone in Hollywood has done it at all since the Blade&nbsp;trilogy concluded in 2004. If the reviews are any indication, it seems altogether likely that this will be far from the last. Critics say director Ryan Coogler, helming only his third feature after Fruitvale Station&nbsp;and Creed, has delivered a richly rewarding action adventure that balances thrilling set pieces against thought-provoking themes — each component brought to life by a stellar ensemble cast led by Boseman and rounded out by Michael B. Jordan, Lupita Nyong’o, Letitia Wright,&nbsp;Daniel Kaluuya, Angela Bassett, and Forest Whitaker. It all adds up to a movie whose unique importance extends well beyond the MCU, but never forgets to have all the fun that’s made Marvel such a box office behemoth.Early Man (2018)  81%Painstaking craft doesn’t always translate to popcorn entertainment value, but in the case of Aardman Animations, they’ve gone reliably hand in hand for decades. From the classic Wallace and Gromit shorts to big-screen hits like Chicken Run, the studio’s stop-motion work has stood in adorable opposition to mainstream animation’s increasingly computer-driven aesthetic — and their seventh full-length feature, Early Man, is no exception. Critics say veteran writer-director Nick Park‘s latest effort is just as visually appealing as anything that bears the Aardman imprint, which makes it easier to forgive the more ordinary story; although audiences have definitely seen plenty of films that tell a sports-driven underdog story with more imagination than this Stone Age soccer tale, families seeking an entertaining diversion could still do far, far worse than spending time with caveman Dug (Eddie Redmayne) and his fellow claymation sapiens.Samson (2018)  25%Most people have at least a passing familiarity with the biblical story of Samson — you know, the strongman whose incredible strength allowed him to whoop on an entire army with nothing but the jawbone of an ass, but who ended up being felled by a fateful haircut — but we’ve never seen it acted out in a big-screen epic starring Rutger Hauer and Billy Zane. Until now, that is: Samson, the latest production from faith-based studio Pure Flix, aims to spin an inspirational, family-friendly drama out of the tale while continuing a string of profitable pictures that includes The Case for Christ&nbsp;and the God’s Not Dead&nbsp;trilogy. Unfortunately, we can’t tell you much about the critical response — as of this writing, only a couple of reviews have trickled in. While we wait, let’s play a round of Guess the Tomatometer!What’s New on TVEverything Sucks!: Season 1 (2018)  71%A flawed series that ticks off all the nostalgia boxes, Everything Sucks! still manages to tug at the heartstrings.Also&nbsp;Opening This Week In Limited Release Tehran Taboo (2018) , an animated drama looking at the lives of young adults in modern Iran, is at 100 percent.

Israel, Esq., co-starring Colin Farrell and Carmen Ejogo). What are the critics saying?Coco (2017)  97%The concept of death isn’t exactly taboo in animation — as any film lover can tell you, countless classic cartoon characters are orphans, and the loss of a loved one has offered the motivation for many an ultimately heartwarming tale. But it’s rare to see a family-friendly movie whose plot is centered around mortality — let alone one that takes pains to honor the traditions of a culture that many viewers consider foreign. Leave it to Pixar to take both leaps with&nbsp;Coco, in which a young Mexican boy named Miguel (Anthony Gonzalez) is caught between his dreams of being a musician and his obligations to his family. With a story (and overall aesthetic) influenced by the Mexican holiday of Día de Muertos,&nbsp;Coco&nbsp;represents a thematic and visual departure for the studio — which is exactly why critics say the movie is such a delight. While audiences can still expect all the tight storytelling craft and attention to detail that’s become synonymous with the Pixar name, the end result is still fresh enough to avoid feeling like formula. Whether&nbsp;Coco‘s characters remind you of your own family or you don’t know your mariachi from your norteño, this looks like a sure thing for families heading out to the theater over the long holiday weekend.Roman J. Israel, Esq. (2017)  55%Denzel Washington is one of our more remarkably gifted working actors, capable of bringing such depth to his performances that even the less compelling entries in his filmography can often be worth watching just for the opportunity to see him in action. All of which is to say that writer-director Dan Gilroy made the right move when he hired Washington to play the lead in Roman J. Israel, Esq., his drama about a principled lawyer whose life is upended when the senior partner in his small firm dies, forcing him to open up to uncomfortable changes — or potentially damaging lapses in ethics. It’s the type of part Washington can be counted on to invest with real feeling even when the screenplay or editing make it difficult; unfortunately, critics say that’s often the case here, adding up to a movie that, while far from a disaster, is also much less than the sum of its award-winning talent. Hardcore Washington or Gilroy fans may want to head to Israel&nbsp;this weekend, but for everyone else, there’s no reason not to wait for the movie’s arrival on home video.What’s New on TVGodless: Miniseries (2017)  84%Vistas and violence root Godless firmly in traditional Western territory, but its female-driven ensemble sets it apart in a male-dominated genre.She's Gotta Have It: Season 1 (2017)  84%Fun, fascinating, and feminist, Spike Lee‘s classic is born again for a new generation.Also&nbsp;Opening This Week In Limited Release Call Me by Your Name (2018) , a coming-of-age romance set in the Italian countryside starring&nbsp;Armie Hammer&nbsp;and&nbsp;Timothée Chalamet, is Certified Fresh at 98 percent.

What do the critics have to say?The Mummy (2017)  16%With Tom Cruise in the lead, the best special effects money can buy, and one of cinema’s most durable characters driving the action, The Mummy&nbsp;is one of the most highly anticipated releases of the year — at least in the Universal boardroom, where execs are counting on it to help launch their Dark Universe tying together reboots of the studio’s classic monster movie franchises. Critics, as ever, are harder to convince — and they certainly haven’t been swayed by The Mummy, which reviews describe as a commerce-driven assemblage of set pieces that’s more concerned with rolling out spinoffs and sequels than telling a compelling story. The gears are already in motion for more of these movies, so there’s still a chance it’ll get better from here, but if you want to watch a fun Mummy&nbsp;movie this weekend, the newest option isn’t your safest bet.It Comes At Night (2017)  87%A vulnerable family waiting out the end of the world in a remote cabin, with unseen threats lurking in the woods…and a mysterious danger potentially waiting within the walls that were supposed to keep them safe. With It Comes at Night, writer-director Trey Edward Shults is playing with an oft-dealt hand, but like Eric Clapton told us, it’s in the way that you use it — and critics agree this movie uses it pretty darn well. Fans of less-is-more horror should find plenty of reasons to sleep with the lights on here, and Shults — who earlier earned acclaim for his debut feature Krisha&nbsp;— is quickly emerging as a filmmaker to watch.Megan Leavey (2017)  85%Many filmmakers have tried and failed to put together a war movie that makes its points effectively without sacrificing character development — or browbeating the audience — and when you throw the heartstring-tugging potential of a dog into the mix, you’re basically begging for a saccharine mess. But critics say the fact-based Megan Leavey, based on the real-life story of a Marine corporal who bonded with a K9 patrol dog during two tours of duty in Iraq, beats the odds by delivering a movie that honors its subjects and its themes with enough grace to compensate for a fairly light touch. It doesn’t reinvent the uplifting drama, but if you’re in the mood for a feelgood movie, this one should hit the spot.Also&nbsp;Opening This Week In Limited Release Dawson City: Frozen Time (2017) , a look at a trove of long-buried film reels from the early 20th century, is at 100 percent.

Of course, it’s hard for anything to feel quite as fresh the second time around, and critics say diminishing returns are definitely an issue with Guardians‘ second installment; while the vast majority of reviews have been positive, a number have also pointed out that the franchise’s rapid-fire humor and thrilling visual spectacle don’t stick the landing quite as often, and it doesn’t help that the story keeps our heroes apart for an extended stretch.

What do the critics have to say?Oblivion 53%Can a movie get by on good looks alone? Critics say Oblivion is visually striking but narratively thin, a thoughtful sci-fi head trip that starts strong but gets bogged down by its murky storyline. While working as a repairman on an abandoned, post-Apocalyptic Planet Earth, Jack Harper (Tom Cruise) discovers that he’s not alone — and that everything he knows has been a lie. The pundits say Cruise’s strong performance helps to enliven the proceedings, but Oblivion is largely derivative of other, better sci-fi films.

Universal averaged a sturdy $14,903 from 4,026 locations and enjoyed its fourth top spot debut of the year.Jason Bourne is the third film in the franchise to be directed by Paul Greengrass, fourth to star Damon, and fifth installment overall across fourteen years. In terms of opening weekend performance, it ranked second best in gross behind 2007’s The Bourne Ultimatum which was the last chapter from the Damon-Greengrass team. It ranked third out of the four Damon films in terms of tickets sold behind Ultimatum and 2004’s The Bourne Supremacy.But given how this sequel-heavy summer has been going, Bourne delivered the third largest opening weekend for any live-action film behind May’s Captain America and X-Men sequels, and was just a hair ahead of last weekend’s Star Trek Beyond. Damon’s latest also beat out the $55.5M opening this same weekend last year of Tom Cruise’s fifth spy pic Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation which went on to enjoy a healthy summer run ending at $195M.Bourne earned a solid A- grade from CinemaScore and reviews from critics were mostly mixed. Studio data showed that males made up 55% of the audience and 60% were 35 and older. Ethnic appeal was good too with 44% of the business coming from non-whites.46 international markets also opened this weekend, one week ahead of the Rio Olympics, and grabbed an estimated $50.1M for a global launch of $110.1M. Top performers were Korea with $11.2M over five days and the U.K. with $10.2M across three days. Bourne will invade China, Mexico, and Russia after the Olympics.With another action sequel entering the marketplace distracting adult men, Star Trek Beyond tumbled out of first place falling 60% to an estimated $24M. The sophomore drop was exactly in line with past number one hits this summer like the Captain America and Ninja Turtles sequels. Beyond has grossed $105.7M through its second weekend and may end its mission with about $150-160M falling behind its two predecessors which each did over $225M.Overseas, Star Trek Beyond took in an estimated $13M this weekend from 40 markets with the U.K. being the only one to reach a double digit cume so far. Seven of the top 11 markets have yet to open with many waiting until after the Summer Olympics. The international cume of $54.8M puts the third Trek at $160.5M worldwide.The raunchy comedy Bad Moms delivered a strong opening weekend in third place with an estimated $23.4M from 3,215 locations for a solid $7,278 average. Adult women and mothers were the driving force for the R-rated pic as audience data showed that the crowd was 82% female. With plenty of starpower coming from a cast that included Mila Kunis, Kristen Bell, Kathryn Hahn, Christina Applegate and Jada Pinkett Smith, plus generally positive reviews from critics and funny trailers, Bad Moms served as effective counter-programming to summer’s steady diet of testosterone-filled action sequels.Produced for only $20M, and earning a glowing A CinemaScore grade, the STX release is sure to end up being a moneymaker. Weekend sales were very frontloaded, however, with Saturday dropping a steep 19% from Friday’s opening day take. Last July’s female-skewing R-rated comedy hit Trainwreck was up 3% on Saturday and had more appeal to the date crowd.Holding up well in its fourth weekend was the hit toon The Secret Life of Pets with an estimated $18.2M, down 39%, for a new domestic total of $296.2M. The Universal smash will soon become the third animated movie of 2016 to cross $300M joining Zootopia and Finding Dory, both from the Disney camp. Also in the triple century club is The Jungle Book which features all but one of its characters being computer animated. Worldwide, Pets sits at $395.2M. Horror pic Lights Out dipped a reasonable 50% in its sophomore session to an estimated $10.8M putting Warner Bros. at $42.9M to date. The $5M production should end with a robust $60M or so.Older movie brands saw half of their sales disappear this weekend. Franchise toon Ice Age: Collision Course fell 51% to an estimated $10.5M giving Fox just $42.1M on its way to the $70M range in the end. It may gross seven to eight times that amount from international markets though. Global is now $253.7M with 83% from overseas. Sony’s pricey Ghostbusters collected an estimated $9.8M, off 53%, for a new cume of $106.2M. Final may reach the $130M range.It’s been a great summer for fright films and thrillers with high grosses coming from films with low production costs. Another arrived this weekend in the form of the teen thriller Nerve which debuted on Wednesday and collected $15.1M over five days including $9M over the weekend period. The PG-13 Lionsgate release averaged $3,546 from 2,538 locations over the three-day period which was good for a pic with a mid-week launch. Reviews were mixed but ticket-buyers were pleased giving it an A- CinemaScore grade which is quite positive for a scary movie.Finding Dory, the year’s biggest domestic blockbuster, followed with an estimated $4.2M in its seventh round dipping 42% and pushing the cume to $469M. The global tally stands at $830.5M led by China’s $38.4M. That is not too high of a gross there as Dory is not even one of China’s top-grossing animated films this year. Angry Birds has done nearly twice as much there. Rounding out the top ten was The Legend of Tarzan with an estimated $2.4M, tumbling 63%, for a total of $121.9M domestic and $309.1M worldwide for Warner Bros.The top ten films grossed an estimated $172.3M which was up 27% from last year when Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation opened at number one with $55.5M; and up 3% from 2014 when Guardians of the Galaxy opened in the top spot with an August record $94.3M.Compared to projections, Jason Bourne opened a little higher than my $57M forecast while Bad Moms and Nerve were on target with my $23M and $10M predictions, respectively.Follow Gitesh on Twitter.","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"green, All, Nominations, Video, Fox, Geo, Searchlight, TLC","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/31124200/jason-bourne-rep1.jpg","slug":"box-office-jason-bourne-guns-down-60m-debut"},{"id":"47508755666363","title":"The BFG Is a Visually Striking Adventure","content":"Critics Consensusvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})The BFG Is a Visually Striking AdventurePlus, The Legend of Tarzan swings and misses and The Purge: Election Year is a B-movie blast.by Jeff Giles | June 30, 2016 |  CommentsThis week at the movies, we’ve got a big friendly giant (The BFG, starring Mark Rylance&nbsp;and Ruby Barnhill), an iconic jungle dweller (The Legend of Tarzan, starring Alexander Skarsgård&nbsp;and Margot Robbie), and a bunch of masked marauders (The Purge: Election Year, starring Frank Grillo&nbsp;and Elizabeth Mitchell). What do the critics have to say?The BFG (2016)  74%Few modern filmmakers have been able to capture the conflicting emotions of childhood as successfully as Steven Spielberg, and few authors have crafted young protagonists as gracefully as Roald Dahl — so Spielberg adapting Dahl’s classic The BFG should add up to an automatic home run. This latest cinematic take on the tale of a young girl named Sophie (Ruby Barnhill) who embarks on an adventure with a big friendly giant (a mo-capped Mark Rylance) certainly benefits from the latest technology, presenting viewers with a series of visual splendors, yet many critics can’t help wishing for something more. Although overall quite positive, reviews point to a disarmingly sweet film that ignores the darker elements of Dahl’s source material, not to mention the sense of danger that informed Spielberg’s earlier work. All the same, younger viewers — and the young at heart of all ages — will likely be swept up by The BFG just as easily as he scoops up little Sophie.The Legend of Tarzan (2016)  36%It’s been quite awhile since a U.S. studio decided to make a big-budget film based on the vine-swinging jungle adventures of Edgar Rice Burroughs’ classic Tarzan character — and based on the reviews for the David Yates-directed The Legend of Tarzan, it could be years before it happens again. Starring Alexander Skarsgård as the erstwhile ape man and Margot Robbie as Jane, Legend does its level best to grapple with the most problematic elements of the character; unfortunately, critics say those efforts aren’t enough to enliven what is, at bottom, a fairly ordinary action-adventure outing with not enough of either — and an overload of obvious CGI. There may yet be a way to turn Tarzan into a viable 21st-century film franchise, but the reviews point back to the drawing board after The Legend of Tarzan.The Purge: Election Year (2016)  56%When you’re living in the midst of a presidential election year, it can be difficult to imagine ways in which campaign season could possibly become even more of a circus. Well, now there’s The Purge: Election Year, which infuses the franchise’s traditional skull-cracking violence with a shotgun blast of politically timely relevance. Returning audiences to a future in which citizens have an annual 12-hour pass to legally commit all manner of mayhem — including murder — writer-director James DeMonaco’s third installment in the series envisions an election in which one candidate (Elizabeth Mitchell) vows to do away with the Purge if she’s elected. She’s got series protagonist Leo Barnes (Frank Grillo) on her side, but shadowy government forces are determined to stop her — and critics say it adds up to a wickedly dark action flick that, while perhaps not quite as lethally effective as its predecessors, is still high-caliber enough to recommend for filmgoers seeking a summer dose of genre thrills.What’s New&nbsp;on TVThirteen: Miniseries (2016)  88%Thirteen gives a well-worn premise an intriguing facelift with haunting execution and compelling performances across the board.Queen of the South: Season 1 (2016)  68%Queen of the South enlivens an overdone premise with action and narrative vigor — and shows hints of intriguing potential.Dead of Summer: Season 1 (2016)  63%Dead of Summer sets a spooky stage for a silly period creepfest, but its lack of actual scares adds up to an altogether underwhelming experience.Roadies: Season 1 (2016)  35%Roadies‘ condescending tone, boring and underdeveloped characters, and lack of dramatic intrigue lead to a failure to rock.Also&nbsp;Opening This Week In Limited Release Microbe and Gasoline (Microbe et Gasoil) (2016) , Michel Gondry‘s new comedy about two teenage outcasts who plan to traverse france in a homemade car, is at 95 percent.

What do the critics have to say?Don't Breathe (2016)  88%A trio of teens with ill intentions bust into a blind man’s house. Sounds like the setup for a suitably sleazy home invasion thriller, right? Don’t Breathe delivers, but with a twist: instead of a helpless victim, our would-be thieves stumble upon a guy with unsuspected skills — and a mean streak a mile wide. Maybe it isn’t the stuff Oscars are made of, but critics say the end result is a satisfyingly nasty bit of suspense-filled horror, and one that further establishes director/co-writer Fede Alvarez (reuniting here with his Evil Dead star Jane Levy) as a talented filmmaker who just needs a few ingredients to pack a punch. August has a reputation as a bit of a dumping ground for subpar genre fare, but Don’t Breathe looks like a spine-tingling exception to the rule.Hands of Stone (2016)  45%“No más.” Say those words around any serious boxing fan, and they’ll immediately understand you’re making a reference to the landmark 1980 rematch between&nbsp;Sugar Ray Leonard and Roberto Durán in which Durán, defending his WBC championship belt, turned his back on Leonard in the waning moments of the eighth round and uttered those infamous words, yielding the fight. This weekend, Durán gets his biopic due with Hands of Stone, starring&nbsp;Édgar Ramírez as the boxer, Robert De Niro as his trainer Ray Arcel, and Usher as Leonard. Unfortunately, critics say the results don’t quite do Durán’s story justice; reviews describe a fairly standard boxing flick that hits the usual beats, but without sufficient strength of conviction. There’s certainly no shortage of movies that put you in the ring, and ESPN’s 30 for 30 gave this fight a documentary overview with No Más in 2013. Viewers hungry for a cinematic beatdown may wish to seek out one of those options instead.Southside With You (2016)  92%It’s exceedingly rare for Hollywood to release a narrative film about a sitting president, and rarer still to see a POTUS-inspired movie that focuses on the personal rather than the political. This weekend’s Southside With You offers a notable exception, starring Parker Sawyers as a young Barack Obama and Tika Sumpter as Michelle Robinson — the woman we now know as the nation’s First Lady. Writer-director Richard Tanne uses his appealing leads to piece together an idea of what the couple’s first date might have looked like, and critics say the results should be entertaining for anyone who appreciates a good walking-and-talking cinematic romance, regardless of where they sit along the political aisle. We all know where the Obamas went after the evening we witness in Southside With You, but the reviews argue it’s still well worth it to witness the start of their journey.Mechanic: Resurrection (2016)  31%The Mechanic earned a middling critical response in 2011, but enough people turned out to watch Jason Statham star in a remake of the 1972 Charles Bronson action thriller that we’ve got ourselves a sequel this week. Unfortunately, The Mechanic: Resurrection didn’t screen for critics, so you know what that means — it’s time to play Guess the Tomatometer!What’s Hot&nbsp;on TVGomorrah: Season 1 (2014)  95%Gomorrah brings a refreshing twist to a familiar story, with its realistic, unglamorous and often riveting portrayal of a Neapolitan crime organization.Halt and Catch Fire: Season 3 (2016)  96%Halt and Catch Fire finds its footing in an optimistic third season that builds on the fascinating relationship between a pair of emerging protagonists.Better Late than Never: Season 1 (2016)  80%Better Late Than Never‘s wayward travelers offer up enough personality and surprisingly sincere moments to buoy the show’s all too familiar shenanigans.Also&nbsp;Opening This Week In Limited Release Kate Plays Christine (2016) , a quasi-documentary that delves into the suicide of news anchor Christine Chubbuck, is at 92 percent.

What do the critics have to say?Finding Dory (2016)  94%Pixar has adopted more of a franchise mindset in recent years, but for many of us, the studio’s best films were never meant to be more than standalone stories — which makes attempting a sequel to a classic like Finding Nemo a risky endeavor indeed. Happily, this is one instance where critics overwhelmingly agree that the ends justify the means: like all the best Pixar flicks, Finding Dory&nbsp;is a funny, heartwarming adventure that serves up state-of-the-art visual thrills while imparting a thought-provoking, ultimately poignant message. Picking up a year after Nemo‘s conclusion, Dory&nbsp;centers on the titular forgetful Pacific regal blue tang (voiced by Ellen Degeneres) as she embarks on a quest to find her family after experiencing a sudden flash of memory. Blending new characters with familiar faces — and, of course, raising the bar yet again for animation — it might fall just a little short of its predecessor, but the end result still hits some impressively lofty heights.Central Intelligence (2016)  71%Does the world need another buddy cop comedy? Most likely not. And yet it’s a formula that can deliver terrifically entertaining dividends under the right circumstances — and the&nbsp;pundits say&nbsp;Central Intelligence pulls it off just well enough to recommend. Dwayne Johnson stars as Bob, a doughy high school outcast who grew up to be a musclebound CIA agent; Kevin Hart plays Calvin, the former classmate-turned-accountant who gets roped into Bob’s big case on the eve of their high school reunion. It’s a suitably daffy premise, and the Johnson/Hart pairing is inspired — all of which adds up to a blast of popcorn fun strong enough to make up for a willingness&nbsp;to coast on formula and the charms of its stars. The&nbsp;critics are charmed rather than wowed, but this should scratch your buddy-cop comedy itch&nbsp;— at least until&nbsp;the next Johnson and Hart film.What’s New&nbsp;on TVOrange Is the New Black: Season 4 (2016)  94%Orange is the New Black is back and better than ever, with a powerful fourth season full of compelling performances by the ensemble cast.Animal Kingdom: Season 1 (2016)  76%Bolstered by Ellen Barkin‘s acting prowess, Animal Kingdom is a darkly intriguing, although occasionally predictable, twisted family drama.BrainDead: Season 1 (2016)  65%While admittedly uneven, BrainDead remains a charmingly idealistic sign of the political times.Also&nbsp;Opening This Week In Limited Release Raiders!: The Story of the Greatest Fan Film Ever Made (2016) , a documentary about a group of friends and their decades-long effort to finish their homemade Indiana Jones movie, is at 96 percent.

Reilly and Sarah Silverman), a troubled pilot (Flight, starring Denzel Washington and Don Cheadle), and a fighting blacksmith (The Man With the Iron Fists, starring Russell Crowe and RZA). What do the critics have to say?Wreck-it Ralph 87%What do video game characters do when the lights go off at the arcade? That’s the inspired premise of Wreck-it Ralph, which critics say is a visual phantasmagoria with a clever story and heartfelt characters that should appeal to kids and their parents. Ralph (voiced by John C. Reilly) is the bad guy in a retro arcade game, but he longs for acceptance and love from his fellow video game characters. So he ventures out of his game in search of adventure and respect — a trek that could have devastating consequences for his pixelated peers. The pundits say the Certified Fresh Wreck-it Ralph falls a little short of the Toy Story movies, but it’s a deft mix of strong storytelling and sensorial ingenuity. (Check out this week’s Total Recall, in which we run down memorable video game movies.)Flight 77%Flight is the tale of the flawed man behind a great act of courage, and critics say it features a terrific performance from Denzel Washington, while director Robert Zemeckis successfully balances white-knuckle action with a perceptive look at a vulnerable, troubled man. Washington stars as Whip Whitaker, a commercial airline pilot whose mid-air heroics help to avert a catastrophic crash. Soon, however, his halo is tarnished, as investigators examine whether Whip was under the influence while flying. The pundits say the Certified Fresh Flight is effectively unsettling, a smart, surprisingly entertaining film about addiction that never lets its message overwhelm its narrative.The Man With the Iron Fists 51%As the mastermind of the Wu-Tang Clan’s sound, RZA famously sampled dialogue and sound effects from classic martial arts films. And he basically does the same thing in his directorial debut, The Man With the Iron Fists, which critics say is a disjointed but spirited and exciting pastiche of movie styles. RZA stars as a blacksmith who tries to defend his village against a bloodthirsty clan that descends on the town in search of gold. The pundits say The Man With the Iron Fists overcomes its narrative flaws to deliver an action-packed spectacle that brims with over-the-top exuberance.

This week at the movies, we’ve got a new top contender&nbsp;(Creed, starring Sylvester Stallone&nbsp;and Michael B. Jordan), a pair of prehistoric&nbsp;pals&nbsp;(The Good Dinosaur, featuring voice performances by Raymond Ochoa and Jeffrey Wright), and a dogged detective (Victor Frankenstein, starring James McAvoy&nbsp;and Daniel Radcliffe). What do the critics have to say?Creed (2015)  95%Everybody likes an underdog, and everybody likes Rocky, the lovable lug who has taken his share of punishment but refuses to be K.O.’d. Critics say he’s a contender once again: Creed is one of the best entries in the venerable franchise, with fantastic performances from Sylvester Stallone and Michael B. Jordan and kinetic, sympathetic direction from Ryan Coogler. Jordan stars as Adonis Johnson — the son of Rocky’s old rival-turned-friend, the late Apollo Creed — &nbsp;who sets aside his promising white-collar career for a shot at glory in the ring under the tutelage of the former champ, who’s looking for a little redemption of his own. The pundits say the Certified Fresh Creed understands what made Rocky so compelling in the first place; its characters and gritty sense of place are as satisfying and hard-hitting as the fights themselves.The Good Dinosaur (2015)  76%Pixar has ruled the computer animation genre since it debuted Toy Story in 1995, but it’s never attempted to release two films in one year before. That changes this week with the release of The Good Dinosaur — which follows on the heels of this summer’s widely acclaimed Inside Out — and critics say it’s a worthy entry in the Pixar canon, even if it doesn’t quite measure up to the studio’s best. Set on an alternate version of Earth where dinosaurs have survived extinction, the story centers on Arlo, a timid Apatosaurus who finds himself lost after chasing a caveboy into the wilderness. In order to find his way home, he must befriend the feral boy and face his fears. The pundits say the Certified Fresh&nbsp;Good Dinosaur boasts lush animation, gorgeous landscapes, and charming characters, which help the film overcome its rather ordinary narrative.Victor Frankenstein (2015)  27%It’s… alive? Critics say Victor Frankenstein resembles its title character’s creation: it’s a bunch of disparate elements fastened together, lacking the spark needed to come&nbsp;to life. James McAvoy stars as the doctor and Daniel Radcliffe plays Igor; together, they team up to create artificial life, but (spoiler alert!) their macabre experiments eventually spiral out of control. The pundits say Victor Frankenstein leaves its talented cast stranded in a tonally inconsistent mishmash that does little to distinguish itself from Frankenstein films of yore beyond a few would-be knowing winks.What’s Hot on TVThe Man in the High Castle: Season 1 (2015)  95%The Man in the High Castle is unlike anything else on TV, with an immediately engrossing plot driven by quickly developed characters in a fully realized post-World War II dystopia.Marvel's Jessica Jones: Season 1 (2015)  94%Jessica Jones builds a multifaceted drama around its engaging antihero, delivering what might be Marvel’s strongest TV franchise to date.Also&nbsp;Opening This Week In Limited Release Janis: Little Girl Blue (2015) , a documentary about the legendary blues singer and Woodstock fave, is at 87 percent.

What do the critics have to say?\n\n\n        \n            \n                American Ultra (2015)  43%\n            \n            \n                \n            \n            \n              \nAmerican Ultra has a pretty ingenious premise: what if a perpetually stoned slacker was a brainwashed killing machine? Unfortunately, critics say this would-be mashup of The Manchurian Candidate&nbsp;and Pineapple Express is undone by an inconsistent tone, veering wildly between laughs and ultraviolence — though stars Jesse Eisenberg and Kristen Stewart make a charming pair. Eisenberg plays Mike, a small-town layabout who lives blissfully unaware that he was once trained as a CIA super soldier. When the agency decides to eliminate him, his dormant powers are activated and chaos ensues. The pundits say American Ultra is quite sweet and charming in spots, but it devolves into the kind of mediocre shoot-em-up it seemed to parody in the first place.\n\n            \n        \n\n\n        \n            \n                Hitman: Agent 47 (2015)  8%\n            \n            \n                \n            \n            \n              \nHitman: Agent 47 is a sequel/reboot to a video game adaptation that wasn’t particularly loved to begin with. So it shouldn’t come as much of a surprise that critics say it’s a bland, shallow action flick that heaps more loving care on its shootouts than its characters. Rupert Friend stars as the titular assassin, who acquired his murderous talents as part of a secret government experiment. He’s tasked with tracking down a woman who knows secrets about the program’s origins. The pundits say Hitman: Agent 47 is thoroughly generic stuff, and its occasional flashes of craft do little to elevate its hollow emotional core.\n\n            \n        \n\n\n        \n            \n                Sinister 2 (2015)  15%\n            \n            \n                \n            \n            \n              \nIn Sinister, a writer moved into a house that was bedeviled by a ghoul that lurked within the frames of old Super 8 films. Critics say Sinister 2 is haunted as well — by a dull&nbsp;script and a decided lack of scares. Shannyn Sossamon stars as a woman who moves into an isolated farmhouse with her sons to escape her abusive husband. Soon, however, the malevolent spirit Bughuul turns up with his box of haunted Super 8 reels. Critics say Sinister 2 substitutes jump scares for real tension, and it’s only on the strength of the acting that the film sustains any interest.\n\n            \n        \n\n&nbsp;What’s Hot on TV\n&nbsp;\n\n\n\n    \n        Show Me a Hero: Season 1 (2015)  96%\n    \n    \n        \n    \n    \n      \nShow Me a Hero is an impressively crafted period drama whose timely themes prove as absorbing as its engaging, compassionately drawn characters.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        Fear the Walking Dead: Season 1 (2015)  76%\n    \n    \n        \n    \n    \n      \nFear the Walking Dead recycles elements of its predecessor, but it’s still moody and engrossing enough to compete with the original.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        Kevin From Work: Season 1 (2015)  55%\n    \n    \n        \n    \n    \n      \nKevin From Work relies on raunchy jokes delivered by unsavory characters, but the show’s gags hit their targets often enough to elevate a rather routine premise.\n\n    \n\n\nAlso&nbsp;Opening This Week In Limited Release\n&nbsp;\n\n Being Evel (2015) , a documentary portrait of legendary motorcycle daredevil Evel Knievel, is at 100&nbsp;percent.\n Blood Cells (2015) , a drama about a transient laborer haunted by family secrets, is at 100 percent.\n Station To Station (2015) ,&nbsp;which documents a cross-country train trip and features short works by a wide range of artists, is at 90 percent.\n Grandma (2015) , starring Lily Tomlin in a comedy about a woman who visits a bunch of old friends iin order to borrow money to help her granddaughter out of a jam, is at 88 percent.\n The Iron Ministry (2015) , a semi-experimental documentary about China’s railway system and its passengers, is at 86&nbsp;percent.\n Guidance (2015) ,&nbsp;a&nbsp;comedy about a former child star who fakes his way into a gig as a high school guidance counselor, is at 80 percent.\n The Mend (2015) , starring Josh Lucas&nbsp;in a comedy about a man who stirs up dysfunction when he crashes on his brother’s couch, is at 75 percent.\n Digging For Fire (2015) , starring Jake Johnson&nbsp;and&nbsp;Rosemarie DeWitt in a comedy about the marital tension that arises when a man makes a strange discovery at a rented house, is at 70 percent.\n Learning To Drive (2015) , starring Patricia Clarkson&nbsp;and&nbsp;Ben Kingsley&nbsp;in a&nbsp;romantic drama about a lovelorn woman who bonds with a cabbie while receiving driving lessons, is at 45 percent.\n After Words (2015) , starring Marcia Gay Harden&nbsp;in a drama about a woman in the midst of a personal crisis who meets a younger man while on vacation, is at 40 percent.\n 6 Years (2015) , starring Taissa Farmiga&nbsp;and&nbsp;Ben Rosenfield in a drama about the ups and downs in a young couple’s relationship, is at 40 percent.\nPeter Bogdanovich‘s&nbsp; She's Funny That Way (2015) , starring Owen Wilson&nbsp;and&nbsp;Imogen Poots&nbsp;in a screwball farce about a theater director who casts his wife and her ex &nbsp;alongside his mistress in a new play, is at 38 percent.\n The Curse of Downers Grove (2015) , a horror film about a hex that claims the life of a high school senior each year, is at 20 percent.\n Some Kind of Beautiful (2015) , starring Pierce Brosnan&nbsp;and&nbsp;Salma Hayek&nbsp;in a comedy about a rakish professor in love with his girlfriend’s sister, is at zero percent.\n\n                                            \n                \n            ","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"Competition, Vudu","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/American-Ultra-CC2.jpg","slug":"american-ultra"},{"id":"47508762215927","title":"Critics Consensus: Avengers: Age of Ultron Is Certified Fresh","content":"Critics Consensusvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Critics Consensus: Avengers: Age of Ultron Is Certified FreshPlus, Far From the Madding Crowd is visually striking, and The Casual Vacancy is uneven.by Tim Ryan | April 30, 2015 |  CommentsThis week at the movies, we’ve got just one wide release: the hotly-anticipated Marvel superhero extravaganza Avengers: Age of Ultron, starring Robert Downey Jr., Scarlett Johansson, and Mark Ruffalo. What do the critics have to say?Avengers: Age of Ultron 76%Marvel’s The Avengers was greeted with such overwhelmingly positive reviews that Avengers: Age of Ultron has a lot to live up to. And critics say that while Ultron isn’t quite up to its predecessor’s standard, it’s still robust blockbuster entertainment, an expert assemblage of beloved characters with enough loving detail and character quirks to withstand an occasionally overstuffed narrative. This time out, the Avengers — whose ranks include Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), the Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), and Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) — are pitted against Ultron (voiced by James Spader), a powerful robot with dangerous beliefs about the best way to achieve world peace. The critics say the Certified Fresh Avengers: Age of Ultron lacks the charm and lightness of its predecessor, but the cast is outstanding and the action set pieces are suitably epic. (Check out this week’s Total Recall, in which we take a look at some of the lesser-known career highlights of the Avengers cast, and watch our video interviews with director Joss Whedon and a bunch of the stars.)What’s On TV:HBO’s adaptation of J.K. Rowling’s The Casual Vacancy (57 percent) is mostly dull, heavy-handed, and predictable, although it possesses a few touching moments.Instead of sly and shocking, Happyish (30 percent) comes off as shrill and self-satisfied, despite the efforts of its talented cast.Also opening this week in limited release:Albert Maysles‘ Iris, a documentary about the life and times of fashion maven Iris Apfel, is at 100 percent (watch our video interview with Apfel here).In Country, a documentary about Vietnam War reenactors, is at 86 percent.Far From the Madding Crowd, starring Carey Mulligan and Michael Sheen in an adaptation of Thomas Hardy’s classic novel, is at 79 percent.Marie’s Story, a drama about a nun who works tirelessly to communicate with a deaf and blind teenager, is at 78 percent.Hyena, a British crime drama about a detective who becomes entangled in a turf war between rival drug trafficking organizations, is at 77 percent.Far From Men, starring Viggo Mortensen in a drama about a schoolteacher who must accompany an accused murderer across the Algerian desert to stand trial, is at 75 percent.Soul Boys Of The Western World, a documentary about 1980s new wave pop pioneers Spandau Ballet, is at 73 percent.Welcome to Me, starring Kristen Wiig and Tim Robbins in a dramedy about a woman with borderline personality disorder who wins the lottery and proceeds to start her own talk show, is at 71 percent.Reality, a dramedy about a would-be horror film director whose life is turned upside down when his producer demands that he find the perfect cinematic scream, is at 67 percent.Days of Grace, a thriller featuring three intertwined stories involving criminal activity as World Cup fever grips Mexico, is at 63 percent.Maya The Bee Movie, an animated adventure featuring the titular bee on a mission to save her hive from a plot against the queen, is at 56 percent.Ride, starring Helen Hunt and Luke Wilson in a comedy about a magazine writer who follows her son to Los Angeles and embarks on a period of self-discovery, is at 53 percent.Gerontophilia, a romantic comedy about a teenage boy who forms a close relationship with an older man while working at a retirement community, is at 50 percent.Cas &amp; Dylan, starring Richard Dreyfuss and Tatiana Maslany in a dramedy about a terminally ill man who ends up on a wild road trip after agreeing to give a lift to an aspiring writer, is at 33 percent.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"Pacific, Winners, quibi, Universal, FirstLook, HBO, TV, Worst, 99%, Red, travel, camera, halloween, movie","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/avengers-vision.jpg","slug":"critics-consensus-avengers-age-of-ultron-is-certified-fresh"},{"id":"47508762232318","title":"Critics Consensus: Cinderella is Certified Fresh","content":"Critics Consensusvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Critics Consensus: Cinderella is Certified FreshPlus, Run All Night is hit and miss, and Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt is Certified Fresh.by Tim Ryan | March 12, 2015 |  CommentsThis week at the movies, we’ve got a fairy tale princess (Cinderella, starring Lily James and Cate Blanchett) and a regretful hit man (Run All Night, starring Liam Neeson and Ed Harris). What do the critics have to say?Cinderella 83%Revisionist fairy tales are all the rage these days, so it’s a bit surprising that director Kenneth Branagh has taken the opposite tack with his mostly-straightforward version of Cinderella. Not that that’s a bad thing; critics say this is charming, visually striking family entertainment with more than a touch of the old Disney magic. You probably know the story by heart, but here goes: after her aristocratic father’s tragic death, Cinderella (Lily James) is left in the care of her wicked stepmother (Cate Blanchett) and her cruel stepsisters. But with the help of a fairy godmother (Helena Bonham Carter), our heroine wins the heart of a prince. The pundits say the Certified Fresh Cinderella doesn’t bring many new twists to the classic tale, but it’s so exquisitely crafted and energetically acted that it hardly matters. (Watch our video interview with Branagh, James, and Blanchett, and click through our gallery of the most important shoes in the movies.)Run All Night 59%Another week, another movie in which Liam Neeson is out for blood. Critics say Run All Night is a so-so entry in this budding subgenre, one that’s better than Taken 3 but a notch or two below A Walk Among the Tombstones. Neeson plays Jimmy, a broken-down mob assassin with a long personal and professional history with crime boss Shawn (Ed Harris). But when Jimmy kills Shawn’s kid in order to save his son’s life, he finds his old buddy gunning for him. The pundits say the main reason to watch Run All Night is Neeson and the strong cast, but otherwise, the plot is too convoluted and the execution is too workmanlike. (Check out Harris’ best-reviewed films here.)What’s On TV:Critics say that Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt (Certified Fresh at 95 percent) is as odd as it is hilarious, thanks in part to a spot-on performance from Ellie Kemper.The pundits say season three of Bates Motel (90 percent) further blurs the lines around TV’s creepiest taboo mother/son relationship, uncomfortably darkening its already fascinating tone.Critics say that while The Returned (64 percent) is overshadowed by its superior source material, the US version retains enough of the creep factor and character drama to appease fans of the genre.Also opening this week in limited release:Of Horses and Men, an Icelandic dramedy featuring a series of interlocking stories about disparate people and their equine companions, is at 100 percent.Seymour: An Introduction, a documentary profile of concert pianist and teacher Seymour Bernstein directed by Ethan Hawke, is at 100 percent.It Follows, an indie horror film about a malevolent force that preys on teens in a Michigan suburb, is Certified Fresh at 95 percent.The Wrecking Crew, a doc about the legendary L.A. session musicians who backed up everyone from Frank Sinatra to the Beach Boys, is at 93 percent.3 Hearts, starring Charlotte Gainsbourg and Catherine Deneuve in a romantic drama about two sisters who fall for the same man, is at 82 percent.Champs, a documentary in which legendary pugilists Mike Tyson and Evander Holyfield discuss their lives in and outside the ring, is at 60 percent.Walter, a dramedy about a movie theater employee who believes he’s the son of God, is at 57 percent.Treading Water, starring Douglas Smith and Zoë Kravitz in a dramedy about a lonely teenager with a rare medical condition that makes him smell like a fish, is at 50 percent.Cymbeline, starring Ethan Hawke and Ed Harris in a modern-day retelling of Shakespeare’s tragedy featuring warring bikers and cops, is at 33 percent.The Cobbler, starring Adam Sandler and Steve Buscemi in a comic fantasy about a shoe repairman who discovers a machine magical properties, is at 11 percent (check out co-star Method Man’s Five Favorite Films here).Home Sweet Hell, starring Katherine Heigl and Patrick Wilson in a drama based on the true story of the brazen kidnapping of a brewery heir, is at eight percent.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"Adventures, social, franchise, war, Chernobyl, Association","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/cinderella.jpg","slug":"critics-consensus-cinderella-is-certified-fresh"},{"id":"47508765620762","title":"Critics Consensus: The November Man is Slick But Convoluted","content":"Critics Consensusvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Critics Consensus: The November Man is Slick But ConvolutedPlus, As Above/So Below is only moderately spooky, and Ghostbusters is still a classic.by Tim Ryan | August 28, 2014 |  CommentsThis week at the movies, we’ve got a spy on the run (The November Man, starring Pierce Brosnan and Olga Kurylenko), some haunted explorers (As Above/So Below, starring Perdita Weeks and Ben Feldman/), and four supernatural elimination specialists (Ghostbusters, starring Bill Murray and Dan Aykroyd). What do the critics have to say?The November Man 36%Pierce Brosnan is best known for his stint as cinema’s greatest spy, James Bond. He plays a different sort of espionage agent in The November Man; unfortunately, critics say that while the film is slick and competently made, it suffers from convoluted plotting and middling dialogue. Brosnan stars as Peter Devereaux, an ex-CIA agent who’s lured out of retirement to protect an important witness. However, Devereaux quickly discovers that everyone’s out to get him. The pundits say that Brosnan is strong as a thoughtful, haunted protagonist, but The November Man is largely a generic spy thriller that’s weighted down by an overloaded narrative. (Check out this week’s Total Recall, in which we count down Brosnan’s best-reviewed films.)As Above/So Below 26%What better place to set a horror movie than the catacombs beneath Paris, where the bones of millions of souls are part of an intricate series of dark tunnels? Critics say As Above/So Below occasionally takes full advantage of its chilling locale, but its characters aren’t particularly well-developed. It’s the story of three adventure seekers on a quest to find a mythical artifact. When they venture into the catacombs, however, they’re forced to confront horrors both tangible and psychological. The pundits say As Above/So Below is atmospheric and occasionally spooky, but it lacks the weight and urgency necessary to be a true head-trip.Ghostbusters 97%If there’s something strange in your neighborhood, who you gonna call? Yes, that’s right: Ghostbusters, one of the most beloved comedies of the 1980s is back in theaters in celebration of its 30th anniversary. Critics found it to be a sublime blend of witty banter and inspired special effects, and it’s barely dated a lick since its original release.Also opening this week in limited release:Starred Up, a British drama about an imprisoned teenager who attempts to change his life, is Certified Fresh at 98 percent.Patema Inverted, an anime about a princess who escapes from her staid underground life, is at 89 percent.Kundo: Age of the Rampant, a martial arts film about a group of bandits that rises up against the aristocracy, is at 86 percent.The Notebook, a drama about 13-year-old twins abandoned in a small village who bear witness to the violence and hypocrisy around them, is at 75 percent.The Congress, starring Robin Wright and Harvey Keitel in a half-animated, half-live-action fantasy about the movie business, is Certified Fresh at 73 percent.Canopy, a World War II drama about a pilot who’s been shot down in enemy territory, is at 71 percent.The Calling, starring Susan Sarandon and Topher Grace in a thriller about a serial killer who preys on the terminally ill, is at 64 percent.Jamie Marks Is Dead, starring Cameron Monaghan and Liv Tyler in a drama about the ghost of a teenager who visits some of his old classmates, is at 63 percent.Life of Crime, starring John Hawkes and Jennifer Aniston in a caper comedy about a man who refuses to pay the ransom for his kidnapped wife, is at 61 percent.The Strange Color of Your Body’s Tears, a thriller about a man whose search for his missing wife leads to disturbing places, is at 45 percent.Through a Lens Darkly: Black Photographers and the Emergence of a People, a documentary about how photography helped to shape African American culture, is at 45 percent.Last Weekend, starring Patricia Clarkson in a comedy about a dysfunctional family that gathers at a summer cabin, is at 43 percent.The Last Of Robin Hood, starring Kevin Kline and Dakota Fanning in a drama about the last years of Hollywood swashbuckler Errol Flynn, is at 38 percent.The Damned, a horror film about a man who discovers a mysterious child in the basement of a remote hotel, is at 13 percent.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"Christmas, Prime, 2017, richard, jones, Returns, hidden, Month, Watching","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Critics-Consensus-The-November-Man-is-Slick-But-Convoluted"},{"id":"47508766737962","title":"Critics Consensus: Neighbors is Certified Fresh","content":"Critics Consensusvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Critics Consensus: Neighbors is Certified FreshPlus, Mom's Night Out is dull, and Legends of Oz: Dorothy's Return is duller.by Tim Ryan | May 9, 2014 |  CommentsThis week at the movies, we’ve got a battle between bros and parents (Neighbors, starring Seth Rogen and Zac Efron), another trek down the yellow brick road (Legends of Oz: Dorothy’s Return, with voice performances by Lea Michele and Dan Aykroyd), and a wild night on the town (Moms’ Night Out, starring Sarah Drew and Patricia Heaton). What do the critics have to say?Neighbors 73%Most frat comedies seem content to rip off Animal House, but occasionally a movie comes along that shows the keg isn’t completely tapped. The critics say Neighbors can get pretty gross at times, but it’s well-acted and often surprisingly insightful about the anxieties of growing older. Mac (Seth Rogan) and Kelly (Rose Byrne) are a married couple with an infant child who think they’ve found the perfect home — that is, until a fraternity moves next door. Soon, our heroes are locked in battle with Teddy (Zac Efron), the frat’s president; hilarity ensues. The pundits say the Certified Fresh Neighbors has no shortage of lowbrow laughs, but the performers — particularly Byrne — make the characters relatable, and the result is both highly amusing and smarter than average. (Check out our video interview with the stars, as well as our gallery of the worst movie neighbors.)Legends of Oz: Dorothy’s Return 16%The Wizard of Oz is just as dazzling today as it was 75 years ago, and the reasons why are clear: it looks terrific, it features great songs, and (most importantly) it’s got a great story. Critics say the inverse is true of the new animated film Legends of Oz: Dorothy’s Return — with its dated visuals, so-so tunes, and meandering plot, this trip over the rainbow is unlikely to become a perennial family favorite. Shortly after returning to Kansas, Dorothy (voiced by Lea Michele) is whisked back to Oz to help pals old (Scarecrow, the Lion, and the Tin Man) and new (Wiser the Owl, Marshal Mallow, and China Princess) rescue Glinda the Good Witch from the evil Jester. The pundits say Legends of Oz is a less-than-magical affair that feels more suited to the cutout bin than the multiplex.Moms’ Night Out 20%This Mother’s Day, we hold these truths to be self-evident: that the hardworking moms of the world deserve some free time, and that moviegoers could use more female-centric comedies. So it’s unfortunate to report that critics find Moms’ Night Out to be predictable, uninspired, and seriously short on laughs. Stay-at-home mom Allyson (Sarah Drew) really needs to unwind, so she plans a night out with her BFFs. Naturally, everything goes haywire immediately, as the ladies get into trouble on the town while their husbands mostly fail to hold things together at home. The pundits say Moms’ Night Out earns a stray chuckle here and there, but it mostly feels more like a sitcom than a movie. (Check out star Patricia Heaton’s Five Favorite Films.)Also opening this week in limited release:Sol LeWitt, a documentary about the unassuming but highly-regarded conceptual artist, is at 100 percent.Chef, directed by and starring Jon Favreau in a comedy about a chef who quits his job at a swanky restaurant to operate a food truck, is Certified Fresh at 86 percent (check out this week’s Total Recall, in which we count down co-star Scarlett Johansson’s best-reviewed movies).Fed Up, a documentary about the ways in which the food industry is culpable for the obesity epidemic, is at 86 percent.Llyn Foulkes One Man Band, a documentary about an eccentric and obsessive outsider artist, is at 86 percent.Palo Alto, starring Emma Roberts and James Franco in a drama about four interconnected high school students with a bunch of personal issues, is at 85 percent.The Double, starring Jesse Eisenberg and Mia Wasikowska in an adaptation of the Dostoyevsky novel about a lonely man who finds himself pushed aside by his doppelganger, is Certified Fresh at 83 percent.The Wedding Video, a comedy about a videographer who makes a startlingly honest film about a couple’s big day, is at 69 percent.Stage Fright, starring Minnie Driver and Meat Loaf in a slasher flick about a murder-plagued performing arts camp, is at 39 percent.Before the Winter Chill, starring Daniel Auteuil and Kristin Scott Thomas in a drama about a man torn between his wife and a troubled younger woman, is at 33 percent.Devil’s Knot, starring Reese Witherspoon and Colin Firth in a fictional take on the story of the West Memphis Three, is at 32 percent.God’s Pocket, starring Philip Seymour Hoffman and John Turturro in a drama about a blue-collar neighborhood upended by a suspicious death, is at 29 percent.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"York, international, RT, Opinion, Now","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"critics-consensus-neighbors-is-certified-fresh"},{"id":"47508766730790","title":"Critics Consensus: Edge of Tomorrow is Certified Fresh","content":"Critics Consensusvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Critics Consensus: Edge of Tomorrow is Certified FreshPlus, The Fault In Our Stars is Certified Fresh as well.by Tim Ryan | June 5, 2014 |  CommentsThis week at the movies, we’ve got a time-looping soldier (Edge of Tomorrow, starring Tom Cruise and Emily Blunt) and literate teens in love (The Fault In Our Stars, starring Shailene Woodley and Ansel Elgort). What do the critics have to say?Edge of Tomorrow 91%On paper, a high-concept blend of Groundhog Day and Starship Troopers sounds like a recipe for disaster. In practice, critics say Edge of Tomorrow is a thoroughly entertaining sci-fi action flick with a sharp sense of humor and muscular acting from Tom Cruise. With the planet under attack from alien invaders, Major William Cage (Cruise) is sent into battle — and killed instantly. However, he finds himself in a time loop, reliving the same battle scenario and gradually discovering how to defeat the enemy. The pundits say the Certified Fresh Edge of Tomorrow is a rare beast — it’s a pulpy, visceral shoot-em-up that’s also intelligent and character-driven. (Check out this week’s Total Recall, in which we count down Cruise’s best-reviewed movies.)The Fault In Our Stars 81%When a beloved bestseller is adapted to the big screen, there’s inevitably some trepidation within the book’s fan base. After all, doesn’t Hollywood always screw up what made the book so special? Thankfully, critics say The Fault In Our Stars does John Green’s novel proud, thanks to a fine performance by Shailene Woodley and a script that that (mostly) avoids cliches on the way to its heart-tugging conclusion. Woodley stars as Hazel, a tough-minded teenager with thyroid cancer who reluctantly joins a cancer support group. There, she meets a sweet cancer survivor named Gus (Ansel Elgort), and the two bond over a love of literature. The pundits say The Fault In Our Stars occasionally veers into schmaltzy territory, but it’s crafted with an earnestness and sensitivity that’s tough to resist. (Check out our video interview with Woodley and Elgort, and flip through our gallery of contemporary books that have been adapted into films.)Certified FreshAlso opening this week in limited release:Bobcat Goldthwait‘s Willow Creek, a found footage horror film about two guys who go looking for Bigfoot, is at 95 percent.Test, a drama about the love affair between two dancers in the early years of the AIDS epidemic, is at 90 percent.Obvious Child, a comedy about a standup comedian who discovers she’s pregnant just as she loses her job and her boyfriend, is at 88 percent.The Dutch import Borgman, the unconventional tale of a rural eccentric who escapes from vengeance-seeking assailants and hides out in the suburbs, is at 86 percent.Dormant Beauty, starring Isabelle Huppert in a drama based on a real life euthanasia case, is at 85 percent.The Case Against 8, a documentary about the Supreme Court case that overturned California’s ban on same-sex marriage, is at 80 percent.Supermensch: The Legend of Shep Gordon, Mike Myers‘ documentary about the famed rock manager, is at 72 percent.The Sacrament, a horror film about a journalist whose search for his missing sister leads him to a mysterious religious community, is at 66 percent (check out director Ti West’s Five Favorite Films here).Citizen Koch, a documentary about the controversial political donors, is at 60 percent.Rigor Mortis, a horror thriller about a has-been actor who moves into a haunted apartment building, is at 57 percent.Trust Me, starring Clark Gregg and Amanda Peet in a dramedy about a Hollywood agent dealing with a talented child star and her overprotective dad, is at 56 percent.Ping Pong Summer, starring Susan Sarandon and Lea Thompson in a coming-of-age comedy about a table tennis-obsessed teen outcast, is at 50 percent.Anna, starring Mark Strong and Taissa Farmiga in a thriller about a detective attempting to understand the mind of a teenager accused of a triple homicide, is at 33 percent.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"TV, of, Tumblr, renewed, Society","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"critics-consensus-edge-of-tomorrow-is-certified-fresh"},{"id":"47508772065884","title":"Critics Consensus: Fast &amp; Furious 6 is Certified Fresh","content":"Critics Consensusvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Critics Consensus: Fast &amp; Furious 6 is Certified FreshPlus, The Hangover Part III is short on laughs, and Epic is a solid animated fantasy.by Tim Ryan | May 23, 2013 |  CommentsThis week at the movies, we’ve got racing renegades (Fast &amp; Furious 6, starring Vin Diesel and Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson); the Wolfpack on the prowl (The Hangover Part III, starring Bradley Cooper and Ed Helms): and a fantastical forest (Epic, with voice work by Amanda Seyfried and Beyoncé Knowles). What do the critics have to say?Fast &amp; Furious 6 70%While most movie franchises find themselves running on fumes after one or two sequels, the Fast &amp; Furious movies have improved as they’ve gone along. Critics say Fast &amp; Furious 6 shows the series still has plenty left in the proverbial tank — its absurd plot is merely an excuse to stage (even more) deliriously exciting chases, stunts, and crashes. This time out, Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) and his merry band of thieves postpone retirement when government agent Luke Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson) asks for their help in taking down a vicious criminal gang that counts old friend Letty Ortiz (Michelle Rodriguez) among its members. The pundits say the Certified Fresh Fast &amp; Furious 6 is as gleefully preposterous as previous installments, and if you’re in the mood for exhilarating, supercharged action set-pieces, you’ve come to the right place. (Check out this week’s 24 Frames for a gallery of the cars of Fast &amp; Furious.)The Hangover Part III 20%The Hangover Part II was mostly content to recycle its predecessor, so switching things up for the second sequel was probably a good idea. Unfortunately, critics say The Hangover Part III is so joke-free that it barely qualifies as a comedy, and while the stars make for good company as usual, the energy level isn’t particularly high. Phil and Stu (Bradley Cooper and Ed Helms) decide to get their out-of-control buddy Alan (Zach Galifianakis) into rehab, but their plan is foiled when a mobster (John Goodman) forces the Wolfpack to track down their old frenemy Chow (Ken Jeong). The pundits say The Hangover Part III is substantially darker than the previous installments, and it lacks the go-for-broke exuberance that made the original a massive hit. (Check out this week’s Total Recall for a countdown of Cooper’s best-reviewed movies, as well as our interviews with the stars.)Epic 65%Given the advances in CGI, it takes more than pretty pictures to make an animated feature worthwhile. Still, critics say Epic is so visually stunning and briskly-paced that it (mostly) overcomes its generic storytelling. While looking for her missing father in a forest, a teenage girl (voiced by Amanda Seyfried) stumbles across fantastical creatures and finds herself in the midst of a battle between good and evil. The pundits say say Epic‘s plot will seem familiar even to small children, but it’s a beautifully animated fantasy with an inspired vocal cast.Also opening this week in limited release:Nancy, Please, a thriller about a grad student who runs afoul of his malevolent former roommate when he tries to retrieve a treasured book from her, is at 100 percent.Richard Linklater‘s Before Midnight, which finds Before Sunrise sweethearts Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy now dealing with married life, is Certified Fresh at 98 percent.Plimpton! Starring George Plimpton As Himself, a documentary about the adventures of the noted writer and bon vivant, is at 86 percent.Fill the Void, a drama about an Orthodox Jewish woman who faces familial pressure to marry her late sister’s husband, is at 86 percent.Alex Gibney‘s We Steal Secrets: The Story Of Wikileaks, a doc about the website that published a variety of secret documents, is at 77 percent.Doin’ It in the Park: Pick-Up Basketball, NYC, a doc about the history and culture of New York’s playground hoops scene, is at 67 percent.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"teaser, Mary, television, aliens, guild, Premiere, Awards, south, Kids, Arrowverse, Academy, Nat, Bros.","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"critics-consensus-fast-and-furious-6-is-certified-fresh"},{"id":"47508781049523","title":"Critics Consensus: Moneyball is Certified Fresh","content":"Critics Consensusvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Critics Consensus: Moneyball is Certified FreshPlus, Dolphin Tale inspires, Killer Elite wanders, and Abduction sags.by Tim Ryan | September 23, 2011 |  CommentsThis week at the movies, we’ve got baseball nerds (Moneyball, starring Brad Pitt and Jonah Hill), aquatic rehab (Dolphin Tale, starring Harry Connick Jr. and Morgan Freeman), an assassin-dodging teen (Abduction, starring Taylor Lautner and Lily Collins), and a tough-guy showdown (Killer Elite, starring Jason Statham and Clive Owen). What do the critics have to say?Moneyball 94%Do you love The Natural, but wish the movie had found time to take a closer look at Roy Hobbs’s OPS and weighted on base average? Well then, Moneyball is the movie for you, and critics say it’s a moving, witty underdog tale that somehow manages to find drama in baseball stat geekdom. Oakland Athletics General Manager Billy Beane (Brad Pitt) is tasked with fielding a competitive team on a small-market budget. His solution is to ignore traditional scouting methods and focus almost exclusively on obscure statistics that measure players’ abilities in ways that have been overlooked by other teams. Will Beane’s feather-ruffling approach be accepted in the staid world of Major League Baseball — and more importantly, will it yield results on the field? The pundits say the Certified Fresh Moneyball is a smart dramedy with excellent performances and a razor-sharp script that is likely to appeal to folks who don’t know the first thing about our national pastime. (Check out our countdown of the best baseball movies here.)Dolphin Tale 82%In these cynical times, we could use some good old fashioned inspirational family entertainment at the multiplex. And critics say the pleasant, uplifting Dolphin Tale fits the bill, thanks to solid acting and a script that manages to avoid schmaltz and still jerk tears. Based upon a true story, Dolphin Tale is the story of an injured seafaring mammal who damages her tail in a crab trap. A team of specialists and a lonely youngster band together to help our aquatic heroine — now sporting a prosthetic tail — to swim again. The pundits say Dolphin Tale deftly avoids the corniness that could have weighed it down, and the result is a heartwarming film that will please both kids and adults.Abduction 5%Given his high-profile gig in the Twilight franchise, it was inevitable that Taylor Lautner would get his own starring vehicle. Unfortunately, critics say he could have chosen a better one than Abduction, a predictable, mediocre thriller that never slows down long enough to make sense. Launter plays Nathan Harper, who learns that the family he’s living with is not his own. Soon, he’s on the run from an elite group of assassins, and he tries to piece together his mysterious past while staying one step ahead of his pursuers. The pundits say Abduction is Bourne-lite, with unintentionally funny dialogue and an absurdly complicated plot that strands a talented cast. (Check out Lautner’s Five Favorite Films here.)Killer Elite 28%Killer Elite is a globe-trotting action flick with a top-notch cast and more on its mind than your typical thriller. Unfortunately, critics say those intriguing pieces don’t add up to a satisfying whole, and Killer Elite is ultimately a formulaic adrenaline-fest with a plot that wanders all over the place. Jason Statham plays Danny Bryce, a hired gun on the edge of retirement who’s lured back into action when his mentor Hunter (Robert De Niro) is taken hostage. Our hero must finish the job Hunter was contracted to do, but soon he’s run afoul with a rogue group of soldiers lead by Spike (Clive Owen), who’s now gunning for Danny. The pundits say Killer Elite has macho attitude to spare, but its execution is off, and the result is an overlong and confusing film that raises interesting moral questions without answering them. (Check this week’s Total Recall, in which we count down Statham’s best-reviewed movies.)Also opening this week in limited release:Weekend, a romantic drama about two men who meet and share their lives over the course of 48 hours, is at 100 percent.Thunder Soul, a documentary about Houston’s astonishingly funky Kashmere High School Stage Band, is at 100 percent.Pearl Jam Twenty, Cameron Crowe‘s documentary portrait of the grunge superstars, is at 71 percent.Limelight, a doc about the rise and fall of New York nightclub impresario Peter Gatien, is at 71 percent.The Whale, a doc about a killer whale who befriends some residents of Vancouver Island after being separated from his family, is at 67 percent.Puncture, starring Chris Evans in a drama about a drug addicted lawyer who investigates a health care and pharmaceutical industry conspiracy, is at 57 percent.Archie’s Final Project, dramedy about a high school filmmaker who announces he’s going to kill himself on camera, is at 40 percent.Machine Gun Preacher, starring Gerard Butler in a drama about a former biker and born-again Christian who goes to Sudan to save as many children as he can, is at 29 percent.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"aliens, discovery, screen","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"critics-consensus-moneyball-is-certified-fresh"},{"id":"47508782800578","title":"Critics Consensus: Super 8 is Certified Fresh","content":"Critics Consensusvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Critics Consensus: Super 8 is Certified FreshPlus, Judy Moody is kind of a bummer, and Midnight in Paris is Certified Fresh.by Tim Ryan | June 10, 2011 |  CommentsThis week at the movies, we’ve got a close encounter (Super 8, starring Kyle Chandler and Elle Fanning), a quest for fun (Judy Moody and the NOT Bummer Summer, starring Jordana Beatty and Heather Graham), and a Gallic nostalgia trip (Midnight in Paris, starring Owen Wilson and Rachel McAdams). What do the critics have to say?Super 8 81%With films like Jaws and Close Encounters of the Third Kind, Steven Spielberg altered the cinematic landscape by combining B-movie thrills with sophistication and emotional heft. Now, with Spielberg producing, J.J. Abrams tries something similar with Super 8, and critics say it’s a both an expert homage to old-school 1970s proto-blockbusters and an exciting, heartfelt thrill-ride in its own right. Super 8 is the tale of a group of youngsters who, while filming a homemade movie, witness a horrific train crash. When the citizens of their small town become unnerved by a series of unexplained disappearances, the kids begin to suspect the crash might not have been an accident — and it may have unleashed something unworldly upon their sleepy community. The pundits say the Certified Fresh Super 8 pulls off the neat trick of being both suspenseful and poignant, with strong performances and an uncanny sense of the story-driven power of Spielberg’s early classics. (Check out this week’s Total Recall, in which we count down Spielberg’s best productions.)Judy Moody and the NOT Bummer Summer 21%It’s an old adage, but it’s one that bears repeating: sometimes, what works on the page falls flat on the screen. Take Judy Moody and the NOT Bummer Summer, for example: critics say this kiddie comedy — based upon the bestselling books by Megan McDonald — is an exercise in overblown whimsy that’s so manic it never slows down long enough to charm. Judy Moody is the tale of a precocious eight-year-old (played by Jordana Beatty) forced to spend the summer with her eccentric Aunt Opal (Heather Graham) when her parents and best friends leave town. But Judy’s got a plan, in the form of a checklist of adventures that, if achieved, count for “thrill points.” The pundits say that little kids might find some laughs in Judy Moody, but their parents and older siblings probably won’t; despite the good efforts of a game cast, the movie is hyper and noisy, with a plot that’s more a series of zany vignettes than a cohesive story.Midnight in Paris 93%Even at this late stage of his career, Woody Allen is capable of wringing a few surprises out of his trademark formula. Critics say Midnight in Paris is a treat for Allen’s fans and romantics alike, a comedy about wish fulfillment that’s magical and touching. Owen Wilson stars as an aspiring novelist who, on a trip to Paris with his fiancée, is transported back to the city’s Jazz Age, sharing drinks with Salvador Dali, getting advice from Ernest Hemingway, and finding romance with a beautiful scenester (Marion Cotillard). But is our hero’s idealized 1920s Paris all that it’s cracked up to be? And is his fantasy incompatible with the real world? The critics say the Certified Fresh Midnight in Paris is a delight, with terrific performances from an all-star cast (particularly Wilson as Allen’s onscreen surrogate) and a dreamy sweetness that’s both funny and lovely.Also opening this week in limited release:One Lucky Elephant, a documentary about a man’s attempt to move an adult circus pachyderm to a more natural environment, is at 100 percent.The Trip, starring Steve Coogan and Rob Brydon in a largely improvised comedy about a pair of foodies on a jaunt across the English countryside, is at 85 percent.Viva Riva!, a Congolese crime drama about a small-time hustler looking to make a big score without running afoul of the underworld, is at 83 percent.Bride Flight, a drama about three Dutch women immigrating to New Zealand whose lives intersect with a fellow immigrant, is at 80 percent.TrollHunter, a horror/comedy about a group of Norwegian film students who discover a terrifying mythic beast, is at 77 percent.Road To Nowhere, a drama about a woman cast in a true crime film that shares many similarities with the victim she’s portraying, is at 71 percent.Just Like Us, doc about a Middle Eastern tour of a group standup comedians, is at 67 percent.Reversion, a meditative sci-fi drama about a woman with a mutation that doesn’t allow her to process time, is at 43 percent.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"renewals, Britbox, the, Endgame, documentary, review, Disney, Paramount, sports, TIFF, vampires, CW, christmas, stop, true","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"critics-consensus-super-8-is-certified-fresh"},{"id":"47508782794432","title":"Critics Consensus: Cars 2 is Stuck in Neutral","content":"Critics Consensusvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Critics Consensus: Cars 2 is Stuck in NeutralPlus, Bad Teacher doesn't quite pass the test.by Tim Ryan | June 24, 2011 |  CommentsThis week at the movies, we’ve got animated autos (Cars 2, with voice work from Owen Wilson and Larry the Cable Guy) and execrable educators (Bad Teacher, starring Cameron Diaz and Justin Timberlake). What do the critics have to say?Cars 2 40%Pixar’s output has been so good for so long that it seemed unfathomable that one of the studio’s films would get a less-than-rapturous response from critics. Well, all good things must come to an end, and that now includes Pixar’s streak of Certified Fresh releases; critics say Cars 2 looks fantastic, but the studio’s trademark storytelling prowess and character development is MIA here, and the result is a decent animated feature that must count as a big disappointment, given the standards that Pixar has set for itself. This time out, Lightning McQueen (voiced by Owen Wilson) is off to a big international race with his best buddy Mater (Larry the Cable Guy) in, ahem, tow. Soon, though Mater finds himself in the middle of a secret espionage mission. Will he still be able to help Lightning in his quest to be the fastest car in the world? The pundits say Cars 2 is visually delightful, but its plot is uninspired, and it’s over reliant on gags and shtick instead of an interesting story. (Check out this week’s Total Recall, in which we run though Pixar’s filmography in chronological order.)Bad Teacher 45%There’s no shortage of tasteless Hollywood comedies in the world, but it’s rare that a movie gets criticized for not being tasteless enough. However, such is the case with Bad Teacher, which critics say has moments of raunchy hilarity but doesn’t quite fulfill its outrageous premise. Cameron Diaz stars as Elizabeth, a boozy, wildly inappropriate middle school teacher who’s looking for a sugar daddy so she can leave her job behind. Elizabeth falls for a hunky substitute teacher (Justin Timberlake), but she’s got a rival for his affections, and soon, her scheming and bad behavior starts to affect the whole school. The pundits say Bad Teacher benefits from a sharp performance from Diaz, but it sags in spots, and it’s never quite as wild and transgressive as it should be.Also opening this week in limited release:Leap Year, a drama about a journalist who engages in a steamy, complicated affair with a sadist, is at 100 percent.If a Tree Falls: A Story of the Earth Liberation Front, a documentary about the radical environmental group that engaged in domestic terrorism, is at 85 percent.Chris Weitz‘s A Better Life, a drama about an immigrant’s struggle to provide for his teenage son, is at 83 percent.Passione, John Turturro‘s documentary tribute to the music and culture of Naples, is at 83 percent.Conan O’Brien Can’t Stop, a doc about the comedian’s stage show in the days after his public break from NBC, is at 79 percent.The Names of Love, a French romantic comedy about a radical woman who has affairs with conservatives in order to convert them to her cause, is at 67 percent.Turtle: The Incredible Journey, a doc about the 25-year global oceanic journey of a loggerhead turtle, is at 67 percent.General Orders No. 9, a meditative doc about the ecosystem of the South, is at 60 percent.The Best and the Brightest, starring Neil Patrick Harris and Amy Sedaris in a comedy about a couple that pulls out all the stops to get their child into an elite kindergarten, is at 36 percent.A Love Affair of Sorts, a lo-fi drama about a man who documents his tentative relationship with a woman he catches shoplifting, is at zero percent.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"TV, true, versus, Emmy, Heroines, ID, Century, Pet, Reality","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Critics-Consensus-Cars-2-is-Stuck-in-Neutral"},{"id":"47508824271953","title":"Al Gore’s Five Favorite Films","content":"Five Favorite Filmsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Al Gore's Five Favorite FilmsThe former Vice President, dedicated environmentalist, and center of this week's An Inconvenient Sequel lists his favorite movies that are both educational and entertaining.by Grae Drake | July 28, 2017 |  Comments(Photo by Britta Campion/Newspix/Getty Images)Former American Congressman, Senator, and Vice President Al Gore has been involved in environmental issues since the beginning of his career, working on pro-environment&nbsp;legislation, founding environmental advocacy groups, and even organizing benefit concerts. A little over a decade ago, his campaign to educate the public about global warming was the center of Davis Guggenheim’s documentary&nbsp;An Inconvenient Truth, which went on to win the Oscar for Best Documentary Feature (and, incidentally, Best Original Song).This week, Al Gore returns to theaters in&nbsp;An Inconvenient Sequel: Truth to Power, an examination of the progress made since the first film and a profile of Gore’s continuing efforts to enact effective measures against climate change. To celebrate the release, and in an effort to get more young people invested in the planet’s future, the film partnered with Snapchat to offer two free tickets to Snapchat users under the age of 18. Having originally seen the film at Sundance this year, RT’s own Grae Drake met with Al Gore earlier this week to chat about the film, and he gave us his Five Favorite Films that are both educational and entertaining. Read on for the full list.The Big Short (2015)  89%The subprime mortgage issue triggered the credit crisis, which in turn caused the Great Recession. And yet, it was so complicated that I would not be surprised if quite a few storytellers had despaired of their ability to elucidate it, but The Big Short did it so brilliantly and made it accessible and understandable, and in the process, inspired demands for reform. I thought it was extremely well done.Spotlight (2015)  97%Next, I would pick Spotlight, because the tragedy it explained in very personal and compelling ways is one that also needs to be more widely understood. And in the process, it threw light also on the importance of high-quality investigative journalism.Right. It almost seems like kind of an era long gone, in the majority of cases. Being an online journalist, I really admire those kinds of journalists.Yeah, and you know the guy who ran that team subsequently has been chosen to be the editor of the Washington Post. And the Washington Post has now reinvigorated the incredibly intense competition between the Post and the New York Times that was a big factor in Watergate, and now it is needed again.Hidden Figures (2017)  93%Choice number three may or may not surprise you, but I absolutely loved, loved, loved Hidden Figures. If I were a young African-American woman, I would ask the question: Why did I not know about this story before now? And even as a 69-year-old white male, I want to know why I didn’t know about that story. It’s so inspiring. It’s almost like a fact-checked Frank Capra movie for the 21st century, and really, really, really got me psyched up about it.I loved the portrayal of John Glenn in the movie as well. I’m always so excited to see people who are in positions of power having such a deep respect for the people that helped them become who they are. I liked that portrayal of him, and I choose to believe that’s how he really was.I had the privilege of serving with John Glenn in the United States Senate, and he was really like that. His wife, Annie, overcame a stuttering disability when she was young. He was really quite, quite something.Lincoln (2012)  89%Next, I would cite Lincoln. And I have two connections to the movie, so that’s part of the reason I’m including it on the list. My college roommate Tommy Lee Jones did an amazing job in the movie.So fascinated by that fact, by the way. I have tried to get him to talk about it, and he’s just cranky with me. He’s very discreet.It’s hard for me to believe that Tommy Lee has been cranky with a journalist.I’ve gotten nothing out of him. But he’s marvelous.Oh, my gosh. He’s an actor’s actor. And it was a Participant movie. They were part of the producing group, and I’m pretty fond of Participant.An Inconvenient Truth (2006)  93%I hope that you will be understanding when I mention my fifth choice, which is An Inconvenient Truth. Davis Guggenheim justly received the Oscar for his work on that movie. He’s a great friend; I was with him last night. He’s so talented, and he did such a good job in that movie. Of course, I’m hopelessly biased in including that in the list, but I’m encouraged by how many positive comments people made about how it affected them.Grae Drake for Rotten Tomatoes:&nbsp;When I saw An Inconvenient Sequel at Sundance, I was shocked at how many things from the first film have come true. When you were speaking to everyone after the show, there was, I felt, a real need for hope. Now that we’re six months past that, what’s your perspective right now? What can we do? Where are we now? Everyone who’s helping you — what’s their spirit like? Just give me some hope here.Al Gore:&nbsp;There’s a law of physics that sometimes operates in politics: For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. The reaction to Donald Trump has included an amazing upsurge of activism, especially among progressive forces who are now organizing in a way that I haven’t seen since the Vietnam War.You know the Indivisible group? They’re partnering with us during the launch of this movie. We are using the movie as a major organizing event to try to get people to go to the movie, to take others to the movie, to learn about the crisis and the solutions, and then use their voices to win the conversations on climate. That’s how social revolutions begin. To use their votes and their political activism to let candidates and office holders know that it’s really important to them, and that will bring the change we need. And then to use their choices in the marketplace; for example, by sending a signal to business that they want more responsible, climate-friendly products.

What do the critics have to say?Paul 70%Simon Pegg’s filmography is littered with expert genre parodies (Shaun of the Dead, Hot Fuzz), and director Greg Mottola is known for mixing big laughs with poignancy and intelligence. And although their new effort, Paul, may not live up to their previous work, critics say it’s an amiable, sweet road comedy that smartly sends up sci-fi references. Pegg stars as a fanboy who’s on a tour of America’s UFO landmarks along with his mate Nick Frost when he meets Paul (voiced by Seth Rogan), a crass, smart-mouthed little green man. With the Feds in hot pursuit, it’s up to our heroes to transport their alien pal to his intergalactic craft. The pundits say Paul isn’t the most disciplined comedy on the block, but it’s witty, warm, and smarter than your average road-trip romp.The Lincoln Lawyer 83%Matthew McConaughey’s big break as a leading man came with the 1996 adaptation of John Grisham’s A Time To Kill (not to mention Amistad the following year). So it’s nice to see him back in the courtroom, and critics say The Lincoln Lawyer is a good old-fashioned legal thriller with some interesting twists and an excellent performance from its star. McConaughey stars as a somewhat sketchy defense attorney who’s just landed the case of his career when he’s brought in to defend a millionaire bad boy (Ryan Phillippe). Soon, however, our protagonist discovers that not everything is as it seems. The pundits say the Certified Fresh Lincoln Lawyer won’t set the world on fire, but it’s skillfully made and entertaining, and it greatly benefits from a stellar cast. (Take a look at Phillippe’s Five Favorite Films.)Limitless 69%Limitless takes the concept of the Faustian bargain and gives it a contemporary spin: what if a revolutionary pharmaceutical could help you reach your full potential? It’s an interesting idea, but critics say the movie only partially fulfills it — it’s smart and slick, but also occasionally haphazard and frustrating. Bradley Cooper stars as a struggling writer who’s encouraged by a friend to try an untested miracle drug; soon, his brain is running on all cylinders and making big bucks on Wall Street. However, the drug has some serious side effects, and sinister forces want to get their hands on Cooper’s stash. The pundits say Limitless is stylishly directed and well performed, but in raising so many intriguing questions without answering them, the film can feel like a missed opportunity. (Check out this week’s Total Recall, in which we run down Limitless star Robert De Niro’s Best Movies.)Also opening this week in limited release:Nostalgia for the Light, a documentary about a research team in Chile’s investigations into big questions, is at 100 percent.Bill Cunningham New York, a doc about the legendary New York Times fashion photographer, is at 91 percent.Win Win, starring Paul Giamatti and Amy Ryan in a comedy about a wrestling coach who ends up caring for a runaway, is at 89 percent.Winter in Wartime, a drama about a youngster aiding the Resistance in Nazi-occupied Holland, is at 85 percent.The Music Never Stopped, a drama about a father who attempts to treat his son’s brain ailment with music, is at 72 percent.The Butcher, The Chef And The Swordsman, an action comedy about a butcher knife forged from the remains of legendary swords, is at 60 percent.Desert Flower, the tale of a Somali woman who escaped an arranged marriage to become a model, is at 44 percent.Cracks, starring Eva Green in a drama about jealousy and obsession at a remote all-girls boarding school, is at 39 percent.Finally, want to win a Rotten Tomatoes shirt?

What do the critics have to say?[tomatometer]MovieID=770813310[/tomatometer]Easy ALike Clueless and 10 Things I Hate About You before it, Easy A takes a classic tale – in this case, Hawthorne’s The Scarlet Letter — and gives it a contemporary teenage spin. Critics say Easy A benefits greatly from the presence of Emma Stone, who helps to elevate this John Hughes-esque comedy with her natural comic instincts. Stone stars as Olive, who, unlike poor Hester Prynne, becomes a minor celebrity in her school when tales of her (alleged) promiscuity get around; she subsequently tries to use the scuttlebutt to her advantage, but finds herself in the midst of a tangled web. The pundits say Easy A is funny and smart, and Stone emerges as a talent to watch.[tomatometer]MovieID=770814363[/tomatometer]The TownAs an actor, Ben Affleck’s career has had its ups and downs. In the director’s chair, on the other hand, he’s all aces: his debut was the Certified Fresh Gone Baby Gone, and critics say he’s got another winner with the visceral noirish crime drama The Town. Affleck stars as one of a group of old pals-cum-bank robbers; in the midst of a heist, he finds himself romantically drawn to a hostage and starts to think about going straight. But can he escape his past? The pundits say the Certified Fresh The Town is proof (if any were needed) that Affleck is a strong director, and he gets memorable performances out of Jon Hamm, Rebecca Hall, Jeremy Renner, and others in a strong crime procedural.(Check out this week’s Total Recall, in which we count down Affleck’s best-reviewed films.)[tomatometer]MovieID=770789904[/tomatometer]Alpha and OmegaAs How to Train Your Dragon and Toy Story recently reminded us, even in this age of CGI and 3D, the best special effects are always great characters and strong storytelling. Unfortunately, critics say those attributes are largely missing from Alpha and Omega, a generic action adventure with so-so 3D visuals. A pair of young wolves (voiced by Justin Long and Hayden Panettiere) find themselves relocated by forest officials, and must make their way back to their homeland in order to stop a war with another pack of wolves. Will they find romance along the way? The pundits say Alpha and Omega may please some of the little ones, but it’s not a terribly memorable film — the animation is rudimentary, the gags are pandering, and the characters are bland.[tomatometer]MovieID=771203480[/tomatometer]DevilIt appears the folks behind Devil were terrified of critical damnation, since their film wasn’t screened prior to its release.

What do the critics have to say?[tomatometer]MovieID=770802244[/tomatometer]The ExpendablesSly Stallone directs and stars in The Expendables, and he’s got a veritable army of your favorite action stars along for the ride, including Jason Statham, Jet Li, Mickey Rourke, and Terry Crews. Sounds like a rip-roaring good time, right? Well, critics say that while this old-school action flick is jam-packed with star power and explosions, it’s sadly short on imagination and decent plotting. Stallone stars as the leader of a band of mercenaries who’ve been hired to take out the puppet dictator of a fictional rogue nation. The pundits say The Expendables delivers some impressive, impossibly over-the-top action that harkens back to Sly’s 1980s heyday, but it’s a stale, humorless affair. (Check out this week’s Total Recall, in which we run down Stallone’s best-reviewed movies.)[tomatometer]MovieID=770857925[/tomatometer]Eat, Pray, LoveElizabeth Gilbert’s 2006 memoir Eat, Pray, Love made her the darling of book clubs across the nation, for obvious reasons: her witty travelogue acted as a wish-fulfillment fantasy for readers longing for globe-trotting, tasty meals, and a little amore. However, critics are less than enchanted by the movie, which, despite the luminous presence of Julia Roberts, is skin-deep and cliché-ridden. Roberts stars as a well-to-do woman who, after a painful divorce, travels the world in search of spiritual actualization and — of course — romance. The pundits say Roberts is magnetic, and the scenery is often breathtaking, but Eat, Pray, Love is short on profound insights despite its overextended runtime.[tomatometer]MovieID=770782775[/tomatometer]Scott Pilgrim vs. the WorldIs Scott Pilgrim vs. the World a comic book movie? Is it a video game movie? It’s both, and much more, say critics, who find this irrepressible action/comedy tough to resist. Michael Cera stars as Scott, an unemployed layabout whose life changes when he meets Ramona (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) the girl of his dreams. However, in order to win her, he must defeat her seven evil exes. The pundits say the Certified Fresh Scott Pilgrim sometimes suffers from excess, but what glorious excess it is — director Edgar Wright has fashioned a fast-and-furious miasma of pop culture references that’s heartfelt and very funny, sure to delight geeks and non-fanboys (and girls) alike with its manic, inspired sense of fun.Also opening this week in limited release:Animal Kingdom, a drama about the fall of an Aussie crime family, is Certified Fresh at 93 percent.Neshoba, a documentary about the murders of three Civil Rights workers in 1964, is at 88 percent.Peepli Live, a satire of contemporary Indian politics and media, is at 75 percent.Tales from Earthsea, a fantasy anime feature from Goro Miyazaki (the son of the legendary animator Hayao Miyazaki), is at 48 percent.Salt of This Sea, a drama about an American woman who attempts to find her Palestinian roots, is at 33 percent.La Soga, a drama about a secret police hitman who has a crisis of confidence, is at 25 percent.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"demand, Worst, Fox, lord, fiction, parents","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Critics-Consensus-The-Expendables-Isnt-Explosive-Enough"},{"id":"47508792298257","title":"Critics Consensus: Avatar Is Certified Fresh","content":"Critics Consensusvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Critics Consensus: Avatar Is Certified FreshPlus, Did You Hear about the Morgans? should go into hiding, and Crazy Heart is red hot.by Tim Ryan | December 17, 2009 |  CommentsThis week at the movies, we’ve got a strange alien world (James Cameron‘s Avatar, starring Sam Worthington and Zoe Saldana), and a couple on the run (Did You Hear About the Morgans?, starring Hugh Grant and Sarah Jessica Parker). What do the critics have to say?[tomatometer]MuzeID=1194501[/tomatometer]AvatarAvatar is one of the most hotly anticipated films in years, for a number of reasons: it marks James Cameron’s return to fiction filmmaking after a long layoff; its motion capture techniques were the subject of intense pre-release press; and it’s the most expensive movie ever made. And now, the verdict is in: critics say Avatar is indeed a visionary picture, a movie of such sensorial power and majesty that you won’t mind too much that the plotting and characters aren’t quite as state-of-the-art. Sam Worthington stars as an ex-Marine who has replaced his twin brother as an Avatar driver in the alien world of Pandora; he soon finds his loyalties divided between the military and the Na’vi, the indigenous species on this strange planet. The pundits are wowed by Cameron’s phantasmagorical visuals, which many agree mark a giant leap forward in the realm of special effects, and for that reason alone, you should probably see the Certified Fresh Avatar. (Check out this week’s Total Recall, in which we take a closer look at Cameron’s career, as well as our video interview with Worthington. In addition, watch this episode of Unscripted on Moviefone., in which Worthington and Saldana interview each other.)[tomatometer]MuzeID=1213718[/tomatometer]Did You Hear About the Morgans?Fish-out-of-water comedies are so prevalent at this point that any new entries in the genre need to bring something fresh to the table. Unfortunately, critics say the appeal of Hugh Grant and Sarah Jessica Parker is not enough to elevate Did You Hear About the Morgans? above its middling script. Grant and Parker star as a big-city married couple on the rocks; upon witnessing a murder, the Witness Protection Program relocates them to Wyoming, where they relearn to love each other. The pundits say Morgans is utterly generic, with shopworn stereotypes about small town folk, and little chemistry between its two leads; worse, it’s almost laugh-free.Also opening this week in limited release:Crazy Heart, starring Jeff Bridges as a down-on-his-luck country singer looking for a last shot at love, is Certified Fresh at 96 percent.A Town Called Panic, a surreal, wacky, and brightly-colored stop-motion animated film, is at 80 percent.The Young Victoria, starring Emily Blunt as the woman who would be queen in the midst of a power struggle for the throne, is at 69 percent.The French import Ricky, a comedy about an oddly gifted infant, is at 43 percent.Nine, starring Daniel Day-Lewis and Penelope Cruz in an adaptation of the hit Broadway musical, itself a take on Fellini‘s 8 ½, is at 34 percent.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"crime, Purge, Film, Plus, dramedy","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"critics-consensus-avatar-is-certified-fresh"},{"id":"47508793837351","title":"Critics Consensus: Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince is Certified Fresh","content":"Critics Consensusvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Critics Consensus: Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince is Certified FreshPlus, 500 Days of Summer is sweet and poignant.by Tim Ryan | July 16, 2009 |  CommentsThis week at the movies marks the return of the young wizards of Hogwarts with Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, starring Daniel Radcliffe and Emma Watson. How does the latest installment stack up with the critics?[tomatometer]MuzeID=1189302[/tomatometer]Harry Potter and the Half-Blood PrinceThe Harry Potter franchise has maintained a level of quality nearly unmatched in recent times. And critics say the latest, Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, is no exception. This time out, Hogwarts has become a gloomy place, with suspicions running high and hormones running wild; in addition, Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) is steeling himself for a big showdown against the forces of evil. If Half-Blood Prince has a failing, pundits say, it’s one that’s common to franchises: it’s a transitional installment. That said, the production design is moody and impeccable, the tension is palpable, and there’s a welcome strain of humor to the proceedings. In addition, the three principal actors — Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, and Emma Watson — have grown into their roles, and the supporting players are outstanding. Half-Blood Prince isn’t the best reviewed in the series — Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban holds that honor – but it’s still Certified Fresh.

What do the critics have to say?[tomatometer]MuzeID=10008827[/tomatometer]Where the Wild Things AreMaurice Sendak’s Where the Wild Things Are is one of the most beloved classics of modern children’s literature, but the brief text doesn’t necessarily lend itself to feature-length cinematic treatment. Critics have largely praised Spike Jonze for maintaining the spirit of the book while adding some visually daring touches to bring it to life; however, some feel the narrative is a little thin. Max (Max Records) is a troubled youngster who disappears into a fantasy world of his own making, populated by fluffy monsters who symbolize the various facets of his personality. The pundits say Wild Things may be a little too creepy for the wee ones, and it lacks a strong plot. However, the images Jonze crafts are so wondrous that older kids — and adults — will find the film to be a fascinating, poignant dreamscape.[tomatometer]MuzeID=1198026[/tomatometer]Law Abiding CitizenNobody says that a thriller needs to be completely plausible to be watchable. However, staying somewhere within the bounds of believability is generally required, and on this count, and several others, critics say Law Abiding Citizen fails. Gerard Butler stars as a man whose family has been murdered; he becomes enraged when the prosecutor (Jamie Foxx) makes a plea deal with the killer, and goes about exacting revenge. The pundits say Law Abiding Citizen isn’t just outrageously contrived; worse, it lingers a little too long over some gruesome violence under the guise of making a political statement about the judicial system. (Check out our interview with director F. Gary Gray, who shared his Five Favorite Films with RT.).[tomatometer]MuzeID=1207147[/tomatometer]The StepfatherIt appears the folks behind The Stepfather are being a little too strict with their baby, as it wasn’t screened for critics prior to release.

What do the critics have to say?[tomatometer]MuzeID=1200615[/tomatometer]Inglourious BasterdsHistorians may have plenty of quibbles with Quentin Tarantino’s wild and wooly take on World War II. However, critics have fewer reservations on Inglourious Basterds, calling it an audacious, bravura piece of pulpy pop filmmaking. Brad Pitt stars as the leader of a group of Jewish soldiers who terrorize the Nazis and plot a brilliant plan to put an end to the Third Reich. Meanwhile, a German officer (Christopher Waltz) is hot on the Basterds’ trail. The pundits say Basterds may not be Tarantino at his peak, but it’s perhaps his most loving tribute to cinephilia yet, as well as a bracing, tense exercise in over-the-top action. Like most of Tarantino’s directorial efforts, Inglourious Basterds is Certified Fresh.[tomatometer]MuzeID=1198526[/tomatometer]ShortsDirector Robert Rodriguez has seamlessly moved between the worlds of violent adult-themed film (Sin City, From Dusk Till Dawn, Desperado) and more family-oriented fare (the Spy Kids franchise). After working with Quentin Tarantino on 2007’s B-movie tribute Grindhouse, Rodriguez returns this week with another whimsical children’s film, Shorts. In Shorts, an 11-year-old boy named Toe Thompson happens upon a magical rainbow-colored rock that grants wishes to anyone that holds it, and after it falls into the hands of the neighborhood grown-ups, Toe and his friends must band together to save the town from chaos. So far, while some critics have noted the film’s hyperkinetic pace and imaginative premise as strengths, others fail to see any underlying charm and feel the director’s enthusiasm is wasted. (Be sure to check out our interview with Rodriguez from Comic-Con, in which he talks about his own son’s involvement in the project.)[tomatometer]MuzeID=1190015[/tomatometer]Post GradAt a time when college graduates are having a tough time finding work, Post Grad seemingly benefits from timeliness. Unfortunately, critics say the film is less about our current economic situation and more about shopworn romantic comedy conventions. Alexis Bledel stars as a grad that has been beaten out of her dream job by her college rival, so she moves back in with her parents — and finds herself torn between two dudes. The pundits say Post Grad is listless and dull, squandering a solid cast that includes Jane Lynch, Michael Keaton, and Carol Burnett on a script that lacks much insight into the heady days of post-collegiate life, and worse, one that is woefully short on laughs.[tomatometer]MuzeID=10011621[/tomatometer]X-Games 3D: The MovieWhen the X Games held its first annual competition nearly 15 years ago, some dismissed it as a novelty act, while others clearly foresaw its potential to explode worldwide. Now a legitimate sporting event, the extreme sports exhibition has spawned several similar competitions and garnered coverage from the likes of ESPN and ABC Sports, so it’s only natural that the next step would be a feature-length documentary in 3D. X-Games 3D: The Movie mashes together a string of impossible stunts from the various events, sound bites from the biggest names, and a narrative voiceover by Emile Hirsch, but early critical response has been negative overall. Most are saying the film plays out like an extended commercial for the event, offering little beyond what one might find in a typical broadcast of the X-Games besides the novelty of 3D, and its appeal may extend no further than its built-in fans.Also opening this week in limited release:Spike Lee‘s Passing Strange, a document of the Broadway smash featuring singer/songwriter Stew, is at 100 percent.50 Dead Men Walking, starring Ben Kingsley and Jim Sturgess in the tale of an IRA informant in the 1980s, is at 84 percent.Bobcat Goldthwait‘s World’s Greatest Dad, starring Robin Williams as a high school teacher who turns family trauma into new opportunities, is at 82 percent.The Baader-Meinhof Complex, a thriller involving the German terrorist organization of the 1970s, is at 79 percent.My One and Only, starring Renee Zellweger and Kevin Bacon in a screwball comedy based upon the life of George Hamilton, is at 70 percent.The Italian import The Headless Woman, about a woman’s struggle with reality after a random traffic accident, is at 67 percent.Five Minutes of Heaven, starring Liam Neeson in the story of the fallout from a murder in Northern Ireland, is at 56 percent.Art &amp; Copy, a documentary about influential and memorable advertising images, is at 50 percent.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"Central, Holidays","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"critics-consensus-inglourious-basterds-is-certified-fresh"},{"id":"47508793839400","title":"Critics Consensus: Bruno is Certified Fresh","content":"Critics Consensusvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Critics Consensus: Bruno is Certified FreshPlus, critics have little love for Beth Cooper.by Tim Ryan | July 9, 2009 |  CommentsThis week at the movies, we’ve got Austrian audacity (Bruno, starring Sacha Baron Cohen) and graduation gratification (I Love You, Beth Cooper, starring Hayden Panettiereand Paul Rust). What do the critics have to say?[tomatometer]MuzeID=1200814[/tomatometer]BrunoSacha Baron Cohen has become one of cinema’s most daring provocateurs — and astute social critics. Critics say his latest vehicle, Bruno, is at once laugh-out-loud funny, teeth-grittingly awkward, and disarmingly intelligent — though it’s a few notches below his last gonzo doc, Borat. Cohen plays Bruno as a flamboyantly gay Austrian fashionista, with a desire for fame an an aptitude for making people very uncomfortable; like Borat, he also has the ability to get people to say disturbingly revealing things on camera. The pundits say Bruno isn’t quite as sharp as its predecessor, but it’s still shocking and oddly perceptive. It’s also Certified Fresh.

Unfortunately, the pundits say Beth Cooper fails on both levels. Paul Rust stars as a high school valedictorian who declares his love for super-popular Beth Cooper (Hayden Panettiere) during his commencement speech; later that night, she shows up at his house to take him on a whirlwind tour through her world, which results in parties, debauchery, and property destruction. The pundits say this is a tired, joyless affair cribbed from parts of much better, more substantial teen flicks. It’s also filled with stereotypical characters and occasionally offensive gags.Also opening this week in limited release:Yoo-hoo, Mrs. Goldberg, a documentary about forgotten radio and TV personality Gertrude Berg, is at 94 percent.Humpday, an indie comedy about a pair of old buddies who enter a porn contest, is at 89 percent.The Mexican import Lake Tahoe, a deadpan comedy about a teenage who crashes the family car, is at 86 percent.Soul Power, which documents the concert in connection with the Ali-Foreman “Rumble in th Jungle” and features such legends as James Brown and B.B.

What do the critics have to say?The wait is finally over, and the word is good. Indiana Jones and the Kingdomof the Crystal Skull may not be of the order of the first three Indyadventures, but critics say it’s a solid entry in the series. Skull findsthe principals from Raiders of the Lost Ark (directorSteven Spielberg,producer George Lucas, and starsHarrison Ford andKaren Allen) battling theSoviets to keep the world safe from nuclear war. This time, an aging Indy’sjoined by a youngster (Shia LaBeouf) who helps him track down the titular skullbefore a ruthless Russian agent (Cate Blanchett) gets her hands on it. Thecritics say Skull is a solid action adventure buoyed by the warm feelingsthe Indy franchise has generated over the years; they say it’s good to bein the company of these characters again, even if the results aren’t asexhilarating as past entries. At 77 percent on the Tomatometer, Skulldespite being the worst-reviewed entry in the series, is still Certified Fresh.(And check out all of our Indiana Jones featureshere.)“Let me show you how Russians say good-bye.”Also opening this week in limited release:War, Inc., starringJohn Cusack andHilary Duff in a satire of themilitary-industrial complex, is at 21 percent.Uwe Boll‘s Postal, a post-9/11 satire, is at 25percent (check out Boll’s list of his five favorite movieshere).A Jihad for Love, a documentary about homosexual in the Muslim world, isat 83 percent.The Edge of Heaven, a drama about family ties and immigration, is at 76percent.The Children of Huang Shi,a drama set in war-torn China in the 1930s starringMichelle Yeoh,Radha Mitchell, andJonathan Rhys Meyers,is at 25 percent.“Hey, where’s the fourth Horseman?”Indiana Jones Movies:—————————-90% — Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade (1989)87% — Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom (1984)95% — Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981)","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"comedies, America, Mary, Rocky, chucky, of, Witch, Women's, Film","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"critics-consensus-indiana-jones-is-certified-fresh"},{"id":"47508799874915","title":"Critics Consensus: No Go for Speed Racer, Vegas Cashes Out","content":"Critics Consensusvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Critics Consensus: No Go for Speed Racer, Vegas Cashes Outby RT Staff | May 8, 2008 |  CommentsThis week at the movies, we’ve got fast cars (Speed Racer,starring EmileHirsch and Christina Ricci),marital mishaps (What Happens in Vegas,starringAshton Kutcher andCameron Diaz),and battle royals (David Mamet‘s Redbelt,starringChiwetel Ejiofor).What do the critics have to say?Sing along with me: “Here it comes, here comes Speed Racer / It’s gettingbad reviews….” The critics say the Wachowski brothers’ big-screen adaptation ofthe old-school toon is loaded with flashy visuals, but is too bombastic andthinly plotted to resonate. Emile Hirsch stars as the titular hero, who, withthe support of main squeeze Trixie (Christina Ricci), battles it out it out withRacer X (Matthew Fox) in a cross-county road race that Speed learns is beingunfairly influenced by corporate interests. The pundits say Speed Racer istoo loaded with eye-popping (some say headache-inducing) visuals and too shorton character development and coherent plotting. At 32 percent on theTomatometer, you may not want to go (Speed Racer) go to this one. (Checkout this week’s Total Recall, in which we count down the greatest movie cars ofall time.)“Rotten!”&nbsp;How much mileage can a movie get out of the appeal of its stars? With regard toWhat Happens in Vegas, the critics say quite a bit — though perhaps notenough to deal this formulaic romantic comedy a winning hand.Ashton Kutcher andCameron Diaz star as a pair of strangers who stumble into matrimony afterhitting the jackpot; what follows is a battle of the sexes and a tug-of-war overthe money. The pundits say Diaz and Kutcher display solid comedic chops, but arelet down by a predictable plot and a sour undercurrent. At 50 percent on theTomatometer, you have even odds of enjoying this one.“I doubt that’s going to fit in the ATM slot.”With a gift for cryptic language and complex characterization,David Mamet isone of America’s most celebrated playwrights. It turns out he’s also a bigmartial arts fan. In Redbelt, Mamet’s passions collide, and critics sayit’s a solid, if not spectacular, combination.Chiwetel Ejiofor stars as aJiu-Jitsu teacher who preaches self-defense; however, after an accident new hisschool triggers a series of ominous events, he’s forced to step into the ring.The pundits say Redbelt features many of the strengths of Mamet’s work:strong acting (from a cast that includes Joe Mantegna,Emily Mortimer, andTimAllen), intriguing moral dilemmas, and rich dialogue. But some say it’s a littletoo tightly scripted to be fully believable. Still, at 64 percent, the scribessay Redbelt hits pretty hard.&nbsp;“For next year’s fundraiser, we should just have a cops vs. firemenbasketball game!”&nbsp;Also opening this week in limited release:Refusnik, a documentary about longstanding activist efforts to help Jewsin the Soviet Union, is at 100 percent.&nbsp;Turn the River, starringFamke Janssen as a pool hustler working to getback the son she gave up at birth, is at 88 percent.&nbsp;The MemoryThief, starring Mark Webber and Rachel Miner in the tale of a man whobecomes obsessed with the Holocaust, is at 86 percent.Monster Camp,a doc about live action role playing, is at 83 percent.OSS117: Cairo, Nest of Spies, a parody of espionage thrillers, is at 75percent.The Merchant-Ivory period drama, Before theRains, about a cross-cultural love affair in 1930s India, is at 50percent.Battle forHaditha, Nick Broomfield s chronicle of a dark campaign in the Iraq war,is at 44 percent.Noise, starring Tim Robbins in a comedy about a man who loses it afterbeing inundated with street sounds, is at 44 percent.The French slasher import,Frontier(s), abouta group of criminals who stumble into a house full of flesh-eaters, is at 43percent.The TraceyFragments, starringEllen Page ina dark comedy about a teenager searching for her brother, is at 40 percent.The Fall, a fantasy film about strange goings-on in a Los Angeleshospital, is at 42 percent.The Babysitters, starringJohn Leguizamo and Cynthia Nixon in comedyabout a girl who stars a sitting/callgirl business, is at 34 percent.&nbsp;“Patti Smith or Sonic Youth?”&nbsp;Wachowski Brothers Movies:—————————————-37% — The Matrix Revolutions (2003)73% — The Matrix Reloaded (2003)86% — The Matrix (1999)88% — Bound (1996)","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"show, LGBT, Trivia, BAFTA, X-Men, zero, monsters, TV","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"critics-consensus-no-go-for-speed-racer-vegas-cashes-out-2"},{"id":"47508801385326","title":"Critics Consensus: Cruel to Be Kind, Vantage Has Little Point, Guess Witless Protection‘s Tomatometer!","content":"Critics Consensusvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Critics Consensus: Cruel to Be Kind, Vantage Has Little Point, Guess Witless Protection's Tomatometer!Also: Charlie Bartlett will nearly cure what ails ya.by Tim Ryan | February 21, 2008 |  CommentsThis weekat the movies, we’ve got views to a kill (Vantage Point, starringDennis Quaidand Matthew Fox), medicated youth (Charlie Bartlett, starringAnton Yelchin andRobert Downey Jr.), a pair of DIY filmmakers (Be Kind Rewind, starringJack Black andMos Def), andSouthern justice (WitlessProtection, starringLarry theCable Guy). What do the critics have to say?Apolitical thriller featuring conflicting eyewitness accounts, Vantage Pointcertainly sounds intriguing, like a cross between Z and Rashomon.Unfortunately, critics say that while the premise is sound, the execution islacking. Vantage Point follows eight different people who try to unlockthe truth behind a political assassination attempt, despite their differingperspectives. The pundits say Vantage Point has some tight, tensemoments, but is ultimately undone by its gimmicky technique and increasinglyfar-fetched plot developments. At 33 percent on the Tomatometer, Vantageisn’t quite on Point.“You can play Doom RPG on this!\"In thetradition of Ferris Beuller’s Day Off,Charlie Bartlett is thestory of a teen who’s too clever by half. And critics say the movie’s prettysharp itself.Anton Yelchin stars in thetitular role as a teen who’s run afoul with every school he’s attended; in hislatest go-round, Charlie becomes something of a counselor to his classmates —while attempting to outwit school administrators. The pundits say Charliefeatures a star-making performance for Yelchin, as well as some sharp, cleverplotting, though some find it a little toothless. Still, at 56 percent on theTomatometer, you’re a (mostly) good man, Charlie Bartlett.“Crossfire / You’ll get caught up in the / Crossfiyaaaa…”MichelGondry has carved out one of the most distinctive niches in recent cinema; EternalSunshine of the Spotless Mind and The Science of Sleep exude a mix ofchildlike wonderment and dazzling visual inventiveness. But critics say hislatest,Be Kind Rewind, maintains Gondry’s oddball aesthetic withoutthe emotional uptick of his previous flicks. The filmstarsJack Black as a man who has unintentionally erased all the VHS tapes athis friend’s (Mos Def) video store; the pair team up to remake the moviesthemselves. The pundits say that Rewind has sweetness and originality tospare, but is slighter and less disciplined than Gondry’s previous mind-benders.At 68 percent on the Tomatometer, Rewind is Kind to the Gondry faithful.\"Don’t worry, Miss Farrow, Supergirl is lost forever.\"Perhapsthe folks behind Witless Protection were concerned that movie criticsneeded protection from their film, since it wasn’t screened for critics.Larry theCable Guystars as a small-town lawman who runs afoul of the FBI afterrushing to the rescue of an attractive witness in a high-profile case, who mayhave been victimized by rogue agents.

However,two sequels later, critics say the thrill is gone, and formula has set in. In Rush Hour 3, ourheroes head to Paris to take on the Triads; action, wisecracks, and culturalmisunderstandings ensue. Pundits say Rush Hour 3 simply doesn’t addenough new elements to the mix to make it worthwhile; worse, they say there’s alack of energy that makes schlepping through an incomprehensible plot prettydifficult. At 23 percent on the Tomatometer, this franchise’s Hour may beup. (Check out RT’s interview with Tucker and director Brett Ratnerhere.)&nbsp;\"And here’s me giving testimony via video link.Don’t I just look adorable?\"A mashup of fantasy, adventure, romance, and comedy, critics are calling Stardust one of thebest big-kid fairy tales since The Princess Bride.Based upon Neil Gaiman‘sfantasy novel, Stardust spins a tale of a young man who sets out to provehis love to the girl of his dreams by presenting her with a fallen star; heembarks on a journey through a forbidden kingdom, encountering witches, pirates, and other magical folks along the way. The pundits say the cast —which features RobertDe Niro, SiennaMiller, Michelle Pfeiffer, Claire Danes, PeterO’Toole, and Charlie Cox — is top-notch, and helps to enliven directorMatthew Vaughn‘simaginative fantasy world. While some pundits say the movie has moments ofunevenness, it has enough visual razzle-dazzle, good humor, and well-drawnperformances to compensate. At 76 percent on the Tomatometer, Stardustshines brightly.&nbsp;Claire Danes is a star-crossed lover once again.If you are of the opinion that what is sorely lacking from contemporary Americancinema is flatulence, critics don’t deny that Daddy Day Camphas an ample supply of it. However, if you require laughs from your comedies,you may want to book another trip. Picking up where 2003’s poorly-reviewedEddie Murphy vehicleDaddy Day Careleft off, Camp stars Cuba Gooding Jr. as the head of a dilapidated summercamp, where a ragtag bunch of kids cause him no end of trouble. The pundits sayDaddy Day Camp is little more than a collection of predictable, insipidgags that generate more guffaws than chuckles. The scribes also lament the stateof Gooding’s once-promising career, noting that he’s largely reduced to muggingthough mediocre projects like this one. At two percent on the Tomatometer, Daddy Day Camp is one of the worst-reviewed films of the year.“What would you think if I directed this projectile vomit scene? Would you stand up and walk out on me?”Apparently, the people behind the werewolf flick Skinwalkers areafraid those pesky critics may have revolvers full of silver bullets, since itwasn’t screened prior to release.

What do the critics have to say?In \"Vacancy,\" Luke Wilson and Kate Beckinsale star as a couple whose vacation is sidetracked when their car breaks down and they check into a nowhere motel with a sinister history. \"Vacancy\"’s premise, which borrows from such voyeur classics as \"Psycho\" and \"Peeping Tom,\" ain’t exactly original, and some critics have denounced the clichés from the get-go. But the movie’s defenders say it’s a surprisingly effective B-thriller, a sleazy movie that works because it relies more on tension than gore. At 65 percent on the Tomatometer, \"Vacancy\" may not become a genre classic but horror and thriller fans would do well to check into theaters this Friday.\"Luke Wilson Bot, power down.\"Anthony Hopkins plays a charming rogue better than just about anyone, and Ryan Gosling has showed he can do earnest better than the rest as well. Put them together, and what have you got? \"Fracture,\" a crime drama about a young district attorney (Gosling) convinced of the guilt of a just-acquitted attempted murderer (Hopkins). The critics say \"Fracture\" may be manipulative, but in the best way, with suspenseful plotting and excellent lead performances. At 67 percent on the Tomatometer, you may want to make a break for \"Fracture.\"Ryan Gosling plays cops and robbers with his finger gun.\"The O.C.\" may have been canceled, but the show will live on through its DVDs, countless compilation soundtracks…and the careers of the show’s alumni. Displacing his sensitive young adult persona onto the silver screen, Adam Brody stars in \"In the Land of Women\" as a man who returns to his hometown and gets touchy-feely with not one, not two, but three females. While pleasantly acted, the critics deride it as painfully obvious, dramatically stunted, and with underdeveloped characters better suited for TV movies. \"Land of Women\" registers a 38 percent on the Tomatometer, so consider taking a detour.\"I appreciate James Mercer on a much deeper level than you do.\"With \"Shaun of the Dead,\" director Edgar Wright and screenwriter/star Simon Pegg made a delirious zombie flick that worked as both a satire and as a straight-ahead horror film. Now they’re back with \"Hot Fuzz,\" turning their attention to the world of cop-buddy-action movies. And the critics say it’s a perfect fit. Pegg stars as a city cop who’s so accomplished that he’s commissioned to a sleepy village, which is subsequently overrun with grisly accidents. The pundits say \"Hot Fuzz\" is works as a loving homage to such fare as \"Lethal Weapon\" and \"Bad Boys,\" while skewing the conventions of the sub-genre with panache and glee. At 87 percent on the Tomatometer, \"Fuzz\" isn’t only smokin’ hot, it’s also Certified Fresh.Nick Frost serves up two slices of fried DVD gold.Also opening this week in limited release: Thai import \"Syndromes and a Century,\" the latest from Apichatpong Weerasethakul, is at 93 percent on the Tomatometer; \"The Valet,\" a frothy French farce starring Kristin Scott Thomas and Daniel Auteuil, is at 90 percent; \"Severance,\" a slasher/ corporate satire, is at 85 percent; \"Stephanie Daley,\" a drama about a family grappling with a variety of sordid topics, is at 86 percent; and \"Smiley Face,\" a stoner comedy from Gregg Araki starring Anna Faris, is at 67 percent (check out RT’s Sundance review here).\"Who wants to come?

The film, billed as an \"anti-romantic comedy,\" tells the story of a couple in the final death spiral of a relationship, the inverse of typical Hollywood rom-com fare. It’s an intriguing idea (kinda like a Frat-Pack version of Bergman‘s \"Scenes from a Marriage\"), but the critics say that two of contemporary cinema’s most likeable actors stranded in a tonally schizophrenic plot with unfunny bickering that is simply hard to watch.

The Oscar-nominated actor is best known for his roles in such movies as The Godfather Part III, When a Man Loves a Woman, the Ocean’s franchise, and The Untouchables, but Garcia also produces, writes, directs, and even composes music for film. As a lifelong music lover, he’s also produced Grammy-winning albums for and toured with the band of the legendary Cuban musician Israel “Cachao” Lopez, about whom he also directed a feature-length documentary.Garcia’s latest film is City Island, a dramedy in which he plays the patriarch of a dysfunctional New York family whose propensity for keeping secrets hurtles them (sadly, but often humorously) towards an inevitable confrontation. Andy was kind enough to take some time out of his schedule to chat with RT about his Five Favorite Films, his ongoing friendship with Al Pacino, his acting process, and what it’s like to have children in the industry. Like many before him, Garcia admitted that his Five Favorites often rotate: “These are the ones that came to me today; you know, tomorrow, the list might change.

You’d almost have to put Part I and II together, because they were so close together, and they’re so innately tied into one another. Not to exclude Part III as a bad movie, but… I don’t see it that way, but I can’t vote for Godfather III because I’m in it. So I have to group those two together. I think those are joined at the hip, in a way.I believe Francis Ford Coppola said something to the effect of the third Godfather film serving as an epilogue to the first two.Right, exactly. It functions in a different way. Although, I must say that, every day of my life, I get people screaming at me in the streets, saying, “Hey, when’s Godfather IV?” I think they look at it as an ongoing serial, and they want to know more about what’s going on. So, I’m sure there’s still a franchise there if Francis wanted to approach it or Paramount wanted to approach it. I’m not sure how the dynamics of that would work these days, but I know the interest is there, only because I’m field testing it every day. Well, in the sense that I’m sort of like the barometer because people in the street go, “Hey man, when’s it going to happen?”It certainly sounds like you’re up for it, if it happens, but regardless of that, does it ever get to a point where you tire of hearing it everywhere you go?No, no, not at all. I’m honored to have been associated with those films, are you kidding? I mean, Godfather Part I was a movie that, certainly my generation of actors, if not every generation after it, was deeply inspired by. To be part of that was an extraordinary blessing. I don’t get tired of it. If someone says, “When’s Godfather IV?” I say, “I’m waiting along with you.” If they want to do it, that would be an extraordinary thing. Working with Francis is like working with Aristotle. He’s an extraordinary creative mind; I found that to be very stimulating.Being There (1979, 95% Tomatometer)Then I would have to go with Hal Ashby’s Being There. I was struck by the tone of the film and the extraordinary performances in it, starting obviously with Peter Sellers. It was one of the most sublime movies I had ever seen.When The Pink Panther 2 opened, you mentioned how you had grown up watching Peter Sellers in the original Pink Panther films.Right, sure, of course. He was sort of the comedic hero of the 1960s, you know. So he did a lot of those movies, and After the Fox, and I was always a big fan of his. So when they called about doing the Pink Panther film, it was just a gas to be in that credit sequence where I could be alongside an animated Pink Panther, and the [Henry] Mancini theme. Plus, it had a very nice cast, and I had good fun with it. Lighthearted.Serpico (1973, 92% Tomatometer)Then I would have to — and it’s hard to pick just one of his — but I would go with Sidney Lumet’s Serpico. Again, a performance-driven film, but there’s a sort of a reality to Sidney Lumet’s movies. I had the great pleasure of working with him, and there’s a reality, a sort of documentary quality to his films, you know? And it’s hard to pick from the lot of his films, whether it be Network or Dog Day Afternoon or Serpico. But there’s something about Serpico that has an emotional depth to it that was very touching. And also, it’s easy to identify with someone who’s trying to fight against the system and rise above it and do well, and the price that he pays for doing that. And Al Pacino’s performance in that movie is quite extraordinary.Knowing that you were a fan of his, what was it like to meet him and work with him in Godfather III?He was extremely generous, you know, very easygoing. He’s all about the work, and about the enjoyment of the work. We got to become very close allies in the movie. He treated me like his nephew and I treated him like my uncle. It was a very warm experience. He wasn’t taking me under his wing from an acting standpoint; he would never sort of presume or condescend to you in that way. It was an embrace from the point of view of, “We’re in this thing together, and this is a family, which is sort of a metaphor for the film. Just come on board. There’s nothing you need to prove; there’s nothing you need to do to sit alongside us in this theatrical experience.” So in that sense… I’m not talking about it in the sense that he was “showing me the ropes” or anything like that, you know what I mean? He wouldn’t presume to even feel like he needs to do that. It was more like, from a familiar point of view. You know, you’re a fellow actor, and coming from the stage, he knows that the stage is the great equalizer. [laughs] Everyone steps on it with equal energy, so everybody’s taking care of each other. It was a joy to work with him. And, you know, we remain good friends to this day. I mean, he’s still my “Uncle Michael.”Mon Oncle (1958,94% Tomatometer) &amp; Playtime (1967, 100% Tomatometer)Okay, I’m going to do a hybrid again. Jacques Tati’s Mon Oncle and Playtime; I’m going to put those two together. One’s sort of spun off the other, in a way, but you could put either, because it’s really about Tati himself, and the conceptual art of his films. The film that has almost no dialogue, just gibberish and music and human behavior, and staging. Competition is staging, which I found fascinating. They seduce you into paying attention to the simplest of details.The General (1927, 92% Tomatometer)I would go back to Buster Keaton’s The General. The accomplishment of that movie in those days, you know… First of all, Buster Keaton as an actor — and as a comedian — but as an actor really, was… again, I think the word “sublime” comes across, because of that sort of deadpan quality that he had. When he was still, you felt as though his feet had roots, and they were sort of embedded and grounded into the ground. And, you know, a hurricane could come and it would never push him over. So that sense of stillness that he had, that had this kind of emotional weight inside of it, created juxtaposition to the stuff that he would do. Even if he was moving around, there was always a sense of a “man against the world” kind of thing that was always very compelling. But that movie, what he did with that movie, with that train, and the kind of stunts he was doing on his own, and just running around… I mean, just the accomplishment of that movie from a technical standpoint in those days was quite something. So that’s my list as of today.Next, Garcia talks about his Marlon Brando impersonation, his acting process, and working alongside his real life daughter.RT: Let’s talk about your new film. Your character in City Island is a correctional officer and an aspiring actor who’s heavily inspired by Marlon Brando, and I’d heard that it was actually your idea to make Brando his muse.Andy Garcia: Yeah, it was initially more general. It was more like Scorsese, DeNiro, Coppola, Brando, New York movies, posters everywhere. And I had this idea to focus it on Brando, and let it be private, not posters up on his walls and stuff like that in his office. Just keep it very private, and discover tapes that are hidden in the shed, and eventually get into this thing where Alan [Arkin] wrote this beautiful speech that dismantled the Brando thing. That was something that he wrote. Once we had layered in the Brando thing, he had an idea about pauses and Brando and all that, and he wrote that speech for his character, which was very funny. And I told [director] Ray [De Felitta], obviously about the fact that [Vince] could break into this impression without really knowing he’s doing it. Just out of complete fear and nervousness, you know. His body collapses, sort of like an allergic reaction to the audition, and goes to the only thing he knows is good acting, which is Brando. Raymond found it funny, so he said, “Let’s try it.”And you went with it. Is that Brando impersonation something you practiced? Because it was hilarious.I don’t know if I practiced. I just messed around with it as a joke, you know, but it’s not like I practiced it. I just kind of did it as a joke. It’s the largest laugh I’ve ever gotten in my life, with the worst impression I’ve ever done in my life. [laughs] So, there you go.[rtimage]MapID=10011801&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=4&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Considering that, as well as the fact that you’re doing movies like City Island and some broader comedies like parts of the Ocean’s films and The Pink Panther, was comedy one of your passions back then, and is it still?Yeah, definitely, and it still is. Well, you look at my Favorite Film choices, and three of my films are comedies. I think four of them are comedies, actually, if you look at Being There as a comedic film, in a way, or a dramedy.When you were doing that audition scene in City Island, did you find yourself recalling your own auditioning experiences?Oh sure, the anxiety of that, absolutely. That’s all working in your subconscious. You prepare yourself for that scene, and you have all that stuff working. There are scenarios when you’re starting out that are very uncomfortable, and you kind of beat yourself over the head for being so ridiculous in the room, of course.And how exactly do you prepare for a scene in which you have to pretend to be a bad actor? Is there anything in your process you have to do differently?Study acting all your life. No, it’s like preparing for anything else. It’s a thing that’s in the moment, you know. I don’t rehearse the scene and design the scene before I step into it; I just step into it. I prepare myself for the scene. I prepare the character, why he’s there and all that stuff. But I don’t rehearse the scene and say, “I’m going to do it this way, and this is how I’m going to say it.” I’m doing that for the first time as I’m doing the scene. So I’m just trying to live the scene in an organic and truthful way, and stay open and as spontaneous as possible with my fellow actors. I’m not preparing the scene in that way; I’m preparing the life of the character and the stakes that he’s in, and what is important to him. I’m thinking about those things; I’m not thinking about the lines or how I’m going to say them, or whatever, you know what I mean? You just step in the door and see what happens. Just live in the moment, you know?[rtimage]MapID=10011801&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=5&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Looking at the supporting cast, there are a lot of actors with whom you’ve previously worked, including your daughter Dominik. I know that she’s played your daughter before, but this is the first time she’s done so as an adult. Did the lines between reality and the film ever blur during those scenes you shared with her? When you’re playing her father and having these interactions with her, does your relationship with her influence and inform your character?I certainly hope so. Why would we ignore that? No, of course, I mean, one of the things that I remember from working with Al [Pacino] on The Godfather… The way we worked on the relationship was just to be together as much as possible off camera. Go to dinner and hang out, and we never talked about the scenes, or rehearsed the scenes. We worked on our relationship so that when the cameras would roll, that sense of family, that sense of comfort, that’s understood already. It was there. So in a case where you’re working with your own daughter, why would you want to ignore all that history? You know, as an actor, you’re trying to create that history with your fellow actor, like I would create a history with Steven Strait or Ezra Miller in the movie. You know, I have to cheat my subconscious into thinking, “This is my son,” and look at him in the eye and hold him and kiss him and run my hands through his hair. He’d go, “What are you doing?” and I’d go, “Leave me alone. You’re my son; I’m your father. I can do whatever I want.” You know what I mean? And get close to him, and bond with him, so when we’re on camera, that can be there.Are you very hands-on with Dominik’s acting career?No, no, not at all. Both she and my middle daughter Daniella are actresses. They’ve chosen that as their careers; my middle daughter’s just graduating from college at Cal Arts. What I’ve told them, at least, about the preparation, is to study and prepare yourself for your career, seriously, which they’ve done all their life; they’ve always been very passionate about it. And then, of course, we talk about what kind of acting we respond to, and what they’ve seen. We talk about the work, like “Oh, you should’ve seen this guy. So-and-so was so good,” or “You should have seen Meryl in that movie,” or whatever. We talk about the work. When [Dominik]’s acting, that’s her thing, that’s her art, unless I’m directing her, which I have. But in City Island, we’re colleagues and we’re helping each other as actors. If I see she’s stuck, then as an actor, I would try to help her, you know, just like if I’m stuck, she’ll try to give me something. It’s her art; she has her process like I have mine. We both strive for the same thing, but we each have our process. When the door closes behind you, you’re on your own, so you gotta be ready to do your thing.Check out Andy Garcia in City Island, which opened in limited release on March 19 and will continue to expand throughout the Spring.

The North American box office plummeted to one of its worst showings of 2015 with the top ten generating a measly $66M in ticket sales led for the fourth week in a row by the latest Hunger Games while the only new wide release, the epic Moby Dick&nbsp;adventure In the Heart of the Sea, attracted little interest from moviegoers. Film fans are focused on the highly-anticipated arrival of Star Wars: The Force Awakens which begins breaking records this Thursday night with 7 p.m. pre-shows.In its fourth weekend, The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 2 collected an estimated $11.3M declining by a moderate 40%. Lionsgate has amassed $244.5M to date which is still the smallest gross yet for the profitable series with the new chapter currently running 12% behind the pace of its 2014 predecessor which sat at $276.9M at this same point. The only other film in this franchise to four-peat was the first Hunger Games in the spring of 2012. Of course, part of the reason for the new film staying on top is next weekend’s Star Wars scaring away studios from programming anything worthwhile on this frame.Overseas, the second Mockingjay boosted its cume to $320.1M led by the U.K. and Germany with $38.1M and $36.2M, respectively. The global haul stands at $564.6M including China where the film has finished its run. Last year’s chapter was higher at this stage with $611M and that total did not include China which opened later in the run. The entire franchise has grossed just under $2.9M worldwide to date.Opening close behind in second place was Ron Howard’s historical adventure In the Heart of the Sea with an estimated $11M from 3,103 theaters for a weak $3,547 average. The Warner Bros. release starring Chris Hemsworth earned lackluster reviews and never commanded much consumer interest in the first place. Add in the fact that the PG-13 actioner found no love from end-of-year awards groups and Heart clearly had no must-see buzz.Studio data showed that the audience was 68% over the age of 35 and 54% male as young people were not engaged at all. The CinemaScore grade was a B+ which is decent, but not strong enough to signal nice legs ahead. Thursday night’s arrival of Force will only make matters worse, though the studio can always have a new hope trying to capture spillover business from those sold out of Star Wars.Even if a solid holiday run results in the weeks ahead, it will be difficult for In the Heart of the Sea to finish its domestic run much past the $50M mark. That would be a big disappointment for Warners, given the production cost estimated to be over $100M. Even international may not save this one.Kidpic The Good Dinosaur isn’t exactly showing sensational legs. A decent hold saw the toon drop 32% to an estimated $10.5M lifting the total to just $89.7M. Dinosaur is running a mere 7% ahead of 1998’s A Bug’s Life, Pixar’s lowest-grossing movie ever. Luckily ,the Disney empire will be taking in truckloads of cash next weekend with the return of Mr. Solo.This weekend, Creed became the highest-grossing Rocky franchise installment in 30 years as movie fans delivered another good hold with a 33% slip to an estimated $10.1M. With an impressive $79.3M after its third weekend, the second-generation boxing drama surpassed the $70.3M of 2006’s Rocky Balboa on Friday. A trip to the $100M club looks very likely.The rest of the holdovers were slumming it in single-digit-millions land. In its second weekend, the horror-comedy Krampus enjoyed an acceptable hold thanks to good buzz and no new competition falling 51% to an estimated $8M. Universal has banked $28.2M to date.Sony’s big end-of-year offering SPECTRE dropped 28% to an estimated $4M boosting the domestic haul to $190.8M which is 30% behind Skyfall from the same point three years ago. Global grosses have exceeded $820M now. The studio’s Seth Rogen holiday comedy The Night Before followed with an estimated $3.9M, down 23%, for a cume of $38.2M. Collecting an estimated $2.7M in its sixth weekend was Fox’s The Peanuts Movie which dipped 26% and sits at a sum of $125M.Gaining awards season momentum with three Golden Globe nominations for picture, director, and screenplay, Open Road’s Spotlight did well again easing just 10% to an estimated $2.5M as its theater count broke the 1,000 mark for the first time. Cume is now $20.3M with plenty to come thanks to the upcoming holiday season plus continued Oscar talk. Fox Searchlight’s Brooklyn hung in the top ten again with an estimated $2M, off 19%, for a new total of $14.3M.Generating spectacular results in its platform debut was the all-star financial meltdown pic The Big Short which opened to an estimated $720,000 from only eight locations for a stunning $90,000 average. The Paramount release combined starpower from Christian Bale, Steve Carell, Ryan Gosling, and Brad Pitt with great reviews and growing awards buzz including the four Golden Globe nominations that came out on the day before it released. All audience metrics show very positive support from paying moviegoers. Short will remain limited while Star Wars opens and then expands nationwide on Dec. 23 as it embarks on a potentially lucrative holiday season run despite a crowded field.The Weinstein Co. finally expanded its awards contender Carol after three weeks in four theaters. With five Globe nominations including Best Picture – more than any other film – it went out slowly to 16 sites and grossed an estimated $337,000 for a solid $21,063 average. Sum is $1.2M.The top ten films grossed an estimated $66M which was down 11% from last year when Exodus: Gods and Kings opened at number one with $24.1M; and down a steep 52% from 2013 when The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug debuted in the top spot with $73.6M.Compared to projections, In the Heart of the Sea opened very close to my $12M forecast.Get earlier box office updates and analysis by following BoxOfficeGuru.com on Twitter.Follow Gitesh on Twitter!","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"Worst","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/14004832/mockingjay-600.jpg","slug":"box-office-plummets-in-a-calm-before-the-star-wars-storm"},{"id":"47508814553078","title":"Neve Campbell’s Five Favorite Films","content":"Five Favorite Filmsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Neve Campbell's Five Favorite FilmsThe Scream star talks her love of old-school musicals and Robert Altman, and shares the discoveries she made while working on new opioid-addiction drama Castle In the Ground.by Joel Meares | May 12, 2020 |  Comments(Photo by Tasos Katopodis/WireImage)Fans of the&nbsp;Scream&nbsp;series’&nbsp;Sidney Prescott may not recognize Neve Campbell in her latest role, a terminally ill mom struggling with opioid addiction in the Canadian drama&nbsp;Castle In the Ground.&nbsp;The actress&nbsp;– most famous as the ass-kicking final girl&nbsp;of Wes Craven’s slasher franchise – gives&nbsp;a raw, vulnerable, and moving performance as Rebecca, who swings between guilt about her son (Alex Wolff) giving up so much of his life to care for her, and outbursts driven by her addiction to the meds numbing her pain. The movie, which follows Wolff’s character’s own journey through addiction and his relationship with a troubled neighbor (Imogen Poots), premiered at the 2019 Toronto International Film Festival, where writer-director Joey Klein, Campbell, and the cast were heralded&nbsp;for their intimate look at the mammoth opioid crisis. Ahead of&nbsp;Castle In the Ground‘s at-home release, Campbell shared her Five Favorite Films with Rotten Tomatoes and explained what drew her to the new project. Plus – deep breath, Scream&nbsp;fans –&nbsp;she revealed&nbsp;she may not be done with Ghostface just yet.Cinema Paradiso (Nuovo Cinema Paradiso) (1988)  90%My dad introduced me to cinema when I was a kid, to watch old films and foreign films, and so I think I was just touched by the idea of a young kid getting to know the projectionist in a village and falling in love with the world of cinema. I kind of related to that. And then I related to the idea of a kid’s passion for movies and eventually getting out and making movies himself. I like the idea of that. And the pacing of the film, and the beauty of the cinematography, and the relationship between the boy and the projectionist is very, very sweet and very touching.Call Me by Your Name (2018)  94%It’s such a touching, beautiful depiction of coming of age and discovering one’s sexuality and first love. I thought Timothée Chalamet’s performance was so beautiful and he captured youthful discoveries in such a way, I was moved for days. And again, the pacing of the film was so patient and thoughtful, and the cinematography and the location really brought you into the film. I felt transported.The monologue with the father towards the end of the film, where he reveals that he perhaps had a similar experience, or his life could have been different had he allowed himself the room to be who he needed to be –&nbsp;I just thought it was such a beautiful moment.That’s two movies set in beautiful parts of Italy. Do you have a thing for the Italian countryside?I hadn’t even thought about that! I think maybe because my dad raised me on foreign films I lean in that direction. I don’t think it was specifically Italy, but obviously it’s a very romantic location.The Big Chill (1983)  69%I love intimate ensemble pieces that allow you to get to know the dynamic amongst a group of characters without overly complex plot lines. The movie certainly made me wish I’d grown up with those people. You know, despite their flaws. They really had such a wonderful, deep love and friendship between them that I think is meaningful. It’s a phenomenal cast and I just loved the history that was created amongst the characters without it being fed to you; it was unraveled for you throughout the film.Singin' in the Rain (1952)  100%I was a dancer, and this movie inspired me to become a dancer, I think. I grew up watching Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers films, and they really inspired me. I loved watching the big dance sequences in this film. Gene Kelly is phenomenal. I love that the film has fun looking into the transition from silence into sound in the movie world as well. It was a big challenge for a lot of actors to go from one to the other, and I think they have a really hilarious look at that transition. But also I think it’s these big dance numbers and big choreographed pieces with a hundred dancers on top of their game. You just wouldn’t see that anymore. You wouldn’t see sets like that either – the shots are just phenomenal.Do you have a favorite song or sequence from the movie?In Singin’ in the Rain? “Singin’ In the Rain,” of course. He’s so brilliant in it, it’s so flawless and beautiful. I was thinking it must have been freezing. They still haven’t figured out how to do warm rain –&nbsp;it’s totally cold and he must have been freezing. When you think about that it’s pretty phenomenal.McCabe &amp; Mrs. Miller (1971)  84%It’s not your typical Western movie, although it might be mistaken as one. There’s virtually no dialogue in it, which I love. You know, I’m obviously a big Robert Altman fan; I got to make a movie with him [The Company]. I love his work, and I actually hadn’t seen this film until I worked with him and had a look at it. I think the performances are very surprising and wonderful. I personally love a film that doesn’t have much dialogue in it and the story’s basically told through glances and sounds, and I just think it’s unique.Joel Meares for Rotten Tomatoes: What was Joey’s pitch to you to come on board for The Castle in the Ground? What was it that interested you about the film and the script?Neve Campbell:&nbsp;Well, I think it’s a very important topic. The subject of the opioid crisis is very important at the moment. I think over half a million people have lost their lives to the opioid crisis and it’s tens of thousands of people a year, still. And I think so few people really realize how easily people can succumb to these medications and how dangerous they can be if not taken appropriately. So, for me that was really important.I hadn’t seen Joey Klein’s work before, and when it was brought to me, I watched his movie The Other Half. I don’t know if you’ve seen it, but it’s stunning. The performances are amazing and the time that he allows actors to go to where they need to go to and the vulnerability that he gets out of actors is a beautiful thing. Joey himself is an actor, and it’s always nice to work with directors who are also actors, because it’s a different language, and it’s sort of nice to be able to relate in that way when you’re being guided.Rotten Tomatoes: Was there something that you learned about the opioid crisis or how people get access to these drugs while making this film that surprised you?Campbell: I watched a bunch of documentaries once I got the film, when I decided to do it, and I spoke to Joey’s dad, actually, who is a doctor in Montreal. He spoke to me about what people go through, and I hadn’t realized the impact that Purdue Pharma [which introduced OxyContin to the market] had on the amount of people whose lives were lost. [It’s] pretty awful to think about the knowledge that they already had about the addictive qualities of these medications and the fact that they were not being honest about it. It’s pretty horrific to learn about that. And as I said, I hadn’t really been aware of the numbers before. So for me it was very eye-opening, and then infuriating.Rotten Tomatoes: The relationship that you have with Alex Wolff’s character in the beginning of the film is so beautifully rendered and important when we consider his journey in the movie. Had you worked with Alex before and how did you guys create that genuine-feeling mother-son intimacy?Campbell: I had never met Alex before we got on set together and started our first scene. I think the fact that I’m a mother of two boys really helped me. It helped me be aware of what that dynamic would be already and added an understanding of how devastating this journey would be with my son if I were to go through that myself.And Alex was very, very willing to be vulnerable, and it was so important for this character, and he really went there. He was so committed to it. I think we were really glad when we realized in that first scene that we were both going to allow ourselves to be vulnerable and that we could be; we were safe in that place together.Rotten Tomatoes: We can’t let you go without asking about the upcoming Scream movie. Have you been approached about playing Sidney Prescott again?Campbell: We’re having conversations –&nbsp;I have been approached about it. The timing’s a bit challenging because of COVID. You know, we only started the conversation maybe a month and a half ago, so it’s going to take some time to figure out how it’s all going to work out…. We’re negotiating, so we’ll see.The two directors wrote me a very touching letter about Wes Craven and how he was such an inspiration to them and how they really want to honor him, and that meant a great, great deal to me. So, we’ll see.

The multiple Oscar nominee, who over 60 years has worked with the likes of Alfred Hitchcock, Hal Ashby, Brian De Palma, Eliza Kazan, Alexander Payne, and Patty Jenkins, has more than 10 projects currently in development, most of which hit theaters and streaming this year. The highest-profile of those will be Once Upon a Time In Hollywood, which marks his third time working with director Quentin Tarantino, and in which he plays George Spahn, owner of the Spahn Ranch, which was the onetime home of Charles Manson and his followers. But perhaps&nbsp;Dern’s most celebrated role of 2019, when the year is done with, will be his performance in The Mustang. In the film, Dern plays horse wrangler Myles, who leads an equine therapy program at a Nevada prison and who takes an interest in the rehabilitation of the movie’s central character, Roman (Matthias Schoenaerts). The drama has been in limited release for a few weeks, earning plaudits for Dern’s work and rave reviews all around – it’s Certified Fresh at 95%. As The Mustang expands into more theaters, we spoke with Dern about his Five Favorite Films, and what drew him to his latest role.Lawrence of Arabia (1962)  93%First of all, [for something to be great] there’s magnificence in every single department. Whether it’s genre, whether it’s locations, whether it’s cinematography, whether it’s performances, whether it’s script, whether it’s sound – that’s number one. I saw&nbsp;Lawrence of Arabia&nbsp;in theaters. I’d been an actor for about a year and a half; I was under contract to Elia Kazan. I went to the movie and I was absolutely blown away. But the thing that blew me away more than anything else was that the guy did that. I mean this isn’t “once upon a time;” a guy did&nbsp;that. A guy wrote the book, Seven Pillars of Wisdom. He was there, he did it, and I don’t think he ever saw 40 years old. Excuse my language, but I’ve always been quite impressed with people that got s—t done. And he got stuff done.Amadeus (1984)  93%The second movie that stuck with me more than any others was&nbsp;Amadeus. Because that guy did that. You know what I mean? I remember when Prince died a few years ago, I had a Twitter at that time (I don’t have it anymore). But all I put out on my little Twitter was, “We lost our Mozart today.” And I think that’s true. I look at Bohemian Rhapsody&nbsp;and they did a very nice job with it — the kid is very good, this Rami Malek. It was a good movie, but [Freddie Mercury’s] not Mozart. I think [with Amadeus] they did as good a job [as they could] without doing a documentary in the era of 400 years ago or, actually, however many years ago it was.I go back to when Lawrence climbed on a motorcycle at the end of Lawrence of Arabia. And that’s the same thing [with Amadeus]: When Mozart is writing the piece at the end of the movie and Salieri cannot even keep up with him. He’s&nbsp;that&nbsp;quick and he’s that ahead and Salieri says, “No, no, you go too fast, you go too fast, you have to slow down, slow down.” But there’s no slowing down. “Are you with me, are you with me?” And he says, “Yes, yes, I think I get it.” And Mozart says, “And now … 400 voices,” and Salieri just drops the pen and says, “Well that can’t be done. We can’t do that.” And then within five minutes, we see him lying in a potter’s field grave at 26 years old.The Godfather, Part II (1974)  96%I’d say Godfather 2&nbsp;was up there. (And I did a movie for Francis…) After Godfather 1, I wouldn’t know how he would make a Godfather 2, but he did it. Because of the time span and what it covered, it’s an opera. I mean, there are acts, and it just worked, and I hadn’t seen that done really well. I’ll go see a movie because of moments, and I’ll go to see that movie again. I mean, like The Killing,&nbsp;the movie that Kubrick made when he began. Sterling Hayden is in it, where they robbed the racetrack, you know? And Sterling Hayden is in the locker room getting ready, putting the mask on, and realizing they’re not flowers in the box but a machine gun. It’s just before kick-off and he takes a long deep breath, and Stanley Kubrick was there for him.Nebraska (2013)  91%I’m very proud of my movie, Nebraska. I don’t really know what a great film is. I don’t know what the ingredients should be. But I certainly think Nebraska&nbsp;is a credit to the industry of filmmaking and it’s done very, very well. And both he [director Alexander Payne] and Quentin [Tarantino, with whom Dern has worked three times] can make a f–king movie, trust me. Alexander said to me the first morning, “Do you see anything here, you’ve never seen before?” I went looking around – we were in Nebraska in some little town in the middle of October, cold, freezing – and I said, “Yes I do.” I said, “It seems like everybody here is putting their oar in before 8am.” And he said, “Well hopefully, that’s because we have 91 crew members here and 78 have worked every day on every film I’ve ever made.” He put his hand on my shoulder and he said, “So you, sir, can go take a risk.” And he said, “This is Phedon Papamichael; he’s your cameraman.” I met him the day before. And he said, “I wonder if you’d do something for Phedon and I, that we’re not sure you ever did in your career.” I said, “Well what’s that?” And he said, “Never show us anything. Let us find it.” And I knew for the first time in my life I had a partner.Al Pacino came up to me — I’d never met him — at a party and said, “You know, I’ve not seen your movie yet, Nebraska. But everybody back at the Actors Studio – ’cause we’re both members –&nbsp;is talking about your performance.” So Brad Grey is at the party, and he ran Paramount then, and I said, “You know, Al Pacino has not got a screener,” ’cause it was Christmas time. So he said, “Tell him he’ll have one tomorrow morning with his newspaper.” At noon the next day my phone rings and I pick it up and he says, “Bruce, Al Pacino.” I said, “Oh wow.” He said nothing for about 10 seconds, and then he said, “How did you do that?” I told him what Alexander told me about “let us find it.” And he said, “I have tears in my eyes, because you knew you had a partner. I’ve never had a partner.”He said, “Bruce, I never ever saw the work. You were just the character.” And that’s the greatest compliment to me I ever had.The Last Emperor (1987)  89%I think the fifth greatest movie I ever saw was&nbsp;The Last Emperor. Again, it really happened. I mean he [director Bernardo Bertolucci] also could make a movie. The thing I’m leaving you with is this: I’m a runner. When you run, it’s about your training, and it’s the same way with filmmaking. If you miss a day as a runner, only you&nbsp;know it. If you miss two days, your opponent knows it. And if you’ve missed three days, the crowd knows it. All the movies I mentioned, you had, I don’t know, 60 to 150 shooting days. And every single day, everybody on the set brought it to work – everybody.Joel Meares for Rotten Tomatoes:&nbsp;Did you know about the equine therapy portrayed in&nbsp;The Mustang&nbsp;before you made the film?Bruce Dern:&nbsp;No. Once I read the script, I told Laure [de Clermont-Tonnerre] I really can’t believe this goes on and more people don’t know about it. I’ve done Westerns all my life – I had to kill John&nbsp;F–king Wayne! And then a year later, blow up the Super Bowl [in&nbsp;Black Sunday]. I mean talk about all-time tricks! And then when she told me about&nbsp;[the therapy] and when I went there to shoot… everybody you see that goes into the ring with the horse and&nbsp;everyone in the movie except for Steven Mitchell and Matthias Schoenaerts and me, are prisoners. All the guys in the interviews are prisoners, too.RT: You said you like movies for moments – is there a moment in&nbsp;The Mustang&nbsp;that sticks with you?Dern:&nbsp;In the movie, Miss Britton – I think her name is Connie Britton, I never met her – she was the psychiatrist, and she sits&nbsp;[Roman, played by Matthias Schoenaerts]&nbsp;down, and she sits three or four other guys down, and she asks them three questions. And to me, it’s one of the purest moments I’ve ever seen in film, because the first thing she says is, “How long have you been in?” And he doesn’t say anything for a long time, and then he says, “12 years.” And she says, “And how long a time was it between the time you perpetrated the attack and the time you thought of perpetrating it?” And every single guy she talked to of the 12 never said anything more than three seconds. And Matthias says, “Instantaneously.” Then she said, “And what was it you did?” Well at the end of that, you understand what a violent offender is.The Mustang&nbsp;is currently in limited release and opens in more theaters April 5.","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"tv, &, dark, ID, Disney, Mindy","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/01135135/Bruce_Dern_FFF_Rep.jpg","slug":"bruce-derns-five-favorite-films"},{"id":"47508816167946","title":"Jim Jarmusch’s Five Favorite Films","content":"Five Favorite Filmsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Jim Jarmusch's Five Favorite FilmsThe Dead Don't Die director is a big fan of Charlize Theron and says American Pyscho is more relevant now than ever.by Jacqueline Coley | June 13, 2019 |  Comments(Photo by Theo Wargo/Getty Images)Broken Flowers&nbsp;writer-director&nbsp;Jim Jarmusch is bringing his brand of cinema to ‘zombie horror’ – well kinda. Like his first toe-dip into genre filmmaking,&nbsp;Only Lovers Left Alive, The Dead Don’t Die is a film with horror elements but which isn’t a “true” horror film;&nbsp;it would be more appropriate to call it Coffee, Cigarettes, and Zombies. Like his 2004 cult hit,&nbsp;Coffee &amp; Cigarettes, it boasts a stellar cast and whip-smart dialogue.&nbsp;Where the black-and-white cult classic made the mundane act of chatting over coffee entertaining, the poet-turned-director’s new zombie comedy leans into the laughs&nbsp;by way of its characters’ deadpan approach to a zombie invasion.We recently chatted with Jarmusch about Cannes – where Dead&nbsp;made its world premiere – as well as&nbsp;his love for Charlize Theron, and how Wonder Woman really didn’t do it for him. He also&nbsp;gave us some of his five favorite films,&nbsp;and like many subjects of this column, was quick to point out that the list could change depending on what day of the week it is.American Psycho (2000)  69%My number one is&nbsp;American Psycho, 2000. A masterful adaptation of words to cinema by Mary Harron, an important American director, and writer. She made Alias Grace, The Notorious Bettie Page,&nbsp;I Shot&nbsp;Andy Warhol, et cetera. This is adapted from Bret Easton Ellis’s 1991 novel that was set in the 1980s. And I think that the film resonates even more now than when it was made almost 20 years ago. Though at the time it was called sexist filth by some [laughs]. Christian Bale’s performance is brutally riveting, and the entire cast– Willem Dafoe, Chloe Sevigny, Reese Witherspoon, and Jared Leto&nbsp;– are all just really good. There’s also an uncut ‘Killer Collections’ edition, which I would strongly recommend. It’s a great film.Heaven Knows What (2015)  87%Heaven Knows What is such a disturbing story about unrequited love, heroin addiction, and suicidal tendencies that somehow evades being only completely weighed down by desperation. Even though the death-like weight of the all-out junkie life is detailed and harrowing, it’s also a really interestingly made film in the way it’s shot – it’s bleak, yet somehow a fascinating and important addition for me to recent American filmmaking. And the central character played by Arielle Holmes who also wrote the script and lived the life, and she plays a very riveting and detailed character. Coupled with a&nbsp;great performance from Caleb Landry Jones, who also, appears in&nbsp;our&nbsp;film, among several other actors. Did you see that one?Let the Sunshine In (Un beau soleil intérieur) (2018)  86%Let the Sunshine In, 2017, Claire Denis “comedy.” I have comedy in quotes. [Laughs] Starring the always fascinating Juliette Binoche as a Parisian artist who’s kind of looking for love in all the wrong places. And it’s kind of a sister film to Claire Denis’ film Friday Night from 2002. But in this one, Binoche inhabits a very complex character who is not entirely self-aware. I found myself laughing at many subtle moments – her misjudgments and misadventures. It also includes some great characters also portrayed by Alex Descas, Valeria Bruni Tedeschi, and Gerard Depardieu in a great scene at the end.Atomic Blonde (2017)  78%Atomic Blonde, 2016. I’ve seen it three times. It’s directed by David Leitch, of John Wick fame. But this is my idea of the ultimate feminist action movie. Wonder Woman, I’m sorry, just didn’t do it for me, but Charlize Theron is definitely my idea of a female superhero somehow. She balances femininity, vulnerability, and total badass strength. So she is truly great in this film. And I would say, she usually is very strong. I love the way that Charlize Theron is rarely, if ever, like overplaying anything. And the film is ingenious; it takes place in Berlin, just 24 hours before the wall falls. It’s full of betrayal, violence, intrigue, and the idea of life and death become completely irrelevant when the wall comes down. It’s a&nbsp;really brilliant plot. And also James McAvoy, John Goodman, and Toby Jones deliver really engagingly creepy, supporting performances. The action sequences are all amazing, the visual effects, and hats off to Charlize Theron. I really love, Atomic Blonde.Female Trouble (1974)  88%Female Trouble, 1974. John Waters. And this may be my very favorite John Waters film. Divine is hilariously divine, and the other actors include fabulous Waters favorite, Mink Stole, Edith Massey, and an old friend of mine, the always iconic, Cookie Mueller, who we lost quite a while ago. But as time goes by, for me, John Waters becomes more and more important as his work echoes through our culture. What is so particular and striking for me about John Waters is that no matter how perverse and weird his themes and characters may be, his films are never ever mean spirited. There’s some kind of naked celebration of human nature and its ridiculousness. And John Waters is such an uplifting and remarkable person. I mean where would we be without him?Jacqueline Coley&nbsp;for Rotten Tomatoes: Just out of curiosity why’d you want to go back to genre?Jim Jarmusch: Well, I don’t even think of it really is a horror film exactly. I think of it as a comedy with some dark threads in it. I’m not real analytical. I wanted to make the first idea of it. I wanted to make a film with humor similar to a film we made years ago called Coffee and Cigarettes.&nbsp;It felt like the same job.That’s funny because here we call it Coffee, Cigarettes, and Zombies.Jarmusch:&nbsp;I&nbsp;mean that’s sort of&nbsp;the&nbsp;impetus for the whole thing so honestly that’s good&nbsp;to hear.Tell us about the&nbsp;premiere at Cannes.Jarmusch:&nbsp;It was pretty weird, to be honest. It’s like showing our film to some film people, but also like 1,500 executives from L’Oréal. It’s kind of strange. But that’s part of Cannes. Cannes is more and more each year kind of like a convention.&nbsp;I wasn’t in favor of it being the opening night film, but the people who financed it, and my producers, I sort of let them all vote, and said, “I will defer to what you guys all think.” I kind of think they wanted it because they could get our cast on the red carpet. But other than that I don’t know the motives. It was interesting. I don’t want to just totally dis it. It was weird for me though, I must say. But I was also happy to be there together with members of the cast and Fred Elmes, our DP, and Catherine George, our costume designer. So you know, it was a positive thing on some level. [Laughs]&nbsp;I guess.But that standing ovation was pretty great.&nbsp;Jarmusch: Yeah, it was so fun. For me, the best things I love about Cannes are… I like the press conferences when you have your collaborators there and I don’t know that was kind of fun. And Bill Murray&nbsp;during the photo call was hilarious and amazing.The Dead Don’t Die&nbsp;opens in&nbsp;select theaters on June 14th.","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"strong, Cannes, Starz, BBC, disaster","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/13162059/FFFJim1.jpg","slug":"jim-jarmuschs-five-favorite-films"},{"id":"47508816176143","title":"Sarah Paulson’s Five Favorite Films","content":"Five Favorite Filmsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Sarah Paulson's Five Favorite FilmsThe Glass star shares her love for the movies that inspired her to become an actress.by Joel Meares | April 15, 2019 |  Comments(Photo by JC Olivera/Getty Images)You may have been too busy watching Sarah Paulson conquer Peak TV – almost a decade’s worth of American Horror Story seasons, an Emmy-winning performance in The People vs. OJ Simpson – to notice the list of stellar film credits she has racked up, too. Over two decades, Paulson has starred in Certified Fresh works like 12 Years A Slave, Carol, The Post, and Mud, establishing herself as one of the most sought-after actors of her generation. This year, she made her first move into the superhero genre, playing Dr. Ellie Staple in M. Night Shyamalan’s Glass – a fascinating foil to the movie’s trio of superheroes and villains, Mr. Glass, The Horde, and David Dunn. As the film hits DVD, Blu-ray, and streaming, Paulson shared her Five Favorite Films with Rotten Tomatoes.Postcards from the Edge (1990)  84%I think it’s always incredibly difficult to thread that needle between real pathos and comedy. And I think Postcards dances on that knife’s edge, not to go overboard with the metaphors, but it’s just so beautifully calibrated because the script, Carrie Fisher’s. There is no greater writing mind ever; Carrie Fisher had such a particular lens that she looked through the world with, and it just translated incredibly into her writing. I just thought the script was just so funny, but the performances! It’s one of those movies that for me is the whole package. Although I did not grow up with a mother who was in show business, the relationship between them was not dissimilar from mine in a way, and made me feel connected to the material.But it’s the kind of movie that I actually own still on VHS. I remember buying this movie and wanting it, so I have it for just memory’s sake, but I also have it on DVD, and Cody Fern, who’s an actor&nbsp;on American Horror Story last year, as a wrap present gave me an original poster. That’s how much I love the movie and that’s how much people around me tend to know I love the movie, because I do quote it a lot. And you just don’t want to sit next to me when we’re watching it though, because you won’t hear the movie. I’m just doing the whole thing, line by line.Did you ever get to work with Carrie Fisher?I did not ever work with her, no, but I knew her a bit and spent some time at her house and had the great good fortune to work with her daughter Billy Lourd for the last two years on American Horror Story; I first met her when she was a child. And to be working with her as a grown woman and a real, I think, acting presence, and she’s just an extraordinary person, so I’ve had that great good fortune.Frances (1982)  66%Frances, starring Jessica Lange, is one of those movies that for me was quite connected to my wanting to be an actor. I had obviously been to the movies many times as a young person, but I think I was about 14, or 15 when I was at home on a Sunday, and this movie … I turned a channel, and it was on cable, or whatever cable was at that time. And it was midway through the movie, and I just was transfixed and went out, back when we could go to the video store, and I rented it, so I could watch it from the beginning. And to me, it’s just an extraordinary portrait of an actress. Frances Farmer, I didn’t have knowledge about her and her work, but also whatever I knew of her working-wise, I certainly didn’t know anything about her real life, which is really tragic, and a painful movie to watch.Jessica Lange gives one of the greatest performances, and it was my introduction to Kim Stanley, who is actually the screensaver on one of my cell phones. [The pictures is] from her performance in Bus Stop, not from Frances; it’s just been on my phone for I don’t even know how long. And just again, there’s a thematic thread here [with Frances]: it’s another story about mother and daughter. At its core that’s what it’s about. And I just find it incredibly powerful. It was just like watching two acting titans and thinking, “Oh, if that’s what acting is, I want to do that.” And of course, I’ve come to learn that a lot of times acting doesn’t get to be that, but every once in a while you get to touch on that, and it was really inspiring – and another movie poster I had in house.What was it like then to get to work so closely and frequently with Jessica Lange?Well, that was one of those moments that I’ll never forget. I actually first worked with her on Broadway. We did a production in 2005 of Glass Menagerie, which is where we first met when I was about 29 years old. And I’ll never forget sitting in a room waiting, which was part of the process of getting a job, but you had to do your final audition with Jessica. And for someone like me, who is such an enormous fan [of Jessica] – she’s someone who I credit with really igniting the acting fire for me, and someone whose career I would love to have emulated, so it’s a very big scary day for me. I remember hearing her walk down the hallway. And I remember saying out loud – without even realizing it – I said, “Oh, gosh, here she comes.” And I didn’t even realize I said it out loud, and I was in a room full of people: the directors, the casting directors. I’m sure they were just absolutely terrified that I was gonna blow the whole thing by not being able to speak, but… Now, [working with Jessica] has evolved into something where I don’t burst into tears every time I get a phone call from [her]. Do you know what I mean? It’s landed in a place where I recognize that we’re actually people who have a working history together that is based on something real and not just my absolute adoration of her.Sense and Sensibility (1995)  97%Emma Thompson’s Sense and Sensibility! I find it to be one of the most romantic movies, but also for me, so many times it’s about how the performance affects me, in terms of what I ended up taking away from it all – just dreaming and wishing and hoping that someday I could do work of that caliber. But I just found the movie to be sweeping and yet – even though taking place in another era–&nbsp;it was so timeless to me. And I remember that moment clear as a bell with Emma Thompson at the end of that movie when he comes running up, and she realizes that he’s there to see her, and it’s just one of the most beautiful acting moments I’ve ever seen. So I just love that movie, and I think Ang Lee is such a beautiful filmmaker and creates such beautiful cinematic images that are indelible, really.La Vie en Rose (La Mome) (2007)  74%I remember it was showing in New York City, and I walk over with my friend [to the theater] sort of not knowing what I’m about to see, which is always kind of my favorite thing. I try more and more to not read a review of a movie before I go see it, to not read a review of a play before I go see it, so that I’m not inundated with other people’s opinions about things and I’m able to sort of … It really speaks more to my susceptibility to other people’s opinions than it does about anything that could be playing. I want to have a clean experience that’s just mine.I didn’t know anything about Edith Piaf. I had, of course, recognized many of her songs and had loved many of her songs, but I had no connection to, nor did I know historically, what had happened to her and what her story was. But I was just bowled over by Marion Cotillard’s performance. And of course then I started Googling her and trying to understand where she came from. And she had been in that Russell Crowe movie, and she was so much younger than Piaf, playing that part, and it was just another acting feat!The combination of all the beautiful and tragic things you learn about someone who is so gifted, and then also to see it portrayed by someone equally as gifted and once again be transported into a world you knew nothing about – that’s really the power of the movie.Opening Night (1977)  96%I would probably say A Woman Under the Influence [for my fifth movie], although it’s a deep, deep tie between that and the movie Opening Night. And A Woman Under the Influence was, I think, more celebrated, but Opening Night might resonate more with me. It is a story about an actress coming to terms with aging and her mortality. I think I’m also really drawn to the way those movies were made, and you can kind of feel the hammer and nail that was used to bring the whole thing together in this way that’s sort of extraordinary and that you can just almost feel the effort made by everyone involved – which is what happens when you make any movie. But sometimes [it affects you] when you know that everybody’s friends were there and they’re all making food for people to eat while they’re making this movie, to make this movie, to tell the story, not to serve any bottom line, or anything other than their creative interests. [In Opening Night, writer, director, and co-star John Cassavetes worked with Gena Rowlands, his then wife.] You don’t always have that luxury. And I just am always very moved by the way they made their movies and what a family they were and what places they could go because of it, because of that intimacy, because of that ease and that history between them. They were able to do things that I don’t know that you could achieve or accomplish in any other fashion, you know?Warning: Spoilers for&nbsp;Glass below…Joel Meares for Rotten Tomatoes:&nbsp;You get to play a comic-book movie villain in&nbsp;Glass.&nbsp;How did you approach that challenge?Sarah Paulson:&nbsp;Well, I mean, I know that some people do see it that sort of black and white, but to me, probably because I played her, it doesn’t feel quite that clear in terms of, I had to approach it and then per Night’s wish and suggestion and desire, that I had to approach it from a place of self-interest, or any kind of villainous motivation. It was actually a belief system that is just other. She’s a non-believer, but I think she says in the movie more than once, “I want to believe. I want you to convince me.” I don’t think that’s just a tactic. I think she means it. “If you could convince me, I will leave you all alone, and I will support you and try to get you the mental help that you might need, but work with you again.”But I think that she actually believes that the balance of power would be disrupted in terms of the way we could actually function in the world if everyone went around believing they were capable of great things. It might not only dilute the water, but also make it a place where there would be no rules. And Ellie Staple operates in a place where rules are her friends and she relies them on them, and I think she thinks there can only be order in the world with them. And I think the unruly component of letting these three people out into the world is too terrifying for her. You could look at it that way, and I think it’s how I tried to look at it, because I wouldn’t have known how to play her otherwise.

Here We Go Again star explains why people were so receptive to her feel-good summer hit.by Jean Bentley | October 23, 2018 |  Comments(Photo by Jeff Spicer/Getty Images)It takes someone special to fill Meryl Streep‘s shoes —&nbsp;or to plausibly play someone in whose shoes Queen Meryl will follow, eventually —&nbsp;but Lily James managed to charm audiences as Young Donna in the Certified Fresh summer hit Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again.A decade after the film adaptation of the jukebox musical, Streep, Amanda Seyfried, and co. returned to the fictional Greek island of Kalokairi —&nbsp;Skopelos, Greece doubled for Kalokairi in the first movie but filming moved to Croatia in the second — for a film that ended up being both prequel and sequel to the original.Here We Go Again tells the origin story of how Young Donna (James) met the three suitors who, in one summer of love, could’ve potentially fathered her daughter, Sophie (Seyfried). Colin Firth, Pierce Brosnan, and Stellan Skarsgård reprised their roles as Sophie’s potential hot dads, with Hugh Skinner, Jeremy Irvine, and Josh Dylan as their younger selves.James, who grew up going to musicals with her family, never thought she’d star in one, let alone be featured on an international chart-topping album with Cher. (The Here We Go Again soundtrack hit No. 1 in eight countries, and No. 3 in the U.S.) Her next project is not a musical, per se, but is a music-influenced film from Richard Curtis.When the actress caught up with Rotten Tomatoes ahead of the film’s home entertainment release —&nbsp;it’s available on streaming and Blu-ray now —&nbsp;she almost went with a list of her five favorite movie musicals. Instead, she discussed her Five Favorite Films of all time, her next projects, and the importance of feel-good movies.Badlands (1974)  97%Terrence Malick, Sissy Spacek — she’s out of this world and I just think that film’s so beautiful. I like the relationship and the whole visual world of it. I love that film. I can watch it again and again and again.Titanic (1997)  89%I love Titanic. It’s one of the first films I remember really being taken aback by. Any time I’m at home and if I see that film, whatever point it’s at, I have to watch it ’til the end. I got nodules on my voice and I realized I could do the ‘Jack. Jack. Jack. I’ll never let go, Jack.’ And I realized I could do it cause I’ve ruined my vocal chords and I could gain that talent, so there we go.Grease (1978)  75%I love musicals. I could just do my five favorite musicals, actually. Grease I had on cassette tape and I used to pause and rewind and write down the lyrics of the songs. Like “Hopelessly Devoted” — I’d pause it and then I’d write it down and then I’d play it and then I’d pause it and I’d write down the words so I could sing along. I used to write in my diary and spray perfume on it like Rizzo does when she sprays the perfume on the thing. I just, I knew every word. John Travolta is just — oh my God, doesn’t get any better.Pretty Woman (1990)  64%Julia Roberts is just everything. My mum was obsessed with Richard Gere, like literally obsessed. My mom introduced me to that film really early and I’m so glad she did. I love when [Roberts] goes into the shop and is like, “Big mistake. Huge. Huge.” I guess, in a way, now you think, “Oh, it’s like the Cinderella story and they probably wouldn’t even make that movie anymore; it’s not a strong message,” or whatever. But I think that’s just nonsense. It’s such an amazing film, and I think Richard Gere and Julia Roberts had this electric chemistry, and Julia Roberts is a goddess. I love the bit where she goes, “But when does it ever work for anyone? I mean, when? When?” Like, a man saving you from your destitute life. And Laura San Giacomo thinks about it and she goes, “You know, Cinde-f—ing-rella.”The Deer Hunter (1978)  92%That opening section at the wedding, it takes its time. Those movies at that time, I think, are some of the best movies in the world. I think it was the caliber of actors that existed then. Those actors, I think, are some of the greatest, and the type of filmmaking that happened then was something so special. It’s so character-based and story-led. None of the big blockbuster crap. Not that blockbusters are crap! But you know what I mean.Rotten Tomatoes: You were debating between Pretty Woman and Notting Hill, and you wanted to give Notting Hill a shout-out.I just worked with Richard Curtis and he is one of my favorite people on the planet. I think that he is a genius, and I thank god that he exists because he’s given us so much. I think that’s why I wanted to act, just to be a part of those kind of films, to be honest —&nbsp;those ones that are so heart-lifting and the joy and the comedy and the quirkiness of those movies.RT: The Richard Curtis movie is a musical, right?It’s actually not a musical. You’d think it would be ’cause it’s the music of the Beatles, but it’s not a musical. At all. I don’t even know what it is. It’s sort of its own genre. But I suppose it’s like a comedy-drama vibe. Hamish Patel is just out of this world. He sings a lot of Beatles but he’s pretty much the only one.RT: Would you do more musicals? Clearly you grew up appreciating them.It’s so funny. I kind of lost my love for them because I was so focused on acting, and I went to drama school and I realized that’s what I wanted to do. But then I think back on it, it’s so obvious. The Sound of Music, My Fair Lady, Cabaret, Grease&nbsp;— all these films were the films I literally grew up on and knew every word to. So, it’s obvious that is actually something in me that is my total passion and I kind of neglected it. Well, not neglected it — I just sort of forgot. And then doing it just feels so right.And The Wizard of Oz and even, like, I know they’re not musicals, but the old Marilyn Monroe films where they sing, like Some Like it Hot. There’s something, I guess, in me. I would love to do Cabaret on stage.RT: I think that one reason people loved Mamma Mia is because it’s nice to be reminded of the joy in life. Musicals are the embodiment of that.Yeah. It’s abandon. It’s a sort of freedom of spirit. It’s a sense of humor. I think that’s why people love karaoke, right? Because most people, maybe they have to be drunk, but they like it because you get up, and suddenly you’re singing to a load of drunk people and you don’t care and you let your hair down. And I think musicals are like that, you know? It’s people going, “I’m gonna sing because words aren’t enough, because I’m that committed.” There’s an escapism, and it’s infectious.RT: Did you ever think that you would be on an album with Cher?The other person my mum was obsessed with was Cher. If I think of two people that my mum spoke about on a daily basis, it’s Richard Gere and Cher. So to be in a film on a soundtrack with Cher is just —&nbsp;I still can’t get my head ’round it. Cher gave each of us a necklace that says, like, “Dear Lily, Love Cher.” And Mamma Mia 2 on the back. It will be my most prized possession for the rest of my life. That’s my family heirloom, done.RT: Have you just had ABBA songs stuck in your head for the past two years?Yeah, pretty much. But that’s pretty much been my life anyway. My present since I was a kid and could only sit on my dad’s lap, he used to take me to the ballet. And he used to have to put, like, three pillows on my seat in the theater. I’d sit and I’d watch and I’d be in a pretty frock. That evolved into going to musicals, and every year we’d get on the train to London with my brothers who’d be like, “Ugh, for god’s sake.” They wouldn’t tell me where I was going, and my present was to go and see a musical, and I saw Mamma Mia.RT: What do you think about the reception of the film this summer? People seemed to really embrace it.I feel so proud. I love the film. There’s a lot of things about it that are really beautiful. It’s a film about loss and grief. I think it’s a film about mother-daughter friendship. There’s a lot in it that cuts deep, as well as just being a total laugh. It was cool, the reaction. I was traveling around Italy for a month and I met a girl on a train with a backpack and she said to me that it had really inspired her to go traveling. She was, like, 20. And people that say, “I’ve seen it three times.” “I saw it with my daughter.” It makes you feel good. I really love that.Mamma Mia: Here We Go Again! is available to watch on DVD, Blu-ray and streaming.","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"television, LGBTQ, vampires, teaser, kids, diversity, lee, singing, Turner, movies, of, Schedule, Red, AMC","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/23122202/Lily-James-FFF-Rep.jpg","slug":"lily-james-five-favorite-films"},{"id":"47508817664030","title":"Sunny Suljic’s Five Favorite Films","content":"Five Favorite Filmsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Sunny Suljic's Five Favorite FilmsThe rising star of Mid90s reveals his taste for modern horror, and obsession with an animated classic.by Joel Meares | October 24, 2018 |  Comments(Photo by Jeremychanphotography / Contributor / Getty Images)Sunny Suljic’s discovery story is one straight out of Hollywood fantasy. Suljic, now 13, was skating at his local skate park, Stoner Skate Plaza in Los Angeles, when Jonah Hill plucked him out from the crowd to chat to him about his directorial debut, Mid90s, the story of a young California teen who finds real friendship in a group of older skaters. Hill was there with Mid90s co-star Lucas Hedges, scouting for talent for the lead role of Stevie, and saw something instantly in the pint-size Angeleno. “He had the exact quality I was looking for which was someone who was very young for their age but who was 10-feet-tall inside,” Hill told the AP. As luck would have it, Suljic was actually already in the acting game, having starred in a number of small films and alongside Nicole Kidman in Yorgos Lanthimos’ The Killing of a Sacred Deer. He had the “it” factor and, it turned out, the experience.Suljic spotted something in Hill, too: authenticity. Talking with Rotten Tomatoes, Suljic said, “Jonah’s been skating his whole life, not too many people know that.” The young actor said that experience helped in putting the film together. “You have to be a skater to actually make a skateboarding film. I don’t know anything about basketball, and I can’t make a basketball film or it’s gonna be corny. I think the same thing with skating, and a lot of people mess that up. Jonah did a great job [on the film]. It was really realistic.”Ahead of Mid90s’&nbsp;wide release this Friday, Suljic told Rotten Tomatoes about his Five Favorite Films –&nbsp;none of which involve skateboarding.The Incredibles (2004)  97%Okay, I’m just gonna try to say both Incredibles&nbsp;and&nbsp;Incredibles 2. I’m just gonna put this as a whole movie together. I grew up watching The Incredibles and it was one of the best animated films I’ve ever seen. And it’s – I don’t know – the humor… it didn’t even feel like a kid’s film. It was the storyline and it was almost like an actual film. But it was more exaggerated, because it was animated.And then, years later, I saw a trailer for Incredibles 2, but it was like a sneak peek – it was Jack-Jack the baby showing his superpowers for a second, like five seconds. It was a five-second trailer and I was like, “No way!” I was so excited. And then I saw Incredibles 2 and it didn’t really have the same plot, it didn’t really relate to the first one. But those, the The&nbsp;Incredibles&nbsp;and Incredibles 2, are my favorite animated films.How many times have you seen the first one.I can’t count. I’m not exaggerating. I’ve probably watched it like 40, 50 times. Especially once I knew that Incredibles 2 was coming out, I had to watch it another 10.Deadpool 2 (2018)  84%One hundred&nbsp;percent! I think it’s one of my favorite films. That’s like top three, probably. But yeah, Deadpool 2… Oh my God. Deadpool was amazing, but then Deadpool 2 … I don’t usually like superhero movies, but I love Ryan Reynolds’ sarcasm and the way he delivers everything. I loved all the characters and I loved the plot, and I would just love to work with Ryan Reynolds. Ryan Reynolds is crazy.Is this you saying, “Ryan Reynolds, if you’re reading this, and Deadpool 3&nbsp;is coming out …”Deadpool 3: Hit me up!I think Deadpool 2 just doesn’t play out as a superhero movie. I’m not talking smack, I mean, I watch superhero movies, but it’s not a generic plot, it’s not the nerdy kid that likes this girl and then he gets superpowers and then she’s attracted to him, you know what I mean?Favorite moment? Okay. I do like watching the Hulk, I love the Hulk a lot. So, when they brought out Juggernaut in the film – I didn’t even know what Juggernaut was, but it was like a really good character. And I love bigger superheroes like Hulk. When they brought out Juggernaut in the film, I think that was really cool.The Conjuring (2013)  86%My family, we only watch scary movies together. We do not watch comedy – anything – we just watch scary movies. The only other times that I have seen scary movies is when I’m watching Netflix in my room. And I think I’ve probably watched The Conjuring 100 times. I’m not exaggerating: I’ve watched The Conjuring a hundred times. I could recite the movie.A lot of scary movies usually just [feature] a bunch of pop-ups, which is pretty scary, but I don’t really think it’s that scary –&nbsp;it catches you off guard and you’re just shocked. But with The Conjuring it’s actually creepy stuff. And they have a lot of things that I have phobias of.It all piles up. It’s not just like, “Ooh that was scary for a second!” It’s like “Oh my God, that’s so scary!” and then it keeps adding on. It’s not a pop-up and then in another 20 minutes it’s going to be another pop-up. It’s: “Why is she still walking towards me? And why is it still getting more intense?”Hereditary (2018)  89%I don’t want to spoil it for anybody, but I think I will, and I’m sorry.I love that movie. It kind of reminds me of The Conjuring. I just watched it recently. I can’t really speak on it because half the movie I was closing my eyes. It was one of the scariest movies. But the build-up in it and when the little girl goes: [he clucks]!And then there’s the telephone pole scene. [Spoilers for Hereditary ahead.]I was just about to say that! Oh my God! Like, that is not something you expect but it was so scary. The kid is at the party, and his little sister is actually cute and she’s just walking around and then she’s just super vulnerable. And the kid goes upstairs and is like, “Go get some cake,” and she’s like, “alright,” and she goes and gets cake. And she’s allergic to peanuts and he knows there’s peanuts in there. And the kid’s already high, like smoking. And she’s having a really bad allergic reaction. So they’re going super fast driving to the hospital and next thing you know she’s sticking her head out so she can breathe better. And her head completely falls off, she gets decapitated right away! And I just see her head come off and was like, “What the f–k?”Sorry about cursing.I had to replay it two or three times because I was like, “No way.” That’s really scary. And then he has like nightmares and bad thoughts on it. I think that was the scariest movie I ever watched in my life. Definitely.Live Die Repeat: Edge of Tomorrow (2014)  91%I’m not a big fan of action movies. I usually like dark movies, but that action movie was definitely one of my favorites. One of the top five. I love Tom Cruise, I love a lot of his films. And Emily Blunt, she played such a tight role. That movie is crazy. A lot of people actually try to make movies like that, where they re-live&nbsp;events&nbsp;until they correct it. It was almost like a movie that’s so insane that it can be realistic. I feel like, for some reason, I could put myself in those shoes. Like, “Whoa, this movie could be real,” you know what I mean?Mid90s&nbsp;is currently in limited release.

The director, who earned his stripes cutting trailers for Roger Corman early in his career, breathed life into fan favorites like Explorers, Innerspace, The ‘Burbs, and of course, the beloved horror comedy Gremlins. Among a long list of other credits, Dante was also the man at the helm of the original Piranha and the cult werewolf flick The Howling, and he contributed a segment to Twilight zone: The Movie, alongside John Landis, George Miller, and Steven Spielberg.With Halloween coming up, Dante spoke to RT about his Five Favorite Horror Films, admitting “that’s always a tricky question, because there are so many more than five.” Thankfully, he agreed to narrow down his list, and he also spoke to us about why the genre appealed to him as a director, what it takes to make an effective horror comedy, and what he thinks about the current wave of horror filmmakers.The Innocents (1961)  94%From my own personal tastes, my favorite horror film, I think, is a movie called The Innocents, which is based on this Henry James novel Turn of the Screw.&nbsp;The British picture from 1961 with Deborah Kerr as the repressed governess who goes to the faraway estate to take care of these kids who are seemingly possessed by the ghosts of the people who used to haunt the place. It’s a beautifully made movie and it’s not a rock-em’ sock-em’ movie, but its got really great psychological chills in it. And of course, there’s the eternal question as to whether the governess is imagining these things, or are they really happening?&nbsp;And it’s left kind of ambiguous, and it’s a really artful movie. I don’t think it was ever a particularly popular movie.&nbsp;I think a movie like The Haunting, which is somewhat similar, was a little bit more accessible to people than The Innocents, but, for my money, it’s, I think, the best horror film I’ve ever seen.Rosemary's Baby (1968)  96%You know, I’d have to give a shout out to Rosemary’s Baby, which is not only a great horror film, but probably the most faithful adaptation of a book that I’ve ever seen on screen. The realistic ambience of New York in the ’60s is so palpable that it makes all of the horror tropes seem much more believable.&nbsp;We have a heroine we can identify with, and are the people around her all witches, or is she imagining it? Once again, there’s always a psychological component to a really good horror film. I don’t know if I’ve ever seen a film better directed than Rosemary’s Baby.RT: Horror or otherwise?Yeah, it’s one of the best-directed movies ever.&nbsp;There’s nothing wrong with it. You can’t really point to, “Oh, that doesn’t work.” No, it all works.&nbsp;It’s quite brilliant.The Old Dark House (1932)  96%To go back to the ’30s, which is the movies I saw when I was growing up on television — it was one that they never showed, because it was lost for years and it was by James Whale. It’s called The Old Dark House, 1932. It’s currently about to be reissued on Blu-ray.&nbsp;For years, all you could see were these sort of beat-up prints I think they found in the mid-’60s, and they had been lost, because of a remake and some rights issues and stuff. Now, it’s sort of come back, and it’s&nbsp;got a great cast of Charles Laughton, Gloria Stuart, Boris Karloff, Melvyn Douglas, Raymond Massey.It’s the classic “travelers stranded in the haunted house and the bridge has washed out”, but it’s the template for all the movies that followed it. It’s still one of the more watchable and disturbing movies from that period. And it’s a shame that it isn’t better known; it never got television distribution, and it wasn’t included in the package of Universal horror pictures because it wasn’t in their library anymore.&nbsp;It’s a chance, I think, for people to catch up with it now. I’m a big James Whale fan, and this might be his best picture.RT: How were you able to see it, initially?I got a 16mm print. I used to collect 16mm movies, and collectors very often were the ones who found the gems that weren’t in the mainstream. Now, of course, it’s all on video.&nbsp;I’ve seen a clip of the restoration and it really looks like it was shot yesterday. It’s really great.Blood and Black Lace (Sei donne per l'assassino) (1964)  80%One of my favorite filmmakers is an Italian director named Mario Bava.&nbsp;His most famous movies have titles like Black Sunday and Black Sabbath and all that, but the one that really was astonishing at the time was a picture called Blood and Black Lace, which is one of the most gorgeously lit Technicolor movies I’ve ever seen. And it’s a whodunit kind of thing — a murderer in a fashion house and models are being killed in various gruesome ways. This is the early ’60s when you could get away with a lot more in the way of explicitness than you had been able to before, and these movies still basically played grindhouses. But it’s such a beautiful movie to look at, and the juxtaposition of beauty and death is really perverse in it. It runs through all his works, but in this particular movie, which I think is one of Tarantino’s favorites, it really comes to the fore. It’s a very entertaining picture, and very violent.Bava was completely unknown when he was actually alive. Almost nobody except, you know, the most extreme film buffs ever saw those movies. But now, as often happens to people when it’s too late for them to enjoy it, he’s now revered, and people see his movies who didn’t even know they existed before.The Black Cat (1934)  89%Growing up on movies on TV, part of the Universal package was a very, very weird and creepy movie called The Black Cat. Which is ostensibly based on Edgar Allen Poe’s story, but wasn’t. It’s a devil-worshiping movie with Karloff and Lugosi, and it’s directed by a guy named Edgar Ulmer, who was a very promising European director whose career ran afoul of the fact that he slept with the boss’s niece or something like that and got, basically, blackballed by the major studios. But before he did that, he was able to make this very, very dark and very dreamlike horror movie, which only runs about 65 minutes. It’s an art deco nightmare, and it’s got all these very perverse ideas and concepts running through it. It’s like watching somebody else’s bad dream.It’s really a wonderful picture. I mean, Karloff has given better performances.&nbsp;The Body Snatcher&nbsp;is probably his best performance outside of Frankenstein, and that was on my list, but between The Body Snatcher and The Black Cat, I have to go with The Black Cat, because it’s so off-beat and kind of unique. There aren’t a lot of other movies like it.The interesting thing is, now these movies are actually available to see. When I was growing up, you had to wait until two o’clock in the morning on Friday; they were going to run some movie, and if you didn’t watch it then, they weren’t gonna run it again for another year and a half or more. And you’d fall asleep anyway, you know. It was so hard to see these things. You had to really seek them out.The Mario Bava movies, I had to go to the lowest dives, the crappiest grindhouses, to see these things, and often the prints were all beat up. But now, all this stuff is available, and it looks great. I just don’t think film lovers realize what a paradise they’re living in right now. [laughs] For those of us who really had to go the distance to seek these things out, it was really quite arduous.Ryan Fujitani for Rotten Tomatoes: How did you first become interested in horror movies? Was it&nbsp;as simple as just seeing them on TV as a kid?Joe Dante: It was really watching them as a kid. It was probably because you could see things in those movies that you couldn’t see in other movies, and they weren’t like what you saw when you went out on the street. They brought you into a different world, and maybe a world you didn’t want to live in for a long time, which is also good. And I got the usual nightmares. I imagined that there were giant spiders under my bed and everything, and my parents would say, “If these movies scare you so much, why do you see them? Why do you watch them?” And I don’t know. I can’t help myself. [laughs] And then, of course, ironically I ended up growing up to make them.RT:&nbsp;How and when did you know that you wanted to make horror movies?Dante: Well, I didn’t even realize that I wanted to make movies until I was quite a bit older. I was gonna be a cartoonist, and when I came out to California to work for Roger Corman making trailers, I realized that it was possible to actually make a movie, because when you make trailers you have to cut down a scene into the tiniest components of what makes it, and you sort of get a sense of, “Oh, you don’t need this shot, but you can use this shot and this leads to this.” And so, when I got a chance to direct a movie, I was much better prepared than, for instance, a writer, or an actor who doesn’t think editorially.So I found that I enjoyed it, because it’s a very communal thing, making movies, because everybody’s involved. And then, of course, I gravitated to horror movies, because the second movie I was offered was a pictured called Piranha, which was a science fiction horror film.&nbsp;From then on, I did The Howling, which is a werewolf movie, and then I did Gremlins, and pretty much I started to get typed. But, I didn’t mind getting typed, because it was a genre that I liked. It wasn’t like I thought, “Well, I’m gonna be the next James Whale,” or something. There was really no need for that anymore. I was hoping to have a more varied career, and I’ve been lucky. I’ve been able to make comedies and things.Joe Dante on the set of Twilight Zone: The Movie, 1983 (Photo by Warner Bros. courtesy Everett Collection)You know, it’s a genre that’s always been close to my heart. What amazes me about it is that it was always so reviled, and it was always considered so second-rate, and now it’s one of the few genres that has lasted all this time and is now a tentpole genre. Now, it’s like, everybody knows that if we make a horror film, people are gonna go see it.&nbsp;So it’s become a staple. It was so funny, because zombie movies, I mean, nobody would walk across the street to see a zombie movie when I was kid. And now, it’s like a cash cow.RT: What do you think about this new wave of contemporary horror, stuff like It Follows and The Witch?Dante: Well, I think it’s really good. For a while the genre was laying kind of fallow, because after a certain point it’s like, “Well, now what do we do? We’ve done everything. The audience knows all the cliches. They know all the gimmicks. They know all the tricks.” And for a little while, people were finding their way, like, “How are we gonna do this? We can’t just keep making it the same movie over and over.”Now there are people coming who actually have different takes on it and are presenting the stories in different ways. You know, female characters in particular have improved. And these movies, I’ve always believed, reflect the society that they’re in. I think you can go back and look at horror movies and you can really get an idea of what the society was like at the time and what the politics were. You know, when&nbsp;Night of the Living Dead came out in the middle of the Vietnam war, people started to notice that there was something going on.&nbsp;And now, I think you can go back to the ’30s, even the ’20s, and the German silents, and you can sort of get a sense of what the world was around them. It’s really fascinating.RT:&nbsp;Do you think that’s one of the keys to making a good horror film? Reflecting the Zeitgeist, in a way?Dante: I think so. I think there’s a lot of fear in the Zeitgeist, and if the idea is to instill fear in people, you have to figure out what’s scaring them right now. What’s the scariest thing going for them? And how can you exploit that? Now, with the current political situation and even the world political situation, people are very uneasy. This clown movie IT opened up to huge response, which I was kind of… You know, I looked around me before it opened, and I knew it had been done before for TV, but it just seemed to me this is probably going to make a killing, because people want to escape into that kind of a world as opposed to coming out of the theater and having to face Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump and all the other things that are going on.Joe Dante on the set of Gremlins, 1984RT: Your films in particular have often combined&nbsp;elements of horror with elements of comedy.&nbsp;Gremlins, for example, is frequently hailed as one of the most iconic examples of something that could be considered a “horror comedy.” For you, what’s the trick to&nbsp;blending the funny with the scary?Dante: Well, it depends on what you mean by “scary.” There’s different kinds of scares. There’s jump scares, then there’s the hairs-on-the-back-of-your-neck scares, which are rare, but always effective. And, I mean, my generation grew up on Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein, you know?&nbsp;We’d seen the Frankenstein movies, and we took them seriously. Then all of a sudden, here was one that didn’t, except it did, because even though the comedians had the comic stuff, all the horror stuff was treated pretty straight.&nbsp;And it was pretty well-produced and pretty well-presented, and atmospheric. I think that there’s always been a tradition of horror comedies, but they’re always pretty atmospheric. Whether Bob Hope is in them or Martin and Lewis or whoever. You have to take the horror stuff pretty seriously, or else nobody takes anything seriously.There’s always an element of absurdity in horror story. You have to find a way to channel that, so that people don’t laugh in the wrong places. And I think that’s one of the reasons that people like to lard their horror with some humor, because usually these stories are, taken at face value, pretty unbelievable, so in order to buy into that world, you have to give it some semblance of the world that the people in it live in.&nbsp;Which is why Bob Hope would be making wisecracks all through The Cat and the Canary, and&nbsp;that was all part of the fun. But there are a lot of horror films that don’t have any humor in them whatsoever and can be very grim, and that doesn’t mean they’re any less effective, but I prefer my horror with a little bit of humor.RT:&nbsp;Do you do anything special to celebrate Halloween?Dante: Well, I usually watch horror movies. [laughs] But it’s fun when the kids come.&nbsp;You know, the juvenile blackmail with the, “Give us candy or we’re gonna throw toilet paper all over your house.” I can get behind that.","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"SDCC, It","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/24174232/Joe-Dante-FFF1.jpg","slug":"joe-dantes-five-favorite-horror-films"},{"id":"47508825594980","title":"Sam Claflin’s Five Favorite Films","content":"Five Favorite Filmsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Sam Claflin's Five Favorite FilmsHunger Games and Their Finest Star Discusses His Love of Film, Notting Hill, and Joy Division.by Kerr Lordygan | April 3, 2017 |  Comments(Photo by Matt Winkelmeyer/Getty Images for SBIFF)Sam Claflin&nbsp;of the&nbsp;Hunger Games and Snow White and the Huntsman franchises stars in&nbsp;Their Finest, a historical drama&nbsp;about Catrin Cole (Gemma Arterton) and the propaganda film crew&nbsp;working in WWII London that employed her as a writer while the majority of the men were on the front lines. Claflin, who’s kept busy managing a&nbsp;successful career and being&nbsp;a new dad, is a huge movie fan himself.“I could honestly talk about films&nbsp;all day,” he told us, when we asked him about his Five Favorite Films. “That list of five could easily fit between 700,000 that I like. The one thing, I have to say, I’m really upset in myself and quite disappointed by, is that my knowledge of a back&nbsp;catalog of films that were brought out a while ago is pretty lackluster. Purely because I try to keep up-to-date with filmmaking now and the filmmakers now and who I want to work with.” See which ones actually made the list right here:Notting Hill (1999)  83%One off the top of my head — I think a film that I have watched time and time again — and every time I watch it I feel that I kind of see something new. I love Notting Hill. It’s by Roger Michell. There’s sort of an English charm — [and] I’m English. There’s sort of that slight insight&nbsp;into the kind of acting world Julia Roberts is playing. The kind of celebrity — I suppose especially me being an actor — there’s a lot of relatable qualities about it. I have a huge entourage of people who are really far away from this industry. So, there’s a sort of connecting dots between myself and them&nbsp;— always sort of very similar to the the world Notting Hill is based in.When you see a film or a play or read a book about the industry, are you more critical of it? Does it irritate you at all?I think, honestly, when I watch any film, I tend to find myself very critical, and it’s sometimes very difficult to step out of the actor world and just enjoy it — for being it, you know? I think it is irritating, there’s no doubt about it. I sometimes — especially when I watch with, say, my brothers who aren’t actors, or my parents — if I start kind of being quite judgmental about a performance or about a way that something’s shot or whatever it is…The one thing that I personally struggle with now more than ever, I suppose, is the amount of CGI that is sometimes used. Sometimes that takes me out. I don’t know if that’s the same, not being an actor. But I feel like, as an actor, having those things in front of you and kind of being able to live it and breathe it and sense every part of it is really&nbsp;important.I prefer to watch the actors doing the physical acting&nbsp;myself, rather than animation.Yeah. Well I find that animated films are probably — actually, the moment that I allow myself to kind of not think about being an actor, then I can kind of enjoy them. You know what I mean? They are what they are. I think I enjoy that kind of escapism, almost. The opportunity to not be judgmental and opinionated about someone’s performance. Especially the quality that they do them, the heart and soul that most of them have now — it’s really quite amazing.A Prophet (Un prophete) (2010)  96%A Prophet&nbsp;is a film that I saw a few years back now. That completely blew my mind, &nbsp;and I thought that could have easily been quite… Not cheesy; cheesy is the wrong word. They have this sort of ghost and kind of have this supernatural element of it in places. I feel that it could easily kind of be done to a point that it takes me out of the story, but I think they handled it so beautifully and subtly. The madness of it being in the prison system. I thought it was a really gritty, real film. I thought that the performances, in fact, were just wonderful. Very gritty. A Prophet, it’s a strange film.&nbsp;Yeah, it’s really a great film.No Country for Old Men (2007)  93%I think… No Country For Old Men.&nbsp;It was my introduction to Javier Bardem, and I think he is such a powerhouse on screen, but that performance, specifically, just kind of blew my mind completely, and&nbsp;it’s such an incredible thriller. It’s a film where not a huge amount happens. You could call it an action film, I suppose, but without — there’s not masses and masses of explosions. It’s a quite simple piece of storytelling, but it’s so beautifully done. And the Coen brothers [Ethan and Joel] did it.&nbsp;So I definitely say that.The Departed (2006)  90%I love The Departed. I was only talking about it the other day, in fact. I think it’s Scorsese at his best, in my opinion. I definitely love gangster films generally, like from Casino to the Godfathers. But I think The Departed, being in the modern day and being relatable — I think the cast is just amazing — but there’s something about being in the now that kind of made it a lot more… obviously relevant, but I suppose I connected with it in a much grander scale than I did with the likes of GoodFellas. I love all those films, but I think The Departed sort of resonated more than any of them.Control (2007)  88%Another film I really loved is Control.&nbsp;It was directed by Anton Corbijn. It was the story of Joy Division and it was black and white and it was so kind of picturesque. But the cinematography — I think that Anton Corbijn is a photographer who is [an]&nbsp;artist in many forms —&nbsp;some of the shots that he kind of captures in that film are absolutely stunning. I actually haven’t seen his most recent film that I think is called Life, which is a film about James Dean but Control is definitely one I recommend. To anybody.Are you a fan of Joy Division?I have to confess: I was a fan of their music before I knew who was singing the songs. So many of their songs, I’d sort of heard in my childhood without realizing they were called Joy Division. When I bought the album a few years before Control came out, I was in drama school — I just remember completely being in awe of their music. The story, I suppose, that follows them as well. I mean that’s why&nbsp;Control is so special. It’s really a wonderful film.Their Finest opens on Friday, Apr, 7, 2017.","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"Video, zombie, twilight, hist, rotten, dark, Diego, Box, BBC","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/29190044/claflin-fea.jpg","slug":"sam-claflins-five-favorite-films"},{"id":"47508827942018","title":"Travis Knight’s Five Favorite Films","content":"Five Favorite Filmsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Travis Knight's Five Favorite FilmsThe Director of Kubo and the Two Strings Talks the Emotional Power of Film, Childhood Loneliness, and How One TV Show Saved the World.by RT Staff | August 17, 2016 |  CommentsPhoto by Getty Images / Matt Winkelmeyer / StringerTravis Knight served as the lead animator on the popular family films&nbsp;ParaNorman, The Boxtrolls, and Coraline, but this Friday, he makes his directorial debut with Kubo and the Two Strings.&nbsp;Rotten Tomatoes learned&nbsp;how his&nbsp;favorite films&nbsp;(and&nbsp;one TV show) contributed to his work on&nbsp;this and his past adventures. See the full list here:Yojimbo (1961)  95%An utter masterpiece from the great Akira Kurosawa. Curiously, a Dashiell Hammet novel provided the inspiration for this film. I love that an American pulp novel from the 1920s was the spark for a staggering work of genius from Japan over three decades later. It demonstrates how art can transcend barriers across time, space, and culture and speak to us in a meaningful way.&nbsp;Yojimbo was remade as Sergio Leone’s spaghetti western classic A Fistful of Dollars, which I saw and loved long before I knew the original even existed. But when I discovered Yojimbo, it was like a gift from the universe. Everything else paled in comparison. Yojimbo&nbsp;is part western, part gangster noir, part samurai story, all awesome. It’s so good. Plus, if Kubo’s dad looks a wee bit like Kurosawa’s resplendent muse Toshiro Mifune, that’s not necessarily a coincidence.Flash Gordon (1980)  83%A gloriously ludicrous slice of 1980s cinematic fromage. Between the infectious Queen soundtrack, eye-popping Technicolor special effects, super hot Italian space princess, outrageous production and costume design, a deranged Max von Sydow spitting eminently quotable lines, and a leading man whose principle qualification was being a Playgirl centerfold, this movie had it all. I must’ve watched it fifty times when I was a kid. It was on a near-constant loop in our living room Betamax. One of the great many things I love about being a father is sharing my beloved childhood experiences with my kids. I was so giddily excited to watch this movie with my children when they were old enough. I couldn’t wait. They turned it off halfway through. I spent the next twenty minutes trying to convince them how awesome it was. They weren’t having it. My kids have terrible taste.The Grandmaster (2013)  78%A visual genius working at the height of his powers. For emotional heft, this film can’t compete with Wong Kar Wai’s heartbreaking In the Mood for Love, but just try keeping The Grandmaster’s gorgeous imagery from being seared into your brain. The cinematography and choreography are exquisite. They’re just poetry. I was absolutely transfixed watching this film during the early stages of Kubo’s production cycle. After I picked my jaw off the floor I completely reconsidered all of Kubo’s action scenes. We had to step up our game. Wong Kar Wai had raised the bar to soaring, impossible new heights. The terrific filmmaker Zhang Yimou&nbsp;—&nbsp;who himself made two flawless action epics (Hero and House of Flying Daggers) — once said that every boy wants either a train set or to make a martial arts movie. I never had a train set. After seeing The Grandmaster, I have a feeling Wong Kar Wai didn’t either.E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial (1982)  98%This is the first movie that moved me to tears. I saw this in the theater with my mother when I was eight years old. I was a pretty lonely kid, who made friends slowly when I made them at all. So when I saw this masterwork in a darkened room, surrounded by strangers, spellbound by the flickering world onscreen that painted a devastating portrait of childhood loneliness, it felt like someone had ripped out my insides. I was sobbing in my mom’s arms, aware on some level that what I was watching was completely fake, but on another level was more real than anything I had ever felt or understood. It was the first time I became consciously aware of the power of film to make us feel something. Something I wasn’t even aware of was roiling around inside me. E.T. introduced me to the profound and melancholic truth that love and pain go hand in hand, that love both gives us strength and makes us vulnerable. But, above all, it made me understand that love heals us and gives our lives meaning. E.T. introduced me to an idea that, over thirty years later, would beat at the heart of my directing debut. An eight-year-old me wasn’t prepared for any of that. But watching this movie, clutching my mother’s arm, an overwhelming feeling of empathy washed over me, and it reminded me that I wasn’t alone after all. Someone out there felt just like I did. “Ouch” indeed.Buffy the Vampire Slayer  83%Ok, I know this one’s cheating. I don’t care. So it’s not a movie, so what? It did start as a movie, so it totally counts. No TV show has meant more to me than Buffy the Vampire Slayer. Stop laughing, I’m serious.&nbsp; It’s one of the greatest things ever created in the history of mankind. I said stop. How dare you?! I will fight you! I will fight you and I will win. It’s the best. Every right-thinking person knows that. When Buffy was on the air, I recorded every single episode on my TiVo. I’m pretty sure my DVR thought I was a fourteen year-old girl. Whatever. The show was incredible. It refused to be pigeonholed. It defied, merged, bent, and blended genres, masterfully commingling fantasy and reality. It dealt with issues of real substance. It treated its audience intelligently, with the utmost respect. Over a decade after it went off the air, it still had residence in my head and heart, and served as a model for what Kubo became: real life wrapped in metaphor. Like Buffy, we explore triumph and tragedy, loss and healing, and compassion, and forgiveness through the stylized prism of fantasy. We acknowledge that part of life… is death. That lives can be thrown away and lost and upended in an unfair and random act of casual violence, without the grandeur and rousing speechifying often found in heroic movie deaths. People we love are often ripped away from us, in an instant. And we need to find a way to reconcile that a part of life is struggle, and it has a cost. Kubo and the Two Strings, like life, like Buffy, is wonderfully bittersweet. So thank you, Joss Whedon, for giving me so much high-spirited joy and gut-wrenching heartache. You saved the world. A lot.Kubo and the Two Strings&nbsp;opens Friday in wide release.","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"TCA, tv, TV, Disney, Premiere, TV, Skip, directors, talk","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/15125158/travis-kn-rep.jpg","slug":"travis-knights-five-favorite-films"},{"id":"47508827928703","title":"Anna Gunn’s Five Favorite Films","content":"Five Favorite Filmsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Anna Gunn's Five Favorite FilmsEquity and Breaking Bad Actress Discusses Her Inspirations and Studying with Kim Stanley.by Kerr Lordygan | August 31, 2016 |  CommentsPhoto by Robin Marchant / Getty ImagesAs Skyler White in Breaking Bad, Anna Gunn&nbsp;wowed audiences with her subdued, layered performance&nbsp;week after week for five seasons. She now brings her dramatic expertise to the new Certified Fresh film, Equity, in which she plays a successful senior investment banker managing&nbsp;her way through the competitive Wall Street jungle. When we asked Gunn&nbsp;what her Five Favorite Films were, she gave us her top five but also wanted us to know that Meryl Streep is such an inspiration to her that any film she’s in — including one mentioned here&nbsp;— is automatically one of her favorites. With that in mind, here is her list:A Streetcar Named Desire (1951)  98%First of all, it’s just a brilliant play, and then seeing the film and seeing those&nbsp;incredible performances and direction — it’s just one of those films. I first saw it when I was 15 or 16, and I decided to be an actress.On the Waterfront (1954)  99%I can watch it over and over and over again, and I continue to see layers and layers and layers in it.The Deer Hunter (1978)  92%Out of all the films I watch — I mean the ones I’m mentioning — I’ve probably watched this one, for some reason, more than all the others. The actors in it — the acting is stupendous. The story, direction, and the whole thing. And it features one of my favorite actors in the world as well.The Goddess (1958) I’m lucky enough to have studied with and been mentored by Kim Stanley.&nbsp;The Goddess, written by [Paddy] Chayevsky, was such an extraordinary film to watch. I hadn’t watched it until after I studied with Kim. Her performance is just so powerful and so extraordinary. The story is the foundation, but it was amazing to watch this woman I was studying with, and it was such an inspiration to me as an actor.Network (1976)  91%[Again by] Chayevsky. And directed by Sidney Lumet. That story to me — it’s amazing how it continues to be — &nbsp;it was predicting something that we’re dealing with [now]. It was dealing with something in its time, but it still continues to be so timely. It’s one of these movies that I just go back and watch, and it continues to blow my mind.Equity&nbsp;is now open in limited release.","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"series, HBO, space, kids, australia, Video","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/26144311/anna-gunn-rep.jpg","slug":"anna-gunns-five-favorite-films"},{"id":"47508870783493","title":"New on Disney+ in August 2020","content":"Now Streamingvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})New on Disney+ in August 2020Ant-Man and the Wasp, Phineas and Ferb the Movie: Candace Against the Universe, and The One and Only Ivan are just three of the many movie delights coming to Disney+ in August.by RT Staff | July 24, 2020 |  Comments(Photo by TM and Copyright (c) 20th Century Fox Film Corp.

The charming and funny SNL Alum, television actor&nbsp;(Archer, 30 Rock, Rick and Morty), and star of the upcoming tennis comedy&nbsp;Break Point&nbsp;showed up ready with his picks, and they’re all aces.&nbsp;Here are his smashing&nbsp;selections — &nbsp;compare and see if any of your favorites&nbsp;game, set, match!Chariots of Fire (1981)  82%I guess my first favorite movie would be Chariots of Fire.&nbsp;I know it’s not just me because it won an Academy Award, so I know it’s pretty good. But it struck a chord with me. I think when I was younger I was very religious, and that aspect of the story appealed to me. Although not anymore, I still love it. I have a certain, I guess, fascination with that kind of period in England. Not that I know about it; I’m not a historian or anything. But just like it’s something so romantic about, you know, going to school there and in that atmosphere and that time. I mean, it was an awful time for a lot of people, but for the guys who got to go to Oxford and Cambridge. I don’t know. It’s cool. And then they go to the Olympics, and the characters are just so interesting, and winning. I mean obviously based on real people, and such fantastic acting, you know. Great direction. Art direction, and wardrobe, and all of that.Dune (1984)  51%Dune, directed by David Lynch. I just love that movie. It’s so weird. It’s such a great combination of the book that Frank Herbert wrote, and then David Lynch’s sort of take on that and spin on that. It’s so otherworldly, but you know, so human obviously. I love Kyle MacLachlan, Patrick Stewart; it’s an amazing cast. I love science fiction, and it’s just so weird in so many ways. It’s so different than any other science fiction film that I know.&nbsp;I saw it (in the theater), I can’t even remember how old I was. I was a teenager maybe. But I remember when you went in to see it, they gave you a one-page glossary of terms used in the movie, because I guess they felt like that was going to be necessary for you to get what was going on. Of course, you get in there, it’s kind of hard to read this in the dark. But I enjoyed it. And I kind of rediscovered it. Later on at some point I watched it and I was like, “Oh my God, this really is so good.” I mean, there’s a few cheesy aspects to it, but it’s just awesome to me.This Is Spinal Tap (1984)  95%I guess I’d have to say This Is Spinal Tap.&nbsp;I don’t know that many movies made me laugh as hard as that did — the first few times I saw it, anyway. I haven’t seen it in a while, but I know that at some point I will&nbsp;watch it again and laugh anew at it. That movie is just so brilliant. It captures something from a period in rock and roll that, even though I wasn’t there, it just feels so right. It feels like, “Oh, yeah, this is based on something real.” That time in rock and roll, and these guys are not that far off from real rock and rollers of a certain band.&nbsp;And it’s just brilliant. I mean, it’s just so well done, and just so funny. I mean, they were such an amazing team:&nbsp;Michael McKean, and then Rob Reiner directing, and Christopher Guest. You know, it’s a masterpiece, a comedy masterpiece.Annie Hall (1977)  96%It would probably be a Woody Allen movie, and I don’t know whether it would be Manhattan, or Annie Hall, or Broadway Danny Rose. Those are my three favorites, but it’s kind of hard to pick a favorite among those. I don’t know. It’s hard. I mean, they’re all three so good.&nbsp;I don’t know. Maybe Annie Hall is my favorite. It’s one of the most lauded certainly. But then you’ve got Manhattan, and the romance of New York City, and you have that obviously in Annie Hall, to a certain extent. Broadway Danny Rose is less often mentioned, I find, but still really amazing with him (Allen) and Mia Farrow. He’s such a character, and Broadway Danny Rose represents all these, you know, sort of loser acts in a way. But it’s such a sweetness to it that I love, and it’s just like all of his – I like all of those movies certainly. So well shot, in&nbsp;beautiful black and white.&nbsp;You Only Live Twice (1967)  73%That would have to be a James Bond film, and then I was trying to think of what my favorite one would be. And I guess it would probably be You Only Live Twice.&nbsp;Mr. Connery. Even though I really like Roger Moore, too. I mean I liked all the Bonds, honestly. Including the newest, Mr. Craig. He’s fantastic. But yeah, You Only Live Twice. It takes place in Japan as a part of it, and you’ve got Blofeld, Spectre, the classic villains, and the whole thing with the volcano that’s really a secret lair. And you’ve got Russia and the United States. You know, it’s huge in scope. And I don’t know, it’s this great classic Bond to me, and a great song, a great theme song. I think the first time I saw&nbsp;it,&nbsp;I definitely saw it on TV.&nbsp;I’m not sure what year it came out, but I may not have even been born yet when that came out. I mean my first exposure to James Bond was absolutely on television. And then my first one to see in the theater, which I also love, is The Spy Who Loved Me. That was pretty exciting. That was the first Bond I saw at a movie theater.Break Point&nbsp;opens in wide release on September&nbsp;4, 2015.","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"DGA, Netflix, BET, Swim, Comic, historical, streaming, Trivia","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/GettyImages-475443520-Chris-Parnell.jpg","slug":"chris-parnells-five-favorite-films"},{"id":"47508832281772","title":"Alison Brie’s Five Favorite Films","content":"Five Favorite Filmsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Alison Brie's Five Favorite FilmsThe star of Sleeping with Other People watched a lot of 1980s and 1990s movies with her dad.by Ryan Fujitani | September 11, 2015 |  Comments(Photo by Larry Busacca / Staff / Getty Images)Despite a recurring role on&nbsp;Mad Men and appearances in several films and TV shows,&nbsp;Alison Brie is probably best known for playing the sweet, bubbly, somewhat neurotic goody two-shoes Annie Edison on&nbsp;Community, the quirky and inventive sitcom that earned a massive cult following despite its almost annual struggle to stay on the air. Brie is one of the brightest talents to emerge from&nbsp;Community, and this week, she stars opposite Jason Sudeikis in Leslye Headland’s romantic comedy&nbsp;Sleeping with Other People, about two relationship-challenged friends who slowly discover they might be right for each other.When we asked Brie about her Five Favorite Films, she replied enthusiastically, “This is actually amazing, because I was recently thinking that whenever people ask me what my favorite movies are, I’m not prepared. So recently I did start to write down some things just for this situation, so I have them right here!” She also noted a running theme in her choices: “I feel like my reasoning is going to be similar; the theme – which I didn’t even realize until I wrote them down – was that there’s a strong female protagonist in all of them. It hadn’t even occurred to me.” With all of that in mind, here are Alison Brie’s Five Favorite Films.Working Girl (1988)  84%The first one is Working Girl. I love that movie, and I think all the female characters in it are pretty amazing. I love watching Melanie Griffith’s transformation. Her wardrobe and her makeup is amazing, because it’s the ‘80s. It’s unbelievably awful; you can’t even believe that people used to think that was okay to dress that way, or that other people found it attractive. Joan Cusack is amazing in it. Her eye shadow is so blue; it’s horrifying, and you also can’t look away. Sigourney Weaver is a great villain in it, because she also has moments when you, I don’t know, you kind of like her… and then you don’t in the end, of course. But she’s a very interesting, strong character. Even her tone of voice and the way that she’s super sweet to everyone; it’s almost like Meryl Streep in The Devil Wears Prada before she did that. You know, kind of the bitch with the huge smile on her face. So I love that movie.&nbsp;If I turn on just the last five minutes, I burst into tears. [laughs] Joan Cusack stands up and is like, “She did it!” and that Carly Simon song comes on, and I just feel strong and inspired, and I always cry. It’s like a happy cry. I’m surprised that it still makes me cry, but I’m always just like, “Yes! This is incredible!”Alien (1979)  98%This next one, there’s an actress tie-in. The next one is Alien. So, I clearly have a bit of a Sigourney Weaver fetish. I love the movie Alien. I wouldn’t say… I mean, I like sci-fi movies – I’m open to them – but I’m not a huge sci-fi buff, I guess. I really love watching the older sci-fi films that had the man-made special effects, the pre-CGI practical effects, and I think that Alien is one of the greatest examples of that. I think that movie is so cool. For the time when it was made, the effects, I think, hold up completely. You know, the scene with the alien popping out of the guy’s chest. It’s gripping. And also, it’s very dramatic as a film. It’s not as action-heavy as you might think it should be in your mind; because you’re setting up the whole thing, there’s a lot of silence. There’s a lot of people alone – you see them on their own. And obviously Sigourney Weaver is so incredible in it. I don’t think it was the first time I saw it, but the first movie that I saw in the Cinerama Dome at the Arclight was Alien, so I think it just cinematically took my breath away. You know, by that time, The Matrix is getting made, and you’re having these cooler effects and other things going on, and I still found it so admirable that something like that holds up and cinematically is so beautiful.Broadcast News (1987)  98%Broadcast News is next on the list. I’m a big Holly Hunter fan. I just think it’s a great movie; it’s funny, it’s sad, it’s interesting. It’s got that archetype of the ambitious news woman, you know? I like that she’s behind the scenes. It’s a character that I’ve never played in a movie. I think that I’m always waiting for that role; they all seem to go to Rachel McAdams. [laughs] You know, that inquisitive journalist who’s behind the scenes and is super feisty. We’ve done a couple episodes of Community where I got to sort of channel that energy. But it’s definitely a role I’ve always had my eye on, and Holly Hunter is such a singular actress in her style, and her voice is unique, and she’s such a petite woman; I think she carries her strength in an interesting way. She just emanates strength and confidence. She also has amazing crying scenes. It’s a great showcase of her acting.The American President (1995)  91%The next one is The American President. I’ve been talking a lot about romantic comedies lately because of Sleeping with Other People, and you know, I’m listing all my favorite rom-coms, and you’re talking about When Harry Met Sally, Sleepless in Seattle, and things like that, that could just as easily be on this list for me; I watch those movies all the time and love them. But I realized it took me a second to realize that The American President is a romantic comedy, because it has a political angle, and it’s got that [Aaron] Sorkin dialogue. But it’s directed by Rob Reiner, and ultimately it’s just a full-on love story between these two people that also has snappy banter and comedic scenes.I think Annette Bening gives one of the best comedic performances of her career; she’s so specific. There’s a scene where, it’s like before her first date with the president, played by Michael Douglas, and she’s sitting in the office and she’s tapping her pen on the desk. The guy says to her, “What’s up? You got a hot date tonight?” and then she does this move where she goes to put the pen in a jar, and the whole jar falls over. There was something so effortless and so specific about that to me; it’s a moment that jumps out at me, in terms of making the work you’re doing funny, but still feeling in the moment. I don’t know how many times she shot that scene, but it looks so natural. When I watch it, I find it hard to believe that it wasn’t really an accident that she knocked over that jar, and that’s incredible. I love that movie, and I love Annette Bening. And her hair. And her shoulders, her shoulder muscles when she’s dancing with the president in that blue dress. These are all things I aspire to.The Silence of the Lambs (1991)  96%The final one is The Silence of the Lambs. I love dark movies, and I love thrillers. I don’t like horror movies because I get too scared. [laughs] I draw the line at thrillers; I like to think while I’m afraid. Obviously, great characters in that movie. The shots last for like a million years. Anthony Hopkins never blinks. Again, you just see the throughline; Jodie Foster’s character is obviously strong in that she’s dealing with this serial killer and she’s keeping up with everybody and her boss at the FBI. At the same time, she’s so vulnerable. It’s her vulnerability that enables her to have this connection with this psychopath. It’s a brilliant performance, and I just love that movie. It’s so good.Ryan Fujitani for Rotten Tomatoes: Almost all&nbsp;of your choices are from around the same era, the late 1980s to early 1990s.Alison Brie:&nbsp;I used to watch a lot of movies with my dad. I mean, he loved old, classic movies, but none of them are on my list, even though I watched a lot of them and loved them. But also, we would watch a lot of random movies from the ‘80s and ‘90s, because we kind of would just watch whatever was on cable, and my dad would go, “Oh my god, have you ever seen this movie? Oh, it’s great! We gotta watch it!” So I have this random lexicon of ‘80s and ‘90s movies that not everyone from my generation was watching, like Defending Your Life. I remember describing the plot to Donald Glover in our first season of Community and he was like, “Are you making this up?” I was like, “No!” [laughs] He was like, “And Meryl Streep is in it? And Albert Brooks? It sounds so weird.” Oh, it’s amazing.Rotten Tomatoes: I’m pretty sure I discovered&nbsp;Defending Your Life for the first time on cable, too.Brie: Yes! Because&nbsp;they used to play it on cable all the time! [laughs] And you’re just like, “Oh, yeah, this is perfect. This is what I want to watch after school. While I do my homework.” I’m a great multitasker.Rotten Tomatoes:&nbsp;When you were talking about Broadcast News, you mentioned you were interested in playing the feisty, ambitious journalist type.Brie:&nbsp;Absolutely, yes! I’m searching for that role to do, 100 percent. I’ll just keep putting it out there. They make movies like that every few years. I watch a movie like The Paper with Michael Keaton and Robert Duvall, and I’m like, “If I could be the Keaton in that, it’d be great!” [laughs] I’m just dying to play a journalist. I don’t know why. I like fast-paced characters who are super smart, smarter than myself, and way more into current events than I am.Rotten Tomatoes:&nbsp;There aren’t a lot of romantic comedies these days that are written and/or directed by women, but&nbsp;Sleeping with Other People&nbsp;was both written and directed by a woman. Is it a noticeably different experience for you?Brie:&nbsp;It’s tough because feminism is a very hot topic in our industry today, so that tends to be the focus, but not having worked with a lot of women, I can really only speak to it being a singular experience because of Leslye Headland specifically. Definitely, I had a different experience working with Leslye than with other directors I’ve worked with, because she’s written the material, because the material is so personal to her, because her voice is so strong and so specific and so frank. She has such a candid way of sharing her life, as the characters do, and as a director, she’s so emotionally connected to the actors throughout the whole process. So that was very different for me. It definitely felt like she was in the trenches with me, and we were feeling what was going on with the character together. And, of course, at the same time, she’s got her eye on it from the outside.Sleeping with Other People&nbsp;opens today in limited release.","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"Mindy, Disney, godzilla, Rey, TNT, Watching, TruTV, Arts, Avengers, Winter, of, DC, 007, Plus","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/AlisonBrie.jpg","slug":"alison-bries-five-favorite-films"},{"id":"47508834038972","title":"Jason Dohring’s Five Favorite Films","content":"Five Favorite Filmsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Jason Dohring's Five Favorite Filmsby RT Staff | April 20, 2015 |  CommentsJason Dohring has often portrayed mercurial characters in film and TV projects, ranging from a love-to-hate bad boy in Veronica Mars all the way to a vampire in Moonlight. In The Squeeze, his real-life affinity for golf reveals itself in his role as a hot shot associate of some shady characters. Needless to say, I had some expectations when I asked him his Five Favorite Films, but his list couldn’t have been more earnest and filled with open affection. Guess you can’t believe everything you see in TV and the movies.Love Actually (2003)  64%This has to be up there. There are parts of this movie that I think are perfect — like when [Andrew Lincoln] is flipping the cards for Keira Knightley. I just died. I think I was in love with Keira too; when I would see her, I could get that heartbreak he felt. For some reason, there’s so many aspects of love in that movie — it all resonates with you one way or another, and there’s such humor and different stories, young and old. There’s all kinds of relationships — it’s family and taking care of them even if you have to sacrifice your own romantic love. I always watch it and am always overwhelmed with how good it is. It’s amazing.Crash (2004)  74%I grew up not understanding racism — I was never around anything that would have led me to that. All of a sudden I went to the premiere of this film and it struck me so hard. It made me brothers with my fellow man more than any other film that I’ve ever seen. It changed my life. The perspective it gave me was incredible. I don’t have a lot of films that changed my life, but that one made me realize we’re all in this together. Michael Pena is a good friend of mine, and this was the first film that put him on the map. He was so good. When the lights went down in that movie, we were taken away. It was unreal.RT: Please tell Michael Pena I also love End of Watch, and Cesar Chavez was also great.Yes, I thought End of Watch was amazing, I’d put that in my top 20. It was that good.Top Gun (1986)  57%For no other reason than it just kicks ass and inspires you. There’s no other reason. I remember watching the love scene when I was a little kid and I was like, “This movie sucks; it’s so gross,” but since then I get pumped up because it’s so kick-ass and cool.Being There (1979)  95%This movie is unbelievable. It was my first introduction to Peter Sellers and I was like, “Who is this guy?” He is so funny and innocent, and so perfect — and what a story, man. The end scene where he walks away on water, I thought, “Oh my gosh, this guy is God. He’s so simple, but he touched all these people and changes them.”Ishtar (1987)  37%It’s so funny, I was literally laughing out loud. I heard it was on Quentin Tarantino and Ed Norton’s list of top movies ever of all time, and I didn’t even know what it was. I’d never heard of it. I heard it was a huge box office flop, and then I saw it and wondered why it isn’t more known. I think people just don’t know what it is or don’t understand the idea. These guys are in North Africa, in these awful situations, with the mafia involved. It was totally over the top. For me, it was so funny. Such a great story, so original, just hilarious. I have very rarely laughed this much in a movie. I have no reason why it wasn’t a huge smash success, in the top five funniest movies ever. It’s Dustin Hoffman — I could make a Top Five just around him. Like Rain Man. Watch that again. It will touch your soul.&nbsp;The Squeeze opened on Apr. 17 in wide release.","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"Company","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/JASON-DOHRING-S-FIVE-FAVORITE-FILMS.jpg","slug":"jason-dohrings-five-favorite-films"},{"id":"47508870755839","title":"New on HBO Max in September 2020","content":"\n\n                                            Now Streaming\n                                        \n                        \n                        \n                            var mps=mps||{}; mps._queue=mps._queue||{}; mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[];\n                            mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function() {\n                                mps.rt.insertlogo('#article_sponsorship_ad', 'ploc=articlesponsorship');\n                            });\n                        \n                    \n                    \n                        New on HBO Max in September 2020\n                        Ridley Scott sci-fi series Raised By Wolves, original films Unpregnant and Coastal Elites, and 2020 horror hit The Invisible Man are all headed to HBO Max this month.

The acclaimed revenge saga grossed an estimated $16M falling 50% from its take from last weekend. Cume to date for Fox is a hefty $119.2M. Though starring in many critical and commercial successes in recent years, DiCaprio has not had a number one hit since the summer blockbuster Inception which spent three weeks on top in 2010 and 11 total weeks in the top ten. Both movies, coincidentally, co-star Tom Hardy.Films across the board were impacted by a major winter blizzard hitting the eastern half of the country affecting over 80 million people across 19 states. Studios hope to recover lost business in the days and weeks ahead, though higher quality pics with strong audience buzz are the ones most likely to do so. Hollywood is also expecting Sunday sales to take a hit from the annual football conference championship games which always deliver high TV ratings.The juggernaut of all juggernauts Star Wars: The Force Awakens got to climb up one spot from third to second place with an estimated $14.3M, down 46%. Disney has amassed a huge $879.3M and looks on track to finish up in the $910-915M range from the domestic marketplace. With no major Oscar nominations to keep the juice going the way Avatar and Titanic had at this same point in their record runs, the BB8 pic is seeing normal declines for a sci-fi actioner.Worldwide, Force&nbsp;has risen to $1.94 billion thanks to an international weekend estimate of $23.3M (-51%) pushing the offshore cume to $1.06 billion. The overseas total will probably not surpass Furious 7‘s. Just under 55% of the worldwide haul for Force&nbsp;has come from international markets led by the U.K. ($173.3M) and China ($112.7M). The latter has not been delivering results near industry highs. Instead, the final gross in China will probably be on par with the latest Mission: Impossible film while also ending up $100M below Avengers: Age of Ultron and a whopping $250M below Furious 7.The global total for the seventh episode of Star Wars now looks on track to end at about $2.05 billion which is still monumental. The same mid-December launch period has been staked out by Disney this year and in 2017 for the next two films in the franchise – Rogue One and Episode VIII.Last week’s top film Ride Along 2 tumbled in its sophomore frame falling 63% to an estimated $13M giving Universal $59.1M overall. The Ice Cube-Kevin Hart sequel is running 22% behind the pace of its 2014 predecessor which had banked $75.5M at this same point that January. A final gross in the $85-90M range should occur giving both actors another profitable hit.The critically-panned comedy Dirty Grandpa bowed in fourth with an estimated $11.5M from 2,912 theaters for a mild $3,958 average. Pairing Robert De Niro with Zac Efron, the R-rated pic tried to go after a male audience hoping to appeal to guys of all ages. Horrible reviews kept many away and mediocre word-of-mouth from those who did pay to go see it will lead to above average erosion.The haunted doll chiller The Boy opened close behind in fifth place with an estimated $11.3M from 2,671 sites for a decent $4,216 average. The PG-13 spookfest played to young women as expected with exit polls showing the crowd to be 62% female and 75% under 25. Latinos contributed heavily to the supernatural thriller’s weekend making up a strong 41% of the audience. Reviews were weak but the B- CinemaScore is not bad for the horror genre. Budget was just $10M.Also targeting young females this weekend was the new Chloë Grace Moretz-led sci-fi thriller The 5th Wave which debuted in sixth place with an estimated $10.7M. Sony averaged a lukewarm $3,680 from 2,908 locations. Studio data showed that the audience for the PG-13 pic was 55% female and 62% under 25. The production cost was only $38M. Reviews were negative across the board and a weak B- CinemaScore grade means a shaky road ahead.Michael Bay’s military drama 13 Hours followed dropping a reasonable 40% in its second weekend to an estimated $9.8M boosting the cume to $33.5M. Look for Paramount to finish at about $55M for the low-cost project. Studio stablemate Daddy’s Home was off 45% to an estimated $5.3M lifting the cume to $138.8M on its way to the $150M range.Lionsgate’s toon offering Norm of the North grossed an estimated $3.5M, down 40%, and put its sum at a soft $14.3M. Academy Award nominee for Best Picture The Big Short had a good weekend slipping 34% to an estimated $3.5M and also winning the prestigious PGA prize on Saturday night. The last eight consecutive Oscar winners for Best Picture won at the PGAs beforehand so Short has now moved into a very high profile slot with weeks of Academy voting still to come. Cume is $56.7M with plenty of potential ahead.Moviegoers continued to sample other Oscar contenders for Best Picture which posted great holds outside the top ten. Fox Searchlight’s Brooklyn eased just 7% to an estimated $1.7M for $27.5M to date. Room nearly tripled its screen count and shot up 88% to an estimated $1.4M giving A24 $8M. Spotlight, winner of many top prizes from journalist groups, slipped only 17% to an estimated $1.4M in its 12th weekend. Open Road has collected $33M so far.The top ten films grossed an estimated $99.3M which was down 27% from last year when American Sniper stayed at number one with $64.6M; but up 6% from 2014 when Ride Along remained in the top spot with $21.3M.Follow Gitesh on Twitter!","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"Reality, 2021, PBS, breaking, pirates, Premium, Out, Fall, IFC, historical, Amazon, popular, cancelled","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/24173554/600TheRevenant2.jpg","slug":"box-office-leo-fights-his-way-into-1-spot-with-the-revenant"},{"id":"47508835702995","title":"Christina Ricci’s Five Favorite Films","content":"Five Favorite Filmsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Christina Ricci's Five Favorite Filmsby Ryan Fujitani | October 3, 2014 |  CommentsChristina Ricci is probably best known as the morbidly precocious Wednesday Addams in Barry Sonnenfeld’s Addams Family movies, but the accomplished actress has amassed a filmography full of eclectic and challenging roles. After making her debut opposite Cher in 1990’s Mermaids, Ricci went on to work with a number of daring directors, from Ang Lee and Tim Burton to John Waters, Terry Gilliam, and the Wachowskis.This week, Ricci lends her voice to the lead character in The Hero of Color City, an inspirational animated story aimed at young viewers, which is strikingly appropriate since she just recently became a mother herself. She took a moment out of her busy schedule to chat with RT and give us her Five Favorite Films.Star 80 (Bob Fosse, 1983; 89% Tomatometer)I think one of my favorite films of all time is Star 80. I’m a huge [Bob] Fosse fan, and I love that movie. There’s something about it; the music, Eric Roberts is so incredible in that movie. There’s something about the way he made that movie; it sort of lulls you into this comfortable state, and then all of a sudden it’s absolutely horrifying. It’s also kind of funny and ironic at times and winky. I just think he was a genius.12 Monkeys (Terry Gilliam, 1995; 88% Tomatometer)This is kind of a weird one. Well, not weird; just totally different from Star 80. I love 12 Monkeys. It’s one of my favorite movies of all time. I love sci-fi, and I think Terry Gilliam is just a genius. That movie is just so fantastic. The whole tie-in with the Hitchcock movie. It’s just so smart; it’s such a smart science fiction film.Did you see that before or after working with Gilliam on Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas?Before.Was it an exciting opportunity for you?Oh my gosh, so exciting. I was so nervous. I had to audition for that movie, and I was so beyond nervous, because I was so impressed by him. He’s amazing.Bram Stoker’s Dracula (Francis Ford Coppola, 1992; 79% Tomatometer)And then, another film that’s kind of out of this realm again: I really love Coppola’s Dracula. I just love it. I love the way it was made, how operatic it is. The production design — the production value — on that movie is so amazing. It’s just such a gorgeous, sumptuous movie to watch. And I think at the time that I saw it, I totally fell in love with Gary Oldman. I think I was 13 or 14, and it made me an Oldman fan for life. He’s incredible.Mona Lisa (Neil Jordan, 1986; 96% Tomatometer)I love Mona Lisa. Bob Hoskins and Neil Jordan. It’s such an incredible movie. It’s really, really, really good. It was very, stylistically and in the production design, it’s very ’80s, very late ’70s-’80s looking. And it’s one of those movies that has a song that was written for it, you know, like they used to like to do in the ’80s. [laughs] It’s such an incredibly well made film, and it’s so interesting, a really dark, twisted, well acted story.The Princess Bride (Rob Reiner, 1987; 97% Tomatometer)So you like movies with a bit of a darker edge to them.Yeah, not a lot of rom-coms. [laughs] Yeah, maybe a little bit. I do have to say, though, the next one I was going to say is The Princess Bride. That’s one of my favorite films of all time. It’s such a great movie. I still quote it.I don’t think you’re alone.I mean, I saw it when I was a kid, and I remember I just watched it over and over and over again. It’s one of those movies that, no matter how old I’ve gotten, it still makes me feel the same way when I watch it: safe and warm, and everything’s funny — it’s brilliant, like really smart humor.Do you think growing up in the industry from a young age had a strong impact on your movie tastes?Yeah, definitely. I mean, I grew up working with people who were making movies because they were obsessed with movies. So I really got to benefit from people’s film school educations and their references and everything. So I saw a lot of things really young that other people didn’t necessarily see; like Star 80 I saw when I was 14 years old, and that was because a cameraman I was working with was obsessed with it. It definitely benefited me in that way.Oh, wait, can I get another movie? Because that reminds me, another favorite movie of all time is Raising Arizona. That movie, I became obsessed with because I worked with Barry Sonnenfeld and somebody was like, “You should see Raising Arizona. It’s some of the best cinematography.” So I saw that when I was really young and fell in love with that movie. I really loved [Sonnenfeld’s] style; in his movies, the camera has such a point of view and it’s such a commentary on what’s happening.Now, you voice the main character in The Hero of Color City, and most people we’ve spoken to who have done voiceover work say these gigs are the best, because you can walk in wearing sweatpants, you spend a couple of hours rattling off your lines, and you’re done. Do you feel the same way?Yes, I would agree with that. I mean, I wouldn’t say it’s the best, but that is one of the perks, one of the reasons you’re like, “Yeah, let’s definitely take this.” [laughs]But it’s not something you’d want to do all the time.Oh no, no, no, I love every aspect of filmmaking, and I would totally miss it. I would miss all that stuff.The Hero of Color City opens today in limited release, and is available to stream on Amazon and iTunes.Click here for more Five Favorite Films.","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"Broadway, Film, Reality, popular, movies, TV, Swim, crime, asian-american, OneApp, based","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Christina-Riccis-Five-Favorite-Films.jpg","slug":"christina-riccis-five-favorite-films"},{"id":"47508837188829","title":"Peter Sarsgaard’s Five Favorite Films","content":"Five Favorite Filmsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Peter Sarsgaard's Five Favorite Filmsby Grae Drake | May 30, 2014 |  CommentsPeter Sarsgaard has starred in critically acclaimed films such as An Education, Garden State, and Shattered Glass, and he played a pivotal role in season three of AMC’s The Killing. He’s currently starring in the new film by Kelly Reichardt, Night Moves.Sarsgaard’s passion for movies was evident when chatting about his Five Favorite Films, something he found both exciting and overwhelming. He admitted to just recently seeing Sunset Boulevard and was simply taken by it, saying, “The end of that movie when she comes [down the stairs]… It’s a classic. You know when you watch an older movie like that and it’s still so riveting?” In the end, it didn’t make his final cut, but read on to see what did.My Bodyguard (Tony Bill, 1980; 85% Tomatometer)A total favorite from when I was a kid was My Bodyguard. When they’re riding together on the motorcycle it’s like one of my favorite images in a movie. I think I also like the story. That type of story has always really appealed to me, two outsiders coming together like that, basically united as a cause who are from opposite sides of the tracks. That movie is just so awesome. The two of them on the motorcycle in that one really… It’s just that image, that feeling. I watched it at the perfect time in my life. I watched it when it came out in the theater. It was very meaningful to me growing up.Lawrence of Arabia (David Lean, 1962; 99% Tomatometer)The next one I was going to say, which is Lawrence of Arabia, I actually just saw for the first time last year. I saw it projected at a theater with the intermission and everything. It was just so awesome, and I loved that it’s “introducing” Peter O’Toole. The character’s so complex and interesting and perverse and heroic and everything in a huge movie and it’s never going to happen again to have a character in front of a movie that’s that big, that’s that complicated. The scene where he’s getting, like, whatever is happening to him… It’s wild. I love that movie.I love the trailer for that movie too. When they did the re-release of it several years ago, the only trailer that they had for it was just a shot of the desert and him walking towards the camera. That’s the whole trailer.There’s a million shots they could have shown, of course. Well that one’s got a motorcycle as well. Maybe there’s a theme developing?Wendy and Lucy (Kelly Reichardt, 2008; 85% Tomatometer)I’m going to throw down a Kelly Reichardt next. It’s this movie Wendy and Lucy. I really love that film. It’s a movie about a woman who lives with her dog, and it’s so spellbinding, and Michelle (Williams), I just love her in that movie. I love that character; I’m so interested in that person. Who would ever dare to think that you could make a movie that was that intimate and small and about something so apparently inconsequential? Of course, she’s also looking for a place to live; she’s homeless.The Dresser (Peter Yates, 1983; 100% Tomatometer)Here’s another one I really like. I really like the relationship and the acting in a movie called The Dresser with Tom Courtenay and Albert Finney. Albert Finney is an aging Shakespearean actor who’s falling to pieces in his mind, and Tom Courtenay’s whole career depends on dressing this guy and he’s the only one who can get him through the show. You see all the people who depend on this guy to be able to do it, you know, in order for them to have their lives, and how important the theater is to them. I’ve always really been into the theater, even before I was an actor. And I love Tom Courtenay.The Hunt (Thomas Vinterberg, 2013; 93% Tomatometer)The Hunt. It’s a Danish movie about a guy (Mads Mikkelsen) and he’s been accused of molesting a kid. The other thing that’s great in that movie is he’s got a very noble quality as a man who believes in himself. He’s the kind of guy that if it were to happen to him, the self-righteous indignation, at first, completely f***s him. He rejects it so hard and then he looks guilty. The self-preservation is… He’s not trying to explain himself at all because it’s so insulting: a great quality to act.And that’s like what’s great is that the actor in that film helps solve the puzzle of the movie. If an actor played it differently… What’s great is his flaw; his character flaw is what makes the whole storyline happen. If he could just be a little more direct and not so disdainful, more kind of humble and understanding, it wouldn’t have all gone down. It’s just because he circles the wagons way too quickly; he gets angry too quickly and just makes himself look guilty. So, yeah. I love films like that where you find yourself yelling back at the screen.A Separation (Asghar Farhadi, 2011; 99% Tomatometer)What was that film, by the way, that came out? It was nominated for an Academy Award. It was an Iranian film.A Separation.Yeah. That has to be on my list. I’m going to give you six. That film, I would say, is a perfect movie. It is perfectly made. It’s like, every element in it sings.When did you see A Separation, and did you see it with anyone?Yeah, I saw A Separation with my wife and it’s just so well plotted. It’s like the distance that that movie travels, the journey that it takes you on, is so massive. Incredible.Night Moves opens in limited release this week.","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"zombies, Classic, Academy","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Peter-Sarsgaards-Five-Favorite-Films.jpg","slug":"peter-sarsgaards-five-favorite-films"},{"id":"47508839095530","title":"Five Favorite Films with Miles Teller","content":"Five Favorite Filmsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Five Favorite Films with Miles TellerThe star of this week's That Awkward Moment -- and the Sundance-winning Whiplash -- talks about his all-time favorite movies.by Luke Goodsell | January 28, 2014 |  CommentsIn the short time since making his debut opposite Nicole Kidman in Rabbit Hole, Miles Teller has established himself as one of the most in-demand actors of his generation. After his bro-comedy double Project X and 21 and Over, Teller starred in last year’s critically-adored coming-of-age movie The Spectacular Now, will this year reunite with co-star Shailene Woodley for futuristic YA adaptation Divergent, and has just appeared in the Sundance Grand Jury-winning Whiplash.This week, he plays opposite Zac Efron and Michael B. Jordan in That Awkward Moment, a new comedy that takes a stab at exploring modern relationships from a dude’s perspective. To mark the film’s release, we had a chat with Teller recently about about five of his all-time favorite movies.Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade (Steven Spielberg, 1989; 88% Tomatometer)I just had such a love affair with Indiana Jones when I was a little kid. I used to dress up like Indiana Jones and my mom would hide jewels in the house. [Laughs.] I loved Connery. He’s so good. It’s kinda hard to have such an established character and then to come in on the last one and play his dad. Also, I just loved the “cup of the carpenter” and him trying to find which cup it was. And I loved all the booby traps. I’d never seen Star Wars or Star Trek or all that stuff — and I was never really into comic books — so for me, Indiana Jones was really my only hero as a kid. He was awesome.Love Liza (Todd Louiso, 2002; 53% Tomatometer)Love Liza, it’s such a random thing. I saw it — I can’t remember if my buddy bought it at a DVD store or it was on NYU TV or something — but I remember watching it and just being so transfixed by Philip Seymour Hoffman’s performance. I just really love that movie a lot. Honestly man, I think that was one of the first independent films I’d seen. I wasn’t huge into the independent film scene until I went to college, and then of course, once you get to NYU, it’s all about the indie scene, you know. But I love independent filmmaking; I think they’re really telling the interesting stories.Big (Penny Marshall, 1988; 97% Tomatometer)Tom Hanks remains one of my favorite actors. I remember seeing that movie at a very impressionable age. It was such a cool storyline, and Tom Hanks is a brilliant actor… and I always wanted to have an apartment with my own vending machine in it, after that. That was the coolest thing. And the trampoline.Wedding Crashers (David Dobkin, 2005; 75% Tomatometer)Wedding Crashers I just think is absolutely hilarious. Old School was like the funniest movie I’d seen in a long time, before this. Vince and Owen, at that point in their careers, there was nothing better. I just thought that movie was so, so funny. And Christopher Walken, and Rachel McAdams, and Bradley Cooper — that was like the first time people really saw him. It had so many lines in it. Vince Vaughn was on fire back then.Speaking of comedic actors, you’re attached to play Dan Aykroyd in an upcoming Belushi biopic.Yeah, if it all works out, it’ll be great. I think Dan Aykroyd is a comedy legend. He’s still around, so it’s very daunting. But as an actor, I think you want to try and challenge yourself. It’s gonna be hard to play Dan Aykroyd in front of Dan Aykroyd. We’ll see what happens, I guess.What other comedians do you admire?Bill Murray is pretty legendary, and I love Steve Martin and Chevy Chase. But as a kid, growing up, for me it was Mike Myers, Adam Sandler and Jim Carrey — those were the kind of guys that I really looked up to.Mike Myers and his old SNL stuff was great.Oh my god, you couldn’t beat him.The Wizard of Oz (Victor Fleming, 1939; 99% Tomatometer)The Wizard of Oz is really the first movie I ever saw. I remember watching it a lot as a little kid. My mom said I used to watch the VHS tape that I believe we had recorded from TV, and I used to watch it twice a day. I remember in my Power Wheels I used to drive along with the Tin Man and the Lion and Dorothy. I don’t really remember a lot of this, but my mom — your mom is kinda like the history of your life. I also loved the Peter Pan, but with Mary Martin; I remember watching that a lot.That Awkward Moment is in theatres this week.","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"french, movie, Broadway, Movies, FirstLook","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/sdf.jpg","slug":"five-favorite-films-with-miles-teller"},{"id":"47508848039219","title":"Five Favorite Films with Boy Director Taika Waititi","content":"Five Favorite Filmsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Five Favorite Films with Boy Director Taika WaititiThe New Zealand filmmaker on his acclaimed second feature, working in Hollywood, and his upcoming vampire movie plans with Flight of the Conchords' Jemaine Clement.by Luke Goodsell | February 29, 2012 |  CommentsMulti-talented New Zealand filmmaker Taika Waititi established himself on the local comedy circuit and scored an Academy Award nomination for his 2004 short, Two Cars, One Night, though chances are you’ll be most familiar with his behind-the-scenes work on TV’s Flight of the Conchords, where he collaborated with friends Jemaine Clement, James Bobin and recently-minted Oscar winner Bret McKenzie. Waititi’s first feature, Eagle vs Shark, earned cult notices, but it’s with his follow-up, Boy, that the director really comes into his own.Set in suburban New Zealand in 1984, it’s a keenly-observed story about an 11-year-old boy called, well, Boy, whose heroes are pop star Michael Jackson, and his mostly absent, tall-tale spinning dad (played with mythic weirdness by Waititi himself). Capturing that all-too elusive tone in such films — where genuine comedy and drama mingle with the just the right hint of nostalgia — Boy is arguably among the best films about growing up to emerge in recent years. Local audiences seemed to agree, too: the movie became the highest-grossing New Zealand production ever when it was released there in 2010.With the movie opening in the US this week, we sat down for a conversation with Waititi about making Boy, his experiences with Hollywood (he appeared in last year’s Green Lantern), and his plans with Jemaine Clement to make a vampire comedy. But first, here are his five favorite films.Dr. Strangelove or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb (Stanley Kubrick, 1964; 100% Tomatometer)Dr. Strangelove. I think purely because of Peter Sellers. I love his characters; he’s just having so much fun. And that kind of subversion of very serious things going on is right up my alley; I really like that. I love Kubrick’s films, but that for me is also a very different Kubrick film. People either get it or they don’t. I love that film.The Graduate (Mike Nichols, 1967; 87% Tomatometer)The Graduate is always a good one to have on my list. It’s hilarious, but also has that element of treading between comedy and drama and doing it so well, and actually being about something. It’s probably the best version of those films about rich people and their boring problems, you know, that anyone’s ever made. People have tried to do that since — that film has totally inspired generations of filmmakers. For me it’s just fresh. There’s also the energy of the actors: Hoffman, just young and going for it; he hasn’t become jaded. That film could come out today in a fresh print and still be incredible; everyone would think “Oh, Wes Anderson made a new film,” or “Sofia Coppola made a new film.” I’ve always loved that film.Stalker (Andrei Tarkovsky, 1979; 100% Tomatometer)Stalker. I went through a big phase, a Tarkovsky phase, when I was in my mid-20s, and that film always stuck with me. For me, I think visually there’s something about that film that manages to get inside your head and touch you on your emotional synapses or something; it somehow just gets in there. And visually: for instance just the shot of this dog, this black dog that’s always wandering around by itself, that… I mean Tarvovsky was a master of symbolism and just knowing, for example, that a candle in a certain place would trigger in most audiences’ minds something to do with memory. And working on an amazing sensory level, with the composition of shots; these big, long shots that just go on forever. And it doesn’t always matter what people are saying — because the film’s full of dialogue, full of poetry and stuff, but that’s what I love about that film, and also The Mirror. It just washes over you, and you can watch it again and again and take more and more in each time. Mirror is also one of my favorites but it’s a baffling, baffling film.It’s the same as in painting, you know: people have to go back and study the old masters to see how they did shit. They’re called masters because they’re still the best that ever were. It’s the same with Kurosawa and Ozu and Tarkovsky: if you look at their films and what they were doing, you kind of feel safe watching those films. With Tarkovsky’s stuff I have to keep going back to it to remind myself that there’s an alternative to the 90-minute American film, you know where it’s all fucking three acts and information, boom-boom-boom, and just to go, “Hey, you know what — there’s a way of communicating that’s different and there’s nothing wrong with that. Don’t be scared to appreciate that stuff.”Coming Home (Hal Ashby, 1978; 81% Tomatometer)Another one’s Coming Home, by Hal Ashby. I mean, I love all of his films — if there’s any filmmaker I would love to be, it would be him. It’s just an amazing film. You think about something like Harold and Maude, which is to me one of the most flawless films there is. There’s always the great films, like Harold and Maude, sure; but then there’s ones that people kind of forget about, you know, or they sort of get swept to the side a little — and I think Coming Home is one of those films. Even The Last Detail is one of those films. But Coming Home: amazing performances, it’s about something, amazing emotional stuff, and it’s just about people — people trying to connect. There’s a simplicity to it, but it’s really engaging the entire time. Waldo Salt wrote the script. I saw a documentary on him. I think just knowing how a film’s made makes me love it as well. He wrote a 200-, 300-page script for this thing, and went and talked to vets and recorded them for like a year. Jon Voight went and lived with paraplegics and war vets who had been injured and stayed in his wheelchair the entire time. It was just a good commitment to making a film, you know, whereas these days it’s like, “I’ll get my double to do it.” I feel like that was made at a time when people still had passion.Badlands (Terrence Malick, 1973; 98% Tomatometer)Alice Doesn’t Live Here Anymore (Martin Scorsese, 1974; 95% Tomatometer)&nbsp;&nbsp;I’m sort of torn on my last film between Badlands and Alice Doesn’t Live Here Anymore. I’m on the fence — I love both of those films. Badlands, for me, is a very important film because I feel like a lot of the time it’s the kind of film I would love to make, if I could just make one. It’s so small, but really perfect. I think another great example of a film, which is like a second film, that people don’t think about, is Days of Heaven, which is again another flawless film. His use of voice over is the best out of any filmmaker. Linda Manz, her voiceover, nothing can beat it, you know. I always think that if there’s a voiceover in a film, it’s gotta be like that, where it?s not telling you what’s happening, it’s talking about completely different things. It’s incredible.Did you see The Tree of Life? There are passages in there that are uncannily of a piece with Badlands.Yeah. Especially in the street, when they’re out in the street in those opening scenes [in Badlands] when he first meets Sissy Spacek, all that stuff with the trees and the old ’50s feel. I fucking love Sissy Spacek. She’s incredible in that film, as is Martin Sheen. Just those two together, and the way that those shots just drift along, and the casual nature of their conversation. It’s so perfect. That character, actually — that character of Kit — in a very sort of subtle way I based a little of the father character in Boy on him. Just the way he was sort of distracted by the world and daydreaming and off somewhere else. I think I rip off a lot of films, but that specifically…Ripping off the best, as the saying goes.Yeah. Well, the beginning of Boy, with the cutting and stuff, was based a lot on the opening of Jules and Jim, which a lot of people have done now, but I just love that film so much. And Alice Doesn’t Live Here Anymore — one of the greatest performances of a woman, and that kid as well, that little boy; those two together. And again, it’s just something about a film about normal people just trying to follow their dreams. It’s those films that haven’t got a really complex narrative or complex structure that are literally just, “We’re gonna leave town and drive.” That’s again a great mixture of drama and comedy, like when Harvey Keitel threatens to kill her and breaks up the motel room, and then a hard cut to one of the most hilarious scenes in the film where they’re trying to pack up and get out of the room, and the kid’s trying to tell that joke to the mother and she’s fucking going out of her mind. So Ellen Burstyn’s like a goddess in that film. I really love strong female characters, and for my next film I’ve actually written a mother character who borrows a lot from Alice in that film. I feel like a mother character should be that interesting.Next, Waititi talks about his latest film, Boy, the experience of working in Hollywood, and what he and Conchords Jemaine Clement have planned next.&nbsp;A lot of those films mix drama and comedy perfectly, which seems like a rarer thing to find in contemporary stuff.Taika Waititi: Yeah. I feel so surprised when I see billboards for films and I’m like, “Really! That’s what you came up with?” — where it’s a really obvious broad comedy or farce or a really obvious drama, like a “This is gonna depress you” film; a real lack of a sense of adventure about trying to mix some shit up, you know.It’s not easy to successfully mix genres. Which is the thing you notice about Boy — it does moves between comedy and drama so well, without feeling contrived in doing so. How do you make a “coming of age” film, so to speak, without falling into the trap of cheap nostalgia? Is it hard to balance the tones?I think a lot of it is coming from somewhere like New Zealand or Australia, where we’re so far removed from the rules on how to make films. I think even if we tried it’d be like a weird New Zealand version of those films, and I think that’s what most of our New Zealand cinema is — weird versions of popular genres. And I’ve always — just because of my comedy background — I’ve always wanted to do mixtures of things because I’m also into things that feel more real, or more human, and things that emotionally aren’t just saying “Just laugh.” Audiences are so savvy now. They know the structures of these genres. If you tell an audience they’re going to a romantic comedy, they’re gonna know exactly what’s gonna happen. Audiences know what they’re getting when they go to those movies, so why not trick them? Why not mix it up? Try to keep audiences on their toes and keep them engaged. It’s just telling the same stories, delivering the same messages, life messages or whatever, but trying to package it differently. I think you have a duty as a storyteller to make that story interesting. We come from an oral background. Maori is traditionally an oral culture: we never wrote anything down and all information and history was spoken, told by story. You had to be good at telling stories, and if you weren’t, someone else would get the job. If you told the same story again and again, it gets boring. And that’s where myth comes from — you’re adding little bits all the time. It’s like, “Oh, I forgot to tell you — also, he could speak to the trees.” [Laughs] You’re making shit up, you know. That’s the evolution of story, I guess. Truth will eventually become myth.Did that notion of myth feed into the character of Boy’s father, and how his stories are always slightly different and increasingly outlandish?Yeah, yeah. His stories are changing all the time.It’s great when he’s bragging to the kids about how many times he’s seen E.T.. It’s such a child-like thing to do.[Laughs] It’s such a thing for a kid to say, but for an adult to be competitive with a kid, you know: “I’ve seen it 10 times. I was one of the first.” When we were kids, when Return of the Jedi came out, we were always like, you had to be the first person to see it so you could hold that over every one else — “I saw it before you,” you know. [Laughs]Going back to the beginnings of Boy, is it based, or partially based, on your own childhood?Not really. It’s a mixture of memories, and things were changed to protect the innocent. [Laughs]So you weren’t actually playing your own father, just to make that clear.I was actually playing a character made up of parts of myself, my father, a lot of uncles, people I’ve met. Basically he’s just a version of a lot of different men I’ve known, either as a child or as an adult; a mixture of people who either hadn’t grown up or were living outside of what was going on — they were living in their head and wanting to be somewhere else. The real autobiographical part of it is just where it was shot. For instance, we shot in the house I grew up in, my grandmother’s house. I grew up in a house like that, with the grandmother and all these kids. Parents and adults would come in and out of our world, but essentially our stable world was kids and the grandmother. All of that was authentic to the ’80s. I needed to make it feel authentic somehow, so I thought that I may as well do it authentic to my memories. It was like recreating a real place but then telling a made-up story within that place.You were already work-shopping this movie before you went amd made your first film, Eagle vs Shark?Yeah. I took it to the Sundance lab in January 2005.Was it always the same story?It was. It was a lot more dramatic when I first did it. There was still humor in it but the dad didn’t arrive ’til half way through the movie; it was more about the kids trying to survive in that world. So I took it the lab and they said “Why don’t you come back to the June filmmaker’s lab where you get to shoot scenes and stuff?” I didn’t want to come back to Utah with kids from New Zealand and have to look after them, so I said, “Okay how ’bout I not submit that and I’ll submit another script, which is this comedy about this girl who loves this idiot?” I hadn’t actually written it at that point but I was trying to stall for time.“This girl who loves this idiot” — I don’t think I’ve heard such a succinct log line for that movie.[Laughs] Yeah. So I wrote it, and made that film and Boy just took a backseat. I came back to it in mid-2008 and wrote more drafts and we shot at the beginning of 2009.&nbsp;Given that Boy is obsessed with Michael Jackson, how did Michael’s death affect the production? What stage were you at when the news broke?We were at the end of editing. It was really sad. When we started the film I thought, “Well, this is going to be a sort of ironic thing where everyone loves Michael Jackson and we’re gonna show this at a time where everyone hates Michael Jackson — he’s been on trial, he’s going through all this shit, he’s bankrupt, and he’s a loser, you know.” I mean, I never considered him a loser but the world kind of considered him this old hack at the time. So I thought this is kind of interesting in a “What becomes of our heroes?” way, and it sort of ties in with the father, who’s Boy’s hero — and Michael Jackson was such a hero to the world in the ’80s and now it’s like, “What’s become of your hero?” So when he died it was just a real bummer. It sucked. It didn’t take anything away from the film; the film was fine with him being alive, or whatever — I just thought it was a bummer for the world to lose this dude. And also a weird bummer that everyone started loving him again once he was dead. It was great that he became more popular, but it sucks that he had to die.Did you find that it changed audiences’ reaction to the film?Not really. Now and then some people think that film was made after he died, which again is a bummer ’cause I wouldn’t want people to think it was made as a reaction to him dying, like “Oh I’m gonna make a film about somebody that likes Michael Jackson,” you know, to try and cash in on his death or something. When he died we had actually budgeted to put some of his music in the film; a lot of it was quite affordable. And before he died, we were watching it and we had some of his songs in it, and it just didn’t feel right. It didn’t feel right having a small, intimate film suddenly kick in with “Beat It” or something. I felt like people would be wondering “How’d you guys afford this?” or it would take you out of the moment.You always had “Poi E” in the film, though?Yeah, oh yeah.At least you still got to mix that in with “Thriller.”Well we used to do that when we were young. We used to mix Maori Haka with other sorts of songs. “Poi E” was such a huge hit in New Zealand. It was this mixture of traditional Maori dance with synthesizers and drum machines, so I was trying to kind of capture that as well.&nbsp;How was your experience with Boy in the US? Did the distributors leave it alone?They have, because we already had a lot of the prints. Which is great. They can’t change it or cut stuff out of the film.They can’t dub over the accents…Yeah. That was always a question, you know: Do we cut the accents? Do we put subtitles on them? But then I thought, “Fuck it,” you know? It’s like, open your ears. [Laughs] It’s English. Isn’t it a nice experience to hear how other people speak?And how has the the response been to the film?It’s been mostly positive. It’s good to be affirmed and have people say, “Yeah we get it, and this is good.” A big thing for me, as well, is the kind of stuff I make I want to be able to show it to my friends and get their approval, you know — I don’t wanna be at a party with my friends and for them to say, “Uggghhh! You made What Happens in Vegas.” I’d be too embarrassed. I feel like it’s quite good coming from a place like New Zealand where you have all those friends to tell you that shit, you know. I’d rather do small films that a small audience loves, which could grow, in a style that I’m proud of, rather than a couple of shitty big films that everyone will go and see.Have you been approached to do bigger films by the studios?I’ve read some scripts that I’ve turned down.Did they offer you a certain kind of film?Definitely after Eagle vs Shark, for sure. They’d send me all the “quirky” ones and the romantic comedies. It’s not even a romantic comedy. It’s a depressing romantic movie, with uncomfortable comedy. They started sending me broad shit and I was like, “That’s not me.” [Laughs]&nbsp;What was it like going from a small movie to doing something like Green Lantern?Oh, incomparable.How did you end up in that?Well, Boy played at Sundance, and the casting director from Warners happened to see it and at the time I guess was looking to fill that role. So I came back to LA and did an audition, then a follow-up audition, and a “chemistry read” with Ryan [Reynolds], and then it just sort of worked out. I was pretty happy with doing it, with getting that chance to do it, but then I don’t know, I feel like that time down in New Orleans kind of disappeared; it was like, “What happened to that three months?”What are you doing for your next film?I’ve got two. One of them is one I’m doing by myself, which I’ve written, which is gonna shoot in Europe — and that’s a World War II comedy. And then Jemaine [Clement] and I are writing a vampire movie that we’re both in with a bunch of our friends, and that will be shot in New Zealand. So that’s the New Zealand film and that’s a hard one to get up and running because there’s a lot of effects.Is it a comedy?It’s a comedy, yeah. We actually came up with the idea in, like, 2005, when no-one was making vampire films and the only films that were coming out was something like Blade, or Underworld. We were like, “Man, vampires are fucking lame, no-one’s into vampire movies — let’s make a vampire movie.” And it took us five years to write a script and get our shit together… and now vampires are lame again. So it’s kind of cool to come in at the end of the reign of the vampire stuff.Are you directing?We’re both gonna direct and be in it together. It’s just hard to make, really. We just wanna do stuff outside of studio control. Not that we’re big studio-involved people, but just me having been in a movie like [Green Lantern] and having worked with studios on a lot of things, and Jemaine’s done a lot of work in the studio system now… we just would like a lot of freedom with this film, and we wanna make it cheap. Ultimately our attitude is just that we wanna do it like how we would make something in New Zealand in the ’90s — by ourselves, with our friends, and just being left alone to do our own stuff and then showing people at the end without contracts and things going on and lots of people giving comments and stuff like that.Boy opens in select theaters in the US this week.","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"Awards, show","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/sff.jpg","slug":"five-favorite-films-with-boy-director-taika-waititi"},{"id":"47508852816228","title":"Five Favorite Films with Mimi Rogers","content":"Five Favorite Filmsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Five Favorite Films with Mimi RogersThe producer of Unstoppable shares her favorites with RT.by Tim Ryan | February 16, 2011 |  CommentsIf you scanned the credits for Unstoppable, you may have noticed a familiar name near the top: Mimi Rogers. Best known as a versatile actress, Rogers made a splash as a producer in 2010 by shepherding the based-on-true-events tale of a runaway train to the big screen. Producer is just one of Rogers’s talents, however — in addition to her widely-praised performances in such diverse films as The Rapture, The Prince of Tides, and Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery, Rogers is also one of Hollywood’s finest competitive poker players. With the Certified Fresh Unstoppable hitting DVD shelves this week, we talked with Rogers about her favorite movies, the rigors of producing films, and what she learned from some of her previous directors.&nbsp;MASH (1970, 89% Tomatometer)MASH. To me, MASH is the superb realization of [Robert] Altman. Amazing. Whether it’s the improvisational nature, the way he layers dialogue, the way that he has scenes that are alive on every level. The rebelliousness, the anarchy, the humor. You know, Donald Sutherland and Elliot Gould were just [great]. To me, it was sort of like the perfect realization of what he does, although McCabe &amp; Mrs. Miller is another favorite.Thunderbolt and Lightfoot (1974, 86% Tomatometer)Thunderbolt and Lightfoot is another one of my favorites. Jeff Bridges, just, wow.Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969,91% Tomatometer)I like a lot Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. It was hilarious, it was incredibly well done and well written. The chemistry between those two is spectacular. And I fell deeply and madly in love with them.Cool Hand Luke (1967,100% Tomatometer)I like Cool Hand Luke. To me, it’s an iconic [Paul] Newman performance. Everything from Newman to George Kennedy to just watching that spirit, and the sort of bitter triumph of that spirit even at the end. An amazing, unforgettable movie for me.The Exorcist (1973, 85% Tomatometer)I like The Exorcist. I mean, for me, it worked on such a psychological level. For me, it sort of grasped the idea of what horror is, what the mind can conjure up.Next, Rogers talks about bringing Unstoppable to the big screen.RT: You’ve been in big movies; you’ve been in little movies; you’ve done comedy, horror; you’re a producer; you’re a poker player. Is there a pattern to your career?Mimi Rogers: Chaos theory, baby. No, no, I guess there’s not a pattern. You know, I started producing however many years ago, which is not an abnormal route to take. Acting is wonderful; it can be, obviously, a very gratifying business, but it’s not a business where you have much control. I’m a big reader, I’m a big storyteller, I’m a big fan of really well told stories, and that sort of motivated me twelve or thirteen years ago to start saying, you know, “Hey, I have some ideas that I think would actually make great movies. Why not try and make that happen?” And, you know, I work with my husband, and we don’t really have an agenda. It’s not any type of genre, it’s not commercial, or indie; it’s anything that appeals to us, anything that we think is an interesting story to tell. This was an article that he had found, and that he brought to me and said, “I think maybe there’s a movie here.” And I read it and said, “Ohh, yeah.”You’re talking about the true story about the train that was without a conductor for a bit, which is obviously a little different from how it’s portrayed on screen.But surprisingly, not that different. It’s actually not that different. You know, the only aspect that became fictional is really what happened at the very end, when Chris [Pine] had to jump out and be driven to the front. But in terms of the size of the train, what was on the train, the stakes in terms of the amount of devastation and death, the attempt at the derailment… All of that happened. Almost everything in the movie did actually happen.[rtimage]siteImageId=10240635[/rtimage]Has being a producer given you any new perspective on the acting process? Or is it two different hats you’re wearing?Well, it is really two different hats. I sort of liken being a producer to being a parent; you’re in charge, you’re supposed to pay for everything. Everybody comes to you with their problems, and you never get thanked. Being an actor is a much more childlike position. You only have to think about yourself. [laughs]As an actress, you had a chance to work with directors like Michael Cimino, Robert Altman, Barbra Streisand, and Ridley Scott. Were you taking notes for your future career as a producer?Well, it’s interesting, because you definitely glean something very different and very useful from each of them. Obviously, in working with Ridley, just a staggering sense of visuals, and what you can do with the camera. He’s not an incredibly verbal director, and he likes to sort of cast people that he feels sort of already have the role in hand, not something that has to be broken down or seriously explained, because he does a lot of the storytelling through the visuals. You see you know, how you can do that and convey a sense of time, place, and identity through what you see and how it’s shown.Working with Barbra was insanely great. She’s a genius on so many levels, and watching her perfectionism and understanding what that really means. She knows how she wants it, she knows how it would be best realized, and she’s not going to settle for less. That’s kind of a great position to take.[rtimage]siteImageId=10240636[/rtimage]Some of the movies you made before were award-winners, but this is a much bigger scale thing. What was the big difference? Is there a lot more to keep track of?Well, obviously, it took us years and years to get it brought to the screen. What we felt about it from the beginning was that it was just sort of rooted in the tradition of great American, sort of blue collar, ordinary person, hero-based action films. The fact that it was rooted in reality was kind of what made it doable because things happen in the movie that literally are stranger than fiction, that if you’d written it in a fictional story, a million people would have said, “Well, that could never happen, that could never happen, and that could never happen.” But our intention from the get-go was to make a really big, fun, fast, highly entertaining commercial film.Are there any poker movies that get it right?Not really. Not yet. I mean, there are movies that get gambling addiction right, but in terms of getting poker playing right? Not really. I think it’s just a lot more esoteric than people think. It took a long time to get a movie about chess with any sort of grain of true reality. The actual real mentality, I just don’t think it has been captured yet.Unstoppable arrives on home video today in the US.","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"to, Office, sag, technology, Trophy, Reviews, Paramount, breaking, MTV, movies, screenings, Sabrina, GIFs, Century","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/xzvc.jpg","slug":"five-favorite-films-with-mimi-rogers"},{"id":"47508842357006","title":"Five Favorite Films with Hitchcock Director Sacha Gervasi","content":"Five Favorite Filmsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Five Favorite Films with Hitchcock Director Sacha GervasiPlus, the filmmaker on working with Anthony Hopkins to bring the iconic Master of Suspense to the screen.by Luke Goodsell | November 21, 2012 |  CommentsArguably the most famous director in cinema history (and the auteur behind the recently crowned Greatest Movie of All Time), Alfred Hitchcock can’t be an easy subject for an on-screen biography. Beyond his larger-than-life persona, embodied by that famously corpulent silhouette, the man was also something of an enigma, an artist who preferred to devote his personality to thrilling audiences with the most popular entertainments of the day.British-born director Sacha Gervasi has taken a shot at it with this week’s Hitchcock, which adapts — with some creative license — Stephen Rebello’s 1990 book Alfred Hitchcock and the Making of Psycho, while exploring the relationship between Hitch (played by Anthony Hopkins) and his wife Alma Reville (Helen Mirren), as he fights to make the thriller that would prove one of his biggest and most influential hits.Gervasi, known for his hugely entertaining 2007 metal documentary Anvil! The Story of Anvil, called in to chat about Hitchcock, the challenge of taking on a movie icon, working with Hopkins, and separating the man from the mythology.Read on for that interview, but first, he talks here about his five favorite films.Withnail and I (Bruce Robinson, 1987; 93% Tomatometer)Well I guess my first one has to be Withnail and I, the 1987 Bruce Robinson classic. You know, the plot is one that would get you laughed out of any Hollywood studio: Two unemployed actors go on a holiday, drinking, to one of their uncle’s cottages for the weekend; but it’s one of the most deeply rich, brilliant, tragicomic tales of male friendship. I actually remember seeing it when I was a kid, and walking out of the theater in London — and by the way, it did not do well at the time it was released; it was a tiny little film — but I remember thinking that I wanted to become a filmmaker after that.Betty Blue (Jean-Jacques Beineix, 1986; 77% Tomatometer)The second one is that incredibly brilliant movie Betty Blue, which I love because it opens with that incredible lovemaking scene with Béatrice Dalle. There’s just something so vivid and luscious about it. It’s just so beautiful and sensual in every regard and I absolutely love the film. I saw it recently and it’s just as brilliant. And the incredible soundtrack, you know. It’s just as brilliant as when I first saw it. Withnail and I and Betty Blue were both in the same period; they were both seminal cinematic experiences for me.The Sweet Smell of Success (Alexander Mackendrick, 1957; 98% Tomatometer)The Sweet Smell of Success is, I think, one of the best — certainly one of the greatest New York films, for me — ever made. Alexander Mackendrick, great director. Unbelievable script. James Wong Howe, unbelievable camerawork. And Tony Curtis and Burt Lancaster — to see those two going at it, and really, you know, the tragedy of corruption and how it infiltrates every aspect of peoples’ lives. There was something so deeply dark and cynical about it. But yeah, there’s this sort of tiny little germ of hope at the end of the film, as Susan walks off with the musician boyfriend that Hunsecker has tried to destroy, and you just feel like, you know, absolute power corrupts but not totally. Still, it has a vicious sting to it, that film. It really affected me.Chinatown (Roman Polanski, 1974; 100% Tomatometer)Obviously Chinatown. Seeing Nicholson with his destroyed nose [laughs], as Polanski is slitting his nose by the reservoir and calling him “pussy cat,” and all that stuff; and him and Faye Dunaway, you know, it’s just extraordinary. It’s one of my favorite movies of all time. It’s one of the greatest screenplays ever written. I’m a huge Robert Towne fan, and a Polanski fan. And it was great on this movie — on Hitchcock — to work with John Huston’s son, Danny. He had some stories about his dad. [Laughs] That Noah Cross character [played by John Huston], I think is one of the darkest villains in cinematic history. Every little detail of that film, you know — whether it’s Gittes choosing the cheap bourbon at the beginning, rather than the expensive stuff; every single touch, I think, was masterful. It has such brilliance, and poise, and ultimately humanity to it. And again, it’s a story of power, of big city power and corruption and how power and privilege can destroy people and families. That’s a theme in Sweet Smell of Success as well.This is Spinal Tap (Rob Reiner, 1984; 95% Tomatometer)The last one, for me, just in terms of comedy, is This is Spinal Tap. [Laughs] I mean, I love Spinal Tap. When I first saw it in 1984 I was the only person in the cinema at Swiss Cottage in London, and I didn’t know whether it was real or if it wasn’t. [Laughs] It was just so profoundly funny. I think it obviously inspired me personally, in a huge way. I would say that the movies that inspired Anvil! were a combination of Withnail and I and This is Spinal Tap. [Laughs]That’s why Anvil! is so good, you see.[Laughs] It really was those two movies I saw early on. I just love the pomposity and ridiculousness of being an artist and trying with absolutely no-one caring. [Laughs] There’s an inherent tragedy to it. It’s the same thing in Withnail and I, you know — the philosophical ridiculousness of it, of a thespian in crisis. No-one really cares. There’s something so deeply hard about being an artist, because most of the time no-one gives a sh-t. But there’s something very sort of tragic and uplifting and real about that. I think with Spinal Tap it also has the humor, you know — how these guys, who have grown up, are still basically children. That was something that I also responded to in Anvil! But you know, Spinal Tap — the original and best. There would have been no Anvil! without that film. The best part is having the two films play on double bills all over the world. [Laughs]Did you ever meet those guys, Michael McKean and Christopher Guest?Yeah, I did. I did, actually, and they were fantastic. They were very funny.Now, did you know they were American actors when you first saw the movie? I didn’t.I didn’t know it wasn’t real, but eventually I figured it out.A lot of people were fooled, ’cause they made records and toured after that film.Oh absolutely! Their second album, I believe, was called Break Like the Wind [laughs], which I think sums it up. And they had a video for a song called “Bitch School,” which I though was very funny.They were genius.They were genius. I just think it was ironic that I found the guys that were part of the reason that inspired movies like Spinal Tap — they were guys like Anvil. It was very similar, the Anvil story, to Spinal Tap — Anvil had songs like “Butterbutt Jerky” and “Whiteknuckle Shuffle.” You could never make it up. I remember being on the road with Anvil, as a roadie, in 1982, before Spinal Tap came out; so I was living that life, you know, as a young kid on the road with a rock band. So when [Spinal Tap] came out, it was like my holiday job was up there on screen.So it’s no surprise that you thought Spinal Tap were real.Exactly! I was the drum tech. I was the drum roadie for [Anvil’s] Robb Reiner. [Laughs] And again, the crazy magical connection between Anvil with Rob Reiner, obviously being the name of the director of Spinal Tap. So it’s like, it was just so meta. It was just very surreal. I’m still amazed to this day by that film.Next, Gervasi talks about Hitchcock, how he approached the story of one of cinema’s most famous directors (and films), and working with Anthony Hopkins on the lead role.&nbsp;Luke Goodsell: When you set out to do a movie like this, about one of the most famous — if not the most famous — directors of all time, what’s the most daunting aspect?Sacha Gervasi: Well, I mean when you take on Hitchcock, at all — I mean, we were mostly telling the story of a relationship, but still, Hitchcock is the man — you know it’s gonna provoke some sort of controversy, because there were so many people talking about the book [Stephen Rebello’s Alfred Hitchcock and the Making of Psycho] and wanting it to be the film about the making of this movie [Psycho]. But that’s been done. That’s been done in the book, and Stephen Rebello himself was like, “I want a movie which is an entertainment for the audience.” So we made the conscious decision. I think we knew, though, that what we wanted to do — the intention of the film — was to pay tribute to not just this fiercely loyal and amazing wife [Alma Reville, played by Helen Mirren], but also this brilliant artist in her own right, who stood by his side throughout 54 years of marriage and this incredible career. I think for us, you know, it was really important to shine a light on that relationship and that incredible artist. And really show a little peek behind the curtain, of how hard it must be to live with a genius like Alfred Hitchcock and to deal with his crap — and playing a huge role. So for us I think it was a lovely thing to do — to take nothing away from Hitchcock, but also to acknowledge the unseen contributions that often are made to some of the great artists that we know.LG: As he’s characterized here, Hitchcock often comes across as a big kid — he’s playing pranks, there’s the scene where he puts the corpse in Vera Miles’ dressing room…SG: Right, yeah.LG: I’m curious as to how you and Anthony Hopkins approached Hitchcock, to try and flesh him out — because he was a very impenetrable persona.&nbsp;SG: Well, yeah, because he was so impenetrable he became so fascinating. I think what we really needed to do was to kind of explore what might have been in his psychology as he shot these movies, you know. So for us it was really a dramatic exploration, because there’s clearly a big fantasy element in the movie — as there should be in making a movie about Hitch; he was so enigmatic and fascinating that we couldn’t really do a documentary about that.LG: It’s inescapable in the performance that we see Anthony Hopkins and his own rich history as an actor — it’s like a synthesis of their personae.SG: Absolutely, and we wanted that intentionally to happen. We knew it was “Anthony Hopkins playing Alfred Hitchcock.” We [originally] had a prosthetic that completely covered him up, but there was no point when you have one of the greatest actors in the world and he’s got a big rubber mask on his face.LG: There’s also, of course, the connection with the killer Ed Gein inspiring both Psycho‘s Norman Bates and, later, Buffalo Bill in The Silence of the Lambs. Did you and Anthony talk about that at all?SG: Right, absolutely. I definitely think we discussed it on some level. I don’t remember it exactly but we definitely mentioned it.&nbsp;LG: In your research for the film, was there something that surprised you about Hitchcock that you hadn’t known before?SG: Yeah, the grocery bills.LG: [laughs]SG: The amount he spent was extraordinary. When we went to the Academy and researched his life, we saw all his incredible grocery bills. We found out he was having the food flown in from France and England, and the wines — they had a vineyard in Northern California. I mean, they lived incredibly well — even though their house, at a certain level, was quite modest, the way they lived was quite lavish and extraordinary. You have to admire Hitchcock. He grew up the son of a green grocer, so very humble beginnings, and he reached a point in his life where he was famous and powerful and could do what he wanted, and he loved the finer things in life. So if you’re Alfred Hitchcock and you want to have your food flown in from Maxine’s of Paris, then goddammit you go ahead and do it. [Laughs] The wonderful indulgence of success.LG: You mentioned working with Danny Huston before. Did he relate any grand tales of his dad? Did the family have any relationship with Hitchcock?SG: I think they did. I mean, what Danny said to me the other day was growing up with John Huston, he was always aware of the difference between the man and the mythology — and I think that’s what we tried to do in this film, to say there is a difference between the two. Mythology is largely the projection of other people, of what they want someone to be and what they hope they are; and I think for us it was important to tell the story of a man — a contradictory, flawed, difficult human being. It’s not good or bad, you know. He was both. And I think that was the exciting part, to show the complexity of the man. To me that only deepens and enriches your interest in the work, because you’re watching these movies — these brilliant movies — over and over again going, “Who is this guy? What drove him?” And I think we explored that without ever being able to answer it, and that’s a good thing. It needs to be as mysterious as ever.LG: Do you have a favorite Hitchcock film?SG: Yeah, Rear Window — because it’s unintentionally his most personal.LG: That explains the many Rear Window references in your film.SG: Yeah, there are about 10 references to other Hitchcock films in there.LG: Were you conscious of maybe putting too many in, or did you just want as many as you could?SG: We just put stuff in for fun, you know. Again, it’s a fun movie for an audience and we made that decision — and we’re really proud of it. That was really what we wanted, because remember — Hitchcock made movies for the audience, so we tried to be as fun as possible.Hitchcock opens in a limited release engagement this week ahead of its nationwide expansion.","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"Walking, who, Golden, drama, Exclusive, Extras, natural, Studios, Paramount, TV","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/dsfs.jpg","slug":"five-favorite-films-with-hitchcock-director-sacha-gervasi"},{"id":"47508847988015","title":"Five Favorite Films with Ewan McGregor","content":"Five Favorite Filmsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Five Favorite Films with Ewan McGregorPlus, the star of this week's Salmon Fishing in the Yemen on working with director Lasse Hallström and cracking up with Emily Blunt.by Luke Goodsell | March 9, 2012 |  CommentsIn addition to being immeasurably charming, the rather talented Ewan McGregor has been a mainstay of interesting performances on film for the better part of two decades now. From his early Danny Boyle breakouts through his roles for the likes of Todd Haynes, Peter Greenaway, Steven Soderbergh and Roman Polanski, the actor’s delivered consistently creative work; even when the movies were less than stellar (you know what we’re talking about), his performances always rose above the material. And when the great Christopher Plummer took home his Supporting Actor Oscar recently, he could thank McGregor’s equally nuanced (though largely unsung) turn in Beginners for providing him with the emotional anchor.In this week’s Salmon Fishing in the Yemen, McGregor takes up the piscatorial mantle of one Dr. Alfred Jones, a Scottish fisheries boffin reluctantly convinced by an angling-enthused sheik (Amr Waked) and his feisty investment adviser (Emily Blunt) to assist them in their crazy desert scheme. Not too many actors can wear a khaki fishing vest and make it look good, but then not too many actors get away with impersonating Sir Alec Guinness, either.We spoke to McGregor recently about the movie, during which time he was also happy to talk about some of his favorite films. “But you should make sure that it’s five of my favorite films,” he qualifies, “and not my top five films. It’s definitely not my all-time favorite films, ’cause then I would have to sit down and think about it more clearly.” Duly noted, sir. Read on for more of the interview.Harvey (Henry Koster; 1950; 83% Tomatometer)Well, Harvey I’ve always loved because Jimmy Stewart’s one of my all time favorite actors and I think it’s just an incredible performance from him. It’s a very, very moving performance. It’s a really lovely character that he has to play.Deliverance (John Boorman, 1972; 94% Tomatometer)Deliverance, I just think is a really incredibly made film — made by John Boorman, who was an incredible director. And I just think it’s a film where you kind of get into the heart and soul of these people and it unsettles you. It’s very frightening ’cause it makes you feel like you could be there, and “What would you do in this situation?”Jaws (Steven Spielberg, 1975; 100% Tomatometer)Jaws, ’cause it’s Jaws, and it’s just a huge, brilliantly made film with rich characters and huge suspense — and a monster that we’d never seen before that happens to be a real one, that we’ve all been frightened of ever since.Did you and Emily conspire to pick Jaws together?No — did she pick Jaws too?It was her number one choice. I think she was promoting “fish” movies.[Laughs]Easy Rider (Dennis Hopper; 1969; 85% Tomatometer)Easy Rider, ’cause it symbolizes a sort of search for freedom…And you love motorcycles. [McGregor produced and starred in the TV series Long Way Down, about two friends on a cross-continental motorcycle ride.]And I love motorcycles. But I also love the way it was made: like they went on a bike trip and they shot it and they made the film up as they went along, I think — and it feels like that. It feels very real. And it’s also circling this very horrible acid trip in it, which really freaks me out.Right. There’s no film, except maybe The Wild Angels, quite like it.Yeah. I don’t think there’s any film really like it. It’s got a very cool opening, too, with the drug run to the airport. Very cool.Doctor Zhivago (David Lean; 1965; 85% Tomatometer)And then Doctor Zhivago, ’cause it’s a lesson in filmmaking. It’s like a master class in how to shoot and act and light and it makes me very depressed watching it, because we don’t make films like that any more — and I wish we did.Next, McGregor talks Salmon Fishing in the Yemen, working with Lasse Hallström and keeping a straight face on set with Emily Blunt.&nbsp;Salmon Fishing in the Yemen must have read as something of an odd film on paper.Ewan McGregor: Well, I thought it would work as a film. I felt very strongly that it would be an amazing film when I read it. I felt that all of the different strands to it — the love story, which is complicated; the actual premise of the movie, the idea of a rich sheik business man wanting to introduce his passion into his country, which happens to be salmon fishing in the deserts of the Yemen; and the political satire, the rich comedy, the characters — I just thought it was absolutely a brilliant film. And it read like that; it was a real page-turner. I thought it was fantastic.The title makes for a curious prospect, though.Yeah. Some people have a funny reaction to the title, but I think it’s great. I was worried that they might change it, ’cause there was some talk of doing that. Hollywood generally likes to simplify things and make them brutally clear and understandable, and I suppose they just couldn’t do that with this title because it’s as clear and as understandable as could be. It’s a film about salmon fishing in the Yemen, and it’s called Salmon Fishing in the Yemen. So I think it’s perfect. I think it’s odd. I just hope it doesn’t turn people off.How did you come to read it? Were you looking to work with Lasse, or had you read some of [screenwriter] Simon Beaufoy’s other stuff?I’d worked with Simon before on something, another film that he wrote. I met him with Danny Boyle at a couple of events — or I presented Danny Boyle with an award for Slumdog, and he wrote that with Danny. So I knew Simon. I thought he did an extraordinary job, because the book — many of the chapters are literal e-mail correspondences, which would become very tedious on screen; although we have a little element of that here and there. I thought he did a really great job, and also, you know, changing the Prime Minister’s PR to a woman I thought was really clever. Originally in the book it was a British politician who we would all recognize, but I think we wanted to be more general in our fun picking over the politics.When we first meet your character, Dr. Alfred Jones, you’re looking rather staid with your gray cardigans and posh accent — what was it like playing someone so different from what we’ve seen of you?Well, I think they’re all different, the characters I play. I don’t feel there’s some kind of mold I have to break out of in order to play this guy. I just think that every character that I approach is unique and different and has a role to play in that particular story. So it wasn’t an attempt on my part to change anything, it was just an attempt to carry on doing what I do — to, you know, play characters in films or on stage or whatever.Did you enjoy playing him?Yeah I really liked it. I think there’s very much fun to be had with him, to play someone who’s kind of stuck and repressed and awkward, and not very pleasant, in fact, at the beginning of the film — and yet to find humor in that was great fun, and a great challenge, yeah.Emily was very complimentary of your working relationship. How was it, working with her?She’s fantastic. I mean, she’s an incredibly funny girl. She’s a lovely girl, and we just had a great time. I knew from the moment we met at rehearsal that we were gonna have a good time making this film. We pushed each other, I think, and freed each other up just to play in front of the lens. And that was also very much with Lasse’s direction — he likes to work in that way; he likes to give you a freedom to throw things around and no two takes were the same. We just had a really wonderful time. She’s a very talented actress.Did you guys add stuff on set that wasn’t necessarily on the page?I mean, that’s the whole process of making a film, really. We didn’t make any changes from the storyline, really, I mean we shot what was on the page, but of course making a film is a process of making that real — so, yeah, [Lasse] was a great partner in that.I hear he’s a little eccentric.He’s sort of… his general style is just sort of bonkers, Lasse. He’d affect, in a way, a kind of clumsiness. He’d often walk on set and make himself trip up; he sort of plays the buffoon a little bit. But at the same time it creates a very relaxed atmosphere. And he doesn’t enforce his opinions on anyone. He’s got good opinions and his notes were very accurate, I thought. He’s just an oddball. He would sometimes not want to rehearse, he would just want to shoot. And he shot an awful lot of stuff on his iPhone while we were working. In fact, of all of the stuff in the film, there’s this little iPhone sequence that he shot. Sometimes you just thought he was more concerned with his iPhone movie than the one we were shooting. [Laughs] But I think it’s all very meant; it’s all tactical. He knows what he’s doing and he certainly knows who these characters are. His skill is really apparent in the film, because by the end of the film we really care about the project and we really care about Alfred and Harriet getting together; he manages to hold all those balls up in the air.There must be a whole other version of the film on that iPhone.Maybe, yeah. [Laughs] He filmed hours and hours of it. By the end of the film he had a special rig for his iPhone — like a Steadicam built for it.Meanwhile the First AD is directing the picture…No, not really. [Laughs] I don’t want to suggest that he wasn’t paying attention to the film, ’cause he was. He’s just got a very funny manner. We adored him. Emily and I both had such a laugh with him. I think on the DVD there’ll be a very funny blooper real, because Emily makes me laugh all the time and we’d often crack up in the middle of the scene. And then we had lots of carry-on with Lasse in between takes and stuff, which all ended up on an outtakes reel.It’s a wonder you maintained any serious poise in this film.[Laughs] Well sometimes it was very difficult. There are moments in it where I can see Emily about to go. There’s a moment where — well, you’ll have to look out for them. But there’s moments where I can see her about to laugh. [Laughs] They had to do a bit of quick editing away from her. [Laughs]Not to take anything away from her performance, but I find there’s something about her — in all her movies — where she seems like she’s about to crack up.Yeah. Well she really allows herself to come through her work, which I think is really difficult, and really brave — and she does that in bucketloads. There’s a lot of her in her work, and it shows great confidence and skill that she’s able to do that.Salmon Fishing in the Yemen is in theaters now.","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"Turner, Academy, shows, singing","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/sadfsdf.jpg","slug":"five-favorite-films-with-ewan-mcgregor"},{"id":"47508848041268","title":"Five Favorite Films with Daniel Radcliffe","content":"Five Favorite Filmsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Five Favorite Films with Daniel RadcliffeThe Harry Potter star drops by for a chat ahead of his new film, this week's Gothic horror The Woman in Black.by Luke Goodsell | February 1, 2012 |  Comments“It’s actually a thrill to be talking about something else,” Daniel Radcliffe chuckles, pausing to consider a question about his new movie The Woman in Black. He is, of course, referring to the ubiquitous presence of a certain blockbuster franchise that has consumed almost half of his life on the planet. Radcliffe was just an untested 11-year-old when cast as the eponymous hero of Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone way back in 2001; now, having triumphantly wrapped the series with last year’s Deathly Hallows, he’s a seasoned 22 and ready to spirit himself into the realm that lies beyond Hogwarts.“To be honest,” Radcliffe admits, “I want to just cram in as many, and as diverse a range, of parts in films as I possibly can in the next few years — while I’m in this stage of transition from out of the world of Potter.”Though he’s done a couple of small films between his wizarding gig (and received praise for his stage work in Equus), The Woman in Black represents the first significant step in the actor’s post-Potter direction. Based on a popular English novel and produced under the vintage Hammer label, the Gothic horror is set in a remote village whose children are being terrorized by the specter of dead woman. Radcliffe plays the young lawyer dispatched to investigate — and it’s a role the actor hopes will help cultivate a new screen image.“The fact that the part is different, in that I’m playing older and I’m playing a father; there’s stuff that will physically separate me from Harry in people’s minds,” he explains. “But what’s more important to me is that the story of this film is so compelling — that even if people go in thinking, “Oh let’s see how he does in his next thing,” within, like, 15 minutes they’re going to be, hopefully, wrapped up in the story; because it’s a great story, and really compelling and scary.”Audiences will have their chance to see Radcliffe’s transformation (and marvel at his dashing new accoutrements) when The Woman in Black opens in theaters this week. In the meantime, we asked him to talk through his all-time five favorite films.12 Angry Men (Sidney Lumet, 1957; 100% Tomatometer)My five favorite films change all the time. Well, no — the top three never change, but the last two are kind of up for grabs constantly. 12 Angry Men is, I think, a feat of writing. It’s brilliant. The fact that it all takes place in one room — I think there’s maybe two minutes, three minutes of screen time that is not in the one room in that film — and yet it is one of the most compelling things I’ve ever seen. I mean, you can’t look away. You’re gripped by the dynamics between the people, by what’s gonna happen, and by the fact that it’s a whodunit, based in one room, which is brilliant.A Matter of Life and Death (aka Stairway to Heaven) (Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger, 1946; 95% Tomatometer)I think A Matter of Life and Death is one of the great works of imagination in cinema. It’s a brilliant story. David Niven could not be more charming in it if he tried. He starts off, you know, as a World War II pilot about to crash his plane whilst quoting Andrew Marvell down the phone to the mayday operator, who he then falls in love with. There is one shot in it, actually, of the heavenly court before it goes into session, which we absolutely — and I haven’t actually spoken to Mike Newell about this — but we lifted almost identically for the start of the Triwizard tournament in Potter, in the fourth film. There is one shot — because I think I watched Matter of Life and Death shortly after we finished that film — which I watched and went, “Oh my god, we’ve just stolen that!”Well if you’re gonna steal, steal from the Archers.Absolutely; if you’re gonna steal, you can’t do much better than those guys. So that would be one of my favorite films. Possibly — possibly — even more than 12 Angry Men.Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb (Stanley Kubrick, 1964; 100% Tomatometer)Dr. Strangelove showed me, I suppose taught me, a lot about comedy. The stuff that’s funniest is the stuff that scares us most — because all good comedy comes out of fear of death, fear of humiliation, fear of public awkwardness, fear of, you know, all those kinds of things. To have truly, really dark comedy where at the end of the film everyone in the world dies, that was very funny to me. I went to the Kubrick exhibition and there was this whole section on how originally the film had ended with a gigantic pie fight, and it was cut; but in a way I get what that might have been going for — the fact that it is all so ridiculous.Little Miss Sunshine (Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris, 2006; 91% Tomatometer)Little Miss Sunshine: I find it to be the sweetest, funniest… it’s a modern classic, I think. And I think Steve Carell is brilliant in it; heartbreaking. Also the fact that it came out of nowhere — that I went to the cinema knowing nothing about it.Jason and the Argonauts (Don Chaffey, 1963; 96% Tomatometer)The fifth, because it is the film of my childhood, and I still think the skeleton sequence is one of the scariest effects sequences ever, is Jason and the Argonauts. That is the film that, within the first six months of a relationship of any girl that I’m with, I have to make her watch that film — and if she doesn’t react the way I’d like, then that’s kind of a deal-breaker. If you don’t like Harryhausen’s stop-motion then you are not going to be in my life. [Laughs]Has it ever come to that?No, fortunately not. Fortunately I think that they all picked up that the stakes were quite high — so at least they pretended to like it.Really, what kind of awful person wouldn’t like it?You really have to kind of just have a heart of stone to not be able to get into that film, ’cause it’s just brilliant. You know the other film I like? The Vikings, that Tony Curtis-Kirk Douglas one. It’s really good, just because it’s… well, it’s Vikings; but I think Ernest Borgnine plays, like, Ragnar, the king of the Vikings, and it’s a hysterical film — ’cause made in the ’50s, and there are these shots where they’re panning down the rows of Vikings and they’ve all got horned helmets and scraggly hair, and then you get to Tony Curtis and Kirk Douglas who’re just perfectly coiffed, beautiful men still. [Laughs]The Woman in Black opens in theaters this week.","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"politics, Network, Country, renewals, Sematary, Emmy, satire, Premium, female","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/wer.jpg","slug":"five-favorite-films-with-daniel-radcliffe"},{"id":"47508846013734","title":"Five Favorite Films with Whit Stillman","content":"Five Favorite Filmsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Five Favorite Films with Whit StillmanThe writer-director of Metropolitan and this week's Damsels in Distress on five of his favorite movies.by Luke Goodsell | April 5, 2012 |  CommentsBack in the 1990s, Whit Stillman wrote and directed what might be regarded as three modern American classics. While independent cinema grew saturated with dysfunctional Sundance dramas and pop culture solipsism, Stillman’s so-called “yuppie trilogy” — Metropolitan (1990),Barcelona (1994) and The Last Days of Disco(1998) — instead offered comedic portraits of hyper-literate, obsessive preppy types negotiating a world of social etiquette that felt extracted from another time. Before Wes Anderson, Noah Baumbach or Lena Dunham — and indeed, Christian Bale’s take on Patrick Bateman — Stillman was indie film’s premier chronicler of the young, privileged and neurotic.Which is all to say, it’s great to have him back. Fourteen years (and several aborted projects) after Disco, Stillman at last returns withDamsels in Distress, which opens in theaters in New York and Los Angeles this week. The director’s take on the campus comedy — in so much as the film can be confined to a genre — it stars Analeigh Tipton as a freshman recruited by a clique of female students plotting a minor social revolution (and a major dance craze) at a school overrun with boorish frathouses. Not unlike an alternate universe Clueless populated with the urban haute bourgeoisie (and better cardigans), it’s an unmistakably Stillman piece: dry of wit, whimsical in the most beguiling sense, and refreshingly counter-cultural placed next to the endless, formula-joke bromances of the era.While on the press rounds for the film this week, Stillman took some time out to write about his five favorite films. “These are just five of a possible 55 faves — or more,” he says. “But one has to start somewhere.”The Gay Divorcee (Mark Sandrich, 1934; 100% Tomatometer)Mark Sandrich was the superlative director of Fred Astaire musicals, strikingly more successful at this demanding (though charming) form than the better known George Stevens. It’s very funny, chock-a-block with great character actors, and with wonderful music (Cole Porter) and choreography (Astaire with Hermes Pan). There’s something about works at the beginning of a form or style of cinema, even if rough and lacking couth, that I find more lovable and compelling than that form perfected (which in this case would be the gorgeous Top Hat made by Sandrich the next year).The Shop Around the Corner (Ernst Lubitsch, 1933; 100% Tomatometer)Ernst Lubitsch’s profoundly moving and charming recreation of a microcosm of commerce-hunting humanity in an idealized, bygone Budapest. Jimmy Stewart and Margaret Sullavan are brilliant in their roles as the letterwriting non-lovers — but it’s Frank Morgan’s plight as the lovelorn, betrayed shop owner which gives the film its heart and weight.Wagon Master (John Ford, 1950; 100% Tomatometer)Directors going independent to make precisely the film they want was not begun — as we sometimes think — by the latterday Johns (Cassavetes and Sayles). After World War Two John Ford formed an indie with the legendary producer (war hero also) Merian C. Cooper: Wagon Master was the lovely result, a film that seems like folk art. The stirring score and brilliant diagonals of Ford’s composition greatly inspired us in the Barcelona edit room — though I’m not sure if any trace of that influence could be found in our film.The Miracle of Morgan’s Creek (Preston Sturges, 1944; 90% Tomatometer)Writer-director Preston Sturges’ most exuberant comedy — a film that’s easy to watch and hard to imagine, God-like in its love for and forgiveness of its protagonists. The Sturges cuisine transforms seemingly lunchmeat ingredients into a rich cinematic repast.I Soliti Ignoti aka Big Deal on Madonna Street (Mario Monicelli, 1958; 88% Tomatometer)The American title — Big Deal on Madonna Street — must be the worst of the international variants for Mario Monicelli’s brilliant incompetent-caper comedy, said to be the absurd version of Rififi. The direct translation — Persons Unknown — used elsewhere, seems funnier once you’ve seen the film; the Spanish distributor had the wit to call it Rufufu and there it’s a treasured classic. The shooting style — the great use of the so-called “curtain effect” — has also been something we always try to put to use.Damsels in Distress opens in New York and Los Angeles this week.","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"Crunchyroll, TV, Premium, Television, Globe, DC, park, TLC, emmy, die, IFC, female, movie, obituary, Adult","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/WhitStillman.jpg","slug":"five-favorite-films-with-whit-stillman"},{"id":"47508848030000","title":"Five Favorite Films with Megan Fox","content":"Five Favorite Filmsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Five Favorite Films with Megan FoxPlus, the actress chats about her role in this week's ensemble movie Friends with Kids and why she enjoys doing comedy.by Luke Goodsell | March 9, 2012 |  CommentsIt wasn’t too long ago that Megan Fox found herself at the dizzying center of the celebrity maelstrom. Through no particular fault of her own, she was teetering on the brink of media overexposure — the kind that comes from the usual perception of someone (and more often an actress) suddenly becoming too big, and too fast. Fox’s well-publicized (and rather humorous) feud with her Transformers director Michael Bay lead to her being dismissed from the third installment (quick: try and remember the name of her replacement), while her would-be star vehicle — the hopelessly misunderstood Jennifer’s Body — bombed with critics and audiences.Yet Fox’s career is taking an arguably more interesting turn now that the white light of scrutiny has subsided: she’s got roles in Judd Apatow’s Knocked Up sequel This is 40 and Sacha Baron Cohen’s The Dictator on the way, and this week stars as part of the ensemble cast of Jennifer Westfeldt’s Friends with Kids. In the well-received comedy-drama, Fox plays Mary Jane, the much-younger girlfriend of single-dad-with-a-twist Adam Scott, while getting to act alongside a cast that includes Westfeldt, Jon Hamm, Kristen Wiig and Maya Rudolph.We got a chance to chat with Fox about the experience recently, as well as her thoughts on doing more of this kind of comedy in the future. Read on for that, but first, she reeled off her five favorite films. (And for being the first person to pick Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, well, we salute her.)The Lord of the Rings trilogy (Peter Jackson; 2001, 2002, 2003; 92%, 96%, 94% Tomatometers)Well number one — and we have to count it as one or else it’s take up my whole list — is The Lord of the Rings. That’s pretty self-explanatory. I read the books when I was a kid and Peter Jackson just created this incredible world and environment that you get caught up in. It’s amazing.How to Train Your Dragon (Peter Hastings and Chris Sanders, 2010; 98% Tomatometer)Number two — you’re not gonna believe me [laughs] — number two is How to Train Your Dragon. You should see it. It’s sad, it’s sweet — it’s a really good movie.Kung Fu Panda 2 (Jennifer Yuh, 2011; 81% Tomatometer)Kung Fu Panda 2. [Laughs] I really love that.You really like those animated movies, huh.I really love kids’ movies. I watch them constantly. I don’t know, it’s nostalgic I guess. I don’t know why I love them so much.The Wizard of Oz (Victor Fleming and King Vidor; 1939; 100% Tomatometer)The Wizard of Oz, which I grew up with. That has always been one of my favorites. It’s a classic.Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles trilogy (Steve Barron, Michael Pressman, Stuart Gillard; 1990, 1991, 1993; 44%, 36%, 27% Tomatometers)Finally — and this is a series as well — the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles movies. The original three are just… [sings] “Go ninja, go ninja, go!” I just really loved those movies.I do love the first one. How old were you when you saw them?I was must have been really young — maybe five or six when I first saw them. And I think they still hold up. [Laughs] My husband laughs ’cause he thinks they’re so terrible, but I love the animatronic puppets. I just love the old school, the practical — you know, there’s no CG. I prefer the original Yoda in Star Wars as opposed to the CG Yoda. I love puppets and animatronics.I’m with you. He needs to go and rewatch those films. That should be your mission.To make him a believer? [Laughs] I’ll try.Next, Fox chats about her role in this week’s Friends with Kids, why she enjoys playing comedy, and her experiences working with Judd Apatow and Sacha Baron Cohen.&nbsp;Let’s talk a little about Friends with Kids. This is an ensemble comedy, and a different kind of movie for you. How’d you get involved?Megan Fox: I think that there were a few names that Jen [director Jennifer Westfeldt] was considering to play Mary Jane, and she came over to my house to meet with me about it. We ended up talking for hours. I think it was maybe three hours, and we were talking about astrology and nothing that had anything to do with the movie — but we ended up getting along well so it sort of came about that way.Adam Scott, Jon Hamm, Kristen Wiig, Maya Rudolph — you got a fine cast to work with there. What was that like?Well they’re all… first of all I feel like they were such a safe choice to make, because the movie’s gonna be amazing because the talent in the movie is so high. There’s so many really strong comedians and fantastic actors in it, and I just wanted the opportunity to get to work with them. I sort of felt the pressure was off of me, you know — I didn’t have to carry it or do anything spectacular to move the story along. It wasn’t really about me, which I really appreciated. I really enjoyed the process of that. And they’re also all good friends, which I feel like is an easier environment to work in and walk in to — as opposed to this sort of awkward, get- to-know-you stage that people go through when the entire cast has not met one another and is not familiar with each other.With that pressure off, did you get a taste for doing more of these kinds of smaller films?Yeah, I love it. I also really enjoy being a part of an ensemble cast. It was fun to go to work every day, and that’s a nice feeling to have — to wake up and be happy that you’re going to work. It’s not always that way.It sounds like you don’t miss being part of a huge juggernaut production.Ah… I don’t. There is something about filming those types of movies that is so [laughs]… there’s a lot of adrenalin each day because you never know what’s gonna happen, and literally going to work was dangerous. It was like, “Well, who on the crew is gonna almost get blown up today?” Which was, you know, there’s something really fun in it — I mean, it’s psychotic, but there’s something really fun and kind of frighteningly enjoyable about doing that. But you can’t always do that. [Laughs] That’s sort of a once-in-a-lifetime, or you maybe do that a couple of times, but you can’t make a living out of doing that. It’ll kill you.&nbsp;You’ve done comedy before: Jennifer’s Body, for example, which most people unfortunately didn’t get—[Sighs] I know.Is comedy something you’d like to pursue?I mean, I’m much more comfortable doing comedy. It feels, I don’t know — it’s a better environment for me and I just enjoy it more. That’s not to say that I’ll be successful at doing it, but right now I at least have more fun on comedy sets.There’s less chance of getting blown up.[Laughs] Exactly.What was it like working with Judd Apatow on This is 40?I love him. He’s such a nice guy. I never saw him get angry or impatient; he’s just this big, happy kid who also happens to be a genius. The way he shoots is so open and so creative. There’s so much improv on his set, it’s crazy. I don’t know how he has the foresight to take all of that and make it into a movie, because he has endless hours of material of all of these comedians that just spend all day improv’ing in these scenes. I loved working with him; he’s one of my favorite people.And you’re in The Dictator — that’s just a cameo?Yeah, it’s just a cameo I shot one day. [Laughs] But, you know — it’s Sacha, so it’s gonna be really interesting. It pushes some boundaries. I had a good time. He was a gentleman, but he’s really hysterical and very funny. That was a good experience as well. I haven’t seen the movie yet but I think it’s probably going to be really funny.Did he stay in character while he was filming?Yeah he did. He was in character the whole time. He would come out of character for a few minutes, but he has this song — he has this sort of chanting — that he would do to get himself back into his Dictator character, which he would do right as we were rollingFriends with Kids is in theaters this week.","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"Academy, and, Interview, Amazon, foreign, history, Association, Grant, Marvel, king, jamie, of, book","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/xvxz.jpg","slug":"five-favorite-films-with-megan-fox"},{"id":"47508846016807","title":"Five Favorite Films with Lucy Liu","content":"Five Favorite Filmsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Five Favorite Films with Lucy LiuThe actress also talks indie comedy The Trouble with Bliss and her upcoming martial arts epic with the RZA, The Man with the Iron Fists.by Luke Goodsell | March 30, 2012 |  CommentsIn a busy career across movies, stage and TV, Lucy Liu has played all kinds of roles: fashionistas, Charlie’s Angels, animated snakes and — perhaps most memorably — sword-wielding, scalp-collecting bosses of deadly assassination squads. She’s currently appearing in Detachment and this week’s The Trouble with Bliss, an independent New York comedy co-starring Dexter‘s Michael C. Hall and 21 Jump Street‘s Brie Larson. With the movie opening in New York, LA and across VOD, Liu called in for a conversation about her role, while also sharing some stories from the Chinese set of The Man with the Iron Fists — the upcoming martial arts movie directed by and starring the RZA, with Russell Crowe, Gordon Liu and Pam Grier. Read on for more of the chat, but first up — her five favorite films.Red Sorghum (Yimou Zhang, 1987; 100% Tomatometer)One of my favorite films is Red Sorghum, by Zhang Yimou, who’s an incredible director — just incredibly visual. The way that he shoots a film and takes a time in history and connects it to somebody; he takes a moment in somebody’s life and also connects it historically to what happened between the Japanese and the Chinese during the war. I just think it’s so elegantly done. It sort of shows not just what’s going on in the family itself, but links that personal story — you get involved in that and then connected to the backdrop of the war, how their family, how their business all kind of connects. It’s incredibly heartbreaking and very real. It was very impactful. I saw it when I was in college, and I was destroyed. [Laughs] Destroyed by that movie. There’s a quality in his movies that really stands out, that I haven’t really seen in a lot of other movies.It Happened One Night (Frank Capra, 1934; 97% Tomatometer)Another movie that I really love — and I’m sure you know it — is It Happened One Night, which is, I think, one of the best romantic comedies out there. I remember seeing that movie and falling in love with Clark Gable and just thinking how fantastic that backdrop was, on the train. It seemed like a very real relationship, like they really were in love with one another. [Laughs] I didn’t seem so pat, you know?2046 (Wong Kar Wai, 2004; 84% Tomatometer)I also love 2046 by Wong Kar Wai, a film which I thought was so beautifully shot, with an incredible story. I love that he uses the location as a character. He has a very romantic way, a very sexy way of presenting everything, and the cinematography in that is absolutely stunning. He obviously has a very strong vision for what he wants to do and how he wants to do it. All of his movies, I think they’re very intimate: They don’t always require huge stages, but he always seems to capture something in a very small area. I like the way he presents things. He creates an atmosphere and you get swept into it right away.Being There (Hal Ashby, 1979; 95% Tomatometer)I love Being There, it’s one of my favorite movies — with Peter Sellers, who I thought was brilliant. I love how underplayed but so incredibly funny it was, you know… dry. [Laughs] There’s something wonderful about the misconceptions [about the main character] that create the simplicity of all of it. The misconceptions create a simplicity which then creates this aura. I love that movie.The Godfather; The Godfather: Part II (Francis Ford Coppola; 1972, 1974; 100%, 98% Tomatometers)Then I have, well, I have two movies: Godfather one and two. An incredibly absorbing story that unravels and captures a time that really existed in New York. It just draws you in and just keeps you. There are moments in that that you can’t believe. You watch it and you go, “Oh, right” and then you hear the dialogue and then you realize that this is an incredibly famous quote. [Laughs] It’s all-time, basically. A side one that I love, just ’cause I grew up watching it, and it happened to air around my birthday in December, was The Sound of Music. It reminds me very much of my childhood, that kind of hopeful, contagious optimism that Julie Andrews had — and also set in the backdrop of war. But that’s more of a childhood thing. Then there’s Drunken Master, but for different reasons, and different entertainment values, you know? It’s hard. There’s a list a mile long. In very small font. But asked to narrow it down, I will narrow it down to those movies right now. [Laughs]Next, Liu talks about her role in The Trouble with Bliss and shares some stories from the set of RZA’s forthcoming martial arts epic, The Man with the Iron Fists.&nbsp;Your role in The Trouble with Bliss is small, but enjoyable: the weird, married neighbor coming on to Michael C. Hall. What interested you about the part?Lucy Liu: Well I read the script and I loved it. I thought that it was very funny and smart. I also loved the idea of [working with] Michael C. Hall. I think he’s lovely and talented, so I kind of jumped on board. It was also shooting New York. I don’t know how it exactly all turned out in the end, but I know that I liked the character: I thought she was a bit odd and had a very strange energy. She was sort of syncopated. I thought that was a nice addition to how the rest of the movie was going. She sort of says one thing and then she does another. [Laughs] She’s hitting on somebody although she has a completely other relationship, you know — she’s trouble. I liked that there was some dimension to her. I also liked the idea of a man who’s still living at home and hasn’t moved on; I thought it was interesting to have other people in his life be quite colorful and try to draw him out, yet ultimately he has to be motivated to move out in his own. I also love doing comedy, and I thought that was a little more comedic than some of my other roles that I’ve done in the past. [Laughs]Is comedy something you’d like to do more of?I like comedy, it’s one of my favorite things to watch. Who doesn’t like to laugh, you know? But oftentimes it’s very difficult for comedy to be successful, for many reasons: timing, delivery; you never know how it’s all gonna come together. I do think that comedy was one of the reasons I chose to do that movie. It was a very small movie; it was made for, like, 10 cents or something.Well you’re funny in it.Thank you. That helps.It usually helps when you’re trying to do comedy.[Laughs] Also just to have an energy with someone. It takes two to tango, for sure, so you need that connection with somebody in order to make comedy, to make funny… “To make funny!” [Laughs][Laughs] How’s it going with The Man with the Iron Fists? You’ve finished shooting?Yes, we finished shooting in China last year.What’s it like?It’s probably gonna be a sort of hybrid of a whole bunch of movies, from Chinese movies and Asian movies from, let’s say the ’70s and before. I mean, to be honest with you I’m not really sure how that’s all gonna turn out because we shot that as an independent film in China. [Laughs] But I think it’s gonna be pretty killer. I know that I bumped into somebody [that had seen it] at the studio and they were like, “This is like nothing we’ve ever seen before, it’s a complete original and we don’t know exactly what to make of it. It’s great.” And I said, “Okay, I’ll take that and run with it.” [Laughs] I think it’s gonna be a lot of fun. I think it’s gonna be entertaining. It’s based in a different time, so it’s a period movie, and there’s gonna be some pure action in it. I think the way that RZA’s gonna put everything together on the screen is gonna be quite different from what we’re normally used to seeing. I know that’s kind of a generic answer, but I haven’t seen the movie myself yet. I know that they’ve been doing some post-structure on it with the editing and the music and stuff.&nbsp;Is RZA doing the music for the film?Yeah, RZA’s doing the music, he’s putting it together and I’m sure he’s gonna get some amazing artists. He also, you know, went off on his Californication for a little bit and did a tour. [Laughs] It’s like, between all that and the post [production] I have no idea when it’s coming out. I know they’re gearing up for it, which is always a good thing — as opposed to “Oh well, let’s just release it.”Did you get to do any fight scenes in this one?I did a whole hell of a lot of fighting. But you know, I did not train for the movie at all, so you can only imagine. [Laughs] They were like, “This is what you’re gonna do now” and I’m like, “Okay…”You did have some serious fight choreographers on this, people like Corey Yuen…Yeah, Corey Yuen — awesome, totally patient. I was like, “Wait a minute: You want me to do this, and then duck and then jump and do wirework?” And I had a little incident where I crashed into the set ’cause the wire went a little awry. [Laughs] Like a full-on crash through the set — an explosion of wood and stuff like that. It was quite interesting. [Laughs] I think B-roll got it. Someone was documenting the whole thing.I’m assuming RZA fights, too?Yeah, he fights. I think everyone pretty much gets into it. [Laughs] Everyone gets down and dirty.Even Russell Crowe?[Laughs] Russell has some moments as well. I don’t know how they ended up doing him, ’cause originally I don’t think he had any stuff but I think when he got there he was like, “Okay, bring it on.” He had some cool moments for sure.Were you in any scenes with Gordon Liu?No! I’m so bitter! [Laughs] There was not a Liu joining in that particular situation.Is Quentin Tarantino in the film? ‘Cause it seems almost impossible that he wouldn’t show up somewhere.Well Quentin was in the film, I mean, he came to the set. He came to China en route to France, if you can believe it, and he hung out. Quentin is presenting the film, and he’s incredibly encouraging and supportive of RZA. He’s just a great guy. I don’t know if they ended up having him in the film or not, but he came by. He read the script beforehand, and made sure that he saw some of the dailies and what not. When Quentin’s a fan of something, he is a fan all the way; that’s what’s so wonderful about him. He’s so encouraging and supportive, and he’ll tell you what he thinks, you know. Like, [adopts Tarantino voice] “Ehhhhhhhh, I’m not so sure,” you know. [Laughs] He was RZA’s [person saying] “I’m not so sure about that.” He’s a part of it. RZA’s sort of been following him around for a while, in terms of getting his thoughts and doing his apprenticeship under him for a while. So there’ll be some qualities in the movie that Quentin’s fans will really enjoy.He’s certainly had some good training then.Yeah. He’s such a cool guy. And I think he’s a great director too. If he had something to say he’d come and say it to you, otherwise he’d sort of leave you on your own. He picked the people that he wanted to do the project and then he trusted them.The Trouble with Bliss is playing in New York and LA and through VOD, with an expansion to more locations on April 6.","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"Lionsgate, cancelled, Comedy, CBS, rom-coms, Sematary, series, medical, name","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/LucyLiu.jpg","slug":"five-favorite-films-with-lucy-liu"},{"id":"47508848063805","title":"Five Favorite Films with Freida Pinto","content":"Five Favorite Filmsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Five Favorite Films with Freida PintoThe star of Immortals also chats about working with Tarsem Singh and the challenges of acting in her first big-budget production.by Luke Goodsell | November 8, 2011 |  CommentsIn just a few short years — following her luminous debut in Danny Boyle’s Oscar-winning Slumdog Millionaire — Freida Pinto has gone from a virtual unknown to one of movies’ most feted young actresses. Her handful of feature credits already boasts performances for such acclaimed directors as Woody Allen and Julian Schnabel, while she starred in the summer’s surprise hit Rise of the Planet of the Apes and will soon headline iconoclastic filmmaker Michael Winterbottom’s literary riff, Trishna. This week, Pinto lends her talents to Immortals, Tarsem Singh’s visually stylish, violent and sometimes quite surreal imagining of ancient Greek mythology in which the actress portrays the oracle (and future lover of Henry Cavill’s Theseus) Phaedra. We sat down with Pinto recently where she discussed her admiration for the director and the experience of working on her first big-budget film, and how it affects her performance. She also took a moment to recall her five favorite films.The Shining (Stanley Kubrick, 1980; 88% Tomatometer)I can give you them as they come to mind; right now, when you say “five favorite films,” the first one that came to my mind — and I’m trying to think of different genres as well — the first one that came to my mind is The Shining. I do not know why, but that’s been one of my all-time favorite films. I’ve seen it about four times. I think that’s a lot for someone who’s completely petrified by darkness and lonely places.The Shawshank Redemption (Frank Darabont, 1994; 90% Tomatometer)Shawshank Redepmtion… I don’t know, it’s very uplifting and there’s something about it that motivates you, you know, and gives you that sense of “Let’s go and do it.” I’ve seen it like a million times. It’s kind of like a book that you can go back to and read again and again. I find it easier to go back to films than books, though.Gone With the Wind (Victor Fleming, George Cukor, Sam Wood; 1939; 95% Tomatometer)In terms of romantic films, all-time romantic films, I really like Gone With the Wind. And I realize I sound so clichéd saying that, but there’s something so absolutely romantic about it. When I watched the film, I wanted to be in a situation like that — to feel that love that’s just basically, it’s crazy; it’s that kind of a crazy love.Drive (Nicolas Winding Refn, 2011; 92% Tomatometer)Recently I really enjoyed watching Drive, even though people seemed to be very mixed about it. I thought it was a well-done film. A really well-done film.Ratatouille (Brad Bird, Jan Pinkava, 2007; 96% Tomatometer)Help me out here! Can I give you an all-time favorite animated film? An all-time animated favorite is Ratatouille. I do not know why, but that film about that rat really got me. I loved Lion King as a kid, but as a thinking animated film [Ratatouille] really has something that I like about it. I thought it was amazing. And Peter O’Toole’s voiceover as Anton Ego is just brilliant.Next, Pinto discusses working with director Tarsem Singh on Immortals, the challenges of acting in big-budget films and how performances differ across projects.&nbsp;This was your first really big-budget film — what drew you to it?Freida Pinto: It was actually Tarsem. I had never done a big-budget film before, so I was not sure what to expect and what not to expect, but that becomes partly the allure, as well — not knowing. You wanna know what it would be like to do a big-budget film. The way Tarsem sold the idea of the film in my first meeting with him — how he envisioned it and how he pictured it — was everything that I had, when I was a child and watched films that were larger than life, always imagined myself being in. So the way Tarsem sold it to me, the story he told me, it was like, “I need to see myself in that film.” And I hoped Tarsem saw me in that film as well.What were some of the films you thought wanting to be in, on that scale?From the recent past, I would think, the first thing that came to mind in terms of grandeur would be The Lord of the Rings, and Gladiator, in terms of the way he described the fight sequences. Harry Potter had some kind of influence as well — I mean they don’t really have anything in common, it was more the magic element of it that made me feel like I would want to be a part of it.Tarsem also has a very specific visual style. What’s it like working with him on set?He does. I think he’s so specific, visually. He’s so artistic that he knows how he wants his painting to look; but at the same time he is very much open and flexible to injecting things that he’s felt on the day, on the spot, into his scene, rather than being so specific and so stringent about it so as to not allow any freedom. That’s very nice. To have someone who has been given a palette to paint whatever picture he wants — and he knows what the boundaries are; he knows what story line he has to fit into — but to be able to splash those colors in ways different to how he’s done it earlier, or in ways no one has ever seen before, I think that truly is his gift. And I could see that happening on set as well. The amount of flexibility he gave us as actors in terms of performances was just absolutely amazing. If something happened by chance on set and that was not part of his idea initially, it made him realize, “Oh, that could be interesting,” and he would include that as well.Which is surprising, because the compositions in his films look so precise.There is a lot of precision in what he does; he knows what he’s going to do and it has to be to a “T,” you know, to the point.Coming from relatively small films with independent directors before Immortals, how does your performance change in a film like this? How does one prepare for a role as a mythological Greek oracle, anyway?[Laughs] I think with a role like this you have to come in with a lot more patience than when you go on to an independent project, ’cause on an independent project you have set hours that you’ve got to finish the filming in, and very little money — so you don’t have massive sets or anything like that. And with a film like this you’re not the only one on set. You’ve got to remind yourself that there are multiple things happening at the same time. One scene depends on 200-300 people working in tandem at that point in time, and if one of them doesn’t work you’ve gotta do it all over again — which seems like an enormous job to keep repeating over and over again.So it’s much more technical.It’s very, very technical. There’s a lot of performance aspect to it as well but it’s very technical. [Spoiler] I remember doing the scene where my sisters die. For almost two hours I was screaming and crying and losing my voice — actually it was more than two hours — but then I understood why I was doing it, because of the way they were shooting that scene from the different angles, with the wide shot and the 3D shot. There’s so much happening that you have to remember that you’ve gotta have patience and be able to pace your performance in such a way that you can deliver on every take. Working on big-budget films teaches you a lot about performing in an environment that is not necessarily for an actor.But you must have given a great crying performance, being so exhausted after so many takes.No, actually I was better in the first couple of takes. [Laughs] After that I was just like, “Aaaaaaaaaaaaarrrrrrgh!” and screaming for the heck of it.You’re filming on barely-there sets and blank screens, so what’s it like when you finally see the finished film, and yourself, in enormous 3D projection?So much bigger than what I expected it to be, you know. I think we all have different imaginations and Tarsem’s imagination is truly one that is unleashed. There is not the smallest, slightest boundary or limitation that I see to his imagination. So when he described that the shrine and the village was going to be at the edge of a cliff, I thought, a cliff, you can imagine that, but what lies beyond, and further out, was something that I could not imagine what?s gonna be there. But the way he’s put it out there in post-production is just magnificent.This is, what, your sixth film?In terms of filming, this was my fourth. Released, this would be my fifth.And in that time you’ve worked for Woody Allen, Julian Schnabel, Michael Winterbottom, Danny Boyle, Tarsem — you could almost retire at this point.No! [Laughs] I’m far from retirement!I’m kidding. I guess the question is, where to now? Do you like working on big-budget films?I do, I do. I like working on big budget films. The logic I use to explain to people is that I love being entertained by them, and I can see myself entertaining people doing the same thing; so why do I need to be afraid of taking on projects like that? That’s the reason I enjoy being on the sets of big-budget films and working on them. And honestly, in terms of performance, I don’t see that much of a difference. You have to come in with the same amount of conviction and dedication to your character.You’re also working with directors who each have very strong visions.I think that’s what it is. That’s exactly what makes the difference. Even working with Rupert Wyatt, the director on [Rise of the Planet of the] Apes, he came from a very independent film background, so one thing you knew for sure was not gonna happen was performances were not gonna get compromised. So that’s nice to have that feeling. What would I like to do next? I don’t know. It all really depends on what is written out there, you know; it’s a lot more difficult for people to write roles for minority actors. It’s not like I’m telling you anything new. So it’s going to be interesting to see wriggle my way into something that is not necessarily written for me.Immortals arrives in theaters this week.","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"dramedy, Character, 2017, cinematic, 72, Comics, Christmas, Films, fiction, tv, Wars","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Untitled-1.jpg","slug":"five-favorite-films-with-freida-pinto"},{"id":"47508848055611","title":"Five Favorite Films with Kermit the Frog (and Miss Piggy Too!)","content":"Five Favorite Filmsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Five Favorite Films with Kermit the Frog (and Miss Piggy Too!)The Muppet legends talk about their new movie and share crazy stories from their lengthy showbiz careers.by Tim Ryan | November 21, 2011 |  CommentsKermit the Frog and Miss Piggy have been big movie stars for many years, and now they’re back with The Muppets, which opens in theaters this week. In their latest big screen adventure, Kermit and Piggy are joined by Muppet superfan Walter, as well as non-Muppets Gary (Jason Segel) and Mary (Amy Adams), who help to get the whole gang back together for a wild televised variety show that may help them to save their old Muppet Theater from the wrecking ball. In interviews with Rotten Tomatoes, Kermit (performed by Steve Whitmire) and Miss Piggy (performed by Eric Jacobson) shared a few of their favorite films (spoiler: Miss Piggy prefers her own movies), and also talked about their craziest fans and their longevity in the movie business. Without further ado, let’s begin with Kermit the Frog’s Five Favorite Films:The Wizard of Oz (Victor Fleming, King Vidor, 1939; 100% Tomatometer)Kermit the Frog: Wow, do I have five favorite films? Well, I love The Wizard of Oz because of the rainbow; it’s kind of an inspiration for me. That’s a good one.The Rocky Horror Picture Show (Jim Sharman, 1975; 76% Tomatometer)Quite frankly, I really like The Rocky Horror Picture Show. It’s one of my favorites.What do you like about that one?Well, Tim Curry. And I’m sorry he got so typecast in that because he’s got such a broad range, but we worked with Tim in Muppet Treasure Island, and we actually sung some of those songs in between takes. Even in this movie we were singing them with Jason [Segel] and Amy [Adams].Vanilla Sky (Cameron Crowe, 2001; 40% Tomatometer)Five films, wow. What else? I love Vanilla Sky.You do?I love it. It’s so weird. It’s like what happens to me when I sit on a log and stare at the water too long. I love that one. I’m giving you strange answers, aren’t I?No, no, this is great. You watch a lot of movies, then.I do. I do, whenever I can.The Devil’s Advocate (Taylor Hackford, 1997; 67% Tomatometer)Ooh, I thought of one! The Devil’s Advocate.Really…The morals… I love that. I love that movie. That’s one of my other favorites. Al Pacino, he’s done a lot of stuff, but I think that’s his best role. I love it.Deliverance (John Boorman, 1972; 97% Tomatometer)I hesitate to say Deliverance, but I must say I like the banjo, so why don’t we go with that? It was shot down in the swamp, where I’m from, and I think there’s a pig scene, too, so there you go. We’re all set.Next, Kermit talks about working with Fozzie, his craziest fans, and how his family first got into show business.Rotten Tomatoes: I work for a website called Rotten Tomatoes.Kermit the Frog: I’m familiar. I love your website.I was wondering, Kermit… in your early days, did anyone throw rotten tomatoes at you?All the time, all the time. You’d be surprised how many rotten tomatoes actually grow in the swamp. They’re everywhere. It happens to all of us.I’m guessing Fozzy more than you, mostly.Yeah, that’s true, that’s true. It’s harder to clean Fozzy, too, so it’s tough. He’s furry.You seem to collaborate well with Fozzy. Did he want to write the whole script?Well, Fozzy always wants to. He always comes to me and he says, “Hey Kermit, I got a joke.” The problem is, when Fozzy writes a script, it’s all jokes. And most of them are kind of sour jokes. It’s the same with all the Muppets. Gonzo wants it to be all stunts, Piggy wants it to be all her… So I have to delicately, diplomatically rein in the troops.Do you know if Fozzy has had any contact with his elusive and mysterious comedy writer Gags Beasley?Oh, well, I think he and Gags are still in contact. You know, Gags has been around since The Muppet Show. Gags is now living in Queens, New York, and I think he and Fozzy still stay in contact.So he wasn’t like a script doctor or consultant?For this? Well… Don’t tell Jason and Nick [Stoller], but I think Fozzy probably let Gags have a pass.Are there any other good movies with frogs?Well, I just found out that some of my relatives were extras in, I believe, The Ten Commandments, when it rains frogs. That’s how we got our start in showbiz.Would you say that’s one of your favorites?Well, for the frogs, sure. Not that Charlton Heston isn’t wonderful.Do you get upset by the depiction of frogs in movies? Were you concerned, say, at the end of Magnolia, another movie with raining frogs?You know, I figure anything that gets the frogs work, go for it. It’s not easy being short, green, and getting a job in Hollywood.Right, but would you say that it’s gotten easier to be green?It has, it has. I am more comfortable in my skin. Environmentally — you know, that’s the other meaning of “green” these days — they sort of took that and ran with it. And being a frog, you know, I’m pretty close to the environment. I live in the swamp, so I have to make sure I don’t sprout extra limbs or grow two heads.At the beginning of the movie, you’re living in a mansion, but that’s just where your character lives, right?That was just an idea in the movie, really. It made the story a little bit better for Walter, because he comes to Hollywood, and if he finds me like that… You know, this is probably my most dramatic role to date. I’m kind of depressed a lot, and down, and serious, which is not exactly like me at all. Maybe I’ll change that if we do more movies. I’ll be more myself, you know.Do you ever miss your days as a reporter doing hard-hitting journalism on Sesame Street News?Yeah, that’s always fun. Every now and then — I still have the trenchcoat; it still fits, I can still button it — and every now and then I put it on, get out on the street, and interview folks for various things. Once in a while on Good Morning America, I’ll do stuff like that, you know. Because I inspired — he’s not there any more — but I inspired Charlie Gibson in his career, to be a reporter. I love that.Who’s the strangest person — from fairy tales or real life — you’ve ever met?Well, there’ve been a lot of strange ones. I think the fairy tale one was probably Rapunzel, which you can probably find on YouTube. Strangest real person? It’s a tossup between some of the rather strange celebrities and some of the fans. We have some strange fans out there, too. I mean, I love them, but yeah, they show up to events with me tattooed on their ankles. Stuff like that, which is kind of weird.In the movie, superfan Walter just had the watch with your face on it.Walter had the watch. Well, the watches are out there. But I actually had somebody ask me to sign their ankle when I got my star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, and then they ran across the street to a tattoo parlor and had my signature tattooed on their ankle.That really happened?True story.Could a frog get tattoos?A “tat?” A “too?” I think I’d rather call it a “too,” because I like doing my face that way. If I had one, I’d probably have to get it put on the bottom of my foot, because otherwise I’d have to put makeup on over it. I don’t know what I’d have tattooed on me. Maybe a copyright symbol. These days, it’s hard to say.You’ve inspired a lot of people over the years, and I noticed during the screening that there were a couple people who got a little misty-eyed.I hope it wasn’t my singing.Your singing was pretty good. Your banjo-playing was pretty good, too.Oh, good. Good, thank you.Do you hope to connect with a new generation?Yeah. It’s funny because, you know, part of the idea, obviously, for this film was to kind of reintroduce ourselves to the younger fans who haven’t seen us in a while. I have a feeling the parents are already doing that. You know, I think they’re probably digging out the old VHS and DVDs of The Muppet Show and showing them to their kids anyway.The Muppet Show seemed inspired by Ed Sullivan or vaudeville, and that seems kind of anachronistic these days, though not in a bad way. Do you think that the whole idea of, “Hey gang, let’s put on a show!” is timeless?I don’t know, I don’t know. Variety shows, you know, they sort of come and they go. It’s interesting, because when I look at something like American Idol, it has that competitive aspect, but it kind of is a big variety show. I think it’s always possible that if the acts are good enough, variety could make a comeback. Or, maybe if the acts are bad enough, in the Muppets’ case. If you think about us Muppets, there’s only about one place in show business where we can be successful, and that’s on our own show. You know, like Gonzo getting fired out of a cannon might not work elsewhere, but it works on our show. I think maybe we could bring it back, perhaps.We are a site that collects movie reviews, and I was worried that you might have thin skin about reviews, but then I realized that you’ve had to deal with Statler and Waldorf for years.Yeah, you can’t have thin skin with those guys in the box, that’s right. No, you know, I try not to… People sometimes ask me what my advice is to young people starting out, and I always say, “Never believe your own PR.” And it’s also, “Never pay too much attention to the reviews.” Sometimes they get it, sometimes they don’t. But that goes equally for those that are complimenting you, you know? You gotta be careful. You gotta just stay the course, and be true to yourself, I think, which is what I try to do. I think that’s part of the key to the Muppets anyway; we’re all pretty strong individual folks. Hopefully people identify with that.And you also seem to make room for other people, like Walter.True. We’re pretty welcoming. You know, when we did The Muppet Show we always had a cast of characters who were on every week, and then some of those background folks stuck around, and some of them didn’t. But I think Walter’s got a good start. We sort of pushed him right to the front on the first go. We have to find something else for him to do — I love him whistling – we have to find something else. He can’t just whistle. Gotta have a job, gotta put him to work.Kermit, it’s an honor to meet you.Same here, same here. I actually really do enjoy your website. It’s a wonderful thing.Wow, thank you! How do you type?I don’t. I don’t even have a computer. Usually when I’m in hotels, I can go to the business center. You can’t have a computer when you live in the swamp. You drop it once, that’s the end.Next, Miss Piggy shares her beauty secrets, and explains how she became such an outstanding martial artist.Miss Piggy, what are your favorite movies?Miss Piggy: I was going to say The Muppet Movie, The Great Muppet Caper, The Muppets Take Manhattan, and The Muppet Christmas Carol, and this movie. I also love Casablanca. It’s romantic, it’s the golden age of Hollywood. It’s where I truly belong. Don’t you think?Yes, you look great.I’m truly one of those faces that they don’t make any more.That’s true. You’ve been able to maintain a pretty good pig look for a long time. What’s your secret?Well, the truth is, pigs don’t really get wrinkles, and the reason they don’t is because, you know that stuff they inject into your face? To plump it up? That stuff comes from my people. Some people donate blood; my people donate dermal filler.I was also wondering, how did you learn to be such an expert martial artist?I was born doing a karate kick. That’s how I got out. But then I also studied at Master Chang’s Finishing School and Karate Dojo. I didn’t have a lot of money early on in my career, so I figured, “Why not? I’ll just spend it here and get two for one.”What was your journalistic philosophy when you were editing the magazine in France?You do realize that this is a movie we’re talking about. I wasn’t really an editor; I just played one in the movie. Just like I wasn’t really in Paris; that was a Hollywood backlot. Do you know how movies are made?No, I guess not. So you’re just putting on a performance?Yes, it is called “acting.” I understand I am such a brilliant actress, that……you made me think you were in France.Yes, I made you think I was in France, that I was actually an editor of a fashion magazine.You are a brilliant actress, but are you afraid of being typecast as Miss Piggy?I’m not afraid that that’s going to happen. I’m very pleased that it has happened. I’m sure there are many other actresses who would love to be typecast as moi, but it ain’t gonna happen because they’re not me.That’s true. So, when you started working on this movie, how did you get contacted? Did they call your agent? Did they call you directly?No, they sent a script to my people, and my people gave it to me. I read it — well, actually, I just thumbed through it and counted my lines — and when I saw how many lines I had, I said, “This is a part for moi. This is a part I was born to play.” The fact that the character’s name was Miss Piggy helped, too. I don’t really like to have to memorize another name to respond to on set; it’s just confusing to me. I don’t really like memorizing lines either, so that’s why I don’t actually read the script. I just make up my lines.So you do a lot of improvising? Did you study acting, or is this just how you’ve always been?I studied with……with Master Chang?Yes, well, he also had an acting class that I took. Then I also studied with “Stan Slavski.” You know Stan?The method acting guy, right?There must be a different Stan Slavski.So, Miss Piggy, are you ready to be a big star again?Well, moi has always been a big star. I’m really shooting for the solar system with this movie, actually. The world is just not big enough.I work for a movie review site. Do you ever read what critics say about you? Do you ever listen to them at all?If it’s good, yes. Are you about to say something nice about my performance?I thought you were excellent.Aww, that’s so sweet. But you’re just telling the truth. (pause) Is that it? Is that all the questions you got? You ran out of questions, huh?I’m just so dazzled by your amazingness.I’m so glad to sit here and talk with you, and I do hope you liked moi’s movie. Did you have a favorite part?It’s tough to say. I mean, with you? The part where all the Muppets showed up in your office in disguise as one giant Muppet, and you were appalled by your gullibility.Yeah, that was me exposing my vulnerability. I think that any good actress has to do that. They have to bare it all! That’s what I told Kermit early on, and he took it quite literally, and just never wore any clothes. It’s not what I meant, but hey, it works for me.How have you managed to maintain your working relationship, despite having very different personalities?We love each other very much, but things can get kind of tense on a set. We were not always seeing eye to eye, but it just made it all the better when we made up at the end of the day.The Muppets arrives in theaters this week.","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"awards, Sundance, Access, The, renewed, Christmas, History, Sony","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/sdf.jpg","slug":"five-favorite-films-with-kermit-the-frog-and-miss-piggy-too"},{"id":"47508848047415","title":"Five Favorite Films with Emile Hirsch","content":"Five Favorite Filmsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Five Favorite Films with Emile HirschThe star of The Darkest Hour shares five of his most-loved movies.by Luke Goodsell | December 20, 2011 |  CommentsWhether he’s piloting futuristic racing cars around a kaleidoscopic funhouse or perishing earnestly in the North American wilderness, Emile Hirsch has been steadily building a solid acting resume that surely hints of some great work to come. And though he’s been relatively quiet since roles in Gus van Sant’s Milk and Ang Lee’s Taking Woodstock, the young actor is set to return with a bunch of new films, the first of which — opening in theaters this week — is the sci-fi action thriller The Darkest Hour, the debut feature for visual effects expert-turned-director Chris Gorak, produced by Timur Bekmambetov. Hirsch stars, alongside Olivia Thirlby, as a young American traveler in Moscow who finds himself pitted against a deadly, literally electric invasion by power-hungry aliens. Well now, that’s not good for tourism, Timur. We had a chance to chat with Hirsch recently, where he obliged us with his five favorite films… and an impromptu exegesis of Terrence Malick.A Streetcar Named Desire (Elia Kazan, 1951; 98% Tomatometer)This’ll be my five favorite films of this moment. I really love A Streetcar Named Desire. With Streetcar Named Desire, and On the Waterfront — those are like the Brando movies that I think are so essential to the growth of film acting in general; I mean, Brando came along and changed the game.The Matrix (Larry Wachowski and Andy Wachowski, 1999; 87% Tomatometer)The Matrix was just such an incredible cinematic experience. I saw it when I was 13, in the cinema. I didn’t know anything about it — I hadn’t seen the trailer. It just blew my mind. I didn’t know anything about it when I first saw it. And I was lucky enough to be able to work with the Wachowskis later, years later, on Speed Racer, which I had a great time on.Raging Bull (Martin Scorsese, 1980; 98% Tomatometer)Raging Bull was just an incredible performance by Robert De Niro. A great, you know, show of discipline by an actor. And Martin Scorsese… visually, it was just so cool.The Usual Suspects (Bryan Singer, 1995; 89% Tomatometer)The Usual Suspects was Bryan Singer’s masterpiece. It was such a great ensemble and such a smartly-told film. The twist at the end was just fantastic. That movie kicked so much ass.The English Patient (Anthony Minghella, 1996; 83% Tomatometer)The English Patient I saw when I was really young, and the love story just devastated me, I think. You know, I was just sobbing. I loved it. Beautiful images. Something that can evoke that much emotion out of me — I was just really moved. So those are five that just come straight to the surface. You must get all kinds of people naming these obscure-ass movies though, right?Most people tend to be pretty honest; unless they’re, you know—Trying to be assh—s. [Laughs] Did you see The Tree of Life?Yeah, I loved it.I thought it was amazing. All the shots of the bacteria, when you see them bubbling for the first time, all the gasses and the fluid. And you see the little helixes swimming toward the surface together. I thought that was so amazing.I could’ve watched that sequence for two hours.Yeah. People were complaining about the cosmos shots and the life shots but I found that infinitely great. It’s such a good film. So beautifully shot and acted. Another thing I really loved about it was the way in which you see the evolution of innocence to experience with these young boys, and how these young boys kind of become a metaphor for the human race; of how our species is just naturally corrupted with time. You’re born good but you eventually see this dark side as you get older; like when the boys get together and they’re killing things — it’s not that they’re raised wrong, it just happens naturally. And then [the movie’s] like trying to go back to that state of grace, you know? I loved that movie. What do you think that doorway represented? Cause it keeps cutting back to that doorway. I think it represented the transition from life to death, but the reason it’s on the beach — it’s the solitary doorway — is because there’s no real difference: death, in a certain sense, is an illusion of change. You’re still in the same area — it’s like you can pass through this manifest doorway but you’re still in the exact same area as you were before.The Darkest Hour opens in theaters this week.","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"Heroines, Witch, Amazon, &, Rom-Com, Amazon, story, Winter, Awards, e., Set, Comedy","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/xzv.jpg","slug":"five-favorite-films-with-emile-hirsch"},{"id":"47508849293635","title":"Five Favorite Films with Bruce Robinson","content":"Five Favorite Filmsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Five Favorite Films with Bruce RobinsonPlus, The Rum Diary director on adapting Hunter S. Thompson, returning to Hollywood, and how Johnny Depp lured him out of retirement.by Luke Goodsell | October 24, 2011 |  CommentsIf British writer-director Bruce Robinson had only made one film — 1987’s inimitable comedy Withnail &amp; I — he would have been assured a place in the annals of cult movie history. And it very nearly became the case, too. Having finished his follow-up, 1989’s overlooked but frequently brilliant satire How to Get Ahead in Advertising (again starring Withnail‘s Richard E. Grant), Robinson took his talent to Hollywood and had such a wretched experience on his first studio picture, Jennifer 8 (1992), that he vowed never to direct a film again.When the combined forces of Hunter S. Thompson and Johnny Depp came calling, however, Robinson found himself being made an offer he couldn’t refuse. The result is The Rum Diary, a long-gestating passion project for Depp instigated when he and Thompson unearthed an unpublished manuscript from the late gonzo icon’s early years as a writer. Functioning as a companion piece — and a prequel, of sorts — to Terry Gilliam’s (screw the critics) classic Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, The Rum Diary explores Thompson (via his proxy, journalist Paul Kemp) in his formative period as a journalist, as he begins to find his authorial voice in a haze of barmy booziness.We sat down with Robinson to talk about the challenge of bringing Thompson’s novel to the screen, the weirdness of being back in Hollywood, and how Depp — who previously tried to bait Robinson to direct Fear and Loathing — finally lured him into taking on this job. But first, kick back with some lighter fluid and enjoy Robinson’s five favorite films.The Gold Rush (Charlie Chaplin, 1925; 100% Tomatometer)The first one is The Gold Rush, by Charlie Chaplin. It’s the apogee of his genius. I saw that film when I was 11 or 12 years old in a cinema in Ramsgate, Kensington, and there were three people in there with me. Nothing has ever made me laugh as much as that. I remember, literally — in those days they used to have a velvet kind of cover over the balcony — and I remember hanging over and laughing at the sheer f–king brilliance of the comedy in that film. The one I saw was just black-and-white, too; this was before Chaplin put a voice-over on it, which I don’t enjoy — I don’t think it serves the film well. There are certain things in there, you know — around cooking and survival and stuff — that kind of are in my soul now, as someone who tries to tell stories too.Bicycle Thieves (Vittorio de Seca, 1948; 96% Tomatometer)The second one is Bicycle Thieves, by De Sica. That was the most moving film I’ve ever seen. The scene in there where the dad has lost his bicycle and he takes his kid out for a pizza in 1948 Rome, and the kid is eating it but he’s not ’cause he can’t afford to pay for it, is one of the all-time most moving scenes I’ve ever seen in a cinema. It’s an amazing film.Psycho (Alfred Hitchcock, 1960; 99% Tomatometer)The third is Psycho. The reason that Psycho is the most extraordinary film to me is the mood in that movie and the fact — and it’s kind of a cliché to say it — that we’re following this woman’s story and suddenly it’s ruptured and she’s dead: What the f–k have we got left? I don’t know a moodier or better kind of horror film. It’s the darkest movie ever made, for me. It’s quite remarkable.Dog Day Afternoon (Sidney Lumet, 1975; 97% Tomatometer)The fourth one, which is kind of a weird one, is Dog Day Afternoon. Because of Al Pacino’s performance. He has a line in there — maybe it’s his line, maybe it’s the screenwriter’s line — he says “Kiss me, kiss me,” to the cops, “I liked to be kissed when I’m getting f–ked.” It’s one of the all-time great lines in cinema.All the President’s Men (Alan J. Pakula, 1976; 100% Tomatometer)All the President’s Men, because of my hero, William Goldman, who wrote that film. Here we’re sitting in the dark watching a movie and we all know what the denouement is — we all know how this film’s going to end up; they’re going to bust Nixon’s ass — and yet we’re on the edge of our seats all the way through that movie. Of course, it’s Pakula’s fantastic direction and these fabulous actors at the height of their career — Hoffman and Redford — but primarily it’s William Goldman, who managed to write a film where we all know what’s gonna happen, and yet we’re compelled to watch this process. Imagine if, in Psycho, the title sequence was Perkins putting on his wig and robe, so we all know it’s him — that’s the problem Goldman had to deal with. We all knew it was Nixon. And yet he managed to pull it off. Blew me away, that film. The performances, and the writing… who was that actor who played the editor? Jason Robards. He tells them to go after it. I wish the press would behave like that today, you know: “Go after these f–kwits, and nail them.”Next, we have a wide-ranging chat with Robinson about The Rum Diary, adapting Thompson’s book, his return to directing and working with star-producer Depp.&nbsp;Bruce Robinson: Would you like a beer?RT: I would but this could get swiftly out of hand. But please, by all means enjoy yourself.Well I will. And I don’t care if they f–king carry me down [to the press conference], frankly. I’m so jet-lagged. It’s such a weird process [doing interviews] but I know you’ve gotta do it. It’s just, you know, if someone asks you to describe your movie you only know so many things, and I’m gonna start speaking Korean very soon to explain this movie. [Laughs.]Fair enough. [Laughs] You talked about your love for All the President’s Men and those journalists going after the “bastards” — was that a theme that drove you in writing and shooting The Rum Diary?Well, not entirely. When Hunter wrote The Rum Diary he had no idea he was going to become “Hunter Thompson” and gonzo and all the rest of the stuff, but subsequent to that one’s able to read all of Hunter’s stuff and the way he did go after them. He was a rageful man. He didn’t use bullets, he used words, which is a fantastic thing to be able to do — and he had the talent to do it. So there’s a line at the back of the film where Johnny has essentially found his voice, and he says, “I make a promise to the reader… I’m going after them, and it’ll be a voice made of ink and rage.” And when he loses, which he does at the end of the film — they f–k him up — he says “I smell ink.” That, to me, was something to do with Hunter, in the best way I could do it, anyway, with all faults.Hunter and Johnny apparently took delight in hauling you out of retirement. So once they’d gotten you to write the script, how did they lure you into the director’s chair? Was Hunter still alive at this point — did you meet him?I met him once around 20 years ago, and we didn’t have anything to say to each other.Why was that?I don’t know. I went into the [Chateau] Marmont hotel and he was there and we sat in a room, like you and me, for two hours and we never said a word to each other. He had a wet towel on his head.Were you daunted?Pretty much. I was a fan and he was an icon. He had all of his equipment — the coke, the grass, the Chivas Regal, the smokes and stuff. And anyway, I sat there for two hours, as close as I am to you, and we never said a word to each other. And then I said, “Okay Hunter, I’m off.” “Okay.” And I left. So that was the end of that. But Johnny has told me that Hunter was a big fan of Withnail &amp; I and he liked watching that, which is the reason that he and Johnny chose me as the writer for this film. I don’t write like Hunter but I do write in the same kind of vernacular, you know, no jokes, but hopefully comedic rage — which is one of my motors, ’cause I’m f–king angry about so many things but I like comedy. That was the reason Johnny said, “Will you write it?” I wrote it, and then he said, to my astonishment, “Will you direct it?” My answer was “No.” And then he sort of went after me. [Laughs]Because at the time you were still very—Tender.And Johnny had been after you to do Fear and Loathing before that.That’s right. I said “No.” It was in the Sunset Marquee Hotel. He said, “You’re gonna direct this.” “No, I’m f–king not!” And I didn’t, and wouldn’t, and couldn’t.Are you glad you didn’t make it?It would have been a very different film if I had done it. It would have been a very different film. Terry Gilliam is someone I admire tremendously, but I wouldn’t have done it like that. I’d have made it much dirtier and wouldn’t have tried to make it look like a Ralph Steadman. Terry made a great film, you know, and people love Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas. But there wasn’t enough time, when Johnny was talking to me there wasn’t enough time for me to have a look at the script. I can only do what I can do.How did Johnny sell you on directing The Rum Diary?He bullied the sh-t out of me. [Laughs] He bullied me, and he also wooed me. He bullied me in the sweetest imaginable way, and he bullied me with really good quality wine. And finally I just thought, well here’s the world’s number one film star, if he wants to take that kind of risk he can have who he wants. If he wants that kind of risk, f–k it — I’m 65-years-old, you know, I don’t give a f–k. So I said, “Okay, I’ll do it.”Did you enjoy returning to directing?I loved it.Because it was the right environment?Because of him [Depp]. He’s a very powerful figure in this industry, and if Johnny is looking after you — if Johnny is saying, “Hey, stay off — he’s alright” — then you’re in the most protected and prestigious position you can be in as a film director, because you’ve got this major f–king star looking after you. If it hadn’t worked out very well, god knows it might have been a f–king bloodbath. [Laughs]&nbsp;Are you happy with how the film turned out?Have you seen it?I have. I’m a fan of the book and I was unsure going in to it — the trailer gives it an uneasy sense of it being a “wacky” sort of bender.Which it isn’t. It’s a serious film.It must have been a hard book to adapt, especially streamlining Hunter’s characters as you did.Yeah, we had to do that. We had to throw Yeamon overboard, because there were two leads in [the novel]. So I made a couple of changes. Johnny’s the reason the film’s being made, and you can’t have two people playing Hunter S. Thompson — and Hunter cut himself into two characters [Kemp and Yeamon, in the novel]. Did we want two Hunters for the film? No. And I shifted the girl [Chenault, played by Amber Heard] from Yeamon, who’s gone, onto Sanderson [Aaron Eckhart], which ups the dramatic ante of the film I think. I’m very pleased with it. I think it’s funny. There are some very funny sequences.It’s funny, but not in a way that the trailer leads you to expect it to be funny. It’s comedy that evolves not from jokes but from—From the environment.Right. I mean, Giovanni Ribisi was just in that world.He’s fantastic. Giovanni was taking — in a sense we all were — incredible risks, ’cause he was right on the edge.There seems to be a hint of Withnail in his performance.Quite strongly, actually. I remember saying to [actor] Ralph Brown when we did Withnail — I knew this hairdresser, who was a hairdresser of a girlfriend that I was living with, and [affects Brown’s dopey geezer drawl] “she used to talk like that” and she’d say to me, “Do you understand? Do yoooooooou? ” She was the thickest f–king idiot I’ve ever met. When Ralph came along to play Danny the Dealer, I only said it to him once, that “Do you understand, maaaaan? Is it cool with you?” and he picked up on that instantly. It was the same with Giovanni. He’s kind of like that, you know — he got it, and made it his own.Did you and Johnny discuss how Hunter’s “Paul Kemp” voice, or lack thereof, would evolve into hints of his “Raoul Duke” persona over the course of the film?Well, I mean Johnny kind of did it organically, in that the only time he starts kind of getting into a Hunter voice is… I needed a catharsis in the film, so I cooked up that f–king acid scene, to say this was five, six years of Hunter coming through that religious lobster that was [saying] “god, now I’ve found the voice!” Of course it isn’t the f–king lobster talking, it’s Johnny/Hunter talking — when he talks about god and “Does the world belong to no one but you?” And then Johnny spontaneously, because he’s a f–king amazing actor, puts it into the typewriter: “I make a promise to the reader.” And if you see his fingers — in Fear and Loathing he’s typing like this [gesticulates with exaggerated fingers], which is insane, but nevertheless it’s a caricature — but here he kind of [moves fingers somewhat less wildly]. “I make a promise to the reader, it will be a voice made of ink and rage,” and Hunter’s starting to come out of his mouth. I thought it was f–king magic when he was doing that. That’s nothing to do with me, that’s him.I don’t think it’s remarked upon enough, but Johnny Depp is one of the great finger actors of all time.I know. I was constantly trying to shut that down. [Laughs]You had to curb those fingers?Only a tiny bit. I wanted him to be still and keep the faith of his power on screen. Why is he a film star? He sticks to the celluloid like f–king glue, Johnny Depp. You could stay there for 10 minutes, you know, just on his face, and people would watch it. We had this running joke and he actually used it in that Pirates film. I work in the middle of nowhere in England, this 16th-century house, and I came out of my writing room one night at about midnight when my family were away; and as I came out of the door I saw this huge black boot come down on the top step, and I went like that [flails hands in front of him], running up and down — I thought it was Jack the Ripper. I’m writing a book on Jack the Ripper, have been for 10 years. And I did that and it really amused Johnny, so he used it in Pirates. But there are a couple in [The Rum Diary]; he does one or two of those.It does conjure that sense of what his “Hunter” would become.Yeah. He moves through that film. I wanted him to become more… he becomes an active motor drive of the narrative in the third act, but he’s [initially] an observer in this film; I mean you get that, when you’re watching it. He’s observing this weird f–king life that he?s slowly becoming absorbed into. And that’s quite a tender thing; slowly making him into the power. “I smell ink,” he says. [Pauses] Am I talking bullsh-t?No, of course not. You feel that he’s taking it all in.And he becomes the power at the end of the film. When he says it’ll be a voice of ink and rage, he says you’ll smell it: “It’ll be the smell of bastards and the smell of truth.” For me, and for Johnny, there Hunter Thompson was now born.The Rum Diary is in theaters this week.","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"Columbia, singing, King, Pictures, Stephen, Musicals, witnail, Video, movies, Emmys, star, Kids","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/bb.jpg","slug":"five-favorite-films-with-bruce-robinson"},{"id":"47508849295684","title":"Five Favorite Films with Paul Bettany","content":"Five Favorite Filmsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Five Favorite Films with Paul BettanyThe Margin Call star talks Occupy Wall Street and busking before acting.by Tim Ryan | October 21, 2011 |  CommentsFrom vengeance-obsessed priests to tennis pros, from English naturalists to sentient computers, Paul Bettany has played a wide range of characters in his big-screen career. In his latest, Margin Call, Bettany plays a high-rolling investment banker whose company is on the verge of collapse — an internal crisis that just might take the whole economy down with it. In an interview with Rotten Tomatoes, Bettany shared his favorite films, and also discussed Occupy Wall Street, why he (sort of) empathizes with bankers, and the difference between busking and filmmaking.&nbsp;In the Name of the Father (Jim Sheridan, 1993; 95% Tomatometer)There’s so much to like about it. Really brilliant script. I think it’s an amazingly directed movie. It’s the real trick of that movie, to come out feeling that you’re Irish and hate the English, especially when you’re English, which I am. [laughs] It is one of the most exquisite performances of all time. I saw it when I was a student of acting, and there was lots of people to admire; there was Robert De Niro, and there was Al Pacino, and here was an English person, making such a complete and visceral transformation in character that you just went, “Oh my God, we’re allowed to do that sort of thing, too?” That felt really empowering.Brief Encounter (David Lean, 1945; 86% Tomatometer)Brief Encounter, I think, is just an exquisite movie. I think I see it at least once a year. It’s a Noel Coward and David Lean movie, and it’s so ahead of its time in so many ways. Visually, it’s ahead of its time. Oh my God, it’s like a piece of music. That sequence of lines in it, when they’re out in the countryside, and he says, “Are you cold, darling?” And she says, “No, not really.” He says, “Are you happy?” And she says, “No, not really.” It’s f—ing heartbreaking. I mean, it pulls every string; it’s beautiful. And it’s also a movie that’s… the first movie I can think of — maybe I’m wrong — where a woman has an affair and is the hero of the piece, and isn’t vilified by the piece. The husband is not evil; you know, the husband is kind of wonderful , and at the end he says, “You’ve been so very far away, and I’m glad you’ve come home,” and all of that. It’s just beautiful.Raging Bull (Martin Scorsese, 1980; 98% Tomatometer)Raging Bull. I defy anybody to point out one thing that’s wrong with it. It’s just perfect. There’s nothing in that movie that could be cut out that would make it better. It just feels so lean and perfect. Every moment doesn’t lose sight of what it’s about, you know? Every shot is animal. It’s amazing. Although I think it’s really hard to do jealousy, because jealousy’s a bit like seasickness in that it’s awful if it’s happening to you but f—ing funny to watch. You know, somebody puking off the side of a boat or somebody being jealous, you look like such a moron, but if it’s happening to you, and you’re jealous, it’s f—ing appalling. Somehow, in that movie, what it pulls off is, it’s never funny. It’s just f—ing awful, he’s just an animal, and it’s the threat of violence the whole time. It’s amazing and beautiful.Prick Up Your Ears (Stephen Frears, 1987; 100% Tomatometer)Prick up Your Ears, Gary Oldman. Great movie. That is another extraordinary performance that feels so total and complete, you know?It’s A Wonderful Life (Frank Capra, 1946; 95% Tomatometer)I love that movie. Again, what’s wrong with that movie? Not a f—ing lot, right? Really lean piece of socialist storytelling that’s just gorgeous.Next, Bettany talks about Occupy Wall Street, why he (sort of) empathizes with bankers, and the difference between busking and filmmaking.&nbsp;RT: In Margin Call, your character, Will Emerson, has a speech at the end where he’s talking about how, if the banks keep making money, everybody’s happy and no one asks any questions, but if they fail, it’s all their fault. Do you empathize with that? Because essentially, you’re giving voice to the banker in that case.Paul Bettany: Well, here’s the thing. What I like about [Will] is that he’s very conscious of who he is. He’s very aware. He doesn’t think he’s a nice man, and he doesn’t think he’s a particularly fair man. I don’t think he thinks life is fair. I think he sees life as a sporting event. He wants to be first to the punch, but if he gets clipped on the chin, he’s not going to whine about it in the corner saying, “He hit me!” And those aren’t my feelings, and they’re not my politics, but I admire being that clear and honest about who you are, you know? A bit of it that I do understand and do think about is, you know, we’ve been f—ing the third world for hundreds of years, and nobody’s batting an eyelid about it. It’s only when it came home [laughs] and bit us on the ass that people kind of got livid. I guess that’s his point; he doesn’t like the hypocrisy of it all. So I understand that.You know, I met these people [bankers]. I went to meet these people, and the problem with meeting people is you’re immediately faced with a human being, and you can’t just judge them as a villain any longer. They’re very bright, clever, imaginative people. Zachary Quinto plays a guy from MIT, and these companies, they go to MIT and they lure young — in this case — rocket scientists away from rocket science. And what would the world look like if that mind was being put to work in building f—ing rockets, you know what I mean?So on one level, I also think it’s a sort of tragedy about wasted minds and intellect, but also — and I think this is a really important thing to realize — it is a waste of everybody’s time. People are sort of begging for blood, but it is a waste of time to sort of look at individuals. Asking a merchant banker not to be greedy is like asking a lion to settle down and stop eating meat. [laughs] You know, it’s not in their nature; it’s their job description. They get rewarded, the more money and wealth that they corral for their firm. So, what needs to happen, surely, is… Perhaps our time would be better spent pointing the finger at government and saying there should be tighter regulations on these people, and the onus is on the government to leash or muzzle Wall Street, because they can’t f—ing do it themselves.If the characters in this movie were just evil, cigar-chomping plutocrats, or if they were heroes, it wouldn’t work. The fact that these are real people adds a certain power to the whole thing.Yeah, I think so. It’s just too reductive. It’s too reductive. And, you know, on the outside, I’ve read magazine articles where people are being reductive about the protests, saying, “Well, you know, only seven percent were able to answer the question ‘What was the Glass-Steagall Act?’ and only four percent really understood the Volcker Rule.” Well, you know what? Anybody would be hard pressed to understand the Volcker Rule because it hasn’t been enacted yet, and you’re missing the point. The point is, people feel angry, and in 2000 a band-aid was put across a gaping wound, and it was still hemorrhaging. So, to sort of point fingers and say, “They don’t understand the world of finance”… You don’t have to have a PhD in Economics to realize you’ve been taking it in the seat for years. They should be heard; people should hear if people are f—ing livid. They’re livid. They’ve got a right to be livid, and it’s so great that we live in a world where you can take to the streets without being shot down.Shifting gears slightly, I noticed you play a lot of roles in which you’re a spiritual warrior — I’m thinking Priest, Legion, and The Da Vinci Code. Is there something about that that appeals to you? You said earlier that you liked that your character in Margin Call wasn’t a hypocrite; do you like characters that sort of see things in black and white?No, I don’t. I think, conversely, I sort of see the job of my life being a process of becoming less judgmental as I get older. That’s what I want to do. Acting has so many vain and awful things about it, but one of the really edifying things about it is you can, at times, get the opportunity to put yourself imaginatively in another human being’s position and try to see things from their perspective. I see that as a real gift, and I hope that this is part of making me a better human being, whatever that f—ing means. But I mean it, you know? I do at least mean it. I really want to make films that I care about, and this film really sparked an awakening in me, just remembering all of the reasons I initially wanted to be an actor. It was just a fantastic experience. Seventeen days, we shot this f—ing movie; it was just unbelievable. It was an unbelievable comradely experience, and I hanker after it. You know, I’ve been on jobs that were seven months long, and I have many more memories of this job than those.Speaking about going back to when you wanted to be an actor, before you made it into the movies, you were a street musician. Is there anything about that job that prepares you for acting in the movies?Jesus, I don’t know. I’ve never given it much thought. No… No, I don’t know. I don’t know. Maybe, in that you’re… I don’t know, man! I can’t answer that question. It’s a really good one, but one that I can’t actually answer without giving it proper thought.I thought there might be something similar about playing off an audience, but I guess in the movies, it’s not quite the same thing.Well, it’s interesting. You know, I was able to look at a group of kids that were sitting on the stairs when I used to busk, which is play music, and I’d be able to judge whether they were French or, you know, what their nationality was. So if they were French, I would think, “Well, the Cure are huge in France, so I’ll play a bunch of Cure songs.” So I suppose in sort of recognizing what your audience wants, but I say that with trepidation because I’m not sure we should necessarily give the audience what they want. [laughs] You know what I mean? We live in a world where you make a film — you spend two years in development, and then you spend six months in prep, then you shoot it for four months, and then spend another year editing it, and then you take it to a small town outside San Diego and show it to 60 teenagers, and then change your movie depending on what they say. I’m lost. Now you’ve lost me, because, you know, every 16-year-old boy is going to say, “I think it should be a bit more like Underworld,” you know what I mean? Should we then make every film a bit more like Underworld? I’m not sure that that’s a great way to go about creating new stuff.Margin Call opens in theaters this week.","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"documentary, Pictures, VH1, Network, Golden, Poppins, tv, renewals, language, Certified, Musicals, LGBT, true, dark","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/vxcv.jpg","slug":"five-favorite-films-with-paul-bettany"},{"id":"47508878974535","title":"Memento, The Iron Giant, Blazing Saddles and More Certified Fresh Picks on Netflix and Amazon Prime This Week","content":"Now Streamingvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Memento, The Iron Giant, Blazing Saddles and More Certified Fresh Picks on Netflix and Amazon Prime This Weekby RT Staff | March 7, 2017 |  CommentsAs usual, Netflix and Amazon Prime released a whole bunch of new titles at the beginning of the month, so we’ve combed through them to bring you the best of the bunch, from a Christopher Nolan thriller and an animated treat to a horror classic, a modern Woody Allen triumph, and the first three Jurassic Park movies.

Favorite Films with Gary OldmanPlus, the star of Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy on his unusual performance -- and just why he feels a little smug about the movie's success.by Luke Goodsell | December 13, 2011 |  CommentsAs the movie industry plunges into the annual self-congratulatory farce of awards season, pause to consider this: Gary Oldman has never been nominated for an Academy Award. No, really — we checked. Not even a lousy Golden Globe. That may be about to change for the great British actor, however, whose unusually quiet (and seemingly effortless) performance as John le Carré’s enigmatic George Smiley in Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy has critics finally predicting a Best Actor nomination. Not that he needs it. Over a nearly-30-year career Oldman has delivered some of cinema’s most electrifying performances, in films like Sid and Nancy, Dracula, Prick Up Your Ears, True Romance, Léon and State of Grace, plus given invaluable supporting turns in blockbusters (Harry Potter, Nolan’s Batman) that would be all the poorer without him. We sat down with the surprisingly soft-spoken actor recently for a chat about playing the “jazzy” Smiley versus his “rock-n-roll” characters, why it’s conventional industry wisdom not to make adult dramas — and how the success of this particular one is so satisfying as a result. First up, here are Oldman’s five favorite films.Apocalypse Now (Francis Ford Coppola, 1979; 99% Tomatometer)Well, three Coppola movies. The list changes, but I always hold the three Coppola movies. Apocalypse Now — the sheer grandeur of it, and the originality of it.The Conversation (Francis Ford Coppola, 1974; 98% Tomatometer)I love Gene Hackman in The Conversation. I love that internal man who’s just, you know, very closed down.The Godfather: Part II (Francis Ford Coppola, 1974; 98% Tomatometer)With these three [Coppola’s] a great storyteller. Godfather: Part II, I just think it’s a master class in acting, production design, directing, lighting, composition. I think that if you were a film student, you’ve got — the way he tells the story, it’s masterful storytelling. And it never ever seems to disappoint.Badlands (Terrence Malick, 1973; 99% Tomatometer)I love Badlands because, I think, I like the interior — I love the story told through Sissy Spacek’s character. I think the telling of it is delicate. It’s just exquisite, that sense of the relationship seen through her; as if she’s telling one story and we’re witnessing another.Ratcatcher (Lynne Ramsay, 1998; 84% Tomatometer)Switching from that to a small indie movie, a Lynne Ramsay movie called Ratcatcher — I just think it’s a masterful piece of filmmaking. I mean, there’s Taxi Driver, there’s Raging Bull… there’s even — I love King of Comedy. Then there’s Kubrick; the list goes on and on. So there’s many, many, many — but off the top of my head, that would be five.Next, Oldman on “putting on” his character forTinker Tailor Soldier Spy and the satisfaction in being a part of a successful adult thriller.&nbsp;It’s interesting you mention The Conversation, and the interior nature of Gene Hackman’s performance as Harry Caul. Was the insularity of George Smiley something that appealed to you, given you’re well known, at least in the US, for more brash, extroverted roles?Gary Oldman: Yeah. Well, you’ve got such a great piece of writing — it nearly always comes down to that. I always think that if you break a sweat you’re working too hard, and you’re often trying to support the material — you’re holding it up with the pyrotechnics, or just technique. Here, you always felt that you were so supported by a great text — and the subtext, the book — that you felt that you could bring it with you. It lived with you, and you could bring it to a scene. So, where obviously they’ve had to throw out 300 pages of this book and reduce a scene to a composition and four lines and a look, you always felt that you were never out there like a cork on the water, you know. You had a base, a story, a life that you could always bring to a scene. In essence, it’s telling the story in a very shorthand way.[Long pause] You know, you often, as an actor, with those sort of emotional, kinetic parts that you play, there’s a cloud that sort of comes over your day. You get to work in the morning and it’s almost as if you’re at the base of a mountain, and you’re looking at the peak and you think, “I’ve got to get there today.” And you’re digging and going to the well of whatever it is to find it, and it’s like rock-n-roll, you know — you gotta burn from the first bar, and just explode. With Smiley, it’s more like jazz: you kind of get to the solo — but you find it. [Other roles] would always haunt me. “Terrify” is not the right word; you’d just get in there and look at that peak and go, [deep breath] “I’ve gotta pull something out of the bag today — I’ve gotta go to a place.” I loved George because, in a way, all that work — whatever emotional terrain you had to navigate — it was all done before you get there. It was somewhat of a relief for me as an actor.It’s a very different approach for you, then.Yeah, to be able to just sort of put on that suit — to sort of “put him on,” and then just rest back in a chair.Did you look at Alec Guinness’s performance as Smiley at all?I only remember it from television in ’79.&nbsp;How much of the performance is, as you say, “putting him on” — choosing the right glasses, getting the hair right?Well the silhouette that you see, when you look in the mirror, is very important — because there’s a physicality to it, how you put a person together and find him. First of all you’ve got the book; you know, it was really one-stop shopping, because it was the book, the script and le Carré, who we had access to if we wanted. So I spoke to him. He had been in MI5, and anything that I wanted to know in and around the book, I could just ask him questions about what Smiley would have done and what he was like in the field. So we’re seeing, in a way, all these scenes sort of start in the middle; there’s life that you can actually bring to it before they say action. [Director] Tomas [Alfredson] sent me a photograph of Graham Green in the ’40s, looking rather suave with a cigarette and a Mackintosh, and he liked the image of him; and that was sort of the beginning of the shape, or the silhouette of Smiley. If the material is good, all the clues are there. It really does come down to how good it is. And it’s subtextual, because it’s grown-up stuff — it’s adult drama. I’m rather happy that we’ve had a success with this film [in the UK] and we’re riding in on that wave. We’re coming in on a wave of box-office success, and it’s the third rail, you know — adult drama is the live rail that you’re not supposed to touch. There’s this sort of unchallenged industry wisdom nowadays where they say, “Oh, you can’t do adult drama,” “People don’t like it,” and “There’s no audience for it.”That’s pretty alarming. Do you hear it often?Yeah, you hear this. It’s very hard to get money. “What’s it about? Hmmm, I don’t know. I don’t know whether you can get that financed.” And so much so that, I mean, [Tinker Tailor producers] Working Title, who have sort of a deal with Universal — they have a first-look deal — didn’t want to do this movie [at first], and for obvious reasons. It’s a bit of a gamble. It doesn’t pander to Bond and Bourne and those types of movies. There’s no gunfire, really, in it, or explosions. It’s a very sort of slow-paced thriller.Which is why it’s so great that it has been a success at the box-office.Well yeah… and I feel kind of a little smug about it.I think you’re completely entitled to.Yeah, and I have no horse in the race. It’s not like I’ve got a percentage or a back-end and things if it does well. I don’t see any money from that. It’s just satisfying.[Executive producer Douglas Urbanski wanders into the room]Don’t you think it’s satisfying that people in the UK went and saw this movie? All those f-ckers that said, “Don’t make adult drama.”Douglas Urbanski: Oh, it’s the third rail! We’re not supposed to make adult films. We never knew if one person was gonna buy a ticket, or ten, or one hundred. And they tend to think — especially when it comes to America — that the press and the critics and the audience are gonna be stupid. We don’t know the answer to that ’til it opens. But if the adult drama is to survive, you know — they’re impossible to finance.GO: Yeah, I was just saying; they’re impossible.Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy is in theaters now.","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"PlayStation, BAFTA, sag, dark","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/asf.jpg","slug":"five-favorite-films-with-gary-oldman"},{"id":"47508848058684","title":"Five Favorite Films (Plus Four More!) with Joshua Leonard","content":"Five Favorite Filmsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Five Favorite Films (Plus Four More!) with Joshua LeonardThe star/writer/director of indie dramedy The Lie gives honest appraisals.by Joshua Leonard | November 16, 2011 |  CommentsIt’s hard to make a list like this, because invariably my first thought is “What’s gonna make me sound cool?” Using this method, I’d have to include at least one obscure Romanian silent film from the 1930s that no one but Leonard Maltin and Quentin Tarantino has ever heard of.If, on the other hand, I were to tell you about the films that have had the greatest personal impact on me (a white kid from the suburbs who grew up in the ’80s and ’90s), it would be as follows:The Breakfast Club (John Hughes, 1985; 91% Tomatometer)Oh, John Hughes…(sigh). A producer friend of mine was recently talking about his teenage daughter and said “You know, the problem is, she’s never seen a real film because they don’t make real movies for kids anymore.”Looking back at The Breakfast Club (which I must’ve watched 40 times by the time I was in the 6th grade), Sixteen Candles, St. Elmo’s Fire, et al — these were real movies. And Jesus, could we relate to them. Many still hold up — if you can ignore the acid-wash and the hair mousse.The Decline of Western Civilization (Penelope Spheeris, 1981; 100% Tomatometer)Dirty and loud, this film put a face to the music that represented the ultimate freedom from the suburbs. Pre-YouTube, footage of these bands was super hard to come by. There were only a couple videotapes floating around… and once in a while, you could see something truly outré on “120 Minutes”… but in truth, if you weren’t in LA/NY/DC, you missed out on most of the scene.Like water to the desert, Penelope Spheeris’s film brought the culture into our lives. And shortly thereafter, I had myself a hideous painted leather jacket — just like Darby Crash.Trust (Hal Hartley, 1990; 82% Tomatometer)Trust was one of the first American indies that I ever saw… and it blew my mind. My experience of movies up until that point had taken place in a multiplex. The fare was entertaining, sure, but I never felt like there was a place for me in it.Hartley’s film and the early ’90s changed all of that. It seemed like a whole new art form. I didn’t even realize that you could make a film like this! The characters were smart and seductive, and they hurt and loved in ways I recognized. Martin Donovan, Bill Sage, Adrienne Shelly — they were my Band of Outsiders.Harold and Maude (Hal Ashby, 1971; 85% Tomatometer)Hal Ashby: Often copied, never matched. The last 10 minutes of this movie might be my favorite piece of film on the planet. It breaks my heart to think that a film so weird and perfect might never be made again… or, if it was made, could vanish without a whisper, buckling under the weight of another billboard for Transformers 16.Nashville (Robert Altman, 1975; 95% Tomatometer)Altman! Pound for pound probably my favorite filmmaker. I’m deeply in love with Short Cuts as well, but Nashville was my first… and you never forget your first.The world, the performances, the music — all seamless. Altman had a way of saying things without ever showing his hand. His world washes over you — and as it does, your heart fills to bursting.Hearts of Darkness (Fax Bahr, George Hickenlooper, 1991; 100% Tomatometer)Hearts of Darkness is my go-to film when I’m feeling beaten or depressed.Everyone knows that Apocalypse Now was a masterpiece, but it was watching the intimate, behind-the-scene details that truly inspired me. The madness, vision, and obstacles that came together to create this film were of Quixote-esque proportions.Boogie Nights (Paul Thomas Anderson, 1997; 92% Tomatometer)My favorite of PT’s films… and one that I will watch any time of day or night, should I come across it on cable.Who will ever forget the Sister Christian firecracker scene? Or Julianne Moore and Heather Graham gacked out on blow talking about family? Or Seymour Hoffman’s short-shorts!? Truly iconic.The Puffy Chair (Jay Duplass, 2004; 76% Tomatometer)I owe a huge debt to my friends Mark and Jay Duplass for making a film that inspired much of the current chapter of my career. Puffy Chair is Gen X Cassavetes at its best.When I saw this film for the first time, I was both moved and a little creeped out — because there were long strings of dialogue that I had literally voiced verbatim in my own life. Mark, Jay, Katie and Rhett captured the pitch-perfect vernacular for our generation.The Tree of Life (Terrence Malick, 2011; 84% Tomatometer)I only hesitate to put this film on the list because it’s so fresh in my mind. But, sitting in a crowded theater, surrounded by haters, I had one of the most personal and profound movie watching experiences of my entire life.As most folks know, this is one of those films that you either “go with” or you don’t — and I was on the bus from the first frame. Somehow, by the end of this seeming non-sequitur of a film, a deep-buried trove of emotions had unlocked inside of me. I don’t think I stopped crying for the last 30 minutes.The Lie is out in theaters in limited release this Friday.","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"strong, Awards, RT21, king, in, talk, Channel, golden, Emmy, dark, Animation, Awards, book","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/vbb.jpg","slug":"five-favorite-films-plus-four-more-with-joshua-leonard"},{"id":"47508848045366","title":"Five Favorite Films with Michael Biehn","content":"Five Favorite Filmsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Five Favorite Films with Michael BiehnThe frequent James Cameron collaborator and star of The Divide chats with RT about tensions on set and his first foray behind the camera.by Ryan Fujitani | January 11, 2012 |  CommentsIt’s one of life’s great mysteries why Michael Biehn isn’t a household name, considering he starred in some of the most iconic action films of the 1980s. If the picture on the left doesn’t trigger any memories for you, perhaps the name Kyle Reese will, as Biehn portrayed the original time traveler who helped to thwart a robot apocalypse in The Terminator. In fact, Biehn was a favorite of James Cameron, who tapped him twice more for the roles of Corporal Dwayne Hicks in Aliens and Lieutenant Coffey in The Abyss. But Biehn’s accomplishments don’t end there, as the underappreciated actor went on to work with William Friedkin, Michael Bay, and Robert Rodriguez and featured in films like Tombstone, Planet Terror, and The Rock, not to mention his extensive work on television.This week, Biehn appears in The Divide, a bleak, post-apocalyptic psychological thriller helmed by Xavier Gens (Frontier(s)) and starring Lauren German, Milo Ventimiglia, and Rosanna Arquette. RT was fortunate enough to sit and chat with him, and we were spontaneously joined by his lovely wife, actress Jennifer Blanc-Biehn, who also has a brief cameo in the film. Biehn gave us his Five Favorite Films, then went on to talk about the mounting tensions on set, Xavier Gens’s fluid, anything-goes directorial style, and his own first outing in the director’s chair (The Victim, which was, in fact, picked up by Anchor Bay on the day of this interview). So, without further ado, here are Michael Biehn’s Five Favorite Films!&nbsp;Taxi Driver (Martin Scorsese, 1976; 98% Tomatometer)The first film that really inspired me… When I came out to L.A. to be an actor, I wasn’t really taking anything very seriously. I thought, maybe I’ll be a model, I could do some modeling, or maybe some commercial acting or whatever, and I thought that would be a career. Then I saw Taxi Driver. Taxi Driver is a movie that changed my life and made me a serious actor. Scorsese and De Niro. I give credit for anything that I’ve ever done as an actor.Were you impressed more by Scorsese’s direction or De Niro’s performance?I think they go hand in hand. The whole movie, really. Harvey Keitel, even Scorsese in the back of the car. The whole thing is fantastic.One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest (Milos Forman, 1975; 96% Tomatometer)One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest is a movie that I just find flawless. Jack Nicholson… I just saw The Shining again the other day; he’s so brilliant. He’s such a brilliant actor, just unbelievable.The Godfather/The Godfather Part II (Francis Ford Coppola, 1972/1974; 100%/98% Tomatometer)The Godfather. The Godfather Part II, mostly, but the two Godfathers. There’s just something about those movies that I just find I can watch over and over again.The Lost Weekend (Billy Wilder, 1945; 100% Tomatometer)There’s a movie called The Lost Weekend, which is about an alcoholic, and that’s another favorite movie.Unforgiven (Clint Eastwood, 1992; 96% Tomatometer)If I had to throw one more into the mix, I mean, there’s so many great movies. Unforgiven. There’s my last one right there. Unforgiven, I think, is the best Western ever.Next, Biehn talks about tension on the set of The Divide (the anger is real, people!), working with legendary directors, and his own directorial debut.&nbsp;Biehn continued from his Five Favorite Films to mention a few other choices he could have gone with:Michael Biehn: Now, having said that, too, I would also say the greatest horror movie — we were talking about all these horror movies earlier — is William Friedkin and The Exorcist. I also think he did the best buddy cop movie ever in The French Connection and, you know, the best car chase, and so on. And I got to work with Billy so that’s kind of my group of films that I can watch over and over again. And funny enough, on the lighter side, on the fun side — I call it the “bubblegum side” — I like to watch The Buddy Holly Story. I love The Buddy Holly Story because Gary Busey is so brilliant in that movie. You know, he does all his own singing and all his own music and everything, and the rest of the movie is kind of thin, but his performance, I think, is brilliant.I read somewhere that you were a big fan of Sean Penn…MB: Sean Penn is, I think, maybe the greatest actor… Jack Lemmon is another great one. It’s hard to say who’s the best, but yeah, he’s right up there in the top five actors of all time in my book. When he goes from playing Milk, and he plays that very thin, kind of light kind of character, you know, Harvey Milk, gay, the whole number, and plays him brilliantly, wins the Academy Award, and then you see him in Fair Game. All of a sudden you see this guy, he’s got a f***in’ gut, he’s got three chins, glasses are down, the hair is out like this, and “Just because you yell louder than me, does that make you right?!” It’s f***ing brilliant! Just incredible. I have so much respect for him.I wanted to mention that because it seems like a lot of your favorite films are very much actor-driven and benefit a lot from really outstanding performances.MB: Yeah, absolutely.Well, let’s talk about The Divide. Just to start at square one, can you tell us a little about how you came to be a part of this project?Well, Xavier [Gens] called me up and wanted to know if I’d be interested in it. He sent the script, I read it. The script was okay, the character was okay.So he called you specifically for the role of Mickey, the landlord.MB: Yes, for Mickey. I asked him if I could make some changes. He was like, “Well, you can make any changes you want. You can do anything you want with the movie.” So I said,”Okay, I’ll do it.”So I got involved with the movie, and then I realized once I got up to Canada to shoot the movie that we were, as actors, able to do anything we wanted. Rewrite characters, rewrite scenes. So the Mickey that is in the script that I originally read bears no resemblance to this Mickey that we ended up putting on film. I wrote Mickey with Eron Sheean, and Eron was basically a writer who was on the set to help all the actors rewrite scenes that they weren’t happy with or rewrite dialogue that they weren’t happy with. I worked with Eron for a week or two; I would send him stuff, he would send it back, I would send it to him again. He finally said, “Michael, you just write it.” So I basically created that character and wrote him and created the backstory of 9/11 and all that kind of stuff.It was a very exhilarating movie shoot because it’s like nothing I’ve ever done before. It was completely like, you can do anything you want, you can improv anything you want, you can write anything you want, you can say anything you want in a scene. And the movie is the only movie I’ve done… In 35 years as an actor, I’ve never shot anything consecutively, day one, day two, day three, day four. So the script started out here, but all of a sudden, Michael Eklund’s improvising, so now we’re over here someplace. Then it went over here, and it just got crazy. Nobody kind of knew where they were headed or where their characters were headed; we were writing them as we went. I mean, Mickey was the antagonist in the script; he was the bad guy, he got it in the end. That was the original script. And Michael Eklund created his character out of nothing. There was no character there; there were four or five lines in the script, and Michael Eklund made that character come alive by improvising things and writing stuff and doing such interesting stuff.Jennifer Blanc-Biehn: Xavier just couldn’t handle it. Xavier was in love with it. He was like, “My God! More, more!” And Milo [Ventimiglia] too.MB: Milo was so committed, and Rosanna [Arquette] was so committed, and Lauren [German]…JBB: Lauren, and Ashton [Holmes], and Ivan. Ivan Gonzalez doesn’t get mentioned but he’s a ridiculously talented actor that lives in France. And Michael said it best when he said it takes a very talented actor to play a weak man.I want to come back to that collaborative experience in just a bit, because I know you have a history of working with your directors in that way. But it’s interesting that you essentially rewrote your character, and that he was originally intended to be the antagonist, because at first, you sort of hate Mickey because he’s such a jerk. But as the film continues, you begin to sympathize with this plight; he’s providing food and shelter for these ungrateful strangers who have invaded his private space and they’re just…MB: B****ing and moaning, yeah, and not listening to me when I tell them not to leave.Well, it’s interesting because by the end of the film, your character, Mickey, and maybe Lauren German’s character to a degree, are the only ones who — I don’t want to say you remain unchanged, but you two are the only ones who don’t go completely insane.Well, I wanted the audience to think that I had changed, you know. The backstory on Mickey, which we created, was that he was a 9/11 survivor. He went into one of those buildings and when it came down on him and his team, and he was the only one left standing. So he ended up with PTSD, you know; his life falls apart and he starts drinking, loses his family, loses his job, gets paranoid, and turns into what he turns into, and that’s who he is at the beginning of the movie. But because of what transpires during the movie, he ends up kind of finding his humanity again. So, towards the end of the movie, you know, you see him put that coat on Ivan’s character, right, and when he goes out, he goes out kind of like… I tried to play him like he goes out with a kind of smile on his face, like, “This is the way my guys went out, and this is the way I want to go out, looking at the woman that I love.” And that character transformed from being a prick, a selfish guy — understandably so.&nbsp;And that backstory is revealed pretty economically through just a short series of photos that Mickey keeps around…JBB: Xavier felt that was enough to soften the character.MB: Yeah, I mean, we shot the whole scene where it was all explained and everything. I shot a whole scene like that in The Terminator that was cut out, too, that I thought was going to be my big scene. And Sigourney [Weaver] shot a big scene in Aliens, too, that was her backstory with her daughter; that got cut out. That stuff gets cut out, but still there’s remnants of that, and that stays with you. You don’t need to be told every single detail.Going back to the collaborative filmmaking process, I have a multi-tiered question for you. I’ll start by asking what the filming conditions were like, in terms of the physicality of the set. Were you all really stuffed into a basement?MB: Yes.The reason I ask is because some of those scenes felt eerily real, and I have to wonder if the cramped space and the freedom to improvise made for some touchy situations. Was there a lot of tension on the set?MB: Yes, there was a lot of tension. Yeah, yes, yes. People hated each other so much that the producers had to be called down constantly because actors were fighting because they thought other actors were trying to steal scenes from them. There was a lot of physicality on the scene, and some actors thought there was too much. Yeah, they hated each other. They hated each other.I’ve worked with Friedkin, I’ve worked with Jim Cameron, I’ve worked with Michael Bay… I’ve worked with these guys, and there was more tension on this set than any other set that I’ve ever worked on in my life. And Xavier set it up that way, where he would bring an actor in — it was going to be their big day — and all of a sudden, he would start shooting something else, and that would piss off that actor, and he’d be mad at that actress, and this actress would be mad, etc. It was crazy. I thought it was going to get violent at times. It was really close.That really comes through in the movie, because there are a couple of scenes when, as I was watching them, I pictured what it must have been like to be there as they were being filmed, and I think I would have been frightened. There’s that scene when you’re being tortured, and you guys are spitting at each other, and I remember thinking, “This anger feels genuine.”JBB: That was a genuine day. [laughs]MB: [laughs] That was a genuine day. What’s not even in there is, the way Michael was holding me, he was holding me like that because originally, he was standing behind me and I was hitting him like this [whips his head back repeatedly]. I hit him a couple times like that. He got a bloody nose, and you know… That was me and Michael. Me, Michael, and Milo would do anything.You look at that movie, and you watch them try to bring Rosanna Arquette down those stairs. You watch that, and that’s her fighting, biting, clawing, doing everything she can, and they shot that three or four times. Those are some committed actors. [laughs]So what was it like working under that sort of directing style?MB: Well, that directing style is something that will never happen to us again, because here in America, if you?re doing a TV show or something like that, and you go, “Listen, can I change this ‘a’ to a ‘the?'” And it’s, “Oh, we’ve got to check with the line producer.” This was the most amazing, open, fun experience for an actor that I’ve ever been involved in.You’ve worked with some legendary directors like William Friedkin and James Cameron, but you’ve also worked with newer talent like Robert Rodriguez and, with The Divide, Xavier Gens. Do you sense a noticeable difference between the two generations of filmmakers, between how things are done now and how they were done 30 years ago?MB: I think every director’s different. Every director’s got his own style. I mean, when I directed, I basically just screamed for eight hours a day, twelve hours a day. “We gotta f***ing go, we gotta move! We gotta move! Shut the f*** up! We’re shooting, we’re shooting!” And other people like Ron Howard can just make a brilliant movie and be just as nice as can be. I think everybody’s different. You look at Eastwood, you know; supposedly he’s just as calm as a cucumber. You look at Cameron, and he’s, you know, he’s an intense guy, and Friedkin’s an intense guy. Everybody’s different.You’re actually one step ahead of me, because I was going to ask you about your directorial debut, The Victim, next.MB: Yeah, I’m like a madman. [laughs] I was described by somebody who was on that set as a cross between a raging lunatic and something else.Was it Robert Rodriguez who sort of gave you that extra push you needed to go ahead and move into directing?MB: I guess it was… You know, Jim Cameron has always told me that I should try and be a director, or try directing. And Jim has said to me about Robert Rodriguez, “One of the brilliant things about Robert is that Robert just doesn’t realize that he can’t do something, and he just does it.” He just goes for it, you kow? He doesn’t care. He just goes for it; he doesn’t care about anything. And when I worked with Robert, I got that from him. He just doesn’t care what people think, you know? I do, but he doesn’t, and I got that from him. And then, when I was shooting The Divide with Xavier, I saw a guy reading [Robert Rodriguez’s book] Rebel Without a Crew, and I said to myself, “You know? F*** it, man, I’m just going to go do this.” So that was kind of the genesis of me saying “I’m going to make a movie,” and then boom, it was three weeks preproduction and twelve days shooting.JBB: It was an original story by Reed Lackey; we wrote [the film] in three weeks. Lorna [Paul] and I and Ryan Honey put everybody together and we shot it in twelve days. It was a lot of fun.What were your takeaways from working with the various directors you’ve collaborated with over the years?MB: You know, truth, man. Story. You have to have a good story to tell; that’s the most important thing. That’s what Cameron always has. That’s what Friedkin always has, or usually has. It’s having a good story to tell, and telling it honestly, trying to be as honest as you can. That’s really the best way I can describe it.The Divide opens in select theaters this week, and don’t forget to keep an eye out for Michael Biehn’s directorial debut, the exploitation-styled thriller The Victim.","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"parents, BAFTA, Calendar, of, Quiz, hard, school, casting, Comedy, TV, hidden, Sematary, free","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/xvxzcvz.jpg","slug":"five-favorite-films-with-michael-biehn"},{"id":"47508852802912","title":"Five Favorite Films with Topher Grace","content":"Five Favorite Filmsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Five Favorite Films with Topher GraceThe star of this week's Take Me Home Tonight dials back the time circuit for his most inspiring movies.by Luke Goodsell | March 3, 2011 |  CommentsFor a guy who got his break appearing on TV’s That ’70s Show, Topher Grace sure is obsessed with this ’80s thing. In this week’s new release Take Me Home Tonight — which might superficially be summarized as That ’80s Movie — Grace, who co-wrote the story and produced, stars as Matt Franklin, a talented-but-aimless college grad adrift between a yuppie career and a dead-end video clerk job in the summer of 1988. Pining after his unattainable high school crush Tori (Teresa Palmer), Matt, his sister Wendy (Anna Faris), and his buddy Barry (Dan Fogler) crash a reunion party in LA’s Valley — thus setting in motion the kind of “all-in-one-night” adventure in which the characters work out their lives via an evening of raucous misdeeds. It’s a film that proudly wears its “I Heart John Hughes” pin on the rolled-up sleeve of its sports blazer, a passion project that Grace has clearly had percolating for some time.In keeping with that spirit, the actor decided he wanted to compile his five favorites with Take Me Home Tonight‘s flavor, and talk about their influence upon his film along the way. “I would say my favorite films that were kind of specific to what our inspirations were for this movie,” Grace says. So here they are.&nbsp;Say Anything… (1989, 100% Tomatometer)&nbsp;First is Say Anything…. In terms of protagonists it doesn’t get any better than Lloyd Dobler, and John Cusack is kind of like the Holy Grail in terms of awesome ’80s protagonists that are kind of lost and don’t know what they want to do. That great speech where he says “I don’t wanna sell anything… bought, sold or processed” or whatever — you know that scene? — it’s just kind of a genius way of describing what a character’s going through. Quite frankly my character in this movie is going through a very similar thing: clearly a smart guy, probably kind of paralyzed in life because he’s done it to himself. He’s kind of over-thinking everything, so the only thing he can think of is to do nothing and work at Sun Coast video.RT: There’s definitely a Cusack element to your character. I thought of Say Anything… but I was also reminded of the character he plays in Better Off Dead.Oh yeah, totally. There’s even a little Grosse Pointe [Blank]. Like, him older would be Grosse Pointe. That would be the reunion of this class. Plus, I mean come on, there are just such amazing lines in Say Anything…: “I gave her my heart and she gave me a pen.” And the use of music in that film, that was something. I mean all these films we looked at, and we kind of made a giant mix tape — that was the first thing we did before we even put a writer on the film. We really didn’t want to make fun of the ’80s, we wanted to celebrate the great music and the great movies of the ’80s. [Peter Gabriel’s] “In Your Eyes” is a great example of ’80s music in a good way.The music playing when you and Teresa kiss kind of recalls that vibe. Who did that music?That was done by Trevor Horn. He did a special thing for us, which is we got the rights to [Pete Townshend’s] “Let My Love Open the Door,” which is actually a different version, the E. Cola Mix, a lot slower — and that’s playing in the car when they first starting to flirt. So we got the rights to have him use that in the score. Trevor did, like, all the great synth scores of the actual ’80s, and we wanted to be the first movie that actually was like the ’80s. It was like we time traveled and made a movie in the ’80s and just put it in a vault and took it out today, blew the dust off and this is like the lost ’80s movie, basically. In order to do that, and not to make a big deal out of it, we did enough that it dated it but not so much that we were making fun of it. The music was the same way. We needed there to be synthesizer, but not the kind where it called attention to itself.And Trevor was in The Buggles, whose song “Video Killed the Radio Star” opens your film.That’s right. You know what’s really crazy, dude? It’s that Hans Zimmer was in that music video. He was in the Buggles at that time and that’s him in the video.Less Than Zero (1987, 54% Tomatometer)&nbsp;Number two I would say is Less Than Zero, which, you know… there’s a point in [Take Me Home Tonight] where we kind of go “across the tracks” in Los Angeles, which is the Hills. The Valley was a big deal; it’s where the majority of the movie takes place, but then we go to a different party, kind of a banker’s party, and that’s going over the hill into Beverly Hills. I realized when I first moved to LA that there was a big difference between the Sunset Strip and Los Angeles proper, and then going over into the Valley, which is more of a hometown community. It’s crazy that the Hills is kind of those train tracks, so to speak, and we really wanted to focus on that second party as in Less Than Zero. That’s what we were going for. The atmosphere in there, we really wanted to see that side of the ’80s too, which is very different. You would say the other side is maybe Valley Girl, and that kind of party, and this side is Less than Zero.The outfit that you wear out is very Andrew McCarthy in Less Than Zero, too.Oh, I was totally inspired by Andrew McCarthy, yeah.The Breakfast Club (1985, 90% Tomatometer)&nbsp;Number three would be The Breakfast Club, which might be kind of on the nose but you can’t not put it on the list. It’s a great film and you can say it in place of naming all of John Hughes’ films, because we drew so much inspiration from a lot of his. The thing that John Hughes did, which was really the genesis of why we wanted to produce the movie, is that there were equal parts drama and comedy. Now today you’ll see a movie and it’ll be all raunchy — and it’ll be great — but it’ll be just sort of a raunchy fun time. Or you’ll go see a movie and it’ll be really romantic, so it’s all one thing. John Hughes dared to do both, to have kind of a four-course meal, and also he could have young ensembles do it. I love having worked with movie stars but I really wanted to find a bunch of young ensemble peers. The little side note is that all of John Hughes’ kids, in his films, go to Shermer High, and that’s where we talk about having gone to. At the beginning, when you see the yearbook, it says “Shermer High.” That’s the only thing that tips its hat in the movie; everything else is like, we wanted to use some conventions — you know, we wanted to steal a red car, we wanted to have a guy chasing a girl at a party, have a platonic best girlfriend — but with Shermer, we went for it.Fast Times At Ridgemont High (1982, 80% Tomatometer)&nbsp;I would say the fourth one is Fast Times At Ridegmont High, which is like a really different version of the same thing at the same time. And you know it’s Cameron Crowe again, with Amy Heckerling, who’s amazing. I remember seeing that and it was kind of like gritty and so real. I think I saw it for the first time 10 or 15 years after it first came out, and it still was shocking and interesting. And we wanted to make sure that we had, in our film, real drug use — and the drug of the day was cocaine — and real boobs. We really wanted to go there. That’s something that I really admire in Fast Times At Ridgemont High. It’s hilarious, it’s not scared to go there and it doesn’t pull any punches. And the character work is so amazing.And it has what may be the single greatest classroom scene ever, when Spicoli orders the pizza delivered to his desk.I know! I mean there are those genius little bits and then it takes all these different stories and puts them into one. I just love Fast Times so much.Dazed and Confused (1993, 98% Tomatometer)American Graffiti (1973, 97% Tomatometer)&nbsp;&nbsp;The fifth one? I gotta give you two. Bend the rules a little bit. These are both not in the ’80s but they were both really inspirational to the movie: Dazed and Confused and American Graffiti.The ultimate all-in-one night, end-of-school movies.Right. When we looked at it, at the beginning, we loved all these ’80s movies and yet this [type of story] hasn’t been done for the ’80s — the look back. It’s different from the movies that were shot in the present, because it’s implicit that there’s a message in looking back. My producing partner was my roommate in boarding school and I remember us watching Dazed and Confused — this was a film from the ’90s looking back at the ’70s — and thinking, what an amazing cast. We really wanted to take the ’80s seriously, like those films. I mean, I love The Wedding Singer, it’s a great movie, but it was only eight years out of the ’80s, and you don’t have real view then. I think it’d be very hard to make the ’90s movie now. But I think those movies, especially American Graffiti, which was the first one, really had something to say about that time. And like our film, they were always at the end of a threshold — like, they literally flew to Vietnam the next month [at the end of Graffiti], these main characters; or in Dazed and Confused you can see that kid’s about to graduate. It’s the end of an era. That’s why we set ours at a Labor Day party, so it’s at the end of summer, and it’s in ’88, so it’s kind of at the end of the ’80s. Matt Franklin is kind of like a beautiful swan in the recession, probably [laughs], but a real ugly duckling in the go-go ’80s.Is that why you chose 1988? Apart from being able to use pop music, like N.W.A., that was changing in tone at the time?Right, the music’s great. I mean, at the party the D.J.’s playing stuff that they had when they went to high school, so it’s kind of more of the ’80s. But we wanted the feeling that Matt’s gonna do great in the ’90s — he really is made for the ’90s. And that’s the thing that both of those movies have: the modern-day protagonist in a film from that time.You’re like the Richard Dreyfuss character in Graffiti?I like Richard Dreyfuss but I more identified with the Ron Howard character when I saw that movie. But yeah, look Richard Dreyfuss is amazing in that movie. It’s really interesting to me when a movie’s set 20 years in the past and it’s a period piece but it’s as close as you can get to that period. It’s implicit that there’s a message inside of it, and yet those films did a really good job of being just a fun blast to watch — there’s no kind of homework to do, you know. Plus there are two audiences when you do this 20-year thing: there’s the audience that’s just swimming in nostalgia watching it, and then there’s the audience that discovers it for the first time.Were there any behavioral quirks of ’80s movie characters that you studied up on? I’m thinking of how you tilt your Wayfarers down when you walk into that house party.Right — all those things, man. We shot that one and I thought, “Is this gonna work?” — and now it’s the poster.But you’re wearing different shades in the poster — you’ve got the Back to the Future aviators on.Ah, yeah… I think they tried a lot of different shades for the poster and I am certainly a huge Back to the Future fan — so I was not against it. I really walk up into the camera and make eye contact at the moment. So I thought, if [I don’t get to do it in this movie], then when? [laughs]&nbsp;Take Me Home Tonight is released this week.","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"Pride, Emmys, Calendar, Month, Apple, best, Television, Talk, unscripted","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/safd.jpg","slug":"five-favorite-films-with-topher-grace"},{"id":"47508851045713","title":"Five Favorite Films with John Carpenter","content":"Five Favorite Filmsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Five Favorite Films with John CarpenterThe horror icon chats about the Coen brothers and his love for Westerns.by Ryan Fujitani | June 10, 2011 |  Comments(Photo by Gabriel Grams/Getty Images)Writer-director-producer-composer (and occasional actor) John Carpenter is a modern horror icon whose keen sense of tension and terror has helped establish his work as some of the finest genre filmmaking to hit the big screen. His best known film is probably the 1978 slasher classic Halloween, but the ’80s — Carpenter’s most critically and commercially successful decade — brought forth other beloved gems like The Thing, Escape from New York, Starman, and the cult classic They Live. After 2001’s Ghosts of Mars capped off a rather less than auspicious decade of films for him, Carpenter fell silent for several years, choosing instead to work on smaller projects like Showtime’s Masters of Horror series.RT recently got the opportunity to speak with Carpenter, who not only gave us his Five Favorites (and then some — more on that below) but also went on to chat about his deep love of Westerns and his opinion on the Coen brothers.When asked specifically about his Five Favorite Films, Carpenter had this to say: “I have two different categories of favorite films. One is the emotional favorites, which means these are generally films that I saw when I was a kid. Anything you see in your formative years is more powerful, because it really stays with you forever. The second category is films that I saw while I was learning the craft of motion pictures. That’s a whole different ball game. I fell in love with them as a mature person.”Since we only have room for one list, we’ll let you read about John Carpenter’s “mature” Five Favorite Films below. But before we get there, here’s what he said about his “emotional favorites,” which he rattled off in quick succession: “When I was a kid, I loved The Curse of Frankenstein, The Creeping Unknown, X: The Unknown. I love Forbidden Planet, The Thing from Another World. They were science fiction/horror movies, generally. A lot of them were Hammer films, and the music in those movies… One of my heroes is a composer named James Bernard, and oh my god… I can still listen to his music today and be stirred and moved by it. But I think that you fall in love with… Well, again, when you’re young, it really is more powerful. Much more terrifying.”Only Angels Have Wings (1939)  100%Now, my favorite films as a more mature person, when I was learning about what the director is and does, probably a lot of them were Howard Hawks movies, like Only Angels Have Wings and Rio Bravo. In Hawks’ world, Only Angels Have Wings and Rio Bravo are his visions of adventure stories with male groups, and men and women’s relationships, and life and death and danger. He’s developed that idea throughout his career. Those are just his beliefs.Rio Bravo (1959)  100%See Only Angels Have Wings above.Citizen Kane (1941)  99%I’d have to say, jeez… Citizen Kane is a great film. Like Hawks, this movie is a vision, primarily the director’s vision, of something that is whole and complete.Vertigo (1958)  94%Vertigo is a perfect nightmare. Perfect. It’s a dream, and it’s stunning. It’s so dark and obsessive, and it came from this director who claimed to only want to entertain the audiences. But that’s not true; it’s a masterpiece.Blow-Up (1966)  88%And let me throw in an oddball here: Blow-Up. That is a brilliant film. It’s kind of a perfect enigmatic example of a film. I just love that movie. I can’t get enough of it. It’s so strange! [laughs]Ryan Fujitani for Rotten Tomatoes: It would be easy for someone to look at your list of early “emotional favorites” and say, “Well, no wonder he ended up making movies like Halloween or The Thing.”John Carpenter: You could say that, but it would be wrong. I got in this business to make Westerns. I’m a Western fan. Loved Westerns… Loved them. I mean, huge love. I think my first love… Well, cinema’s my first love, but along with science fiction and horror, when I was a kid in the ’50s, I saw Westerns! I was at the theater in 1959, buying my ticket to Rio Bravo. They held it over two weeks in our town, because everybody was going. And I went back again. I was in the theater, buying popcorn, as a little kid. Oh, I’ve watched it too many times. [laughs] Too many times.RT: There seems to have been somewhat of a revival of interest in the Western lately. What’s your take on why their popularity in Hollywod dwindled in the first place?Carpenter: There are a number of reasons. Television did it to death. And then, as brilliant as they were, the Italian Westerns parodied it to death. I remember seeing Once Upon A Time in the West, and it was a jawdropping movie. I couldn’t believe that movie. But after that, what are you going to do? I mean, you can’t do a gunfight any better than Henry Fonda and Charles Bronson. You cannot do it any better. You cannot; there’s nothing you can do. You cannot do a revenge story — Bronson’s whole journey in that — any better. What are you going to do?And then, you know, there’s a bunch of left-wing Westerns that came along that occasionally got made. The Dances with Wolves, Little Big Man, stuff like that. But I’m talking about traditional Westerns here. And I guess people are asking that question now because of the Coens’ movie True Grit.RT: What did you think of that, compared to the John Wayne version?Carpenter:&nbsp;Oh, I prefer the original. I thought that they missed out on something the original had that they didn’t have. There’s great stuff in it, no doubt. But they did not have an emotional ending that resolved the relationship. The most important scene in the original True Grit with John Wayne and Kim Darby was how they resolved their relationship. When he’s with her there at the cemetery, she says, “I want you to be buried next to me, Rooster.” And he jumps over the fence on the horse. [laughs] The audience has to have that. We need that. Now, in the Coens’ version, he dies offscreen? Huh? Really? Really… It just cheats me.RT: It’s reminiscent of the complaint some had about Josh Brolin’s fate in No Country for Old Men.Carpenter:&nbsp;They have third-act problems. Believe me, I’m a guy who has third-act problems; I’m familiar with it. But it’s odd. Why would you do that to me? After all this time I’ve been with you?However, their comedies are unbelievable. A Serious Man? I cannot stop laughing at that film. That movie just put me away! It’s the craziest thing. I love that film. And they’re very nice people, too.","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"Sabrina, serial, Fantasy, killer, cinematic, concert, kong, Anna, RT21, movies, Network, Discovery, thriller","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/a.jpg","slug":"five-favorite-films-with-john-carpenter"},{"id":"47508851037518","title":"Five Favorite Films with Rose McGowan","content":"Five Favorite Filmsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Five Favorite Films with Rose McGowanThe Conan the Barbarian star also talks about the new film and growing up watching old movies in Italy.by Ryan Fujitani | August 17, 2011 |  CommentsOver the course of her 19-year career, Rose McGowan has established quite an eclectic resume, working with notable directors across several genres and moving effortlessly between film and television. She landed her first movie role in the Pauly Shore comedy Encino Man and later garnered praise for her portrayal of a troubled teen fugitive in The Doom Generation. For the next decade, McGowan split her time mostly between smaller, independent movies and a career-defining role on the fantasy drama Charmed until her involvement in the Quentin Tarantino/Robert Rodriguez project Grindhouse brought her front and center again.This week, she continues her string of strong but flawed female characters as the evil sorceress Marique in Marcus Nispel’s Conan the Barbarian, and we were happy to chat with her about the film. When asked about her Five Favorite Films, McGowan said, “I’ll probably do five of my favorite films, because they’re always different. I always have to go by genre, too, my tops in each genre. There are many more. Doris Day films, Preston Sturges films; I’m a total geek.” She not only gave us her Five Favorite Films, but also talked about what it was like growing up and watching movies overseas, and how she influenced a rather taboo relationship in Conan. Read on for the full interview!&nbsp;Night of the Hunter (1955, 98% Tomatometer)I’d say Night of the Hunter. It’s an amazing film. That’s where the original “love” and “hate” tattoos on the hand came from. A lot of people don’t know that. You know, the good Christianity, the true Christianity, versus the false prophet thing that plays out in there, and the imagery. It’s an intense and beautiful film. And I love Robert Mitchum. I wish he’d come back to life.Out of the Past (1947, 96% Tomatometer)I also love — another Robert Mitchum movie — Out of the Past, which I think is kind of neck and neck with another fantastic film noir, Double Indemnity. Double Indemnity is amazing; Out of the Past is another one, but I think it ranks up there.So you’re a big Robert Mitchum fan in general.I love Robert Mitchum, apparently. [laughs] But I just happen to like these two movies. I like old films. I co-host a show on TCM {Turner Classic Movies) called The Essentials.The Godfather/The Godfather Part II (1972, 100% Tomatometer/1974, 98% Tomatometer)I love the Godfathers, one and two, but I feel like that should count as one film.Scarface/Scarface (1932, 100% Tomatometer/1983, 88% Tomatometer)For a kind of over-the-top-ness, I love the original Scarface, and then I like the [Al] Pacino Scarface. Both of them are fantastic.Some Like It Hot (1959, 98% Tomatometer)I think probably Some Like It Hot might be the most perfect comedy ever done.Next, McGowan talks about growing up watching movies in Italian and how she made her Conan character slightly taboo.RT: Did you grow up watching a lot of older films?Rose McGowan: I did. We were the weirdos on the block. You know, my dad would say, “Hey, they’re rereleasing a remastered version of Lawrence of Arabia on 70mm,” and we’d all be like, “Yay!” [laughs] Yes, we would be excited about that.Now, I understand you didn’t speak English until you moved to the States.Well, I understood English; I just refused to speak it. My parents would say things in English to me and I would answer in Italian. I just refused.So when you were watching these older films, was that before you moved here or after?Hmm… Kind of both. It’s interesting though, because, you know, everything is dubbed over in Italy, so the first time I saw Gone with the Wind, Mammy was speaking Italian and everybody had the same voice. All the women had the same voice, and all the men had the same voice. And I remember seeing it when I came here, and I was like, “Mammy? That does not sound like the Mammy that I know.”It’s stuff you don’t think about. Like, people over there, I would say pre-cable or DVDs, older people there, if they didn’t speak any English, they’ve probably only ever heard a lot of these classic films with one voice. It’s especially funny seeing African-American actors speaking Italian, and you’re like, “But you’re in the South, Mammy.”&nbsp;Are you still fluent in Italian?I’m an unfortunate mix of French, Italian, and Spanish now, pretty much in one sentence. So I’m kind of useless everywhere. I lived in Montreal after Italy, so then the French Canadian got into my head. And then, living in LA, that’s all Espanol. I’m pretty useless. I go to Italy and someone speaks Italian to me, and it translates in my head to French, and I answer in French. I kind of answer in the wrong languages everywhere; it’s annoying, and makes me look like crazy town. [laughs] They’re staring at me like, “What?”Well, let’s talk about Conan. As I understand it, the role that you play, Marique, was originally a character named Fariq, who was male. Can you talk a little bit about how that change came to be, and what part, if any, you played in making that change happen?Well, I didn’t play a part in that decision making process, although I wholeheartedly agree with it. What I was happy about was, once I was sent the script, and they said “Ignore the fact that it says ‘Fariq’ and it’s ‘him’ and ‘he,'” I was excited because I knew that because it had been written for a man, then that means it’s sure to be a strong character.So when they sent you the script, someone had already made the decision that maybe a woman could play this role.Oh yes. You know, it’s so funny because there’s about 30 different people that I’ve heard who’ve taken credit for that, from the costume designer to… You know, “Why is the costume designer making that choice? She’s amazing, but who knows? Maybe she’s right.” I have no clue. It was everybody’s stroke of inspiration.Well, the gender change is interesting because there’s definitely a peculiar dynamic that can develop in a father-daughter relationship that’s less likely in a father-son relationship.Uh, yes!And based on that, I have to ask, though it’s never explicitly stated in the film…It’s not your imagination.There are a couple of moments when the story hints at something kind of taboo going on in that relationship between Marique and her father, Khalar Zym.Correct.&nbsp;Was that something written into the script?No. I just thought it would be funny. I thought, you know, there’s nothing wrong with having a big summer movie that has some little subversive elements, little twists and turns here and there. The writer and I talked about it, and the studio was pretty freaked out by it, so I added what I could.In the end, though, I think it’s safely ambiguous, because the audience is left wondering, “Does she really feel this way, or is she just hungry for the power of the mask?”No, I don’t think she really cares at all about the mask. I think she’d be totally fine with the mask being destroyed. I think she’s sick and tired of hearing about her dead mother, and she would prefer to take her mother’s place… in every way. I mean, it’s obviously an Electra complex, so I think it lends sort of a Greek tragedy aspect to it. Quite tragic because her love will be unfulfilled; that sort of thing.Jason Momoa, who stars as Conan, is a big fan of the character and the franchise. How familiar were you with the character and its legacy?I was fairly familiar with it, because of my brother. He had a lot of Robert E. Howard’s work, and he liked the comic books and things like that. I’ve never seen the full Arnold Schwarzenegger films. I mean, I remember seeing snippets on Saturday afternoon TV here and there, so I kind of have some images from it, but I think those were more campy. Jason, to me, looks like he walked straight out of Robert E. Howard’s conception of this character. It’s amazing.What is it about these darker roles that you seem to be drawn to?Well, see, not really, if you think about it. I think I just play strong women. Like, I saved the world on Charmed for five years, and I saved the world in Planet Terror. I did one movie where I was pretty sarcastic — that’d be Jawbreaker — but other than that, really just strong female characters. Not necessarily bad, but people unfortunately tend to mix that up.Conan the Barbarian (2011) opens this weekend in the US.","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"Winter, women","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/vcx.jpg","slug":"five-favorite-films-with-rose-mcgowan"},{"id":"47508852680028","title":"Five Favorite Films with Julian Schnabel","content":"Five Favorite Filmsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Five Favorite Films with Julian SchnabelThe Oscar-nominated director of The Diving Bell and the Butterfly and this week's Miral shares his passion for the films that inspire him.by Luke Goodsell | March 25, 2011 |  CommentsAs an accomplished modern artist, sometime provocateur and acclaimed film director, Julian Schnabel’s long and diverse career has taken him from much-lauded exhibitions of his paintings to widespread critical praise — and several Academy Award nominations — for his movies.Schnabel’s feature-film career began with 1996’s Basquiat, a portrait of fellow American painter Jean-Michel Basquiat that allowed the director to explore his interest in lives lived on the margins of society. His follow-up, 2000’s Before Night Falls, garnered star Javier Bardem’s first Oscar nomination, for his affecting portrayal of exiled Cuban writer Reinaldo Arenas. It was Schnabel’s next film, however, that solidified his reputation as a unique director with a bold stylistic approach: 2007’s The Diving Bell and the Butterfly, shot largely through a subjective POV of the paralyzed, wheelchair-bound Jean-Dominique Bauby, was a critical smash, earning the filmmaker a nomination for Best Director from the Academy.This week, Schnabel returns with his latest project, Miral. Drawn from the novel by Rula Jebreal, it’s an emotional journey that follows several generations of Palestinian women against the turbulent landscape of the Arab-Israeli conflict, with the central story refracted through the experience of teenage Miral — played by Slumdog Millionaire‘s Freida Pinto.We sat down with Schnabel this week and asked him to talk about his Five Favorite Films, and in doing so got some insight into his own directing process. “Okay, let’s try to figure them out,” Schnabel ponders, with the first of several long, thoughtful pauses. “I mean, I like Kaspar Hauser by Werner Herzog and… I think I need 10, man. [laughs] Viridiana by Bunuel… Raging Bull, Mafioso by Alberto Lattuada… did I say 400 Blows? Oh, another movie that I loved that I’d put up there is I Am Cuba. It’s a responsibility to talk about the movies and they all have different qualities. I think there are things that exist in these other movies that don’t exist in the first five.”&nbsp;Andrei Rublev (1966, 93% Tomatometer)&nbsp;Well, I think one thing is I love seeing the 15th century in black and white, in the 20th century. The physical imagery… that scene in the balloon at the beginning of the movie, the way that it’s cut together and the way that it functions and what he’s looking at. The sound, the music. Tarkovsky is one of my favorite directors and I think there’s just a great abstract quality in his films, where you see something and, as you’re looking at it, it transforms in front of your eyes. Things happen that you can’t believe you’re looking at — a horse falling down a flight of stairs; all of a sudden there’s a moment where you’ve got Christ, in the snow, carrying his cross up a hill. The kind of subliminal violence that occurs — when this guy gouges the eyes out of one of those journeymen, artisans that are leaving the reconstruction of a church; the apathy in the violence reminds me of the W.H. Auden poem, “Musee des Beaux Arts.” The old masters, they really knew about human suffering.And I guess in that particular film, what I’m thinking about is the length of the takes, and the surprise of what you actually see being filmed. The way slow motion is used in that movie also; the way that movies are not like that anymore. The scale and the depth of field of what you’re seeing is vast. So there’s a poetic quality to that. I’d have to mention The Passenger also, because there’s a moment when Antonioni has Jack Nicholson sticking his arms outside of a cable car, and for that moment you just have this sense of observing observation — that’s a big part of moviemaking to me, or painting. That kind of filmmaking, where the camera is still but everything around it is moving, and moving at different speeds, is something that I’m attracted to.The Battle of Algiers (1966, 99% Tomatometer)&nbsp;The notion of making a fiction — meaning you look at it and you think it’s all documentary footage, but it’s all shot. And the reality factor of that is something that makes you able to escape into the film; the fabric of that fiction is so believable and completely knitted together that you buy the proposition of the film — even when you see people getting shot and there’s no blood coming out of their bodies or whatever. There’s something about shooting something [in black and white] — and I’m talking about two movies that are in black and white, we should say, except for the part [in Andrei Rublev] where they show the color of the fresco of the Russian icons. I really like movies that are in black and white, because you feel like you are watching a movie. We associate it with things that were filmed at that time, that would have been filmed in black and white. So there are different concessions and commitments to make to a limited palette for a reason. When I make a movie like Miral, there’s a kind of reversal stock that I’m using outside and sometimes it really feels like Technicolor, like a movie like Exodus, and there are other moments when it’s rougher and it feels like The Bad Lieutenant, or something like that.The Godfather (1972, 100% Tomatometer)The Godfather, Part II (1974, 98% Tomatometer)&nbsp;&nbsp;Godfather one and two, as one movie — but not blended together; I don’t think that worked when they tried to combine them [for the TV version]. I have to just say that The Godfather is a quintessential American film, where it’s absolutely satisfying. The writing is so excellent — what is being said, and the nuance of what is being said, is so understood. And the color, again, situates you in a particular moment in time. It’s a portrait of America. It’s one of those things where storytelling and acting found one of those magical, elegant solutions…Raging Bull (1980, 98% Tomatometer)&nbsp;…and it’s something that happens with Raging Bull, also. And Marty Scorsese’s notion of sound — the memory. Sound memory is so important in Raging Bull; when you see the scene where Robert De Niro shows Cathy Moriarty his father’s house and tells him about the bird — “It was a bird, it’s dead” — and what’s going on around in the street, and you realize how important sound is. The other thing is the acting: Joe Pesci and Robert are so great together. I mean, the hardest thing in the world to do is just shoot two people in a room. All these other things are very easy to do — you get 150 people, you turn your camera on, you create a situation and as long as nobody looks at the camera you can make them seem very real. [Two people in a room] is really difficult. If I think of Robert Duvall, say, talking to Al Pacino in The Godfather two, when Al says to him, “Well what’d you get my son for Christmas?” and he says, “I got him a little car,” and Robert Duvall puts his hand over the couch — these are gestures that people understand as human gestures and they bring you into the storytelling.The 400 Blows (1959, 100% Tomatometer)&nbsp;Here’s one where the music is so important. And the decision where the camera movement is. There’s one moment in particular in 400 Blows, where the two boys skip school and they go into this centrifuge, and the kids are spinning around and you’re watching the movie and then all of a sudden you realize you’re watching something on the screen — you’re seeing this pole in the middle and these bodies flying by. I guess they’re just epiphanies of humanness that resonate, and I guess all that comes out of really physical human decisions — whether it’s about where you point your camera, what and how you’re editing, or how people are acting. But in all of these movies I can’t think of one that is depending on special effects. So I would say that what drives me is something that has to do with things that seem much more fundamental to storytelling, that are simple things… but maybe that’s because I’m a primitive kind of person.&nbsp;Julian Schnabel’s Miral is released in theaters this week.","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"christmas, 2020, quibi, Mystery, First, E!, ID, Rocketman, Baby","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/vcxz.jpg","slug":"five-favorite-films-with-julian-schnabel"},{"id":"47508852805985","title":"Five Favorite Films with Stephen Merchant","content":"Five Favorite Filmsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Five Favorite Films with Stephen MerchantThe Hall Pass star also chats about conspiracy thrillers and being a film critic.by Tim Ryan | March 1, 2011 |  CommentsThe multitalented Stephen Merchant has proven himself to be one of the freshest comic voices in recent years. The co-creator of The Office and Extras (with longtime collaborator Ricky Gervais, with whom he co-directed the 2010 comedy Cemetary Junction),Merchant’s blend of outrageous scenarios and deep pathos makes for potent observational comedy. Known for his supporting roles in Hot Fuzz and Tooth Fairy, Merchant has also worked as a radio personality, a stand-up comic, and, in his early adulthood, a film critic. Currently, he stars in the Farrelly brothers’ comedy Hall Pass and has a voice role in Gnomeo and Juliet. In an interview with RT, Merchant shared his favorite movies, and talked about his love of New York’s cinematic sensibilities, why he relishes supporting roles and why he’d love to make a conspiracy thriller or a musical.&nbsp;The Apartment (1960, 91% Tomatometer)&nbsp;Number one that always springs to mind is Billy Wilder’s The Apartment. I’m sure you’re familiar with that film. It’s one of those movies which manages to combine all sorts of flavors. People tend to think of it as a romantic comedy, but actually it has some quite dark elements; the Shirley MacLaine character tries to kill herself at one point. And that’s the sort of movie, I like to think — in terms of the sort of films I would like to try and make — are films which are hard to pigeonhole. It has elements of humor, maybe, but there’s also drama in there. Billy Wilder’s one of my heroes, because I think he’s able to sort of step between different genres and make masterpieces.Even with something like Sunset Boulevard, there’s a really dark strain of humor running through the whole thing.Oh, absolutely. And you know, obviously, even something like Some Like It Hot begins with the St. Valentine’s Day Massacre. He’s just incredibly accomplished, and again, a very good example of a master storyteller. Like I said, I think it’s very hard to tell stories in cinema in particular, because an hour and a half seems like a long time, but actually it’s a very short amount of time to tell a story and to create characters, to create a world that you care about. So yeah, someone like him, he’s an absolute master.After Hours (1985, 92% Tomatometer)&nbsp;What else would I include on a list of top five? That is so tricky because that list varies on a week-to-week basis. Another movie I’m really a fan of — and again, I think it mixes all kinds of flavors — is Martin Scorsese’s After Hours. That’s a really eccentric little film. He made it, if you recall, he was trying to make The Last Temptation of Christ and that fell apart, so he went back to basics and wanted to make this sort of short film that he could shoot very quickly in just a couple of months on a small budget. It’s a very, sort of, eccentric film about Griffin Dunne trying to get home from a date that’s gone wrong. It’s like a black comedy equivalent of Taxi Driver; it uses New York as one of the characters, to some degree — this kind of weird, almost Hansel and Gretel forest kind of place, where you can’t escape and there’s strange oddities around every corner. It’s shot through with this brilliantly black sense of humor. Lots of really quotable moments. The playing, as well, from particularly Griffin Dunne, who I think is such an underrated performer, a really great performance of a man just trying to contain his ever increasing panic and rage. Yeah, that’s a film I’ve watched endlessly.Now that we have cell phones, I wonder if After Hours would be over in five minutes.You know, I actually have to say that I think modern technology is really [stymieing] screenwriters nowadays. I mean, mobile phones, the internet, wifi, all those things, they don’t work for a screenwriter. How many times did you ever see an episode of 24 where Jack Bauer has to lose his phone, or break his phone, or there’s no signal? Because it’s just such a godsend; it’s like a teleporter, you know? It’s too useful, a mobile phone. The classic movie moment of sort of running to the airport to see the girl or to try and get everyone out of the building to stop the bomb, nowadays it’s just a phone call. You don’t have to race through the streets to get the airport; just give her a call. “You’re at the airport? I’m in love with you! I’ll be there in 10 minutes!” It’s so cheap, because everyone knows what’s happening. When you see a closeup on the phone, and the bars signal how much reception there is, they all disappear. “I’ve got no reception!” That’s why increasingly horror films all have to be set in the North Pole.Play It Again, Sam (1972, 97% Tomatometer)&nbsp;I have to include a Woody Allen film in the list. I’m not sure which one, though. I love him dearly. I mean, he’s such an inspiration to me. And again, this list could change — and particularly, his movie choice could change tomorrow or this afternoon. The one I always love rewatching for pure comedy, for just gags that really resonate with me — which he didn’t direct, but it’s based on a play that he wrote — is Play It Again, Sam, which just has a couple of comic set pieces that really amuse me. I can watch them endlessly. And it’s sort of one of those movies that I always make other people watch or I loan to people. If they take as much joy in them as much as me, then I know that we’re going to be friends for life. [Woody Allen] plays a film critic, funnily enough, and he is sort of given romantic advice by the ghost of Humphrey Bogart, and Bogie appears throughout in places to offer him love advice. But as he sort of points out, you know, “I’m not you.” It’s him trying to sort of romance girls and meet women after his marriage falls apart. But it’s very, very funny, and it just — a bit like After Hours, in a way — it sort of captures the desperation of single men, single men who don’t feel comfortable chasing girls. It has loads of very funny set pieces. It has a sequence where he’s setting up his apartment for a blind date, which is just, to me, one of the most inspired comic routines I’ve ever seen. It’s physical, but it’s verbal as well; it’s sort of him at his most charming, effortless. It’s really good.I’m noticing a trend here; you’ve chosen several movies that are a knife’s edge between comedy and tragedy. That must have inspired The Office.Yeah, particularly movies like The Apartment. I’m a big fan of movies that take very small situations or small incidents and make them feel more epic, in some way. Like, a movie I really love — I’m not going to include it in my top five — but a movie I really love is The Bridges of Madison County, the Clint Eastwood movie. It seems like maybe it’s sort of a sentimental weepy, but when you rewatch it, it’s just very elegantly made, you know? It’s rare that you see a movie romance featuring two older people, and it doesn’t feature any kind of elaborate romantic conceits. It’s just two people who meet and, for whatever reason, they find a connection and they kind of fall in love. And you see it. It’s a very slow-burning film, but it builds to a really huge romantic conclusion about whether Meryl Streep will choose to stay with her husband or to go off with Clint. And they manage to make just that decision — whether she’s going to climb out of the car and go off with Clint, or she’s going to stay with her husband — they make it feel huge, they make it feel epic. I think that’s something that cinema’s very good at doing, and it’s very tricky to pull off. And that’s the sort of thing I prefer to, say, the grand drama of something like The Lord of the Rings.The Squid and the Whale (2005, 93% Tomatometer)&nbsp;I wish I could choose something cool and artsy. I’ll tell you what I saw, which I think kind of shot into my list, and I only watched it recently — I’m ashamed that I didn’t see it earlier — was The Squid and the Whale. It was absolutely fantastic. Again, I guess, similar in tone to the other films I’ve mentioned. A sort of, you know, domestic comedy-drama, but very, very truthful, and brilliant performances again. Is it Jesse Eisenberg who’s in that movie? Yeah, I just thought that was tremendous. Luckily, my parents never got divorced, I never went through that, but it really takes you into the experience of watching your parents split up. And I think cinema’s at its best when it makes you feel an experience that you’ve never had yourself, and sort of understand the emotions of it. I was really impressed by that movie. Just a great, kind of… shot through with this black spine of humor.You’ve named three New York movies…Maybe it’s because I’ve always been a fan of New York humor, particularly Woody Allen, that sort of wiseass humor. And I think a lot of New York movies use the city so well. New York is so unique, it has such an identity. Somewhere like California is much more anonymous. You know, people drawing from these endless roads that blur into each other — much of the rest of America sadly is becoming as uniform as that, whereas New York has such a visual identity. And I guess maybe because I live in London and I lived before that in Bristol, which is a pretty big city. It’s a place I can respond to. Cary Grant was from Bristol, he was born in Bristol, and actually my grandmother, who’s still alive, used to work with Cary Grant’s father in a boot factory. She said he was a good looking man.Singin’ in the Rain (1952, 100% Tomatometer)&nbsp;I will choose Singin’ in the Rain. To me, that symbolizes everything that can be great about movies. It’s just joyous, it’s just perfectly constructed. It’s just like everything came together; you know, there’s an alchemy that happens with certain films, which, however proficient you are as a filmmaker, however talented you are, and however many hits you’ve had, there has to be a sort of magic dust that happens somewhere. Often when it does, the whole world relates to it or engages with it in some way, and I think that film is such a good example of that. It happened with Casablanca. Just all these elements that could have gone wrong; any one of them could have been too much — too much sugar, too much salt, you know — but somehow the whole recipe’s perfect. And Singin’ in the Rain, to me… It’s like every scene I look forward to, and I can rewatch it endlessly. It’s just quite beautiful. They don’t make them like that anymore, I think.&nbsp;Next, Merchant talks about being a film critic, and why he’d like to do a conspiracy thriller.RT: I was delighted to learn you were a film critic in college.Stephen Merchant: In college and just after, as well, yes. I did it sort of semi-professionally for a couple of years at university.Is it odd to have been a critic and then, now, to read reviews of yourself?Yes it is. It is weird. I don’t want to insult film critics, but I felt uncomfortable, after a while, doing it. I remember I watched the movie Swingers, which I had to review, and I absolutely loved Swingers, and I sort of thought, “I’d rather be up there making the movie than down here talking about it.” So that was one of the reasons I stopped doing it, really, because I just felt like I didn’t have the authority to talk about other people’s work. I guess we all talk about it privately, but maybe I didn’t feel like I was informed enough. And since I’ve been making things myself, I just admire anyone who gets something made; it’s just so hard to make anything. I don’t mean just the mechanics of it, in terms of raising funds and so on. It’s just, getting anything to make sense; it’s really tricky, it’s really tricky. I think there’s a place for good criticism. Unfortunately, I think there’s a lot of bad critics as well, just like there are a lot of bad filmmakers.[rtimage]siteImageId=10241210[/rtimage]I know you still periodically direct episodes of the American Office; have you had much involvement with the international versions, and are you excited that the basic concept has been so widely translated?I haven’t. I mean, we are made aware of what’s happening internationally, but we’re not involved, you know, in the Chilean version or the French version, chiefly because we don’t, obviously, speak those languages. And also, one of the rules that we set for ourselves, even with the American version when it got going, was not to sort of interfere, really, because it seems to us that we did our version, and if we meddle with other people’s, I’m worried we’d just be trying to replicate ours, when actually what you need to do is sort of find a different, new perspective on it, like a cover version of a song. With Greg Daniels, who did the American version, we were always urging him to sort of spread his wings and almost forget our version and fly off in different directions. I think that’s obviously what they did, and I think that’s one of the reasons it’s been a success. I think that’s the biggest contribution we like to say we’ve made, is to sort of not meddle.You’re somebody who’s directed, you’ve written, you’ve produced, you’ve done standup comedy. When you’re acting in, say, Hall Pass, and you have this character, how do you approach it when you’re not the guy calling the shots?My feeling is that I’m there to do a job of work in someone else’s project, so for me to try and interfere too much is rude, it’s disrespectful, and you can fall on your face, because you’re not seeing the bigger picture, because you’re just one small part of it. I’ve been lucky in that the projects I’ve made, the actors have always been kind of willing to do what we ask of them. I think if you’re in a project and you don’t respect the people involved, you probably shouldn’t be doing it. But also, to me, acting in movies and stuff is sort of like a day off. I feel that my day job is writing, directing, and sort of popping up in acting in films — the sort of films that I wouldn’t make myself, but look like fun to be involved with and fun to watch — that’s sort of what I do, really. I don’t consider myself a jobbing actor. So I like to think I kind of offer my suggestions and I think I’m quite collaborative. I like to improvise, or to change lines, and there’s a few lines in Hall Pass which I managed to throw in that weren’t in the script. But generally speaking, I’m happy to sort of do what I’m told, really.[rtimage]siteImageId=10241211[/rtimage]Your comic sensibilities and the Farrellys’ would seem, at first glance, to be polar opposites. What attracted you to Hall Pass?I think it was exactly for that reason, in a way. It’s not the sort of movie I would write, it’s not the sort of movie I would dream up, but it is the sort of movie that I probably would laugh at. You know, if I was in good spirits, if I was out on a Friday night, and I was at the movies, it’s the sort of movie that would kind of get me, because there’s a part of me that likes that sort of childish, naughty, schoolboy rude humor. There’s something kind of joyously adolescent about the Farrellys that I think is really appealing. In a way, that was part of the reason for me to do it, because it allows me to… You know, I’m chewing the scenery, really; let’s be honest. I’m a massive ham. I’m really acting like a maniac, and they totally allowed me to do that. Whereas, say, Ricky Gervais doesn’t. You know, he likes me to underplay everything and try and be as subtle as I can. So it’s a different flavor. I’m a big fan of Owen Wilson; I think he’s great. And also, I think, the danger is that you can get pigeonholed as a certain kind of person. Like I said, I admire someone like Billy Wilder from a filmmaking perspective because he sort of dabbles in all kinds of genres, really. And even though I’ve made my reputation with a certain breed of comedy, it doesn’t mean I can’t enjoy other kinds.I read somewhere you were thinking, maybe in the future, you’d do a musical or a conspiracy thriller. Is anything like that in the works, or is that just sort of what you’d hope if the stars aligned?The musical I would put on backburner is because it just seems so difficult to do that. But I’ve always been of them when they’re done well. If we did that list of top five films, I’m sure I could do the top five conspiracy thrillers again. It’s a genre that I love, so I can imagine myself approaching something like that. But it’s just waiting for the right idea to sort of gel. It feels like an interesting time for another spate of those kind of movies, you know, given what’s going on in the Middle East and things like Wikileaks. It seems like there’s almost a space again for that kind of paranoid thriller.&nbsp;Both Hall Pass and Gnomeo and Juliet are playing in theaters now.","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"Dark, Film, child's, Acorn, and, Cartoon","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/fds.jpg","slug":"five-favorite-films-with-stephen-merchant"},{"id":"47508851065176","title":"Five Favorite Films with Max Winkler","content":"Five Favorite Filmsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Five Favorite Films with Max WinklerThe writer-director of Ceremony on his favorite movies and making his feature debut.by Luke Goodsell | April 8, 2011 |  CommentsFirst-time writer-director director Max Winkler isn’t a household name like his dad, but that may very well change in the future. The 27-year-old son of Happy Days‘ star and producer Henry Winkler has several buzzed-about projects in the works, including the comedy The Adventurer’s Handbook, starring Jason Schwartzman, Jason Segel and Jonah Hill, the intriguingly-titled fantasy The Ornate Anatomy of Living Things, and a film he’s written with Jason Reitman attached to direct, Whispers in Bedlam.Reitman also serves as executive producer to Winkler’s directorial debut released this week, the comedy-drama Ceremony, in which precocious fantasist Michael Angarano crashes a wedding to pursue his older ex, played by Uma Thurman. An impressive debut, the film exhibits the influences of Wes Anderson, Hal Ashby and Noah Baumbach — which is a good thing — and it’s something that Winkler is the first to admit.“The Squid and the Whale changed my life when I saw it,” Winkler says of Baumbach’s 2005 movie. “Just in how you could have these great characters and not be so easy on them all the time. The Jeff Daniels character is one of my favorite characters on film: he believes in the myth of himself rather than who he really is, and I think that’s apropos for [Angarano’s character].”Winkler says he wrote the film, at Reitman’s urging, from a personal place. “He’s sort of the worst parts of myself,” he laughs, referring to Angarano’s protagonist. “It’s a really honest portrayal of what you’re like in that young, reckless part of your life; you feel everything almost too much, and you feel like you have the monopoly on all the world’s suffering and heartbreak and pain.”The director likens his experience to that of Reitman, who also had to work in the shadow of a famous father. “I think that’s one of the reasons that we probably work so hard and produce movies at a young age,” he explains, “immediately trying to get past the misconception. We saw our fathers work that hard, and we wanted to get right out of the gate and make something that was particularly us.”We asked Winkler to submit his Five Favorite Films… and here they are.&nbsp;Paper Moon (1973, 90% Tomatometer)Tremendously influential to me, especially in regards to Ceremony. The writing, the tone, the camerawork, the happy and sad moments; often playing against each other at the same time. Bogdanovich blows my mind continuously.The Last Detail (1973, 92% Tomatometer)&nbsp;Probably the seminal movie in regards to what it means to be a man in changing times. Hal Ashby is one of the great legends of tone and emotion without it ever feeling too forced. A movie that also argues the important point: “It’s just as easy to get it the way you want.”Stardust Memories (1980, 71% Tomatometer)I could choose any of Woody Allen’s movies and would be able to sleep well at night. A true master of cinema and way more of a director’s director than people give him credit for, especially in his collaborations with the greatcameraman Gordon Willis. With the exception of Hannah and Her Sisters and Manhattan, Stardust Memories has always left me the most emotional.The Life Aquatic With Steve Zissou (2004, 53% Tomatometer)When I was 13 years old my father took me to see the matinee showing of Bottle Rocket at the AMC Century City theaters. At our lunch following the picture, I proclaimed to my father with great certainty that all I wanted to do in life was to make movies. All of Wes’s movies have had a tremendous impact and influence on my generation but I believe his 4th film, The Life Aquatic, is perhaps his most underrated and in many ways the funniest. Everybody needs an Esteban in their life…The Bad News Bears (1976, 98% Tomatometer)In my humble opinion this movie is perfection. It’s a summer blockbuster for kids where the authority figure, played flawlessly by Walter Matthau, drinks beer with bourbon as he drives, like, 10 kids in his five seat car.&nbsp;Ceremony is in select theaters this week.","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"Golden, SXSW, Witch, Bros., Skip, and, Musicals, docudrama, Starz","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/safdsafa.jpg","slug":"five-favorite-films-with-max-winkler"},{"id":"47508852814179","title":"Five Favorite Films with Moby","content":"Five Favorite Filmsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Five Favorite Films with MobyPlus, the musician on the Oscar-nominated Waste Land, composing soundtracks, and collaborating with David Lynch.by Luke Goodsell | February 17, 2011 |  CommentsOne of the most accomplished and successful electronic musicians of the past two decades, Moby has also created a body of work synonymous with the world of film soundtracks. His 1991 techno hit “Go” sampled Angelo Badalamenti’s “Laura Palmer’s Theme” from David Lynch’s Twin Peaks, and his music has since accompanied dozens of films and television shows, from 007 to Michael Mann to Danny Boyle and beyond. (Not for nothing was his 1997 movie music compilation entitled I Like To Score.) He even came something of a full circle when Lynch directed the music video for his 2009 single, “Shot in the Back of the Head.”Moby’s tracks provide the musical foundation for Lucy Walker’s Oscar-nominated documentary Waste Land, which is being re-released in select theaters this week ahead of the February 27 Academy Awards. An unexpectedly moving piece, it chronicles the journey of Brazilian-born artist Vik Muniz as he returns to the favelas of Rio and engages the local “garbage pickers,” who work in a literal city of trash, to become a part of his art project. More than simply an eco-themed documentary, it’s a surprising human story that captures the transformative effect that art can have on peoples’ lives.Read through for our full conversation in which Moby discusses Waste Land, the issue of licensing his music, his impetus to compose original soundtracks… and what it was like to DJ his friend David Lynch’s wedding.But first, we got him to talk about his five favorite films.&nbsp;INLAND EMPIRE (2006, 72% Tomatometer)&nbsp;Well, in no particular order, and not to be sycophantic, number one would be INLAND EMPIRE, the last David Lynch movie. I saw it four times in the theater, at the IFC theater on Sixth Avenue in New York, and I loved it because it plays with a lot of narrative conventions but then disposes with them. It made of lot of more traditional filmmaking seem sort of adolescent to me. And I might be alone in my opinion, but I think it’s the best movie David Lynch has ever made.Fireworks (Hana-bi) (1997, 94% Tomatometer)&nbsp;Number two is Fireworks by Takeshi Kitano. I remember when I saw it, I love the way he marries in that movie… it’s emotional and impressionistic but it still has these amazing outbursts of violence. I can’t think of a single movie [like it] that goes from, in one instance,being very delicate and poetic, to being almost obscenely violent. I think he’s remarkable.Man Facing Southeast (1986, 83% Tomatometer)&nbsp;Number three, I don’t know the name of the director [Ed. note: Eliseo Subiela], unfortunately, but it was a movie made in the ’80s called Man Facing Southeast. It’s an Argentine film. I should really find out who the director is, ’cause I saw it a bunch of times in an art theater in the mid ’80s when it was released. I fell in love with it and I dragged all of my friends to go see it, and of course none of them liked it as much as I did, but something about it I just found incredibly powerful and it really resonated with me.Dead Man Walking (1995, 94% Tomatometer)&nbsp;And four… oh, this is tricky. I’m just trying to go through them in my head. It’s probably easier to pick 30 favorite movies as opposed to five. It might seem like an odd choice but I really loved it, the Tim Robbins movie Dead Man Walking. I just thought it was such beautiful, emotional, thoughtful filmmaking, and I’m surprised it hasn’t taken a bigger place in the western film canon.Them! (1954, 100% Tomatometer)&nbsp;Okay, so I can think of about 300 to possibly choose, but this was one of my favorite movies when I was growing up. It’s a movie called Them!; it’s about giant ants that invade Los Angeles. My friend Paul and I, when we were growing up, we had a videotape of it and we just watched it obsessively over and over again. Especially like the first 20 or 30 minutes of it, it’s so apocalyptic and quiet and disconcerting. And the sound design [of the ants] is amazing. I was gonna pick Godfather II or something a little more predictable, but I’ll go with Them! ’cause it truly is one of my favorite movies.&nbsp;Next, Moby talks about the score for Waste Land, licensing and composing music for soundtracks, and his friendship and collaboration with David Lynch.&nbsp;RT: You allowed Lucy Walker, who’s a friend, to use your songs for free in Waste Land — you must have really believed in the film.Moby: I’ve been friends with Lucy for about 17, 18 years now. When she explained the movie to me I really had no idea what she was talking about. On the surface of things, a movie about a Brazilian artist who makes art with people who live in a garbage dump doesn’t exactly sound like… well, it sounds like the sort of movie that eight academics would watch at Quad Cinema in New York City; so when she was working on it, I thought it was the sort of tiny labor of love movie that no one would ever actually see. So I’ve been really happy for her, and for Vik, and for everyone involved that it’s taken on a life of its own that’s been so much more than anyone expected. Traditionally artist biopics don’t get seen by too many people other than the artist and his or her family, so it’s really nice that so many more people have seen it and have ended up loving it.When you saw the film were you surprised by the human arc that the story takes in following the lives of the garbage pickers?Yeah. As I said, Lucy and I had been friends for quite a while and I really like the movies that she makes, but this one, it’s the first time she’s really been allowed to make her own movie. I really think that the filmmaking involved in the movie and the fact that it’s a documentary that does have this really remarkable narrative arc to it — it’s hard to talk about it without sounding too clichéd, ’cause I start using expressions like “a celebration of the human spirit,” but that’s kind of what it is.Did Lucy select the music for the soundtrack or did you collaborate on the choices?It’s funny, I basically just handed a whole bunch of music over to Lucy and gave her complete carte blanche to use what she wanted to use, however she wanted to use it. I made the music, but she’s the one who decided what was gonna be used and where. So once I was done making the music I handed it over to her and that was the end of my involvement in it… to just sit back and bask in her reflective glory.You’re no stranger to your music being licensed to films; do you always involve yourself personally in approving what context your songs are used in?Not really. For a while the reason I didn’t do that was because there was a long period where I didn’t actually own my music — so it wasn’t up to me really where my music was licensed, especially when it came to advertisements.Has that changed?Yeah, luckily now; somehow because my manager’s really smart, he was able to get control of some of my music. Now my manager and I control a lot of my music, so we can decide where it’s actually gonna be placed. But when it comes to licensing music to films, I’m honestly, for better or worse, just really happy to hand the music over to filmmakers and let them do with it as they see fit.Not to sound too much like a literary grad student, a book that really inspired me when I was growing up is the book Steppenwolf by Hermann Hesse, and at the very end he’s having this sort of psychedelic, psychotic breakdown and he’s desperately trying to control everything in his life; and he has this epiphany, realizing that life is this big messy complicated thing and the more you try and control things, the worse they end up being. So that’s sort of my professional ethos, especially with regards to music in films: I hand my music over to people and if they wanna use it, that’s great, and it’s not up to me how they use it or where they use it or when they use it — I’m just flattered that anyone would choose to use my music and I’m perfectly happy for them to do with it as they see fit.&nbsp;Have you ever been watching something and suddenly heard one of your tracks and thought, “Wow, I didn’t know my song was licensed to that?”Oh yeah, and sometimes it’s great and sometimes it’s terrible.Was there an instance where you went, “Oh, that’s not good; I don’t like this”?I went to go see the Tom Green movie, Freddy Got Fingered, which is… I really like The Tom Green Show but suffice it to say that the movie is, um… it’s not one of the better movies ever made. And half way through it as my friends and I were saying to each other that this is one of the worst movies we’d ever seen, one of my songs came up and my friends just started ridiculing me and laughing at me.And is there a moment in which your music’s been used that you’ve been really pleased with?Yeah, I’ve gotten really lucky because honestly, 99 per cent of the times when my music has been used in films I’ve been happy with the results. My favorite is the ending of the movie Heat, when Michael Mann uses a song of mine called “God Moving Over the Face of the Waters,” and that was one of the first times I’d ever licensed music to a movie, and I just remember going to the movie with a friend of mine and sitting there and hearing the music at the end and just being so kind of awed that this amazing filmmaker, who could have used any piece of music on the planet, had chosen to use mine for this really sort of powerful, emotional denouement. When music and film work well together it’s so much more powerful than, you know, the sum of the parts.Speaking of which, I liked your score for Southland Tales, which, I think, is an under-appreciated film…Oh I love Southland Tales. I actually just saw Richard Kelly the other night. When it came out it was almost universally reviled and I was really proud to work on it; I think it’s a challenging, amazing movie. I understand why some people might not like it, but I thought, if nothing else, it should have been celebrated for trying to do something really idiosyncratic and really different.&nbsp;What was it like scoring a film that was so dense narratively, and so strange in tone? Did you collaborate with Richard when he was writing the thing, or did he come to you afterward and ask you to compose music?Well what was interesting, and I don’t know if this has happened too many times with musicians before, was that I basically scored the script. The music was all done before they started shooting, because he wanted to be able to listen to the music while he was shooting. So he sent me this script which was really obscure and Byzantine and difficult and I loved it, because at the end of reading the script it made no sense to me whatsoever. And so the music was all either compiled or written while it was just in script form. The movie itself had so many iterations. There’s one four-hour long cut that was also very difficult and very obscure and very strange, and of all the cuts that was my favorite one but it also seemed like it was the cut that most people hated.And most of us, sadly, have never seen.Well it’s long and difficult; it’s even longer and more difficult and obscure than the finished cut. I’m sure he’s got it floating around somewhere, if you ever see him he’d probably be more than happy to give you a copy.Is there a particular something that appeals to you in a film or director, like Richard Kelly and Southland, that makes you want to compose original music for a project?I guess, I mean there are so many conventional movies in the world and there are a lot of musicians who are really good at writing conventional movie music. I don’t think I’m one of those people, so I don’t have much interest in writing conventional score or working on conventional movies. I’m much more interested in working on stuff that’s odd and idiosyncratic and low budget and will probably never get seen by anybody. My one remaining film music dream is to write the music for a Takeshi Kitano movie, ’cause he’s one of my favorite filmmakers. I mean, if Steven Spielberg and Takeshi Kitano came to me on the same day and asked me to write music for one of their movies I would have to say “no” to Steven Spielberg and an enthusiastic “yes” to Takeshi Kitano. Just because, as I said, there are so many normal, conventional movies — and they’re good — and they tend to benefit from having normal, conventional scores, so I feel like you just leavethat world to the people who are good at it. I’m much more interested in working with the oddballs who make movies that might never get seen.&nbsp;Well on that note, you’re friends with David Lynch — have you two ever considered working together on a feature?Yeah, I would love to. He’s one of my heroes, and it’s really interesting becoming friends with your heroes. If David Lynch makes another movie I will happily make coffee. I’ll happily clean up the set when everybody else is done with it.So long as it’s David Lynch signature coffee.Yeah… I would do anything. We’ve collaborated on a lot of different things. I’ve done music for his DLF TV, which is his meditation charity, so I’ve done a lot of music for that, and he made a music video for me, and I DJed at his wedding; so we’ve done a lot of sort of strange non-filmic collaborations, but yeah — if he ever decides to make another feature, I mean I would literally drop whatever I am doing to just, I don’t know, sit and park his car.What was on the playlist for David’s wedding? Were there any special requests?You know, it was funny: My wedding gift to David and his wife was to DJ at their wedding and I was the most generic, bog-standard wedding DJ. Some people might imagine the soundtrack for a David Lynch wedding being like the slowed-down sound of a box of glasses being broken while an18th-century operatic piece is played backwards pitched down three octaves, but no, instead I was playing “Brown-Eyed Girl” by Van Morrison. Most of the people there were friends and family, so there was me just like the generic wedding DJ in the corner playing CDs.What did you think of David’s recent dance track, “Good Day Today”? Your single “Go” sampled Twin Peaks and it seems almost like David was nodding back in your direction with his song.Yeah. I love his music. It’s funny, I really like David’s music, I like his singing, but he’s sort of shy about it, so I’ve had those experiences where I’ve been around him and I’ve asked to hear music and he’ll get kind of shy; which is of course unjustified because the music that he makes is, I think, really special.Well he has mentioned in interviews that he’s in awe of you as a musician…Which is… I mean, it’s unjustified but it’s flattering.You’ve got a new album, Destoyed, on its way soon — what can we expect from that, musically?The album is music that was written in hotel rooms late at night, so it’s quite atmospheric. The way I describe it is that it’s like broken-down electronic music that was written in hotel rooms at 2 o’clock in the morning. So it’s very melodic but sort of disconcerting at the same time.Waste Land is released to selected theaters in Los Angeles this week, with New York to follow.","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"Month, media, international, Islander, BET, Apple, shows, ABC, GoT, Oscars, DirecTV, doctor, Turner, Disney","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/xczv.jpg","slug":"five-favorite-films-with-moby"},{"id":"47508857426320","title":"Five Favorite Films with Russell Brand","content":"Five Favorite Filmsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Five Favorite Films with Russell BrandThe Get Him to The Greek star stops by The Rotten Tomatoes Show.by RT Staff | June 11, 2010 |  CommentsWith roles in Forgetting Sarah Marshall, the recently Certified Fresh Get Him to The Greek, and the upcoming Despicable Me, Russell Brand has made his mark in recent big screen comedies. And well, it certainly doesn’t hurt to be romantically linked to pop superstar Katy Perry, one of People’s Most Beautiful for 2010. With both Greek and Despicable in theaters this Summer, Brand’s brand (too easy?) of comedy will continue its raucous romp through your local cineplex for the upcoming months.With a very diverse list of films and a Five Favorites first, Brand stopped by The Rotten Tomatoes Show on Current to share five of his favorite movies. Check them out in the video below!If you’re interested in learning more about Brand’s favorites, they’re listed here:The Elephant Man (1980) at 91%One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest (1975) at 96%Monty Python’s Life of Brian (1979) at 96%Garage Girls (1982) at NSFWThe Matrix (1999) at 86%","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"Tarantino, tv, Worst, Pictures, and, what, on, fiction, thriller, stand-up, FirstLook, spanish, Holiday, spy, Rey","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Five-Favorite-Films-with-Russell-Brand"},{"id":"47508849300807","title":"Five Favorite Films with Juno Temple","content":"Five Favorite Filmsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Five Favorite Films with Juno TempleThe future star of The Dark Knight Rises chats about her latest project, the road-trip comedy Dirty Girl.by Luke Goodsell | October 6, 2011 |  CommentsJuno Temple’s star is definitely on the rise. The daughter of punk filmmaker Julien Temple, the 22-year-old English-born actress began her career with supporting roles in movies like Notes on a Scandal, Atonement, and St. Trinian’s — and later delivered a lead performance in Jordan Scott’s excellent, unfairly maligned boarding school drama, Cracks. She’ll soon headline several films including William Friedkin’s Killer Joe, Jonas Akerlund’s Small Apartments and the long-percolating lesbian werewolf project Jack and Diane, in addition to starring as a “street smart Gotham girl” in Christopher Nolan’s The Dark Knight Rises — a role that has fans speculating could be anything from Selina Kyle’s sidekick Holly Robinson to Harley Quinn to a female Robin.In the meantime, Temple appears in this week’s Dirty Girl, an autobiographical comedy-drama from debut director Abe Sylvia. Set in the strange world of Oklahoma in 1987, the film follows the unlikely adventure of two misfit high schoolers — Temple’s trashy, promiscuous Danielle and Jeremy Dozier’s overweight, closeted Clarke — as they bust out of town and head for the Californian coast, a posse of angry and/or confused parents desperately on their trail. Which means Temple gets to wear anachronistic hot pants, flip the bird to religious zealots and strip to Sheena Easton’s “Strut” — things we’re pretty sure won’t be called upon for her employment in Gotham City. We caught up with Temple recently to chat about Dirty Girl, but first, she took a few moments to run through her all-time five favorite films.&nbsp;Badlands (Terrence Malick, 1973; 98% Tomatometer)Badlands, I think is one of the best love stories of all time. I think it’s beautifully shot and I think Sissy Spacek’s flawless in it. I watched that movie and — you know when your hair stands up on your body and you can’t control it? — that movie really affected me quite deeply, and I cried at the end. I based a character that I did last year in this movie called Killer Joe on Sissy Spacek in that movie. It’s a big inspiration for me. I think it’s a flawless movie.True Romance (Tony Scott, 1993; 91% Tomatometer)True Romance, again… a romance at heart, a young couple on the run doing crazy stuff. I think Alabama is one of the coolest characters of all time. I love the script — I think it’s so dynamic.Heathers (Michael Lehmann, 1988; 95% Tomatometer)Heathers — again, a kind of weird romance story and a dark tale. I love the dialogue in that movie. I probably shouldn’t quote it.Please do.“F–k me gently with a chainsaw.” [Laughs] But my favorite is, “You’re such a pillow case.” It’s so good — it’s like the worst insult ever but so funny. It’s just so funny and so gritty and I love the performances in it, and I think it has one of the best endings of all time.Joe Strummer: The Future is Unwritten (Julien Temple, 2007; 89% Tomatometer)Because I think it’s one of my dad’s masterpieces, and Joe Strummer was someone who was a big part of my upbringing and was one of my dad’s best friends. I have such great memories of hanging out with the two of them. It’s something that means a lot to me. I really think my dad put his heart and soul into that film and that’s the kind of film-making I wanna do. No, I don’t wanna direct. I wanna act.Did you learn from your dad, growing up around sets?Yeah. I did. I mean, I learned a lot. He helped me with a lot of tough decisions at times and, you know, he’s helped me with a lot of auditions, too. I really hope I get to do a movie with him one day, and he gets to direct me in a film. I would love that beyond words.I’d love to see him do another narrative feature. Absolute Beginners is kind of great.I agree. Earth Girls Are Easy is probably my number six on this list. [Laughs]Beauty and the Beast (La belle et la bête) (Jean Cocteau, 1946; 95% Tomatometer)La belle et la bête by Jean Cocteau. It’s the movie that made me want to be an actress. I was four-years-old and my dad had it on laser disc. I was being annoying and bratty or whatever, I was a child, and my dad said, “Hey, watch this movie.” This is when we lived in LA and we had this great giant striped couch and I was wearing — I remember this so well — this corduroy dress with red trim, and I lay there and started watching it. I had a really vivid imagination as a child but I had never seen anything like this in my life. Do you remember the scene where she faints and the Beast carries her and he has that incredible cloak that looks like it is actually the night sky? It’s insane. And he carries her and all the arms — we had these arms in our house, these giant arms that hold the candles — all the arms move and he’s carrying her and walks into her bedroom, and as he goes through the door with her, her clothes go from rags to riches. I remember that being the specific scene where I was like, “I wanna do that. How does that happen? I wanna be a part of that.” That was the day I knew I wanted to be an actress. Also, the way that the Beast smokes, when he looks at her and his skin smokes; and when he takes off the glove and his hand’s just smoking. The whole ending… it’s this weird, twisted ending.Next, Temple chats about her role in this week’s Dirty Girl, and how an English private school girl gets into character as a mid-West American teen.&nbsp;RT: It’s a curious character, this one. How did you end up being cast for the movie?Juno Temple: I got sent the script by my agent and I read it and of course I wanted to audition for it — I wanted the part immediately. I arrived at my audition and I was wearing cut-off denim hot pants, biker boots, ripped band t-shirt, a biker jacket that I’d sliced the sleeves off of, had a nose piercing and my dreadlocked hair that I hadn’t brushed in three weeks and I had a sh-tload of jewelry.This was all for character?No, it’s kind of the way I dress. I’m a big fan of ’90s grunge — the grungier the better. So I went in and did my thing, then got a phone call from my agent saying “They loved your audition, but they want you to come back in and take out the nose ring and brush your hair.” So I went back in looking slightly tidier.Begrudgingly so?[Laughs] I remember I was furious ’cause I had a 45-minute audition and I came out and my nose had closed. My ex boyfriend had to re-pierce my nose on the way home, and my nose was bleeding. [Laughs] It got re-pierced and it was back in for a while. Then I got a call back to come in and chemistry read with Jeremy [Dozier] and it was like an instant click. We just got on immediately in a way that was quite overwhelming.The film immediately establishes that your character’s in control — at least in the sexual sense. Was that something that appealed to you?Yeah, what attracted me was the journey she goes on, what she goes through — because she has this crazy arc. I liked the fiery, outrageous personality that she has in the beginning. She has attitude and she doesn’t care what people think. She’s gonna speak her mind and sometimes it pisses people off. But she’s very misunderstood, too — she’s misunderstood by her family, by her school; boys use her for sex and that’s all they care about. She doesn’t have any friends. Then Clarke comes into her life and I think fate brings them together. I’m a strong believer in that fate is real, but it only gets you so far — then you have to make the choice to do something. And so they do: they continue this incredible friendship and they really bring each other out of their shells. They really open each others’ eyes. I think that’s a great example of a true friendship, when you see the world through somebody else’s eyes and you like looking at the world that way. They do that for one another. I think the moral of the story is don’t judge a book by its cover, which I think is great when you look at all the sh-t that’s going on in schools — with the bullying and stuff. You know, what better than to say, “Some people aren’t gonna like you or take you for what you are, but some people will — and they’re gonna change your life.” They’re the people you should be hanging out with.I’m guessing high school in Oklahoma is not the way you grew up–[Laughs] Oh, I went to an English boarding school!So how do you become this teenager in the mid West in 1987?I talked to the director a lot about the kids in his school — ’cause it’s his story and nobody knows it better than him. We talked a lot about it and figured out how she’s gonna be. She’s an ’80s character but she also looks very ’70s, so she doesn’t quite fit into the world — she’s got hand-me-downs from her mom, because they can’t afford new clothes. So that makes her even more of a misfit. I love that she’s this kind of Cherie Currie character in this uptight Oklahoma high school — she really looks like she sticks out like a sore thumb. I loved that, the make-up and everything and the Farrah Fawcett bangs. I thought that was cool having her different to everyone else, because everyone notices her and are like, “Who the f–k is that?” So that was another thing, the costumes. And getting into the music — because like I said, I’m a ’90s grunge fan, so that really wasn’t my music scene, but once you listen to it and get into the idea of playing that character, it was brilliant.So now you’re a fan of Melissa Manchester?She’s extraordinary.How was it singing her song while she played behind you on piano?I’ve never been so nervous in my entire life. Singing A cappella with her playing piano behind me. I was so nervous. I’m shaking [Laughs] You can totally see it. She was so kind afterwards. She was so lovely to me and Jeremy. It was pretty cool to be singing Melissa Manchester’s power ballad that just blew a bunch of peoples’ minds in the ’80s and she’s there playing piano while you do it… it was a trip.Last question. I’m sure nobody’s asked you about this–The Dark Knight? Oh no, you’re not gonna ask about it. Okay. Because everyone’s been asking and I’m not allowed to talk about it.I just have one question: Is it true that you’re playing The Penguin?Obviously! I mean — look at me. [Laughs]Dirty Girl is in select theaters this week.","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"APB, Festival, theme, television, talk","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/ewrewr.jpg","slug":"five-favorite-films-with-juno-temple"},{"id":"47508849302856","title":"Five Favorite Films with Alan Tudyk","content":"Five Favorite Filmsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Five Favorite Films with Alan TudykThe Tucker &amp; Dale vs. Evil star also talks about his new movie and attending pirate faires.by Ryan Fujitani | September 29, 2011 |  CommentsComedic actor Alan Tudyk is what we affectionately refer to as a “that guy,” someone whose face is almost immediately recognizable but whose name tends to elude the average moviegoer. Remember Pirate Steve in Dodgeball? “Oh, that guy!” Remember Simon, who endures a hilariously bad drug trip, from the original 2007 comedy Death at a Funeral? “Oh, that guy!” Remember Hoban “Wash” Washburne from the cult sci-fi show Firefly (and its subsequent film sequel, Serenity)? “Oh, that guy!” Yes, whether you realize it or not, Alan Tudyk has been making you laugh for years.This week, Tudyk stars alongside Tyler Labine as the titular duo in the horror movie satire Tucker &amp; Dale vs. Evil, successfully adding “misunderstood hillbilly” to his colorful list of past characters. The film, in which a couple of backwoods hayseeds on vacation are mistaken for murderous psychopaths, generated quite a bit of positive early buzz and has already been stamped Certified Fresh, and though it opens theatrically this week in limited release, it’s already available via video on demand. RT was recently afforded the opportunity to speak with Tudyk, who absolutely gushed about his Five Favorite Films and went on to discuss his role as Tucker, his fear of horror movies, and his experience hanging out with pirates for a day. Read on for the full interview!All That Jazz (Bob Fosse, 1979; 87% Tomatometer)I’m going to go with All That Jazz for number one. It’s Bob Fosse directing a movie about himself; he changed the name to Joe Gideon from Bob Fosse. So he’s directing a movie about a musical choreographer/director who takes too many pills, sleeps with too many women, drinks too much; he’s a moviemaker who’s editing a movie while he’s doing a play and having hallucinations with musicals. It’s so unbelievable how he balances it all, and it’s Roy Scheider’s best performance, I think, ever. He’s amazing in it. It is so amazing.He’s a pretty despicable guy in the movie — I mean, he sleeps around on his girlfriend — but you love him. The doctors tell him not to take his drugs, but he does it anyway, and you still love him. You don’t blame him. And it’s sort of how Bob Fosse ended up dying, so he really forecasted his own death. I mean, he even put his girlfriend in the movie as his girlfriend — Joe Gideon’s girlfriend — and then cheated on her! Like, he had his character cheat on her. It’s so f***ing unbelievable. Just brilliant. That’s number one. That would be my, I have to say, overall all-time favorite. I’m just very impressed by that movie. It’s just really, really good. It’s got like four musical numbers in there, but they’re not like Glee. Some of them are in drug-induced hallucinations, and some of them are, he’s actually directing a musical. I’ve done plays; I’ve done one musical. But the first table read, when they’re going to put up this play, it is so like the table read on plays. I recognize so many things that they get right. Yeah, that’s my all-time favorite.Young Frankenstein (Mel Brooks, 1974; 94% Tomatometer)After that would be Young Frankenstein. I think that, laugh for laugh… I mean, if you’re going to go for more laughs, I think Blazing Saddles. But Young Frankenstein‘s just a better movie. More solid. And it’s Gene Wilder. I was such a huge fan of Gene Wilder when I was growing up that I even used to try to do… He used to do something; he would say nonsensical… He would make noise in movies without words. He would say things like: [mumbles incoherently], like that, and it made me laugh so hard when he would do that, that I would try to put it in movies when I started acting.I did a movie called 28 Days, and I’m in rehab, and we’re in a circle talking about our feelings, and the script said, “She calls on Gerhardt, but he’s crying and he can’t respond,” and she says, “Okay, we’ll come back to you.” And so it came out. “Gerhardt, would you like to say something?” [bawls incoherently] And I just make noise. [laughs] And then I snuck it into A Knight’s Tale when I’m trying to threaten Chaucer for the first time. I’m like, [frustrated mumbling]. I would just rip [Gene Wilder] off, totally try to mimic him. So, Gene Wilder, huge fan. That’s number two.What’s Up, Doc? (Peter Bogdanovich, 1972; 91% Tomatometer)Number three is What’s Up, doc?. Peter Bogdanovich directed. It’s his homage to Keystone Kops-type slapstick comedy movies. No, it’s not Keystone Kops; he does have Keystone Kops moments, but it’s… Not a slapstick movie; it’s called something else. They were really popular at one time, with like Cary Grant and Katharine Hepburn.RT: Screwball comedies?Screwball comedies! There we go. And it’s got Kenneth Mars, who’s also in Young Frankenstein, as an inspector with one arm. Kenneth Mars, who also does a great… He yells at them right at the end in Russian, but it’s not Russian; he just makes up a lot of noise. Madeline Kahn’s first movie; she’s brilliant in it. And Austin Pendleton, a young Austin Pendleton, who’s hysterical. And, unbelievably to me… My only understanding of Barbra Streisand was sort of this, what I’d seen of her peripherally; she always seems to be singing in some concert venue with a lot of scarves on or something. I don’t think of her as “sexy.” But she’s hot in that movie. She’s f***ing hot.Sexy Beast (Jonathan Glazer, 2000; 86% Tomatometer)And then, I’m going to go with Sexy Beast, a little off of the comedy. Why I love that movie so much is that Ray Winstone is such a badass. I’m a big fan of Nil by Mouth as well, and I knew him from Nil by Mouth. It starts out, he’s with his friends, and [speaking in a British accent] they’re all talking, out there at the restaurant, and he’s like, “Yeah, I’ll get the chicken thing.” “What chicken thing?” And then the friend comes in like, “Ah sh**, just leave it outside.” And they go, “We have something to tell you. Don’s coming.”And then you see him basically sh** his pants, like, “Don? Don’s coming? What’s Don coming for? No, no, God, not Don!” And I’m watching like, “Holy sh**! Who would Ray Winstone be afraid of? This better not be the Ben Kingsley role. This better not be that f***ing little Ghandi motherf***er coming in, scaring Ray Winstone.” And right after the first scene with him, he’s just riding in the car silently; he’s just quiet. Then he gets out of the car and goes, “I’ve got to change my shirt. I’m sweating like a f***ing ****!” [laughs] Oh my God! And he’s so good in it. And it was ultimately a love story, a love story. It was all about his love for his ex-porn actress wife. So f***ing awesome.Smokey and the Bandit (Hal Needham, 1977; 77% Tomatometer)And number five, I’m going to say Smokey and the Bandit. I’m back on the comedy. It’s between Smokey and the Bandit and OSS 117, which is a French movie — it’s sort of like their version of the Naked Gun movies, but their agent’s really good; he’s actually very good at many things. He just happens to be a complete moron. But he’s a lover, he knows many languages… Anyway, Smokey and the Bandit, Jackie Gleason’s performance and Sally Field’s; she was amazing. It’s also a good snapshot of America when being a truck driver was cool. [laughs] Being an 18-wheeler truck driver was like, “That’s a good job.” I mean, they were badasses, and you don’t really think of that now; they don’t have that same mystique. But Jackie Gleason as Buford T. Justice… He has his own f***ing entrance music; every time he shows up, they’ve got this tuba playing, he’s there on the scene, and he’s doing his schtick, doing the best stuff. He’s another character, like the Joe Gideon character in All That Jazz, who’s despicable. He’s a racist, he’s a terrible father, he’s a sh**y cop, and you just can’t wait for him to get back on the screen. He has a line in there, talking about Sally Field, who runs off, and she’s a dancer, and he says, “That’s what you get for poontangin’ around with a bunch of hippie show folk.” [laughs] That is the quality of stuff he’s doing in that movie; it’s just so brilliant.Next, Tudyk talks about Tucker &amp; Dale vs. Evil, how he chooses roles, being afraid of horror movies, and hanging out with pirates.&nbsp;RT: There aren’t many actors who can say they’ve played a pirate, a robot, a cowboy, and you even did the medieval thing in A Knight’s Tale. Now, you’re a misunderstood hillbilly. So what’s the typical selling point that really gets you interested in a role? How does someone who’s played as many varied roles as you have go about choosing his material?Alan Tudyk: I guess it’s just reading the script, and it being interesting. You know, you just follow what you like. Even like A Knight’s Tale. Something that people didn’t like — and some people still don’t like — about that movie was the choice of music, the way they used music in that movie. But when I read that script, it was like, “1437, jousting, the sound of Queen’s We Will Rock You can be heard,” and I was like, “What? That’s f***ing awesome. Yep, I’m ready. Let’s go. I want to go on that ride.”Dodgeball, I mean, that’s just crazy. Honestly, the first time I read it, I didn’t get it. I’m like, “I don’t understand… If they cut that pirate, this is a good script.” [laughs] That’s actually what I said, and my agent said, “I really want you to read it again.” I read it again, and I got it, and when we did the improv portion of the audition, I embraced it and found it just so bizarre. It was awesome.So what was your initial reaction when you first read the Tucker &amp; Dale script?[Note: Spoilers follow in the next paragraph]Well, I didn’t think it was going to work. As I was reading it, I got to the point where the first kid dies. [laughs] And I was like, “That’s great. He’s f***ing dead. Awesome. We’re going to kill people in this.” And I loved the Texas Chainsaw Massacre moment. But I was like, “There’s no way they can… They can’t continue. They can’t support this, because there’s going to come a point when it’s going to be too unrealistic to be believed, to be misunderstood as these killers.” And I’m reading it, and I’m like, “The cops! They would go get the cops,” and then they’re like, “You go get the cops,” and I thought, “Oh, cool. They are getting the cops.” Then, right about the time I’m thinking, “The cops would have shown up by now,” the cops show up! And we get out of the cops, and it keeps going, and by the end, he pulled it off.I mainly wanted to make sure I talked to Eli [Craig] about the way he saw the acting, like how he wanted it acted. Did he want to do it sort of winking at the camera, or did he want to actually be as serious as possible with the ridiculous situations? And [the latter is] what he wanted, and that’s what I wanted. So, I think, after that conversation, I was in Calgary within four or five days. Yeah, it was quick. There was somebody else playing Tucker who had made an agreement to do that early on and said, “I’ll do it,” and then two weeks before production said, “What do you mean? No, I’m not going to do that.”It’s interesting that you mention you talked to Eli Craig about the tone, because one of the first movies I thought of while watching Tucker &amp; Dale was Shaun of the Dead, which had a similar sort of tone throughout. How do you maintain that balance between slapstick humor and the sort of actual tension that exists in the movie?[Note: Spoilers follow in the next paragraph]Yeah, I don’t know! We just watched it yesterday because we were doing the DVD commentary, and there are certain scenes in it, like the one just post-woodchipper accident — and I love that part of the movie, because there’s that other kid who impales himself, sinking towards Tyler [Labine]’s face — and I come inside and I see him, and he’s like, “What happened to you?” and I think we played it straight, but it’s just so ridiculous. “What happened to me? I’ll tell you what happened, man! Holy s***!” But it isn’t… You’re right; there’s like a tip in there, a little… Because you’re also saying — there’s a line in there that kind of gets covered up, but I say, “We gotta hide all the sharp objects! Those kids are killing themselves out there!” — you’re saying stupid s***, but if you believe it, I guess, that’s the trick.&nbsp;And you definitely believe that Tucker and Dale are both completely exasperated by what’s going on outside the cabin.[laughs] Yeah, yeah. Without that, it wouldn’t… I think it’s the audience; as they’re watching, you know, how would you actually react in that situation? You would be beside yourself. You would be so exasperated. “How did she knock herself out again? What do you mean?”Your Five Favorite Films notwithstanding, were you ever a big genre movie guy? Were you into horror movies, and did you get any particular kick out of subverting the genre in Tucker &amp; Dale?Um… No. [laughs] I’m not a big horror movie fan. I am afraid of them; they scare me. The Shining had a huge effect on me. I could just think about those twin girls, and it would keep me up at night. Really scary. But I have… I wish I could remember the name of it! There was this terrible horror comedy that I loved that I found at a Blockbuster when I was young. I need to find this thing. I did love this movie because I rented it again and again, and it was a horror comedy. Basically, there was a brain that wanted to assemble a woman and put his brain inside of the woman that they assembled, and he enlists these two guys who work at some sh***y restaurant to get women and cut them up for him. And there’s like one woman they kill by making a hush puppy out of her head, and the brain has a voice, and he talks like this old Jewish man. I gotta find that movie. I’ll just Google “idiot, guys, hush puppy head.”[Editor’s Note: After some research, it’s been determined that the movie whose title Alan was unable to remember is the 1987 horror-comedy Blood Diner.]So I have liked that genre before, but it wasn’t something I was looking forward to lampooning. I just got excited about doing a comedy that had such high stakes with a director that wanted to play it real. There’s so much room for humor when you’re allowed to invest in the stakes, and not let s*** go by. That happens way too much; I hate that in a movie. I’m into a movie, and then they suddenly do something like, “Why would they do that? They wouldn’t care about that. He would tell him that. That’s too convenient; you guys are being convenient.” I think we did a good job of staying away from that as much as possible. There’s a couple moments, but we talk about it in the DVD commentary.One last, very brief question: Being that you played Steve the Pirate in Dodgeball, and you were sort of a space pirate on Firefly, do you celebrate International Talk Like A Pirate Day?I don’t, I don’t. I will, though. You know, I went to a pirate faire right before we did Dodgeball, to study pirate people. There are people who get together and play pirates. So it’s almost like Scarborough Faire, but it’s all pirate-themed. And I went out there with the actress Missi Pyle who played the Russian on the other team, crazy, bad-toothed, in red. Yeah, I would go to another pirate day. I have a movie of us at that pirate day and it’s pretty funny. But no, no I don’t. It has a place in my heart, and in my liver.Tucker &amp; Dale vs. Evil is in theaters this week, but it’s already available on video on demand.","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"york, Paramount, mission:, Fox","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/3434.jpg","slug":"five-favorite-films-with-alan-tudyk"},{"id":"47508850985293","title":"Five Favorite Films with Joel McHale","content":"Five Favorite Filmsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Five Favorite Films with Joel McHaleThe host of The Soup and star of Community talks films and his role in Robert Rodriguez's latest Spy Kids adventure.by Luke Goodsell | August 19, 2011 |  CommentsJoel McHale’s been making the abyss of modern culture that little bit more bearable over the past decade as the host of E!’s satirical The Soup, while he recently added a residency as the star of TV’s acclaimed series Community to his resume. It follows that his next step toward media ubiquity should be a big screen career (he’s already had supporting roles in Spider-Man 2 and The Informant), and this week McHale takes a somewhat unlikely starring role opposite Jessica Alba in Spy Kids: All the Time in the World in 4D — the latest in Robert Rodriguez’s hugely successful series of adventure films (this time presented in the fourth “dimension” of smell, with Odorama-style theater cards borrowed liberally from John Waters’ Polyester.)“You know, being in a kids movie — I’d never really thought about it in my life until it was presented to me,” says McHale. “My first inclination to do it was getting to work with Robert, and that’s how it came together.” In the film, McHale plays Wilbur Wilson, a sham TV host — irony noted — who pretends to hunt for real-life spies, unaware that his wife (Alba) is actually a secret operative herself (and that his dog is a robotic canine who sounds a lot like Ricky Gervais.)McHale admits he isn’t entirely sure why Rodriguez cast him. “I don’t know,” he laughs. “Because he wanted to grant a wish where, in some weird universe, Jessica Alba would agree to be with someone like me? My character is made the fool for a lot of it, and I think I do a lot of that in my real life.”One thing the director insisted upon was McHale master the art of the arched eyebrow, which, the actor says, took some craft. “I really wasn’t very good at that, but my eyebrow actually began to work after a while. And then I kept forgetting which one I was supposed to be using. I would practice in the mirror a couple of times — and I would look deranged. I kind of looked like I had a neurological disorder.”Asked for his Five Favorite Films, McHale requests we make a “special mention” of Submarine by Richard Ayoade — the filmmaker who directed one of the Emmy-nominated episodes of Community. “He’s the greatest guy,” McHale enthuses. “I wasn’t just saying it because I know him. I have thought about that movie so much since I saw it. I keep thinking about it and how remarkable it is.”Here then are Joel McHale’s all-time favorites.&nbsp;Dr. Strangelove, or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb (Stanley Kubrick, 1964; 100% Tomatometer)Dr. Strangelove, I think, is probably one of the funniest movies ever made. It operates on so many levels. Just that opening sequence when the planes are fueling — it is the most sexually suggestive opening of any movie, ever. And just George C. Scott. It’s an amazing movie.Blade Runner (Ridley Scott, 1982; 92% Tomatometer)&nbsp;Blade Runner, of course. A sci-fi film noir executed so well; I mean, it’s a flawlessly executed movie and it’s a beautiful story. And it’s Harrison Ford at his very finest — he should have won two Oscars for that.Monty Python and the Holy Grail (Terry Jones and Terry Gilliam, 1975; 95% Tomatometer)&nbsp;Then I’m gonna go with the Holy Grail. I think these movies always get pushed aside as being silly and yes, they are silly, which is one of the intents of the movies. It was just, as a child, and as I grew up and watched them as an adult, they were one of the reasons why I was like, “Oh, you don’t have to think the way that everybody thinks” — these guys just did whatever they wanted to do, and their imaginations ran wild. They were always a huge inspiration, and so that movie was such a great capsule of that. And so funny. So good.Children of Men (Alfonso Cuarón, 2006; 93% Tomatometer)&nbsp;Let’s go with Children of Men. That movie is just a perfect movie. Clive Owen just destroys that movie. And the message of that movie is just so beautiful. I think it’s some amazing filmmaking.Ikiru (Akira Kurosawa, 1952; 100% Tomatometer)&nbsp;Then I’ll go with Ikiru by Kurosawa. The scene about a man who died. The opening scene is like, “Oh, this guy died — let’s talk about his life.” And then it goes back. It is, you know, it was made in the ’50s and it was hard to get good prints of it, but now the Criterion Blu-ray is out and it looks a lot better. It’s just a beautiful movie, astonishingly; the movie and the message.&nbsp;Spy Kids: All the Time in the World in 4D opens this week.","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"Comics, Syfy, Musicals, Returns","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/sfdf.jpg","slug":"five-favorite-films-with-joel-mchale"},{"id":"47508852809058","title":"Five Favorite Films with William Fichtner","content":"Five Favorite Filmsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Five Favorite Films with William FichtnerThe ubiquitous character actor and star of this week's Drive Angry picks his all-time five.by Luke Goodsell | February 25, 2011 |  CommentsMovie obsessives know him by name, while everyone else will definitely be familiar with his face: William Fichtner is one of Hollywood’s finest and most prolific character actors, with supporting roles in dozens of films as varied as The Dark Knight, Heat, Black Hawk Down, Crash and Armageddon… to name just a handful.In this week’s deliberately trashy, neo-grindhouse actioner Drive Angry, Fichtner takes a co-starring role opposite Nicolas Cage and Amber Heard, playing a mysterious, black-suited pursuer known only as “The Accountant” — a supernatural agent hot on the trail of Cage’s hell-bent motorist. It’s a funny, eccentric performance that near steals the film, and has already drawn praises (and some Walken comparisons) from early reviews.“I had a great time doing it,” Fichtner says of his role, “the best time I ever had, working on a film. Probably my most fun character. I just liked the guy.” Curiously, for an actor who’s played numerous parts across the moral spectrum, Fichtner’s philosophy is, “If I don’t like the character, if I can’t find something, what am I gonna do with it? I can’t play somebody I don’t like.”Having discovered his co-star’s Five Favorite Films recently, we decided to ask Fichtner to follow suit…&nbsp;The Graduate (1967, 89% Tomatometer)&nbsp;The Graduate, you know, it’s just so frickin’ romantic. I just love that. The music, the performances; everything about it. I saw it at a time in my life that was truly eye-opening.The Godfather/The Godfather: Part II (1972/1974, 100%/98% Tomatometer)&nbsp;Godfather one and two ’cause it’s just… perfect.The Deer Hunter (1978, 91% Tomatometer)&nbsp;Deer Hunter — the human experience was just so pointed; their journeys were so difficult, as life is sometimes. I remember after seeing it, walking down the street — I actually went with a girl on a date and saw The Deer Hunter, and we left the theater and walked for like an hour and nobody said anything; we were just kind of stunned about that.Strictly Ballroom (1992, 94% Tomatometer)&nbsp;Strictly Ballroom — again, such a romantic film. The ballroom dancing was just so exciting and Baz Luhrmann’s such a genius.Three Days of the Condor (1975, 86% Tomatometer)&nbsp;Three Days of the Condor just seems to be one of those films that, if I’m flipping around the channels late at night and I land on that one, I just can’t shut if off — you just have to watch that whole journey with Robert Redford and Faye Dunaway. It’s so good.&nbsp;Drive Angry is released this week.","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"scary, Kids, The, thriller, Land, 99%, action, Go, 2017, Year, Toys, Arts","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/safsafda.jpg","slug":"five-favorite-films-with-william-fichtner"},{"id":"47508854443371","title":"Five Favorite Films with Nicolas Cage","content":"Five Favorite Filmsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Five Favorite Films with Nicolas CagePlus, the star talks Season of the Witch, Ghost Rider 2, and why he's in his supernatural phase.by Luke Goodsell | January 5, 2011 |  CommentsNicolas Cage may have the most unclassifiable body of work of any actor in movies today. He began his career with teen roles in Fast Times At Ridgemont High, Valley Girl and uncle Francis Coppola’s Rumble Fish, went off the wall for Raising Arizona, Wild At Heart and Vampire’s Kiss, won a Best Actor Oscar for Leaving Las Vegas and then somehow became a big-budget action star in films like The Rock, Con Air and Face/Off. The odd trajectory defines the actor to this day, but behind all of Cage’s (seemingly puzzling) film choices there’s been one constant: his fierce dedication to each and every role, whether he’s crafting performances for Spike Jonze, Ridley Scott and Werner Herzog or headlining Disney tent-poles and comic-book capers. This week, Cage nurtures his fantasy fetish as a 14th-century knight in Dominic Sena’s supernatural actioner Season of the Witch, while he continues filming on the Ghost Rider sequel with Crank directors Brian Taylor and Mark Neveldine.We got the chance to speak with Cage recently, where we asked him to name his all-time five favorite films. “It’s a shame because there are so many more,” he says, considering his choices, “but if I had to go with the five, I’d pick the ones that changed my life.”Read on for his thoughts on Season of the Witch, the Ghost Rider sequel, and why, he says, he’s going through his horror movie period.East of Eden (1955, 87% Tomatometer)The first two, I’m gonna go with Elia Kazan, ’cause they’re really the reason why I became an actor in movies. East of Eden, with James Dean, and A Streetcar Named Desire, with Vivien Leigh and Marlon Brando. The performance by James Dean — the scene specifically where he tries to give his father, played by Raymond Massey, the money from selling the beans on his birthday, and he’s rejected — it broke my heart; it was not like anything I’d experienced before, in terms of art, and I’d seen a lot of movies at that point. I was 15, and I’d seen Bergman’s Seventh Seal and Fellini’s Juliet of the Spirits and Welles’ Citizen Kane — great films, but when I saw Dean in that, it really put the hook in me because I felt like him and I knew then the power of film acting, and I knew then what I wanted to be, what I wanted to do to try to move people with motion pictures. So that’s why I have to put that on the list.A Streetcar Named Desire (1951, 98% Tomatometer)Yes, I admired Marlon Brando and I know that he influenced James Dean and he really kind of changed the world of film acting with his naturalistic style, but it was because of Vivien Leigh’s performance as Blanche DuBois that I would put that as one of my favorite movies; because of her dialog, the Tennessee Williams dialog, the music, Kazan’s direction, and Vivien Leigh’s delivery of lines like — I’m paraphrasing — but when she says, “the human heart, how can that be straight?”, you know. It was such a powerfully vulnerable, tragic performance that I have to put that on the top five, because that movie held that performance.2001: A Space Odyssey (1968,96% Tomatometer)Then I’m gonna go into Kubrick. 2001, because it is so enigmatic, it is so poetic, and it remains a mystery to me, even today where I can view it annually, three times a year, and still find something new in it. I’m still mystified by it. It achieved this status of being eternal in a way that didn’t rely heavily on performance; it was the special effects, the music. The fact that it was a success, that it was a commercial success, and it challenged every critic — many critics didn’t get it — so it was really ahead of its time. Nothing’s been ever quite like it again.A Clockwork Orange (1971,91% Tomatometer)Because of Malcolm McDowell I’m gonna go into A Clockwork Orange, because that was the other great teenage performance, along with James Dean in East of Eden. Stanley Kubrick’s treatment of the subject of violence and the mystery of nature and to go against out natures and what is or isn’t necessary, and what is the true evil, and all of these questions that came out of the absurdist and evocative film that is Clockwork Orange, again, is everlasting. And also his lighting: even today when you look at some of the stills from the movie, when they’re in the Milk Bar, it looks like virtual reality and I don’t know how he did it — he was really a master of light.The Wizard of Oz (1939, 100% Tomatometer)Finally I’m gonna say The Wizard of Oz, because that movie, again, is not like any other film — it’s a completely original experience and it has stood up against the test of time. Children are still enchanted by it, adults are still enchanted by it, and nobody has ever been able to capture that feeling since; and it’s a musical. Plus, that first introduction to color film, that doorway sequence and going in to Munchkin land — it’s just mind-blowingly beautiful. And her performance, her voice, Judy Garland — you know, they don’t make ’em like that anymore. So, I would say those would be the top five.Next, Nicolas Cage on his supernatural phase, the absurdity of The Wicker Man, and returning to Ghost Rider.&nbsp;RT: Did you enjoy making Season of the Witch?Oh yeah, this was a real adventure for me. I’d wanted to play a knight for quite some time because it was a childhood fantasy of mine, and here I was finally getting to do that — and dealing with supernatural forces that are becoming increasingly interesting to me, because I want to celebrate the movies of people like Christopher Lee and Vincent Price. I’m really trying to build a body of work that does that now. I don’t want to do one kind of film only; I am eclectic and that’s how I stay interested. So right now I’m in that phase, of movies that go into horror and mystery and the unknown.Christopher Lee’s in the film — did you two talk about The Wicker Man and what it was like remaking his film?Yeah, we did talk about that. First of all, I’m a huge fan of the original movie and his performance in it is outstanding, and I had to share that with him. We talked a little bit about the remake and he wanted to know what happened and I just said well, look, the movie was true to Neil LaBute’s kind of intentionally absurdist black comedy view of relationships between men and women — and we went for it. Let me put it to you this way: you don’t get dressed up in a bear suit and do those kinds of things to women and not know it’s ridiculous [laughs]. The problem is people didn’t know that we knew that it was what it was; hopefully now they will. I mean, I don’t know how they couldn’t know that, but that’s okay.The film’s sort of become a cult item over time as people realize how absurd it is.[laughs] I think so too and I think some things take time to mature, and with hindsight become a lot more understood.You’re working with Dominic Sena again on Season; had you been looking to do something together after Gone in 60 Seconds?Well I really enjoyed working with Dominic on that movie. He makes you feel comfortable and you feel relaxed and that you can be creative. In this case he really had a chance to show his visual style. Gone in 60 Seconds was much more of a straight-up urban action film whereas Season of the Witch goes into far more imaginative places and more expressionistic places and Dom’s really great at that in terms of lighting and landscape. I’m glad he had a chance to do that because I don’t know how many people are aware of his ability in that department, but it’s pretty immense.The year ahead is looking typically busy for you. Have you wrapped the Ghost Rider sequel?Not yet. I’m about a third of the way through. It’s going very well.How different is it from the original?It’s very different. I’m a fan of the first one but that one was more of a fairy tale where as this one is a completely different kind of animal, and that’s what the directors wanted. But I have to say that I’ve never worked with anybody quite like Neveldine and Taylor before. It’s a brand new experience. Mark Neveldine is doing things with the camera that are just mind-blowing. He’s a combination stuntman/camera operator/director and I’ve never seen anything like it. He’s on rollerblades hanging off the bike, hanging from wires that are 300 feet up in the air, I mean he’s getting these shots and virtually risking his life. There’s nobody else that really does any of that. And Brian Taylor is just so knowledgeable about filmmaking: in the same sentence you can talk about Michael Powell’s Peeping Tom and then go into Ishirô Honda’s War of the Gargantuas — he just knows movies. And he’s totally been encouraging about me playing the Ghost Rider as well as John Blaze and this has opened up all sorts of new doors. It was because of him and his passion that we were able to go into areas that I think will really mess with people’s minds; some really abstract, kind of wild supernatural stuff that’s a lot of fun.Season of the Witch is in theaters this week.","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"psycho, Family, and, Holiday, japanese, Pictures, tv, fresh, kong, Nickelodeon, Plus, Movies","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/sadf.jpg","slug":"five-favorite-films-with-nicolas-cage"},{"id":"47508857424271","title":"Five Favorite Films With Toy Story 3 Director Lee Unkrich","content":"Five Favorite Filmsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Five Favorite Films With Toy Story 3 Director Lee UnkrichThe man at the helm of Pixar's latest reveals some curious personal picksby Luke Goodsell | June 16, 2010 |  CommentsOne of Pixar’s core creative team, Lee Unkrich joined the studio as an editor in 1994, where he cut Toy Story and A Bug’s Life before moving on to co-direct Toy Story 2, Monsters, Inc. and Finding Nemo… not a bad track record, to put it mildly. With this week’s superb Toy Story 3, Unkrich has created what may be his best work for Pixar yet — a rich, layered sequel that extends the characters and adventures from its beloved predecessors and yet manages to feel like an essential third chapter in a unified story. We caught up with the director ahead of the film’s release and asked him to name his five favorite films, which proved to be an interesting — and revealing — list. “This is always such a tricky one,” Unkrich says.”I’m trying to go with different filmmakers and not repeat anybody.”The Shining (1980,87% Tomatometer)My favorite film is The Shining, mostly because it was the film that inspired me to become a filmmaker myself.Punch-Drunk Love (2002,79% Tomatometer)Really, that just kind of encapsulates all of Paul Thomas Anderson’s films for me. I’m inspired by the kinetic energy of his films, and the richness of the characters and the performances especially.Blue Velvet (1986,91% Tomatometer)It wasn’t the first film to show a kind of alternate vision of suburbia, but it left an indelible impression, I think, on everybody, and all films like that will forever be measured against Blue Velvet.An Angel at My Table (1991,92% Tomatometer)Here’s an odd one — An Angel at My Table, by Jane Campion. It’s an odd choice and I can’t quite tell you why. I’ve always found that film very affecting. Kerry Fox’s performance is great and it’s such a particular study of such a particular character done in a very stylish way. It’s just always stayed with me.Raising Arizona (1987,90% Tomatometer)I need one more, huh? How about a good comedy? Raising Arizona. Remains the funniest movie I’ve ever seen in my life. There you go!Click here for our extended interview with Lee, in which he discusses the pressure of creating the sequel.","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"reboot, war","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Five-Favorite-Films-With-Toy-Story-3-Director-Lee-Unkrich"},{"id":"47508854451567","title":"Five Favorite Films with Michael Sheen","content":"Five Favorite Filmsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Five Favorite Films with Michael SheenPlus, the actor talks TRON, Bowie, and The Dude.by Luke Goodsell | December 14, 2010 |  Comments“When I start to see a path to explore for a character then I really go for it,” says Michael Sheen, who describes his villain in this week’s TRON: Legacy as equal parts Mae West and Ziggy Stardust. “That’s part of what I really enjoy.” For the film’s key digital villain, Castor, the British actor dug deep into the back catalog of the Thin White Duke himself, David Bowie. “I did spend a lot of time watching Bowie,” Sheen continues. “The idea behind this guy is that he’s able to change and assimilate things; he’s very chameleon-like, and that’s what made me think of Bowie.”For Sheen, a fan of the original TRON since seeing it in theaters in 1982, there’s a certain amusement in the fact that Disney’s massive sci-fi project revolves around the very mellow Jeff Bridges. “There’s a sort of spiritual white Russian inside him all the time,” Sheen laughs. “In the middle of all this technology, you know, this huge, amazing world that’s been created — and there’s a lot of pressure, a lot of anticipation, a big budget, a lot riding on it and all that — at the center of it all is The Dude. It’s this guy going “Hey maaaaan.”Here then, are Michael Sheen’s Five Favorite Films.A Matter of Life and Death (1946, 94% Tomatometer)It has a strange beauty about it. It has a deceptively simple story. It has all the classic trademarks of someone who introduces you to a special, magical world, and yet you are able to then see your own world completely differently. There’s always something slightly uncanny about what Powell and Pressburger did — if you think about The Red Shoes or The Tales of Hoffman, and things later like Peeping Tom, films like that. They’re just extraordinary.Apocalypse Now (1979, 98% Tomatometer)It’s a film I’ve watched so many times, and every time I watch it I find something new in it. Again, it’s got kind of a strange beauty about it: it’s disturbing and kind of magical, and mythical and mysterious, and just shot amazingly. And there’s kind of a madness in it, which I really like as well. The original version, because that’s the one I know the best.Close Encounters of the Third Kind (1977, 95% Tomatometer)It’s a film like the other two, in a way, which has grown as I’ve grown; it’s changed with me. You think of films as being finished, completed things that never change, but actually they do change — because we change. And so a film like Close Encounters, when I first watched it — when I was much younger — it scared me to death, and now it’s a film that I find intensely moving. It’s an almost spiritual film. Spielberg is just, I think, a genius in being able to tell a very simple story and get to something so complex and profound. I think he does in E.T. as well, to a certain extent, but this one I find one of the most moving films I’ve ever seen.12 Monkeys (1995, 86% Tomatometer)For some reason I always find time travel intensely moving and it speaks to me in some weird way. Of all of Terry’s films I find that one the most moving. I love it. It’s a great story.The Last Temptation of Christ (1988, 83% Tomatometer)Okay, I will pick a film with Bowie in it. [laughs] I’m going to say The Last Temptation of Christ, where he plays Pilate. All the Romans are English, and all the Jews are American. [laughs] I think it’s just a perfect piece of filmmaking. It’s brave and it’s imaginative and it’s about the most kind of profound things, and yet it’s very human. And the music — Peter Gabriel’s soundtrack is incredible. Again, every time I watch it… it’s the same with a lot of Scorsese’s films — as soon as you turn the channel and come across one, no matter how many times you’ve seen it, you sort of can’t stop watching it, because he’s a master story teller. That’s my five for today.TRON: Legacy is in theaters this week.","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"CW, American, south, TV, witnail, 2020, comedy, Red, french","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/xczv.jpg","slug":"five-favorite-films-with-michael-sheen"},{"id":"47508852828519","title":"Five Favorite Films with James Cameron","content":"Five Favorite Filmsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Five Favorite Films with James CameronPlus, we talk with Sanctum's executive producer, director Alister Grierson and writer Andrew Wight.by Luke Goodsell | February 1, 2011 |  CommentsSometimes, amid the clamor of media junkets and their tight roster of promotional interviews, we don’t always get a chance to pop our “five favorite films” question. Given that this was James Cameron, however, we couldn’t resist sneaking the quiz into the conversation — despite his being pressed for time.Cameron was on hand, together with director Alister Grierson and writer-producer Andrew Wight, to promote Sanctum, the 3-D cave-diving thriller that arrives in cinemas this week. The film, set in the dark and sometimes terrifying labyrinth of a cave system in Papua New Guinea, deploys the camera technology that Cameron and Wight, a fellow diver, had pioneered on their ocean expeditions — and would form the basis for the tools with which Avatar was shot.You can read on for our chat with the filmmakers about Sanctum. Here, our conversation turns — albeit briefly — to all-time favorite films.“I hate lists. I never do lists,” Cameron protests. “But we’ll stumble through it.”“Not because he’s sitting here, but Terminator 2,” offers Wight.“You liar,” Cameron replies. “I’ve never been able to do this but I’ll take a stab at it.”The Wizard of Oz (1939, 100% Tomatometer)The Wizard of Oz is number one.Dr. Strangelove or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb (1964, 100% Tomatometer)I can’t order these, you know, but somewhere in the top 10 would be Dr. Strangelove…2001: A Space Odyssey (1968,96% Tomatometer)…and 2001: A Space Odyssey. Anything by Kubrick.The Godfather (1972,100% Tomatometer)Just about half of Coppola’s films. [“Except for his last one,” adds Grierson.] Hey, I said half. Okay — Godfather.Taxi Driver (1976, 98% Tomatometer)Okay, Taxi Driver. I love Taxi Driver.Click here for our chat with the filmmakers.Sanctum is released nationwide this week.","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"true, Sneak, cinemax, tv, Carpet, Tubi, Purge, shows, Access, 2020, Go, FOX, Arts, PlayStation","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/zxvv.jpg","slug":"five-favorite-films-with-james-cameron"},{"id":"47508852830568","title":"Five Favorite Films with Ben Foster","content":"Five Favorite Filmsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Five Favorite Films with Ben FosterThe Mechanic star talks about the movies most personal to him.by Luke Goodsell | January 27, 2011 |  CommentsFrom hard drama to bruising action, Ben Foster’s varied resume declares him an actor willing to go many places for a performance. He all but stole Nick Cassavetes’ Alpha Dog, more than held his own against Russell Crowe and Christian Bale in 3:10 To Yuma, and earned some deserved acclaim for his turn as an American soldier in 2009’s critical favorite, The Messenger.This week, Foster stars alongside Jason Statham in the action thriller The Mechanic, a noisy remake of the 1972 Charles Bronson vehicle. Statham takes the Bronson role of the professional assassin double-crossed into murdering his boss, with Foster the dead man’s son who becomes an apprentice to dad’s killer. The talented actor brings an unusual level of edge and tension for this kind of film; in return, the movie gave him his share of physical souvenirs.“I got pretty banged up,” he admits, “but that’s part of the fun. You get the opportunity to scare the **** out of yourself.” Doing so involved performing many of his own stunts — including a spectacular 30-story fall down the side of a skyscraper, attached to a cable. Statham, Foster says, spurred him on. “You wanna step up to his level of athleticism and stone-cold courage,” he explains. “That guy’s got some nuts, you know — he does some scary ****.”Back in the relative safety of a hotel suite, we sat down with Foster to ask him his five favorite films. And here they are.The Jerk (1979, 83% Tomatometer)You couldn’t get away with making that movie today. It’s wild. It’s a wild film, and it’s the great American dream gone wrong. It’s Citizen Kane on its ass. It’s a man who comes from nothing and builds a world and loses an empire and finds love. I mean, it’s a huge movie; and absolutely insane. I watch that several times a year — it’s a go-to on the road.Dr. Strangelove or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb (1964, 100% Tomatometer)I would be embarrassed to begin to talk about Dr. Strangelove, because there has been so much written about it. It’s so bleak. And Peter Sellers is perfect. He’s just perfect. Terry Southern and Stanley Kubrick built this doomsday political satire, in the fists of the Cold War, and made the end of the world hysterical. We’re bumbling idiots, all of us. We’re all walking through dark rooms of our life, bumping into furniture, and it’s shocking. I think we all enjoy watching people who are in authority positions act like bumbling idiots; it satisfies part of our ego, I’m sure, on some level. Sellers’ commitment to those characters… the scene that stands out is when he’s trying to get change to make the phone call to stop the bomb, and that security guard won’t let him break government property to get the change. The frustration of that is as painful as it is hysterical.Husbands (1970,63% Tomatometer)Male camaraderie, male love, is a difficult subject to show on film. What does it mean to have one of your best friends pass away? When that unit dies, how do you deal with it? I’m not a married man but I’m sure that when I’m married and have kids I’ll see Husbands in a new light. It’s regular guys trying to make sense of this life, having a good time while they’re doing it; running from their own lives and trying to distract themselves with hookers and gambling and drinking, and they all have families to go back to. They just don’t wanna leave the party. It’s male camaraderie at its most loving and brutal: these guys are terrible to each other, but they’d do anything for each other, and that kind of friendship, those values, mean a lot to me. The way they shot the film, the way they lost funding — there’re these wild stories of how to make a movie that you care about. They lost financing. As the story goes, they put the last bit of money — and they’re half way through the film, they’ve been shooting for six months — they put all the money to throw a party. They got dancers and girls and piano players and I think there was like an elephant, and they invited all these studio heads to come to this party sequence that they were filming — and when they studio saw the scene they said, “This movie’s huge, it’s wild, we’ll cover the rest of the film.” They got the rest of the financing. The scene’s not in the movie — it was never planned to be. So that spirit still excites me. The camaraderie feels familiar.All That Jazz (1979,87% Tomatometer)I think I’ve seen it five times in the past two months. I can’t stop watching that picture. The way they edited that — the dramatic scenes have as much musicality as the dance numbers, but it’s completely naturalistic. A man facing his own death; he’s creating his own end. He’s riffing on Lenny Bruce, riffing on his own material, his need to connect, his love of women, and his own mortality and relationship to family. It’s a staggering film. It’s Bob Fosse’s “See ya, and goodnight.”The Iron Giant (1999, 97% Tomatometer)A fifth one, that’s tough. What’s a go-to? So many great things out there. The Iron Giant‘s pretty terrific. When you’ve been on the road for a while, and you’re lonely… yeah, that film makes me cry. I love that movie.

Next year she’ll reprise her role as Uhura in the sequel to J.J. Abrams’ 2009 hit Star Trek, which, if successful, will continue the invigoration of the venerable franchise. And then there are the forthcoming sequels to James Cameron’s all-time box-office king Avatar, in which Saldana proved the emotional and spiritual fulcrum as Pandora’s fearless warrior, Neytiri. Saldana invested her character’s digital exterior with a measure of soul; beneath the motion capture moved a graceful, determined performer.In this week’s Burning Palms, an indie portmanteau comprising “five stories of madness” from Los Angeles, Saldana again proves her dramatic talent as a sexual assault victim who seeks out her attacker — with unexpected consequences. “I was intrigued,” she says of her segment, entitled “Man-Eater.” “I was really intrigued with [director] Chris Landon, because he’s so honest in terms of the arc. He wasn’t afraid to expose the artistic dark side of how life can sometimes be. One thing that really interests him is the psychological journey; why people accept things, why people react in certain ways.”The performance is a game one, navigating some psychologically tricky terrain concerning rape. “The one thing that people don’t talk about, that sometimes happens,” Saldana explains, “is that there are women who, while they’re being raped, experience orgasm; and that is the trauma that they have to deal with — forgiving yourself in that sometimes the body can operate separate from the mind, even when going through a very traumatic encounter. It’s very complicated, and it never fully heals. It was that part of it that made me feel, as an actor, not only curious to play the part, but a responsibility to tell a story like this.”Saldana’s tenacity — and tastes — as an actor reflect in her choice of five favorite films. The first one, in particular, was the most telling…The Terminator (1984, 100% Tomatometer)One movie that has always resonated with me is The Terminator. [laughs] I just loved it. Maybe it’s the fact that I was five when I saw this movie, so I was very overwhelmed by it. I felt the passion between these two individuals. I saw the strength of a woman. From the music, the robots, the technology… that movie was big because I saw it through the eyes of a five-year-old. I’m not gonna judge Terminator now that I’m 32, because obviously I’m gonna have a different take. I’ve evolved, I’ve seen different things, and life and technology and the way we see films has evolved, so it wouldn’t be fair to what Terminator represented when I was five. But that essence will never die. Terminator was very impacting for me. It really helped me a lot, to understand the kind of actor I wanted to be, and also the kind of movies and genres that I gravitate towards and absolutely love. That movie, seeing it at that age, was amazing.RT: When you were filming with James, did you think, “Now I’m here channeling that essence of the Cameron female action hero?”Oh my god, yes. Every day, and you’re so embarrassed to say it, you know, because obviously it’s going to make him uncomfortable. Maybe Kismet does exist: when you want something, when you’re very specific about someone you like, for some reason you set out to look for it; but at the same time, if it’s meant to be with you, it’ll come and look for you. That’s why I think that Avatar, working with Jim and calling him a friend, is something that I hold very dear and I don’t take lightly, because it’s something that was so important. Little did I know that when I was five I was gonna see a movie that would make me the kind of tough woman that I wanted to be, and make the films that I want to see. And then, 25 years later, to be working with James Cameron — it’s like, “What the f**k?”, you know?The Hunger (1983, 44% Tomatometer)I loved it. I thought it was such a sensual movie. I’ve always been a very curious person when it comes to sensuality and sexuality. I was raised by a mother that always taught my sisters and I that the body is not what’s tainted, it’s the mind. Therefore there was a lot flexibility; she gave us a lot of responsibility. She trusted us with things that kids aren’t supposed to be watching. My mom has a version of what censorship is, and it’s quite different to what censorship means to a lot of societies and cultures. I was very grateful for that because it taught me so much passion, and it taught me to feel okay with the human body and wanting passion and love. And The Hunger was an amazing love story. I loved the performances by Catherine Deneuve and Susan Sarandon and David Bowie.The Goonies (1985,63% Tomatometer)The third one I would have to say is The Goonies. [giggles] What isn’t there about it to love? Trying to find a treasure to save your parents when you’re seeing them struggle — which f**king kid wouldn’t understand that or wanna do that, you know? [On who she identified with:] I think it was Sean Astin’s character, the little dreamer. That monologue when they’re all on the well and getting ready to go up and he’s like, “Chester Copperpot!” My sisters and I get together and we drink wine and we watch The Goonies and we quote it… “The next time we see sky, it’ll be in another town!” I love The Goonies.Pandora’s Box (1929,91% Tomatometer)I think that — and it’s also related to the fifth one — growing up as a dancer I primarily learned to channel emotions through other parts of my body besides my voice, therefore when I watch silent movies I’m touched on such a deep level. To me, it was a form of acting that I gravitate towards. It’s so beautiful because it incorporates the body in such a way; your vocal chords have a great intonation but in reality it’s so much more, it’s about using the body, using the soul and all these things. So I love it. It’s such a technical movie that I learned so much from. But that’s just my approach as an actor. The storytelling was also very beautiful: the story about this box that they come to realize what’s laying in it is hope — that was a very beautiful message.The Kid (1921, 100% Tomatometer)For Charlie Chaplin to have the kid be this thing that kind of gives him purpose and some kind of integrity, I think that was great. It’s a very emotional and melodramatic subject and only someone like Charlie Chaplin was able to make it whimsical and funny, but also so heartfelt and sincere. So I’ve always loved The Kid. Absolute genius. I feel like he wouldn’t have gotten there if not for his vaudeville years. Every now and then I like to read up on his life as a teenager before he got to Hollywood, and the fact that he came from nothing. He came into an empire with talent. He had nothing and he had nothing to lose, therefore he gave it all. I was watching Benny and Joon last week and what Johnny Depp was doing reminded me of the essence of Chaplin: he was so light but you understood that deep down in inside of him there was this really profound and emotional man. I feel like Charlie did that with a lot of his characters.Burning Palms is released to select theaters this week.","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"Lionsgate","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/werrr.jpg","slug":"five-favorite-films-with-zoe-saldana"},{"id":"47508854460787","title":"Five Favorite Films with Jeff Goldblum","content":"Five Favorite Filmsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Five Favorite Films with Jeff GoldblumThe star of The Fly, Jurassic Park and this week's Morning Glory extracts his all-time favorites.by Luke Goodsell | November 10, 2010 |  CommentsFrom his humble debut as a young punk terrorizing a supermarket in 1974’s Death Wish to his classic era of “unorthodox science types” in blockbusters like Jurassic Park and Independence Day, Jeff Goldblum has accumulated an intriguing acting resume across all kinds of genres. Who could forget his miniature but memorable appearance in Annie Hall (“I forgot my mantra”) or his off the wall turns in cult movies like Earth Girls Are Easy and The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai Across the 8th Dimension, for starters? And then there was The Fly, in which he turned in an heroic performance as a scientist who fuses himself with an insect to horrific, heartbreaking results. This week, Goldblum’s back on the big screen in the newsroom comedy Morning Glory, in which he stars alongside Rachel McAdams as the network head of a TV show anchored by Harrison Ford and his old Annie Hall alum, Diane Keaton. All that and he somehow finds the time for his “other” job, tinkling the ivories in his jazz outfit, the Mildred Snitzer Orchestra.So, what are his five favorite films? “What do I like watching over and over again?” He ponders. “Well certainly The Godfathers when they come on — you’re bewitched and you can’t stop watching them. But that’s everybody’s answer, I’m sure… ”Crimes and Misdemeanors (1989, 92% Tomatometer)I like Woody Allen. Crime and Misdemeanors I liked a lot. I think it’s just wonderful. I also enjoy many of those — I like Hannah and Her Sisters, and Husbands and Wives; I like Broadway Danny Rose. This morning I was watching Love and Death, with Diane Keaton which I like a lot. But Crimes and Misdemeanors is maybe the best one of those.Mulholland Dr. (2001, 81% Tomatometer)Let’s see… I like David Lynch. I enjoyed Mulholland Drive. I loved it. I just think he’s spectacular — I’d love to work with him.A Serious Man (2009,89% Tomatometer)The Coen brothers. You know, I liked their last movie, A Serious Man. I thought that was terrific.Rosemary’s Baby (1968,98% Tomatometer)Polanski. Rosemary’s Baby I keep coming back to, and I like Chinatown a lot. Those aren’t radical choices but I enjoy them. The truth is that I enjoy them a lot, and everybody knows they’re wonderful.The King of Comedy (1983,92% Tomatometer).For funny movies, Scorsese — you know, I have an affection for The King of Comedy. It’s just fun to watch. I like Rupert Pupkin… it’s hilarious. I like that it’s dark, and how this guy gets to be famous. But I like De Niro’s performance; I like Jerry Lewis; I like Sandra Bernhard. I like the Ray Charles song that comes on at the beginning. It’s terrific.Morning Glory is in theaters November 12.","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"TV, streaming, based, Awards, HBO, Sabrina, documentary, parents, versus, docuseries","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/safd.jpg","slug":"five-favorite-films-with-jeff-goldblum"},{"id":"47508857429394","title":"Five Favorite Films with Brett Ratner","content":"\n\n                                            Five Favorite Films\n                                        \n                        \n                        \n                            var mps=mps||{}; mps._queue=mps._queue||{}; mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[];\n                            mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function() {\n                                mps.rt.insertlogo('#article_sponsorship_ad', 'ploc=articlesponsorship');\n                            });\n                        \n                    \n                    \n                        Five Favorite Films with Brett Ratner\n                        The blockbuster director stops by The Rotten Tomatoes Show.\n                        by RT Staff | June 4, 2010                          | \n                          \n                              Comments\n                          \n                     \n\n                     \n\n                     \n                       \n                         \n                           \n                         \n                           \n                         \n                           \n                         \n                           \n                       \n                     \n\n                    \n                                                Over the past decade, Brett Ratner has directed action-packed blockbusters that include Rush Hour 2, X-Men: The Last Stand, and Rush Hour 3.

He’s no stranger to horror franchises, though, having appeared in 2003’s vampires-versus-werewolves showdown Underworld, and this week he’s back among the land of the undead in Resident Evil: Afterlife — the fourth installment of the enduring video game-inspired series. In Paul W.S. Anderson’s 3-D actioner, Miller is Chris Redfield, older brother to Ali Larter’s Claire — and, not incidentally, one of the original heroes from the very first Resident Evil game. We recently spoke to the amiable (and absurdly well-toned) Miller and asked him to name his all-time Five Favorite Films.The Shining (1980,87% Tomatometer)The Shining. I’m a huge horror fan, classic horror specifically, and there’s just something about them. Carrie, The Shining, Rosemary’s Baby. They’re horrifying, and they’re definitely frightening, but they’re also elegant, and they also show patience. And they’re also discreet in certain ways. When the horror comes, they’ve set it up so that there’s more of a payoff, because what’s come before has been executed in such a way that it doesn’t feel like… You know, you watch a horror movie that’s produced today, and they’re trying to scare you or freak you out, or they’ve got cats jumping out of the cupboards in the first five minutes. There’s no gradual build-up; it’s as though they don’t trust that the audience is going to hang in there and wait for the impact coming sixty or ninety minutes into the movie. They want to give it to you in the first ten minutes, which I think is kind of shoddy storytelling, and disrespectful to the audience.You said patience, which is interesting. Do you think patience is a difficult thing to sell to the studios?Maybe. I think, if anything, the way that you would convince a studio that patience is not only out there but it’s essential to good storytelling and only right to expect from an audience is that your average serialized drama – like LOST, 24, Prison Break – that sort of thing takes a serious amount of investment. You’ve got fans that are putting in time each and every week for years, sometimes, on end. So I think the desire is out there, the willingness is out there, to be taken along on a patient journey where the crumbs are kind of sprinkled throughout. They’re not dumped on your plate in the first ten minutes.Carrie (1976,90% Tomatometer)[See response to The Shining]Time Bandits (1981,94% Tomatometer)I think there’s something anarchic about it, which appealed to me as a kid, and appeals to me now. It’s Terry Gilliam, a phenomenal imagination, some brilliant performances. I think there’s something, obviously, very enticing and compelling about the story of a little boy swept up into a foreign land, having an extraordinary experience. I think that journey is kind of at the root of a lot of sci-fi narratives, and it’s easy to see the appeal. That kind of vicarious journey that you get to go on, but not actually experience, like the jaws of the dragon. It’s a thrill.Jesus Christ Superstar (1973,57% Tomatometer)It’s Ted Neeley and Carl Anderson, 1973 if I’m not mistaken. It’s basically, he’s out in the desert, singing and dancing. It’s almost a little acid trippy, and yet, within these very campy elements and this big musical production, there’s obviously an impactful story and some great performances.Bullets Over Broadway (1994,96% Tomatometer)Fantastic cast, such smart writing, really quick-fire storytelling. Woody Allen is someone who doesn’t, I think, dumb down his pictures for an audience. He gives his audience credit, and I appreciate that. I enjoy that feeling that the director’s respecting me as an audience member; he’s not feeling as though I can’t potentially keep up with the pace that he’s setting or the story he’s laying down.Would that be a badge of honor for you, working with Woody Allen?Maybe so, maybe so, although I understand that if you’re asked to participate in a Woody Allen gig, you don’t see the script until very soon before shooting, which is actually kind of nerve-wracking. But at the same time, it’s this sort of dynamic that’s designed to keep you awake and alert and on your feet. It’s not difficult to understand why he gets such great performances from everyone who shows up in his films.RT: It’s your first time with Resident Evil; how would you sum up the experience? Did you have fun?Wentworth Miller: I did. I think what attracted me to the movie was that it’s got a nice balance between special effects and stunts, and character and story. I love the fact that it’s shot in 3D, and I think that’s going to be an exciting element for a lot of people, but I’m not an actor that geeks out on the technical side of things. I’ve always been more interested in the story that we’re telling, rather than by what means we’re telling that story. So the fact that it’s got characters and relationships you can believe in and care about and that deepen the overall narrative, as well as, you know, split-headed zombie dogs, that’s a nice balance that’s difficult to find. Empty fireworks in the sky don’t mean anything.Resident Evil: Afterlife, the fourth installment in the video game-based franchise starring Milla Jovovich, Ali Larter, and Wentworth Miller, opens on September 10th.

After a breakout role in Best in Show, Christopher Guest’s largely improvised mockumentary about the world of dog breeding and competition, Lynch went on to star in several films that helped to showcase her sharp wit and impeccable comic timing, like The 40-Year-Old Virgin, Role Models, and For Your Consideration, another Christopher Guest film. At the same time, Lynch increased her presence on television with recurring roles on shows like Showtime’s The L Word, CBS’s Two and a Half Men, and a slew of other popular programs before finding herself quite a comfortable home as Sue Sylvester on Glee. Just last week, Glee returned for its second season, and with the second episode set to air tonight, we thought it appropriate to share Jane Lynch’s Five Favorite Films, which she was kind enough to take time out of her schedule to talk to us about. Read on for the full list!Private Benjamin (1980,86% Tomatometer)This is in no particular order, but Private Benjamin. That, I think, is a perfectly made comedy. I usually stop watching when she gets together with Armand Assante, not that I have anything against it, but for me, the movie’s over. [laughs] I thought Goldie Hawn was great, and the people who play her parents, those secondary characters whose names escape me now, do some incredible work. Albert Brooks – I just saw Private Benjamin again for the first time in four or five years a couple of months ago – he is amazing, he is so good. He’s only in the first couple of scenes, and he plays her husband and he has a heart attack on the night of their wedding reception. But it’s a great comic performance by Goldie Hawn.Zoolander (2001,62% Tomatometer)Zoolander. Yeah, I mean, I love Ben Stiller, he’s just a brilliant guy. And I love Will Ferrell in it, too. His character, to me, is just insane and he made such huge choices, and he’s such a weirdo! [laughs] And I love Owen Wilson; I think it’s the best work he’s ever done. And they were both so gorgeous at that time. I know they were making fun of themselves, too, but they both look fantastic. So hilarious.The Big Lebowski (1998,78% Tomatometer)The Big Lebowski. Jeff Bridges – I almost put Starman down, too, but I really think I kind of don’t remember the movie so much because I haven’t seen it in so many years – but I love Jeff Bridges, and I love the movie he just did. What was it called? Crazy Heart, he’s great in that. But, I mean, there’s something about The Big Lebowski and that combination with the Coen brothers sensibility, which, he nailed that down. I don’t know exactly what you’d even call that, but brilliant. I loved his performance in that, and I loved John Goodman, and I loved Steve Buscemi. And you know who else was great in that, was Philip Seymour Hoffman. He was really good in that movie, too. Yeah, great, great, great fan of that movie.Ninotchka (1939,100% Tomatometer)And Ninotchka. You know Ninotchka? I recommend it. It’s kind of a mess, too. It was before, you know, we got slick editing tools, so it kind of chops along. You can tell that they shot one thing one day, and then when her hair was a little longer, they shot it again. [laughs] It’s Ernst Lubitsch, wonderful director, not too many comedies, and I think that’s kind of the reason for the not-so-fluid flow of this film. But it’s Greta Garbo being funny – I’m a huge Greta Garbo fan – and it shows she has a sense of humor about herself, behind all that Swedish draw; she had a great sense of humor about herself. And I just love Melvyn Douglas; he’s wonderful in it.The Crossing Guard (1995,74% Tomatometer)The Crossing Guard. Not a comedy. [laughs] The Sean Penn film, with Jack Nicholson and Anjelica Huston. I just remember that taking my guts out of my stomach and pulling them. I remember being doubled over – I went to see a matinee – and I was doubled over, and I was just… The loss of the innocence of this little girl. And I forget the name of the actor who plays the drunk who hits this little girl, but he wakes up, he comes to in the jail, and he realizes that he’s hit this little girl and he killed her, and he bangs his head into the bars, and he has this indent in his head for the rest of the movie. Probably more background than you wanted!You can catch the current season of Glee every Tuesday on your local Fox station at 8pm/7pm Central.","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"guild, universe, potter, Christmas, Mystery, cancelled, emmy, Amazon, Turner, Cannes, movies, Biopics, Classic","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"five-favorite-films-with-jane-lynch"},{"id":"47508855900541","title":"Five Favorite Films with Catfish Directors Henry Joost and Rel Schulman","content":"Five Favorite Filmsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Five Favorite Films with Catfish Directors Henry Joost and Rel SchulmanThe filmmakers behind 2010's word-of-mouth sensation give us their all-time favorites and discuss their hit documentaryby Luke Goodsell | September 17, 2010 |  CommentsDocumentary or skilfully edited fiction? We can’t really talk too much about Catfish, the Sundance hit that swims into theaters this week on a wave of word-of-mouth, because, well, it would ruin the experience of watching the film’s events unfold. What we can say is the film — which charts the unlikely online friendship between New York photographer Nev Schulman and an 8-year-old Michigan girl — taps into a social phenomenon wholly particular to our time, keeping its audience guessing as it twists and turns into unexpected revelations. Or… are they? Rather than spoil the film, we caught up with co-directors Henry Joost and Rel Schulman (Nev’s brother) and asked them to run through their five favorite films. “Can we do 100?” asks Joost as they begin reeling off an exhaustive list that runs from from Les Diaboliques to Heat. “We’ve been agonizing over this.”Oh, and read on afterward as we get what we can out of them about Catfish… beware spoilers.Stand by Me (1986,94% Tomatometer)Rel: It’s the movie I watched most between the ages of eight and 12. It was about camaraderie. It was the friendship I always wished I had with three other guys.The Princess Bride (1987,95% Tomatometer)It’s every kind of movie in one.Rosemary’s Baby (1968,98% Tomatometer)Because I grew up down the street from the Dakota. I have been up in the apartments but never in that apartment. I think Polanski makes the best thriller around.Grizzly Man (2005,93% Tomatometer)I guess because Werner Herzog might be the coolest man in the world. I like how he inserts himself into all of his stories. I’m a big fan of, I guess, “direct” cinema, but I don’t believe that a documentarian has to be a fly on the wall. That would be dull. I would listen to Herzog read anything. He could read the yellow pages. [On the influence of Herzog on Catfish] I guess just the basic instinct on our part just to be in our own films, to be a cameraman and a voice behind the camera and perhaps a character at times. We definitely get that from Herzog.Money Talks (1997,17% Tomatometer)Money Talks, by Brett Ratner. [both laugh] Rel: Henry, why do you like that? Henry: Because it’s a pitch perfect action comedy. We watched it recently. You know what’s also a pitch-perfect buddy comedy? Rush Hour. But that’s not in my top five.Next: Schulman and Joost discuss how Catfish came about, and the trickiness of marketing the film.It must be exciting, what with the buzz around this film.Yeah, it’s been wild.Did you expect any of this?No, we didn’t even expect to make the movie. It was sort of an accident.At what point did you think that this accident could become the movie we see now?It’s a very particular point, which is in the movie. It’s right after the “song discovery” — that’s when it became clear to Henry and I that there was an arc to this.The movie plays almost like a thriller — did you have that sense when you were making it?That’s the way the experience was in real life. It actually took us a little while to find that in the editing, because our instinct was to shoot voice-over narration and stuff like that, which we ended up just cutting out.Without giving anything away, what was the most eye-opening moment in making the film?[laughs] Too hard to answer!Okay, how do you approach the marketing of the film, then, given the less you know about it the more entertaining it is? Was that always your intent?Yeah, I mean we always wanted audiences to have the same experience that we had on it, going into it blind, basically — never knowing where the story is headed. So that’s the great challenge of marketing it, to preserve that innocence.What’s been an interesting reaction so far?Well now people are reacting to the marketing and saying, “I went into the film thinking it was going to be The Blair Witch Project but I was totally surprised that it was a documentary that it did so much more than that.”I was kind of expecting a horror twist but it was surprising where it does go.Yeah, I mean so far people haven’t been disappointed by that.It’s also pretty timely that your film is releasing just ahead of Fincher’s Social NetworkIt is good. Maybe they’ll work really well in tandem — you’ve got the beginning of Facebook and you’ve got the status update.What do you two have planned next? Another documentary?We’d love to make another documentary; we’ve got our cameras on at every single moment, just in case. But I don’t think we’re gonna find another story that’s so spontaneous, so we’re just ready for it to find us. In the meantime we’re writing a Polanski-style thriller .What’s it called?[laughs] “Less is more.”Catfish opens in limited release in NY and LA this weekend, with other cities to follow.","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"war, archives, strong, Adventures, international, Rey, name, All","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Five-Favorite-Films-with-Catfish-Directors-Henry-Joost-and-Rel-Schulman"},{"id":"47508855898492","title":"Five Favorite Films with Justin Long","content":"Five Favorite Filmsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Five Favorite Films with Justin LongThe star of Alpha and Omega gives an exhaustive and passionate top fiveby Luke Goodsell | September 21, 2010 |  CommentsTalking with Justin Long is kind of like having a chat with your junior Cinema Professor on the history of movie comedy. Seriously — the dude can talk for hours on the art of the “spit take” (he’s even tried to work the gag into every movie he’s appeared in), in between gushing about the Marx Brothers and delivering an uncannily good impersonation of Philip Seymour Hoffman as Lester Bangs in Almost Famous. The actor’s typically busy this year, having already antagonized Michael Cera in Youth In Revolt and romanced Drew Barrymore in the recent Going the Distance, and this week he lends his voice to the animated comedy Alpha and Omega, co-starring Christina Ricci, Hayden Panettiere and Dennis Hopper. Taking a break from the promo trail, Justin dropped in to discuss his five favorite films of all time. And wow, did he come prepared.Back to the Future (1985,96% Tomatometer)I’m really worried about these five films. It’s such a tough question. I mean, the first one is easy for me, I can do that right off the bat. The first one’s Back to the Future, for so many reasons: sentimental, cinematic; in terms of just a movie that you love, measuring a movie in terms of how often you can see it without getting tired of it — it’s all of those things for me. I think it’s the most perfect movie ever made. It’s like the form of a movie that all other movies, entertainment-wise, should aspire to. It’s something that I’ll always study — just the storytelling, the efficiency of it. The fact that every element works so perfectly in harmony. It’s a thing to behold.Drugstore Cowboy (1989,100% Tomatometer)It’s hard for me to narrow it down to my favorite directors and favorite actors, too, but I love Matt Dillon. I love Beautiful Girls and I love Flamingo Kid — he’s responsible for a lot of my favorites, but I’m gonna have to pick Drugstore Cowboy. I saw it when I was a kid and I felt like it was such a different culture than any that I’d ever been exposed to, and I felt like instantly I was a part of it — even though I had no frame of reference. I mean, I wasn’t a “kid,” I was 14 or 15. I had started getting into, you know, that sort of pretentious high school literate phase where you start reading, like, Kerouac and Ginsberg and, I don’t know — I loved that world, that romanticized, thuggy, kind of petty crime world. I really romanticized it myself and just wanted to be a part of that world; there was something exciting about that for me. And I love the way it’s shot. I love the drugged out scenes; I love the way [Gus Van Sant] shoots with cut-outs, those kind of simple, free-floating cut-outs to convey the psychedelic scenes. It was one of my very first exposures to that style of filmmaking that was a lot more patient and took its time and allowed itself to breathe. And from there I got into, like Hal Hartley and the independent movies of the ’90s. But my love of that type of film all started with Drugstore Cowboy.Boogie Nights (1997,92% Tomatometer)I think a lot about Martin Scorsese and how heavily influenced Paul Thomas Anderson was by him. I feel like he learned so much from Scorsese in Boogie Nights, and so I feel like picking Boogie Nights is somewhat accounting for my Martin Scorsese love. But I’m also being very honest about a movie that I can watch over and over. Just the epic nature and the grandness of it, and some of the shots and the style of it, and the music — my God, the way he uses music — and that great shot where somebody jumps into the pool and you hear the muffled soundtrack. It’s brilliant. I never get sick of watching it. And the acting is just some of my favorite actors at the top of their game. I love doing impressions and one of my earliest impressions of an actor was Philip Seymour Hoffman in that movie, when he’s saying how much he loves the name and he’s chewing on the pen.Way Out West (1937,100% Tomatometer)I have to pay my respects to two very influential cinema figures for me. Laurel and Hardy are probably the biggest influence for me, just in terms of sense ofm humour, when I was a kid, and in terms of what I continue to laugh at. If I had to pick one I’d say it would be Way Out West. I watched it recently and it still holds up. The reason why I think I latched on to them so much is because as a team they had such a great balance. Oliver Hardy was such a great anal retentive straight man, but still funny in his own right. They had such different comedic perspectives but when they worked together they created such a perfect synthesis; just a perfect balance of extremes, of odd coupling. I feel like all of my favorite comedy since then in some way draws from that — Planes, Trains and Automobiles comes to mind, and What About Bob?, and Midnight Run; these all employ the same template and they’re my favorites, but I feel like I can trace it all the way to Way Out West.Annie Hall… and every other Woody Allen movie from the ’70s (1977,98% Tomatometer)If I had to do my top 100 movies I think 15 to 20 of them would be Woody Allen movies. This is the toughest one for me to do because the instinct is to say Annie Hall, because it’s undeniably, I think, perfect — in terms of comedy, romantic comedy specifically. It’s one that, the older I get, I feel like I continue to grow with, and I check in with it every once in a while. Depending on where I am in my life and the relationships I’ve had, I can always glean something different from it or recognize some truth in it that I’ve experienced or yet to experience. It changes every time. If I were like an evangelical, crazy born-again it would be my Bible. It’s like having an old sage friend who you don’t see very often, who’s tremendously neurotic. I also relate to him so much just as a neurotic and an over-analyzer. I fell in love with him in junior high school when, you know, you’re going through your formative years and you’re realizing certain qualities about yourself. So when I was introduced to Woody Allen it was such a relief. He made me feel like it was okay; not only could I function with neuroses but I could thrive. And certainly with women you go through so many relationship questions and struggles and it’s just nice to know someone can take all of that and create entertainment and mine those life transitions for such comedy. There’s a lot of solace in that. But I also love him on a simple comedy level — I almost love his physical comedy and his slapstick as much. So if I had to pick just one, I would say “Every movie he made in the ’70s.” [laughs]Alpha and Omega is in theaters now.","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"OneApp, video, curtis, Disney, Originals","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Five-Favorite-Films-with-Justin-Long"},{"id":"47508855905665","title":"Five Favorite Films with Harry Shearer","content":"Five Favorite Filmsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Five Favorite Films with Harry ShearerThe comedian and radio host also talks to us about his Katrina documentary.by Matt Atchity | August 31, 2010 |  CommentsIf Harry Shearer isn’t a household name, he really should be. The well-rounded entertainer has focused his talents on film, on radio, in music, and on television, among others. Among his many credits are roles in This is Spinal Tap, Saturday Night Live, and The Simpsons, for which he voices such popular characters as Mr. Burns, Ned Flanders, and Principal Skinner. This evening (Monday, August 30th), Shearer’s latest directorial project, The Big Uneasy, a documentary about the truth behind the New Orleans catastrophe during Hurricane Katrina, engages a special one-night screening in theaters across the country on the five-year anniversary of the tragedy. Shearer was kind enough to take some time out of his busy schedule to give his Five Favorite Films and talk about his film. Read on for the full interview!Dr. Strangelove (1964,100% Tomatometer)I’ll start with Dr. Strangelove. The best satirical movie ever made. Has some amazingly funny performances. When you see Peter Sellers at his best, that’s about as good as you can get, and it’s a brilliantly written, brilliantly directed dissection of the military industrial state.To Be or Not to Be (1942,97% Tomatometer)To Be or Not to Be, Ernst Lubitsch’s World War II movie. To make a comedy about World War II in the middle of World War II is major league balls, and he pulls it off brilliantly. It’s Jack Benny and Carole Lombard. It’s her last film; she’s amazingly funny. And Benny does this great trick of playing the character in the film and yet getting laughs off what you know about the Jack Benny character from out of the movie, without ever disrupting the flow of the story. Just a brilliant movie. Really well worth studying for how to direct a serious comedy about a serious subject, and yet be really funny.Singin’ in the Rain (1952,100% Tomatometer)Singin’ in the Rain. Just the best musical film ever made and one of the funniest movies about Hollywood ever made.Laurel &amp; Hardy FilmsAny Laurel &amp; Hardy feature. My wife and I took a couple of Laurel &amp; Hardy features over to a friend’s house in Fiji, out in the middle of nowhere, and he’s friends with the kids in the neighboring village. And these 8-10 year-old Fijian kids came in and watched Laurel &amp; Hardy and laughed their heads off. It travels through time and space.It’s A Mad Mad Mad Mad World (1963,77% Tomatometer)This is one that will never be in the list of really great movies, but there’s so many really good comedy performances in it, and it’s a comedy museum by itself of performers of this certain era and how great they were. It’s A Mad Mad Mad Mad World. My favorite thing about It’s A Mad Mad Mad Mad World, which was, in its original release, pretty f***ing long, is that at least one of the versions that came out on home video, they released it with 20 extra minutes. So that would be It’s A Mad Mad Mad Mad Mad World. You have to add an extra “Mad” to it.Next, Shearer talks about why he made his documentary and what it’s about.RT: So let’s talk about The Big Uneasy. Apart from the obvious – the five-year anniversary of Hurricane Katrina hitting New Orleans – what prompted you to make this movie?Harry Shearer: The fact that if you follow the news, you don’ know why this thing happened. It’s as simple as that. And I got fed up with the fact that I knew that the news coverage on the fifth anniversary was going to be, in so many ways, a rerun of the news coverage at the time. A lot of the same footage of suffering people, a lot of the same characters brought back for “Where Are They Now?” interviews. “What’s Ray Nagin doing now? What’s Mike Brown doing now?” But still, no real desire to ask or answer the question, “Why did this thing happen?”The media became fixated on the idea that it was a hurricane story, and they’ve never let go of that. And it’s not a hurricane story. It was a hurricane story in the Mississippi Gulf Coast, it was a hurricane story in South Louisiana, but it was a very different story in New Orleans. You can sum up that story the way one of the investigators we profile in the film, a distinguished engineering professor from UC Berkeley, summed it up: it’s the worst manmade engineering catastrophe since Chernobyl. Chernobyl is major leagues. We’re not talking Triple-A here.The film is only being shown on Monday, August 30th, right?Yes. I felt that, after this weeklong display of the problems with the news coverage, that it would be an appropriate night, Monday night, the fifth anniversary of when we really realized how bad the flooding was, to give people the opportunity to see the answers to the question “why.” We follow the course of two of the lead investigators in each of these two investigations from the moment that they first had their doubts about the official explanations, through being in the muck to their findings to what happened to them as a result of going public. And we do the same thing with a third person who was a whistleblower from inside the US Army Corps of Engineers.What are you hoping people will get out of this film?Well, I hope that, you know, after five years, people will understand why this happened, which was basically that we, as federal taxpayers, through our congress, thought we were buying a system to protect New Orleans from hurricanes, and instead bought a system that almost destroyed New Orleans. And it maybe that it was bold to expect it would be done better at the time, not just for New Orleans, not just the New Orleans story. This agency, the US Army Corps of Engineers, is supposedly protecting more than a hundred cities with levee systems like the ones they built for New Orleans. Sacramento is one of them, and the prognosis isn’t good.With all of your time with your radio show and your work on TV and the movies that you do, how did you find time to make this?I just cleared everything away. I mean, I still did my radio show, I still did The Simpsons. You know, this was done on a very accelerated schedule for a normal documentary, and I just went balls-out, night and day. I had an editor who was willing to commit to that same kind of schedule and a great New Orleans crew and a great cinematographer from Los Angeles. People just bought into the idea that this was worth doing and therefore we had to do everything we could to get it done.This is the first documentary that you’ve filmed. I know that you’ve done the faux documentaries before. Did you have to leave behind some of your instincts as a…Oh, you leave behind that whole side of your personality that fools around. When you’re doing comedy, you have to be irresponsible, and when you’re doing this you have to be totally responsible.Was it hard to play it straight through the whole production?No, you know, I mean look. You don’t play it straight. The sound man who worked on our crew said he’s never had more fun on a shoot in his life, because, you know, when you’re dealing with very serious stuff, when the camera’s not rolling, you tend to try to release the tension and have fun, keep people enjoying their job. There was plenty of time for that, but I knew I had very little time to get this right. I had to be focused on communicating a pretty complicated story to as wide an audience as possible in a comprehensible and yet not trivial manner. So all the brainpower was focused in that direction.As someone who listens to your show, I’d like to know: do you think we’ll see you going the route that Al Franken has gone? Will we see “Vote for Harry?”I’m going to guarantee you no. And this isn’t a politician’s guarantee, this is a human being’s guarantee. No f***ing way. But, you know, I didn’t go the way Al Franken went in the comedy business either.The Big Uneasy, Harry Shearer’s truth-seeking documentary about Hurricane Katrina’s effects on New Orleans, will play for one night on Monday, August 30th, at select theaters.

Just a few years later, Cube made his critically acclaimed film debut in John Singleton’s Boyz N the Hood, jumpstarting a Hollywood career that would include everything from family comedies to action flicks to inspirational sports dramas. Further expanding his repertoire, his latest role came just last week in Lottery Ticket, in which he plays an elderly mentor to a young man who’s just won a lottery jackpot.Cube took a break from his schedule to stop by The Rotten Tomatoes Show on Current to share five ofhis favorite movies.

Gary GrayThe director of Law Abiding Citizen also talks about his career and debuting his films with audiences.by Ryan Fujitani | October 14, 2009 |  CommentsDirector F. Gary Gray began his career creating music videos for several big name R&amp;B and hip-hop artists in the early 90s, including Ice Cube, TLC, and OutKast. In 1995, Gray made a big screen splash with a little stoner comedy called Friday, starring a pre-Rush Hour Chris Tucker and an up-and-coming Ice Cube, a friend of Gray’s. Friday was a surprise hit, opening the doors for future high profile projects such as The Negotiator, 2003’s The Italian Job remake, and Be Cool.This week, Gray continues his strong track record in the crime/action genre with Law Abiding Citizen, starring Gerard Butler in the role of a victim of a brutal home invasion who exacts vigilante justice on his attackers… and then some. We had the opportunity to chat with Gary about the movie and his career, and he kindly offered us his Five Favorite Films. Read on to find out more.&nbsp;Casablanca (1942,97% Tomatometer)I’d say Casablanca. I love that it was a combination of political… It had a great love story, and it was unpredictable. It didn’t have the classic Hollywood ending, and that was what was great about it. Also, I love Humphrey Bogart, because he had the great ability to be masculine, yet vulnerable, and that was the perfect role to display that.Sweet Smell of Success (1957,100% Tomatometer)Sweet Smell of Success. That movie, it was just dialogue. The dialogue was absolutely amazing in that movie. They just don’t write movies like that any more. You can watch that over and over and over again and never get tired of the dialogue.La Dolce Vita (1960,98% Tomatometer)La Dolce Vita by Federico Fellini, who I’m sure you’re familiar with. And again, not the formula. He was incredible at expressing himself in a way that no other filmmaker could get away with. You see these sequences that may or may not be related. [laughs] Somehow, at the end of it all, it all makes sense, and you’re floored. The photography, and the shots, and the choreography can stand up to anything that’s been released up to now.The Godfather Part II (1974,98% Tomatometer)Godfather II, specifically number two. It was just what a gangster film should be. It was smart, it had great performances, and you travel through a lot of different worlds with these characters. You know, most people try to avoid family drama. [laughs] I just love the filmmaking in Godfather II.On the Waterfront (1954,100% Tomatometer)On the Waterfront, with Marlon Brando. Between the look, the feel, the casting… even the casting of the extras. Just to look back and get a sense of what America was like back then, and the details, it was just amazing. And again, it was another one of those movies where the leading man, the way they struck a balance between masculine and vulnerable. Humphrey Bogart did it in Casablanca; I think Marlon Brando did it in On the Waterfront, so that’s why they stick out as the best to me. They’re pretty incredible. You’re just like, you sit back and you say, “Damn, I wish I could do that!” [laughs]Next, Gray talks about Law Abiding Citizen, what it’s like to sit with an audience through the premiere screening of one of his films, and his career.RT: Let’s talk a little bit about Law Abiding Citizen. I was actually at the screening you held at the Arclight a few weeks ago, when both you and Gerard Butler showed up. The audience reaction to that was incredible; everyone seemed to enjoy it. What is that like, sitting along with an audience to watch one of your films for the first time?F. Gary Gray: It’s nerve-wracking at first, because you just have no idea how they’re going to respond. That was the very first screening. You know what you like about the picture, but you have no idea what 350 people feel about your choices, and you get to see it firsthand. The audience reaction was amazing; I couldn’t ask for a better response, honestly.Was there anything that the audience responded to in a way that you didn’t expect?FGG: Well, there’s a moment with the judge, and I can’t give it away to the readers, but there’s a surprising moment with the judge in our picture. When I shot it, I knew it would pack a punch and I knew that it would be surprising, but I had no idea people would jump out of their seats and talk for the duration of the scene about that moment. There are a couple of moments like that, but I think that’s the biggest moment where you’re just kind of like, “Wow, I had no idea that would have that impact.”I know that you weren’t initially attached to the project in the beginning. Can you talk a little bit about how you came to be a part of Law Abiding Citizen?FGG: Yeah, Jamie Foxx gave me a call, and we’ve been trying to find a project for quite a while. I’ve always wanted to work with him. We really wanted to find the perfect material, the right material. He called me and said, “I found something great for us. I think you would be absolutely perfect. You should read it right away and tell me what you think.” And, you know, I read it, sat and met with the producers, the film department — Lucas Foster and Mark Gill — and two weeks later I was in Philadelphia in pre-production. It doesn’t always happen like that, but it did. I’m kind of lucky that it happened that way, because the material was great and the concept was great. To have it almost fall in my lap like this was perfect.[rtimage]MapID=1198026&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=5&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Speaking of working with Jamie Foxx, who also has a music career, I know you’ve done music video work with a lot of different artists, like TLC and OutKast. Some of your videos have a grand, epic feel to them, almost like mini-movies. What is it like directing pop stars versus directing actors? Are there any noticeable differences in the methods you have to employ?FGG: Well, it’s two totally different universes. Directing actors in a movie, you have to pay close attention to the detail of the character, the character’s background, the character’s back story, how that character works within the context of the world that you’re creating within the context of the sequence you’re creating. It’s just a lot of detailed work. It’s obviously kind of predetermined when you’re working with a music artist. When you’re working with a music artist, you may have to do a little bit of that if you have a high concept, like a story within a music video, but a lot of that work is already decided because they already have their persona. It’s quite different. With music videos, I guess in general, you focus on entertaining people with images primarily. But with movies, it’s a completely different universe.I had fun doing music videos, and it certainly helped me technically when I was coming up. I certainly wanted my music videos to feel like movies, but again, I can’t say that it’s a smooth bridge from music videos to movies because they’re two different worlds.[rtimage]MapID=1198026&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=24&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]In Law Abiding Citizen, you maintain a high level of tension throughout the film. And with Gerard Butler’s character behind bars, manipulating events on the outside, and the gruesome early scene that takes place in the factory, forgive me for making the comparison, but it bears a resemblance to the Saw films. With that in mind, having mainly done comedies and crime thrillers, have you given any thought to branching out to other genres, like maybe horror?FGG: It’s truly about the material. If I find a sci-fi project or horror project that I have passion for, then absolutely. I never limit myself when it comes to telling stories; I think people can see that in my body of work. It’s just about, what’s a great story? Is it unique? Is it a challenge? Am I up for it? It’s really simple. Yeah, you’ll see other things from me in different genres, especially this next chapter. I kind of consider my first six films like training camp, and the next chapter is really about the filmmaker and what I’ve learned, and applying that to my storytelling.Do you have something specific coming up on the horizon that you’re working on?FGG: I have a few things, but it’s best for me to get a little closer before I talk about them.These days, particularly with the advent of internet sites like YouTube, it’s become much easier for aspiring filmmakers to have their work seen. Considering your background and how you came up in the industry, having not studied filmmaking formally, would you prefer to have had these same advantages or to have done things any differently than you did?FGG: That’s a good question. I think there are a lot of benefits to having the technology today to try things out and to get a reaction from people on these social networks, but I’ve had a great career, so I don’t know if I’d do it any differently. This industry has been great to me and my career. You always want to adjust certain things, but overall, I’ve been fortunate.F.

Fans of the Fox television show Boston Public knew her as attorney-turned-high school teacher Ronnie Cooke, and Ryan maintained recurring roles on other popular shows such as The O.C. and Boston Legal. But she is perhaps best known for her work as the Borg “Seven of Nine” on Star Trek: Voyager. In fact, Ryan’s role in the sci-fi series propelled her to the height of geek fandom, as the former Miss Illinois’ smoldering screen presence succeeded in melting the hearts of many a Voyager fan.Earlier this year, Ryan began a stint on Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit as defense attorney Patrice La Rue, and beginning tomorrow, she will appear in an extended guest starring role on the TNT show Leverage. Lucky for us, she took some time out of her busy schedule to speak with RT about her Five Favorite Films, working in TV vs. working in film, and how she feels about escargot. Read on for the full interview!Sophie’s Choice (1982,81% Tomatometer)That’s my favorite. The rest are in no particular older. Meryl Streep and Kevin Kline and one of the most horrifically gut-wrenching scenes ever in anything. But their performances were just off the charts insane.E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial (1982, 98% Tomatometer)I’ve probably now seen it with my son about a hundred times and I cry every single time. Every time.Toy Story (1995, 100% Tomatometer)I just think it’s brilliant. Everything about it is brilliant.The Wizard of Oz (1939,100% Tomatometer)What’s not to love about The Wizard of Oz? This many years later, it still holds up.You Can Count On Me (2000, 95% Tomatometer)Just the performances of Laura Linney and Mark Ruffalo are just amazing. I loved that movie. It’s such a simple, quiet story, but it’s just so good. The characters were so good. The performances were so good. If I threw a sixth one in there, it’d be the original Willy Wonka. Gene Wilder is brilliant.Next, Jeri Ryan talks about her new role on Leverage and love for escargot.RT: So you’re joining the cast of Leverage. What attracted you to the show?Jeri Ryan: What I loved most about the show is the tone of the show. I love that it doesn’t take itself too seriously. It’s got all the action you could want. It’s got all the character moments you could want. It’s got real, tender, emotional beats. But it’s light-hearted, it’s a great pace, and it’s sort of fun, sort of taper-y; it’s a heist film every week. It’s so much fun and I love that it’s light-hearted and not heavy-handed. I just love the tone.So one of the descriptions of your character is “a two-fisted, street-wise con artist.” What do they mean by two-fisted?JR: Ball buster. That’s what they mean. She’s tough. The best description that John Rogers gave me of the character is “Sophie was the quintessential European grafter and she worked in the art world. Tara (Jeri Ryan) is the one running out of the exploding building with a suitcase full of bloody cash. That’s Tara.” I went, “Ok! I got it. That makes perfect sense.”Do you find that there’s a big difference for you working in TV versus movies?JR: Oh dear god, yes. The pace is completely different. On television, you’re shooting anywhere between six and eight pages a day of a script. A feature film, you’re shooting about two, maybe two and a half, three at the absolute most. You’re working on one scene all day, the same scene. So if you’re used to the pace of television, that’s a little mind numbing.So do you find that you’re enjoying television more?JR: Yeah. {laughs} That was where I cut my teeth for a camera on television. So that’s the pace that I was used to. That’s the pace that I was always used to. So when I went into film, that’s a hard adjustment to make. And I know vice versa, for film people to come into television, it’s a shock to their systems because they’re used to having so much more time to work on things and do twenty takes of each shot and do forty-five shots of one scene. You don’t have that luxury in television. I’m much more comfortable with the pace of keeping things moving.How is the restaurant going? What’s your favorite thing on the menu at your husband’s (chef Christophe Eme) restaurant (Ortolan in Los Angeles)?JR: One is escargot. That I won’t let him take off the menu. He’s had that on since we opened because his escargot is not the typical escargot with garlic butter and puff pastry, which is delicious, but he uses chorizo and tomato concasse’ and it’s served in a highball glass. It’s amazing. So unique and so delicious. My son even eats it. You get a fifteen year old American kid eating snails, you’re in good shape.When are we going to get a show about Jeri Ryan the chef?JR: Seriously! Talk to some writers!You can catch Jeri Ryan in Leverage on Wednesdays on TNT at 10:00 PM.For more Five Favorite Films,visit our archive.","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"Discovery, Showtime, theme, Ice, HBO, scorecard, stop","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Five-Favorite-Films-with-Jeri-Ryan"},{"id":"47508859031972","title":"Five Favorite Films With Zombieland Director Ruben Fleischer","content":"Five Favorite Filmsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Five Favorite Films With Zombieland Director Ruben FleischerThe man behind this year's hit horror-comedy reveals the films behind the manby Luke Goodsell | November 24, 2009 |  CommentsFilmmaker Ruben Fleischer is having a very good 2009. The former music video director has seen his debut feature, Zombieland, open at number one at the US box office and take in nearly $75 million domestically, while earning an impressive 89% Fresh rating from critics — not bad for a horror-comedy road movie revolving around the undead. With the film about to open in Australia, we got the chance to catch up with Ruben and ask him his five favorite films. And a fine list it is, too.The Blues Brothers (1980,84% Tomatometer)I think everybody has their movie when they’re a kid that they love, and that was the one that I used to watch over and over again. And it kind of introduced me to soul music, which I hadn’t really known about before. Each of those scenes are kind of like a music video in themselves, and I think that definitely contributed to me later becoming a music video director. John Landis went on to direct the greatest music video of all time, so I think it informed him as well.Rushmore (1998,86% Tomatometer)It’s a movie that I love and I’ve watched a ton of times. I think that early Wes Anderson was just so exciting and original, and he reinvented Bill Murray in a really cool way. The specifics of the production design and everything are just super inspiring.Midnight Run (1988,100% Tomatometer)I guess Midnight Run was a big influence on this movie, and it’s a movie I’ve always loved. I just love the combination of Charles Grodin’s dry humour and De Niro in, you know, his funniest ever role. It’s a great combination of action and adventure.Down by Law (1986,88% Tomatometer)Off the top of my head I’ll say Down by Law, the Jim Jarmusch movie with Tom Waits and John Lurie and Roberto Benigni. It just has sort of a weird sense of humour and it’s a bit of a road movie itself. It’s original in a really cool way.Blazing Saddles (1974,89% Tomatometer)[laughing] I wanted to say “all Mel Brooks” but I guess I’ll just say Blazing Saddles because of how ahead of its time it was, in terms of the humour and how cutting edge it was. It really pushed boundaries.","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"serial, fast, Festival, pirates, Studios, and","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/RubenFleischer.jpg","slug":"five-favorite-films-with-zombieland-director-ruben-fleischer"},{"id":"47508859014555","title":"Five Favorite Films With Precious‘ Gabby Sidibe","content":"Five Favorite Filmsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Five Favorite Films With Precious' Gabby SidibeRT asks the Oscar-nominated star to name five of her preciousssesby Luke Goodsell | February 5, 2010 |  CommentsFor a first-time ever actor, Gabby Sidibe’s been thrown directly into the glare of the spotlight: the star of Lee Daniels’ critically acclaimed inner city drama Precious has found herself nominated for a host of awards recently, including a Best Actress Oscar alongside such greats as Helen Mirren and Meryl Streep. It could all be a little overwhelming, but when RT caught up with the 26-year-old New Yorker we found her anything but fame-struck; preferring instead to chat about movies and kangaroo fights (well, that’s another story). And so it was she got on to the subject of her five favorite movies…The Five Heartbeats (1991,46% Tomatometer)The Five Heartbeats. That movie’s awesome. It’s kind of like The Temptations, but it’s a movie about a big band, well I guess it’s the story of the band, and they’re all brothers. Like The Temptations except it’s a little funnier. I mean it stars Robert Townsend, who’s really good.Hollywood Shuffle (1987,87% Tomatometer)Hollywood Shuffle, directed by and starring Robert Townsend — so there’s a theme.The Goonies (1985,64% Tomatometer)The Goonies, because I think I watched it when I was a kid. It’s tied to the child in me. It’s the memories I have from that, from that time in my life when I was watching it.Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom (1984,85% Tomatometer)Yeah, the Temple of Doom, That was the best one. That scene where he reaches into the dude’s heart? Come on, that’s the bomb! And I like the little kid, Short Round.This Is It (2009,81% Tomatometer)I’ve got one more? Oh man, my newest favorite movie is This Is It, the Michael Jackson movie. ‘Cause I went into it and I was like, “Eh, whatever, it’s just another Michael thing”, but I didn’t think I’d be that impressed by it. I was just going to kill an afternoon, but it was so good. And I walked out going, “He was so good; he was murdered.” Because he didn’t seem incoherent at all. He was such a genius. He could hear things that no one else in the world could hear musically. That’s one of my latest favorite movies.Click here read RT’s interview with Gabby as she discusses Precious and the Oscars.","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"Star, dark, Century, New, awards, Shudder, Music, media, Superheroes, Academy, festivals, TV+","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Five-Favorite-Films-With-Precious-Gabby-Sidibe"},{"id":"47508859017628","title":"Five Favourite Films with Anika Noni Rose","content":"Five Favorite Filmsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Five Favourite Films with Anika Noni RoseThe Princess and the Frog star shares her picks.by Joe Utichi | February 4, 2010 |  CommentsIt’s been a busy few years for Anika Noni Rose. After starting her career in the Broadway musical Footloose, she snagged a role as part of the starry ensemble in 2004’s Dreamgirls and made the transition to the big screen. Perfect qualifications, then, for her latest role as Disney’s newest princess, Tiana, in The Princess and the Frog. Beating out tough competition from Alicia Keys, Tyra Banks and her Dreamgirls co-star Jennifer Hudson, the 37 year-old actress is making headlines as Disney’s first black princess, and has been touring the world to support the company’s return to hand-drawn fairy-tales.Sitting down with RT at Walt Disney Animations Studios’ Burbank HQ, Rose shares her five (or six) favourite films.East of Eden (1955,87% Tomatometer)I love East of Eden, there’s so much passion. I was reading about how it was made, and how it was such a new thing for James Dean to be doing. One of those scenes was really improvisational between he and his father or mother, and he has this burst of emotion that came from nowhere, that he didn’t even understand. He had such virility in that movie — I love it.My Fair Lady (1964, 94% Tomatometer)That’s something I always wanted to do, damn that Keira Knightley! The costumes are phenomenal in that movie, the message is fantastic and there’s just a grandeur and beauty in the scope. We don’t even make movies with that kind of scope anymore; I don’t think anybody would sit there for that long for that movie anymore. It’s about being yourself, and not forgetting yourself really. Even though you move forward or you move up, you still are you. When they’re at that racetrack she’s talking to the horse and she’s going, “Go Clover,” and then she goes crazy shouting, “Move your arse, Clover!” And she’s got that phenomenal hat, fantastic dress on, but she’s Eliza Doolittle you know? I love that movie, and why can’t a woman be more like a man? I love that song; I love his confusion with that.Strangers on a Train (1951, 97% Tomatometer)There’s something so twisted and sick — that man is sitting there on that train and he just looks so banal and smiling, and he is a killer. It’s really a crazy movie.Fantasia (1940,98% Tomatometer)Oh I just love Fantasia. I played that for my nephew when he was two, and I don’t believe in popping children in front of the television as a babysitter, but I feel like, you know what? “I’m introducing you to classical music; I’m introducing you to classic cartoons, so watch it!” It’s a beautiful way to take music and to take your mind to a place of no words.Carmen Jones (1954, 71% Tomatometer)And All About Eve!The Princess and the Frog is in cinemas now.For more Five Favorite Films,visit our archive.","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"Grant, Marvel, movies, Lucasfilm, werewolf, rt, Brie, Superheroes, Originals, Photos, discovery, 2017, Premiere, DC","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Five-Favourite-Films-with-Anika-Noni-Rose"},{"id":"47508862207416","title":"Five Favorite Films with Richard Kelly","content":"Five Favorite Filmsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Five Favorite Films with Richard KellyThe director of The Box and Donnie Darko talks Kubrick and the merits of being ambiguous.by Jen Yamato | July 24, 2009 |  Comments&nbsp;Is it possible that after only two films (his cult hit debut Donnie Darko and his infamously panned follow-up, Southland Tales), director Richard Kelly has already achieved auteur status? Audiences will find out this Halloween, when Kelly’s next film, The Box, opens in theaters. Based on Richard Matheson’s short story Button, Button, the old-fashioned thriller follows a married couple (Cameron Diaz and James Marsden) who are given a choice: if they push a button they’ll receive one million dollars, but someone somewhere will die. Rotten Tomatoes spoke with Kelly in San Diego just hours before he debuted extended footage from The Box and discussed his favorite films, the genesis of The Box, and his hopes to return to Southland Tales with an eventual Director’s Cut.2001: A Space Odyssey (1968,96% Tomatometer)It pioneered everything, and it’s a film that says pretty much everything that needs to be said about our species (laughs). It was just such a groundbreaking film on every level. I don’t know if anyone has broken ground quite in the way that Kubrick did with that film.Barry Lyndon (1975, 94% Tomatometer)On the flipside, Barry Lyndon, for me, is the most beautiful film ever made, for its beauty and also for its statement about our hubris as a species, in the character of Barry Lyndon being a fool who destroys everyone around him. After that it’s really murky.Vertigo (1958, 98% Tomatometer)My favorite Alfred Hitchcock film would have to be Vertigo.Close Encounters of the Third Kind(1977, 95% Tomatometer)&nbsp;My favorite Spielberg film is probably Close Encounters of the Third Kind.The Big Lebowski (1998, 77% Tomatometer)Who’s another director I like? My favorite Coen Brothers film has gotta be The Big Lebowski.&nbsp;Next: Kelly talks about the merits of ambiguity in cinema, and why The Box is his most personal film.RT: So what of The Box will be show at Comic-Con?RK: It’s a four and a half minute montage that I cut together. It has the score from the film, so I’m really excited for everyone to see it.RT: What interested you in The Box?RK: This was a short story that I optioned about six years ago, so I’ve been trying to figure out how to turn it into a film for several years now. In 2006, it finally all clicked for me. I figured out how to crack the story. The timing was right, and I felt like I wanted to make this my third film. I felt I wanted to go back and make a film in Virginia, where I grew up. [I wanted] to take my parents and my family and the elements of their lives and merge it with Richard Matheson’s short story, to flesh out Arthur and Norma in a very personal way, and to do an old-fashioned suspense film. It’s kind of an old-fashioned film in the sense that there’s not one swear word in it, there’s very little violence ultimately. It’s a very suspenseful film that I hope we’ve made, in the tradition of the kinds of films that my parents grew up with. I guess it would be Alfred Hitchcock who’s someone that I think of. My parents introduced me to Alfred Hitchcock films.RT: And like Hitchcock’s work, The Box has a moral quandary buried within a thriller.RK: Yeah, it has this tantalizing concept of this button that could cause the death of another human being. And receiving a million dollars for it — that’s a question that you could propose to anyone. I think it’s interesting to think about how many people would go through with it (laughs), and to think about why they would go through with it. Arthur’s a scientist, and he looks at this button unit, and there’s no technology in it. It’s a piece of wood. When he opens it up, the button doesn’t do anything. And so, in his mind, push it! There’s no way this could cause the death of another human being. Push it a hundred times. Who cares? It’s just superstition. But then, when you get into the idea of, is there something greater at work? Is there some sort of magic or a higher power at work? That’s when Arthur’s made to believe, OK, this is real. And Mr. Stewart has some sort of greater ability.RT: Are we speaking in religious terms here?RK: I think we’re talking about science and religion, and ultimately, some sort of supernatural entity that is kind of controlling all of this that Mr. Stewart has access to. That’s part of the investigation into the mystery.[rtimage]MapID=1189532&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=1&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]RT: Do feel like your fans will see this as a “Richard Kelly film?”RK: I hope so. I’ve taken something that was six pages long, that was Richard Matheson’s creation, and I’ve been very reverential to it. But I’ve definitely brought a lot [to it]. It’s the most personal film I’ve ever made. At the same time, it’s also my first studio film, and [it’s] more mainstream than the previous two films. It feels very much like something that people would expect from me, I guess (laughs). Specifically with Donnie Darko; I think it feels tonally similar to Donnie Darko in a lot of ways.RT: I appreciate the fact that Donnie Darko doesn’t spell out its meaning. Is that something you strive for in all of your films?RK: I always like that there’s a degree of ambiguity, and that there’s a lot for people to digest and think about. I hope to always make films that people can watch more than once and continue to see new things, because for me, those are the films that continue to age well. At the same time, it’s also about giving people enough answers so that they don’t feel alienated of confused. It’s about finding that balance in the middle.[rtimage]MapID=1165830&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=17&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]RT: I found Southland Tales fascinating. Does that movie still stay with you?RK: I’m so proud of that film. What I really want to do is to be able to go back and do a longer director’s cut of it at some point. There are still some unfinished visual effects that I’d like to do. And then the whole graphic novel prequel, that will always stay with me, and I hope that one day I’ll get to revisit all of that.RT: What’s the optimal length you’re thinking of?RK: I’d love to put an additional 10 or 15 minutes back into the film. Then, I’d love to do the whole prequel saga as an animated motion-capture film at some point. If the actors aren’t all in wheelchairs by that point (laughs).Click here for more Comic-con coverage, and here for Kelly’s complete filmography.Get our latest Comic-Con 2009 updates here:Comic-Con Day 1 News TickerComic-Con Day 1 Wrap-upComic-Con Day 2 News TickerComic-Con Day 2 Wrap-upComic-Con Day 3 News TickerComic-Con Celebrity GalleryComic-Con Costume Gallery","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"Calendar, Premiere, 24, Schmidt, hidden, Shudder","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/RichardKelly.jpg","slug":"five-favorite-films-with-richard-kelly"},{"id":"47508860578226","title":"Five Favorite Films with Eli Roth","content":"\n\n                                            Five Favorite Films\n                                        \n                        \n                        \n                            var mps=mps||{}; mps._queue=mps._queue||{}; mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[];\n                            mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function() {\n                                mps.rt.insertlogo('#article_sponsorship_ad', 'ploc=articlesponsorship');\n                            });\n                        \n                    \n                    \n                        Five Favorite Films with Eli Roth\n                        The Hostel director and Inglourious Basterds actor shares his favorites\n                        by RT Staff | August 18, 2009                          | \n                          \n                              Comments\n                          \n                     \n\n                     \n\n                     \n                       \n                         \n                           \n                         \n                           \n                         \n                           \n                         \n                           \n                       \n                     \n\n                    \n                                                Eli Roth became part of the mainstream movie watching consciousness from behind the camera by directing the gruesome horror movie Hostel, but he’ll be going in front of the camera for Quentin Tarantino’s Nazi-killing flick Inglourious Basterds.

As the film adaptation of Watchmen arrives on DVD, we asked this inherently cinematic artist to name his five favorite films. On the spot. “I wish I had time to prepare this,” he protests. “Okay, this is absolutely off the cuff… ”&nbsp;Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb (1964,100% Tomatometer)I generally like very visually striking films. I love a lot of Stanley Kubrick’s films. I would have to say Dr. Strangelove, which of course has got resonance in Watchmen. It’s a favorite movie of mine.Apocalypse Now (1979,98% Tomatometer)Apocalypse Now is a favorite movie of mine. Again, there are kind of Watchmen resonances there.Grosse Pointe Blank (1997,78% Tomatometer)For a slightly off beat one, you know sometimes you see a movie and you think, ‘That’s a really good movie — why did I never ever hear of that?’ A movie called Grosse Pointe Blank, which is an incredible movie.Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991,97% Tomatometer)I really actually liked this one. There’s a thing with genre movies and science fiction movies that number two is the charmed; two seems to be the best. I loved Terminator 2. I think of all those kinds of movies, that has to be my favorite ‘blowing big shit up’ kind of movie. How many is that so far?The Reader (2008, 62% Tomatometer)So I have to think of one more? Okay, I’ll say that on the plane coming here I saw The Reader and I thought that was an amazing film, a very affecting film dealing with an almost overfamiliar subject but in an almost novel and emotional way. That’s my current favorite movie.Read RT’s full interview with Dave Gibbons, in which he looks back on his experience with Watchmen and shares his thoughts on the film.","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"Video, Christmas, Prime, Grant, Guide, Walt, Disney+","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/DaveGibbons.jpg","slug":"five-favorite-films-with-dave-gibbons"},{"id":"47508862213563","title":"Five Favourite Films with Jaime Winstone","content":"Five Favorite Filmsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Five Favourite Films with Jaime WinstoneThe actress on the films that inspired her.by Joe Utichi | July 8, 2009 |  CommentsIf you flick through the celebrity pages of most British newspapers — particularly the free sheets — you’ll likely recognise Jaime Winstone. As Ray Winstone‘s daughter she’s part of that select set of star children — think Peaches and Pixie, Lily and Alfie, Kelly and Jack — with whom the tabloid press seem to have a keen fascination; especially when it comes to photographing them on nights out at hip London clubs. At 23 years old, it’s no surprise Winstone enjoys having a good time of an evening, but it’s her daytime activities which are becoming increasingly more interesting.As an actress, she made her debut only 5 years ago, alongside Ashley Walters in powerful Brit drama Bullet Boy, and she’s been quietly building a solid body of work ever since. She played as part of the ensemble cast of Noel Clarke‘s Kidulthood, tried her hand at horror with Donkey Punch and Dead Set, and shared the screen with David Suchet in Poirot.Her five favourite films reveal her passions, her upbringing and the steps that brought her into the industry, and her latest project, Boogie Woogie, released later in the year, promises to continue her quest to be taken seriously as an actress, not just a celebrity. Co-starring Gillian Anderson, Heather Graham and Danny Huston, Winstone plays a manipulative young British artist, and recently attended the film’s premiere at the Edinburgh Film Festival, where RT sat down with her.Click on a thumbnail below.La HaineThe Big LebowskiLawrence of ArabiaTotal RecallPulp FictionLa Haine“It’s definitely up there because of the cinematography, the cultural references, the graffiti, and the art. It’s that kind of high-standard indie film and the French make such beautiful films anyway. They seem to be in a league of their own.

What made you want to become an actress?Jaime Winstone: I don’t really know, to be honest. When I was younger I never said, “I want to be an actress.” I always wanted to be involved in the production side — putting on a play or getting involved with the clothes or whatever — but I could never really see myself acting. I’d do creative stuff, in drama class, but I’d never be the one to say, “Oh, can I be up front,” because that’d make me cringe. But Des Hamilton, the casting director, got me in for Bullet Boy, and it just went from there. The illusion of being an actress and being completely dramatic and loving the attention is not that true, you know, there are a lot of actors I know who are extremely shy. And I sometimes fit into that bracket, when it comes to acting I love it and I take it very seriously. I knew as soon as I was in front of the camera that it was right and I was in my right shoes.I grew up heavily into horror films. When I was younger, that was basically all I watched. And Lawrence of Arabia! [laughs] I was really into my Freddy Kruegers and my zombie films and I was always fascinated with moving image and movies. With the escapism you get when you go to the cinema, when you sit in your darkened room and watch a film. It can take you out of your world for a little bit, and I think that’s the extended passion of why I do it, because I get to become someone else for however long. You can experiment in another world and find what you can draw from a particular character. I think we’re very lucky to be able to do that for a career. Some might take it for granted, but I love it.Winstone in Noel Clarke’s Kidulthood.Did you spend much time on film sets with your dad growing up?JW: Quite a bit, actually. When I was younger I remember spending a lot of time in theatres watching my dad, because he went through a bit of a theatre stage. I was completely on set throughout most of my dad’s career. I was heavily involved in Nil by Mouth and I was living with my dad and Gary Oldman while we were shooting that. It was a bit bizarre and weird and I didn’t really know what was going on!I went to do a bit of work experience in Prague Film Festival and got a bit of a view on how the big machine turns and how films are actually made on set. How that runner rigs that certain light and how that light affects that certain area. I was educated when it comes to film. I think that’s why I’m so confident that this is what I want to do. I’ve been lucky enough to experience the full effect of filmmaking. Some people come out of drama school and think, “Right, I’m off to be a big star,” and hardly any of them have stepped foot in a studio before.I guess I don’t really have that fear, you know. I did running on a Scorsese film, getting people teas and coffees. I spent time on the Indiana Jones set with my dad. You get a sense that on those giant films, the scale of it is so huge but it still ticks like any other films. It’s still a group of people getting together; it’s just that they have a lot more money, a lot more power and a lot more time, which a lot of films I’ve done haven’t. I’ve seen quick, short independent film sets with British money where the turnaround is very quick, and then watching a massive film with Spielberg planning two days for one scene.I do feel I’ve had a lot of experience and influence that’s helped me, not necessarily get my foot in the door, but helped me understand what it is I want to do.Continue as Winstone talks about her latest film, Boogie Woogie, and working with Hollywood’s finest.[tomatometer]MuzeID=1201575[/tomatometer]Has that sense of the industry helped you understand the offers and affected your choices since Bullet Boy?JW: Definitely. You’ve got to work, at the end of the day, and this year’s been tough for the industry I think, but it’s still going. In terms of making choices, I’ve always had that support from my dad and my family and my agent to stick to what I want to do and not sell out and take the next big film that comes along. Don’t get me wrong, that can be great, to do a really big film, but at the moment I think it’s time that I carve out my career and the make the films people will remember. I hope I’ve got a good body of work already.It’s quite an important stage for me. I’m 23 and I’m making that transition from a girl to a woman and I want to have some good stuff under my belt. It means holding your breath a little bit and being a bit patient — going a bit insane — but it’s worth it because when you get that good job, you feel it’s right.Everything that’s happened in my career up until now has been very organic and it’s happened naturally through meeting someone and really hitting it off and then going off to do a film with them. I feel my conscience is quite clear with that and I’m confident about the work.You have Boogie Woogie in the festival here in Edinburgh, can you walk us through the film a little?JW: Boogie Woogie is about the art scene in London as a whole. It explores the lives of art dealers, art exhibitors, art buyers, art victims. It’s about the characters in that art world. I play a young artist, kind-of a Tracey Emin vibe. It’s a complete ensemble piece, so it goes through all these different people’s lives and the ups and downs of the fierce art world. It’s amazing how a piece of art is supposed to be moving and touching but when you get to the core of it it’s just fucking expensive.I play a young video artist who self-documents her life and exposes everybody she comes across. She’s a fierce and completely sexual lesbian. She uses her sexual aura to draw people in and uses it as a weapon. Documents their feelings and her feelings and is looked upon as a dedicated artist. It’s quite clever and conniving of her. A lot of time art doesn’t have room for humanity, it just is. If it’s disgusting, that’s the art — it’s supposed to make you feel sick. Her pieces have a lot of those sorts of moments. She goes deep with it, exposes her girlfriend’s life, makes her look like a fool and sells it on and gets picked up by Vanity Fair. That’s the way it goes, usually. You know, the tough guys, the nasty guys in art tend to come out shining. It’s not like the real world.With co-stars Alan Cumming and Jack Huston at the Edinburgh photocall for Boogie Woogie.You’ve got a great cast around you. When you’re working with actors like that, do you learn from them?JW: Totally. To work with Danny [Huston] was pretty amazing. He’s got a great energy. He’s the main art dealer in town, Art Spindle. Amanda [Seyfried] is really sweet and very nice. I really got on with Heather [Graham], she’s a lovely, lovely girl and totally beautiful. Jack [Huston] was so funny and Gillian [Anderson] I just think is fantastic. She’s got such a great range. I was a huge fan of hers from The X-Files! To be on the same screen as Sir Christopher Lee and Joanna Lumley was just amazing. Alan Cumming and I are very close in the film, and we got on really well.I’ve also just worked with David Suchet on Poirot, and yeah, when you’re working with people like that they draw you in and you draw from them. You’re in awe — they’ve been doing this for years and they still have the same passion. And they’re not, you know, thespians; they’re real actors.

Eggersfollowed that up with several more books, the script to Spike Jonze’s WhereThe Wild Things Are, and founding McSweeney’s, a book publishing arm (alsothe name of his quarterly literary journal).We have Vendela Vida, who has written two acclaimed novels: And Now You CanGo and Let the Northern Lights Erase Your Name. And Vida, alongsidehusband Eggers, acts on the board of 826 National, a nonprofit network ofwriting and tutor centers for children and teens, and edits The Believer,a monthly magazine of alt-culture interviews, think pieces, op-eds, and reviews.Together, Eggers and Vida have written the screenplay to Sam Mendes’ latest movie,Away We Go(currently playing in limited release), starring John Krasinski and Maya Rudolphas a young wayward couple, who travel the nation in search of a permanent homefor themselves and their unborn child. Rotten Tomatoes spoke with Vida andEggers for their collective Five Favorite Films.The Landlord (1970,100% Tomatometer)DaveEggers: We’re going to be doing this on the fly. We might start with TheLandlord.Vendela Vida: Hal Ashby film.DE: And we might have [a] half Hal Ashby list because he was our mainhero when we were writing this movie.VV: We watched The Landlord together. It was sent to us by Sam Mendesbefore Away We Go was being filmed. We had told Sam about our love of Hal Ashbyand some of his other films, and Sam was also an Ashby fan. That was kind of ourcommon entry point, and the reason we knew we were in such good hands with Samas director was because he was seeing the same references we were [seeing] andhad the same idea for the look and feel of the movie. He sent us The Landlordand we watched it together and we loved it. The color and the tone, and the factthat it was a real movie taking place in a real specific time.DE: [Anything in Ashby’s] body of work is always recognizably him, butit’s pretty elastic. Like Being There is very different than Shampoo in a lot ofways. There’s a little bit of the surreal that can enter in, but at the sametime, they’re very grounded and very of their time, and have a certain grittyfeel to them. They’re not so clean. There’s a naturalism there that he marrieswith some very bold moves and even magical realism.[The Landlord] is this movie that not too many people have seen, didn’t have abig release originally, and it’s hard to find on DVD, and doesn’t have thereputation of Harold and Maude and Coming Home. But I kind of think it might behis best movie. Maybe it’s just because it’s so screamingly brave in a lot ofways, and it hits so many issues. There’s so few American movies that touch onclass, and this just comes straight at you like a train, talking about classissues, race.[It’s about] this young man who’s born into privilege, struggling with hisplace. “He is to the manor born,” you know? He has money in his blood, and hecan afford to go buy a building where people are living. Just a young man, BeauBridges, and it’s probably my favorite thing I’ve ever seen Beau Bridges do,too. It’s sort of startling to see him in this role as the golden boy, and youcan almost see Jeff Bridges playing it, too. And the fact that this white guy,automatically, just by the color of his skin and the place he was born and thefamily he was born into, has the ability to be responsible for the lives of allof these far less fortunate or privileged people. [He struggles] with that senseof responsibility and [tries] to reject it and give up that control, but [also]do right by these people. I don’t know, it’s so complex.But [Ashby’s] not afraid to have some very broad comic moments. You know,there’s a few people who can do it since. Like Alexander Payne or David O.Russell, a few other people whose work you can see owe a lot to Ashby.Lost in Translation (2003, 95% Tomatometer)VV:I loved the mood of it, I loved the dialogue, I loved the relationship.Every aspect of that film, and I didn’t want to leave the mood of it for hoursafter leaving the theater. I watch that movie over and over again just becauseof the mood. I feel like it’s so hard to put poetry into a movie, but SofiaCoppola did that. The ending is one of my favorite endings ever.DE: It [was] unlike almost anything else before it. I think so oftenmovies try to do too much, especially when you try to adapt a big, sprawlingnovel into a film, and you try to compress hundreds of years or generations. Itcan work, certainly, if you’re Kurosawa or David Lean or somebody. But a lot oftimes, the best movies are not novels, they’re poems. That movie is just thisbeautiful tone poem. I don’t know how many pages of a script that is. It’sprobably a very short script, but she used the medium so well. And when we sawthat, we thought, “Wow.” We kept thinking about that movie, too, when we werewriting, although we ended up writing something much more verbose.VV: When you see Scarlett Johansson walking around in Tokyo and doingflower arrangement, there’s so much that can be said by just watching her movethrough this landscape, and I think we thought about that a lot writing Away WeGo. The image of these two characters moving through a landscape.Local Hero (1983,100% Tomatometer)DE:Maybe now we’ll split. I’ll have one and Vendela will have one. I’ll pickLocal Hero, Bill Forsyth’s movie.VV: Not that I don’t love it!DE: If I had to have one favorite movie that I’ve seen a hundred times,it’s probably that. I’m not really sure why I first liked it; I must have beenfourteen or something like that when I first saw it. It’s always meant so muchto me.Peter Riegert plays a maybe 40-year-old businessman who’s in the oil businessand is called and sent up to the coast of Scotland to look into buying some landwhere they found some oil and he has to negotiate with the local village. [He]thinks it’s going to be a very tough thing to sort of uproot all these people,[and] the comedy is that they’re only too happy to sell out. They’re just tryingto negotiate the price up as much as possible. It unfolds at its own pace, andhe falls in love with this town and with the sea and cares less and less aboutthe deal. He more and more wants to trade places with the local innkeeper andmove to this town and stay there. A beautifully made film and I feel like therewas a rash of movies right afterward that sort of tried to capture what heachieved. These people sort of coming to some little town and being transformed.It’s so touching and so funny and warm, and has so many moments of grief andelegance and delicacy. It’s got beautiful music by Mark Knopfler. That mighthave been the first movie that I felt that strongly about at that sort offormative time. But it’s very strange to feel like that’s the movie, you know?It doesn’t have some young protagonist. [But] from then on I was obsessed withScotland and Ireland. Wanting desperately to go up there, and then when I did,it was very similar to that feeling. I went [on] a Bill Forsyth binge andwatched all of his movies, like Gregory’s Two Girls, and Comfort and Joy, andBreaking In, even, with Burt Reynolds of all people. I wish he were still makingmovies.Together(2001, 90% Tomatometer)&nbsp;VV:I watched it, I think, right before we started writing this movie too. I don’tknow if it’s because my mom is Swedish, and I’ve spent a lot of time in Sweden,but I love Lukas Moodysson’s Together. I love the realness of it and the peopletrying to raise a family in this commune-type environment. I think my favoritescene is the breakfast scene with people coming down, and they’re naked from thewaist down. I still have that image in my head. It’s just a perfect sense ofreality and shock, and it’s not shocking to them at all, but it’s obviouslyshocking to the viewer. But not in a way that’s it’s going for an effect.They’re all eating breakfast and you’re seeing everyone’s pubic hair.DE: Did you just talk about pubic hair?VV: I did.RaisingVictor Vargas (2003, 96% Tomatometer)DE:We always recommend it to our students. We both teach high school classes a lot,and most of them aren’t aware of this movie, even though it’s the most honestand accurate depiction of that age. I guess they’re early high school or middleschool, they’re about fourteen or fifteen. There’s almost a documentary feel toit. At the time, the [kids] weren’t professional actors, though a lot of themhave gone on to acting.[Director] Peter Sollett did such a beautiful job. It’s so loose and warm andreal and naturalistic and funny and unexpected. So much of it wasn’t rehearsed,and they let a lot of that process unfold while they made the movie. The kidssort of do their own dialogue. But I remember seeing it and thinking, “I’venever seen it done that well before.” Usually I think teenagers are overwritten,written by much older people. Sort of reinventing.VV: Or they simplify it too much. They take out all the complexity.DE: Even some of the very best movies still have these caricatures of teenagers.This was a kind of time, and place — these kids are supposed to be, I think, onthe lower east side — that you don’t see very often in film. It’s not like,“Here’s the jock.”VV: Here’s the cheerleader.DE: [Laughs.] Yeah, I mean, all these things obviously exist to some extent, butthis was just, “Here are people.” And these are four main kids who are sort ofjust making their first forays into romance and what it means to be young menand young women. It doesn’t talk down to them, it doesn’t assume things. It allsort of flows from within these young people and from the actors themselves, andit has a humanity that I don’t think has been achieved before or after indepictions of people that age. So I always thrust it on our students, especiallyyoung Latino students who don’t see a whole lot of depictions of themselves inAmerican movies.VV: You also get such a sense of summer in the city. The heat, the pavement, theflamingo and the swimming pool, how refreshing that feels. It such a hard thingto translate.DE: That’s exactly right. Because, you know, he filmed it in the exact placeswhere it was set. That’s what Sollett does great, and he did it really well withNick and Norah’s Infinite Playlist, too, filming everything on location so itfeels true. I think he owes something to French New Wave. I know it seems like astretch, but there’s just something so real and true about the way he chooses tofilm and find his way on location and with a lot of improvisation. It takes areal artist to pull that off.But, you know, we’re in our late thirties now. Maybe we’re too far away. I’msure I could show Raising Victor Vargas to a sixteen-year-old student of mineand they’d be like, “No, no, it’s not like that at all.” It’s all verysubjective. But I thought Nick and Norah felt a bit like Lost in Translation.The cinematography was similar. We really liked it even though it’s a world awayfrom where we are now. I can imagine somebody who’s 21 feeling different aboutit. But it worked for us.Catch Away We Go, writtenby Dave Eggers and Vendela Vida, currently in limited release.

I think I’ll talk about modern films, which aren’t necessarily the greatest films ever made, but are five great films.”Modern films are certainly Curtis’ bread-and-butter. Best known for defining a genre with Four Weddings and a Funeral, the writer of Notting Hill and Bridget Jones’s Diary turned to feature directing in 2003 with Love, Actually — an entire career on the big-screen set in the here and now. The Boat that Rocked, out on DVD and Blu-ray in the UK this week and soon to hit US cinemas retitled Pirate Radio, is his first ‘period’ film and he doesn’t go much further back in time than the swinging 60s.On the small-screen, he’s Britain’s ruling king of comedy, giving us the ultimate history lesson through the various series of Blackadder, and defining comedy for the 80s and 90s through BBC favourites Mr. Bean, The Vicar of Dibley and Spitting Image. In 1985 he founded Comic Relief, which has raised £80m for good causes this year alone.Read on to learn about the five films he can’t do without.Let the Right One In (2008)  98%“Very apt for now, because I think it’s just come out on DVD. I’m scared of horror films, and hardly ever see them, but I was just so haunted by the scene at the end at the swimming pool, about which I will say no more because my brain is still trying to work out what happened there. It just shows how, if you’ve got a really low budget, and a really serious intent, you can make people feel uncomfortable. It’s a weird, spooky, melancholy Swedish love story about vampires, which is a big subject at the moment, but it’s hard to imagine a better vampire film. So that would be my number one choice — delightful, strange and disjointing.“That will be the only horror movie on any list of mine. The first time I saw The Exorcist, I had to sleep with the lights on for about four years, so horror is not for me.”Lost In Translation (2003)  95%“It seems to me that Sofia Coppola is incapable of producing an ugly frame; it’s just completely beautiful, from astonishing first shot to the final whisper. I think that Scarlett Johansson can be just fabulous, and in that she’s just fabulous, plainly beautiful all the way through. She was great in Match Point too, so very good. She gives that dreadful feeling of somebody that will weigh you down forever. And on top of that it’s a genuinely funny film, its got those fantastic bits, particularly the bit where [Bill Murray] is recording the ads, and it really is a comedy. And yet Bill Murray is so melancholy; so sad. After spending all my life in comedy, where you’re aware of all the grief and melancholy that accompanies being thought of as a charming and amusing person, I think it’s an almost perfect film, I think I’d put that in my top ten favourite films of all time. I love that film.”Knocked Up (2007)  89%“I don’t know why because I’m almost never in Los Angeles, but I went to the premiere of Knocked Up. Some cousin of Judd Apatow‘s was going to propose to his girlfriend, but was shy, so what Judd did was brought up the cousin and his girlfriend onto stage and Jack Black hid behind, knelt on the floor behind the cousin, and very noisily proposed to her. So the first time I saw the film I was in a very good mood having had such a brilliant start. But Knocked Up, like The Hangover which is also wonderful, is full of really really funny things; particularly the friends. When that group of friends is together, everyone has a sort of weird idiosyncratic joke which is perfectly expressed every time they appear, from the guy with the beard downwards.There are so many other funny things — when Kristen Wiig is rude to Katherine Heigl when she gets her job, and she’s going on about how lucky she is to get the job, it’s completely hilarious. Both Seth Rogen and Katherine are so charming and funny, and it’s so modern, on the edge and hard; a real romantic film. I think that if romantic comedies are meant to be romantic and funny, then that’s a perfect example. It’s very relaxed and at ease with itself, and doesn’t try too hard, or doesn’t seem to be trying very hard, and I think that’s very much to do with how Judd makes his movies. I’m sure he knows exactly what he wants, but it does have a slightly improvisational edge to it, because he does work with people that he knows very well, so there’s a naturalness to it, and I think it’s a great modern film. I haven’t seen Funny People yet, but I have very high hopes for it, I’m looking forward to it a great deal. “Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (2004)  92%“This is one of my favourite films, and I’m going to almost insist that you say in this article that people must go and watch a song called Carol Brown, from the new series of Flight of the Conchords. It’s been directed by Michel Gondry, and it’s just so amazing; for the rest of the episode you can’t really see that it’s him, but up comes this dazzling thing. I just think for a movie with such a massive concept, that idea, that sort of fantasy, should be done by being completely realistic. In a way it’s like Let the Right One In – the office where they alter your mind feels like a ghastly dental surgery. So you’re in this weird mixture between something that feels terribly realistic, with Kirsten Dunst jumping up and down on a bed, absolutely normal, and yet it’s completely freakish and odd and had these spectacular special effects in it. I love the sort of downbeat-ness of the love story — the fact that, really, they’re sort of right for each other, but only because they’re not right for anyone else. I think it’s a genuinely great fantasy movie, a great love story, and Kate Winslet‘s hair is, after all, blue, so that’s obviously a good reason for seeing it. You’ve been on this massive ride, and it gets back to these people in a corridor, which I suppose is like — if you land on the moon, there’s just you on the moon, and I think there’s something profound about the whole thing.”National Lampoon's Animal House (1978)  90%I’m going to break my rules for this one, and just put in one old movie. I still think that Animal House is misunderstood, although I do increasingly read about a generation of comedians saying it is the great film. Because I think it’s a brilliant comedy, with brilliant acting, with everybody at their best – Karen Allen at her cutest, Tim Matheson at his handsomest, John Belushi at his most mono-syllabic. So these extraordinary comic performances with just a series of amazing scenarios with amazing set-ups with the horse and the chainsaw, the dead girlfriend, them going to the toga party, and just everything about it. It’s boiled down to the funniest joke scenarios that there could possibly be. That fantastic Elmer Bernstein score, which could be from Patton.“It seems to me like a really great, classic, funny character movie hiding in wolves clothing, pretending to be a big stupid old generic college movie, but it actually invented the genre, and I don’t know that I’ve ever seen a funnier version of those movies. Certainly when I was doing The Boat That Rocked, it was M*A*S*H on the one hand – very casual, conversational, just guys doing a weird job – and Animal House on the other – with big characterisations and set-pieces.. So we’ve got four moderns and one slightly older. Can I have one more? Am I allowed? Just for sorrow?”I think we can let you have another film.Richard Curtis: OK – The Son’s Room by Nanni Moretti. He was this kind of comedian when younger, and was always called Italy’s Woody Allen, and in a way he’s fulfilled that promise, because Woody Allen also made some very profound films. The Son’s Room is an amazingly gentle, completely sorrowful movie, which I don’t even know whether or not to recommend. It’s full of sadness but everyone who is thinking of having a family should see the film so that they know the risk, and everyone who has got a family should see the film so that they understand how in the middle of the most normal conversational world, sorrow can hit you. But it’s got the best music of any film I’ve seen and it’s got this Brian Eno track at the end. The movie can’t be resolved because it’s about grief that never ends, but somehow the music acts as some way back to normality. So I think The Son’s Room is the film I’ve been most struck by in a way, over the last ten years, the most truthful film I’ve seen.Music in a film is obviously very important to you…RC: Yeah, I don’t know. Strangely I watched The Godfather the other day, and the Godfather Soundtrack is extraordinary, it never stops. It’s either jazz music or orchestral music or exciting music, he never lets it go, and that’s the way he keeps the pace up. So I always wanted The Boat That Rocked to be an ecstatic movie. I remember at the end of Bridget Jones, the second one, where we were trying to choose which of the three songs to put at the end where she’s running after Colin Firth – in the end I just said, “Put them all in. Put all three. Let’s have Beyonce, let’s have The Shirelles, and let’s have Barry White.” So I like the idea of going for it, wall-to-wall. And in a way I’ve always thought of my films as being like a Madness album or like an ABBA album, full of delightful little scenarios and very high spirited bursts of things.But as a writer, just as sort of autobiographically, I listen to music all the time while I’m writing. It always cheers me up and always lifts my spirits, and it always has. On The Boat That Rocked I just wanted to make a film about that feeling of what it’s like to be exhilirated day and night by pop music.Does the music that you’re listening to end up in the movie when you’re writing?RC: Yes, but the weird thing is when the music doesn’t. I wrote the whole of Love, Actually listening to one song, which is The Loving by XTC, which is a huge orchestral song about everyone in the world being full of love, but I didn’t put it in the film. Notting Hill was based around two songs, one of which was Wasting Time by Ron Sexsmith, and the other – very oddly I used to listen to it all the time because it exactly represented the pitch of the emotion I wanted in the film – was a version of Downtown Train by Everything But the Girl. That was what I wanted the film to feel like. I used that as the pattern and then threw it away, because there wasn’t actually a place for it in the film. But I often get the mood of what I’m writing from pop music.Did you have any problems with rights for any of the songs you wanted to use in The Boat That Rocked?RC: No. With The Boat That Rocked, we had a bit more money, so we got most of what we wanted. Some songs you just couldn’t get because they wanted something like a million pounds – those were the acts who just didn’t want their songs in movies. When Hugh Grant dances in Love, Actually, we wanted a Michael Jackson song we couldn’t get, because it was about a million pounds to use.But on the whole, these days, I get what I want. My bad memories of The Tall Guy, the very first film I made, are thankfully in the past. It was meant to be structured around three songs by Madness. It was meant to start with Yesterday’s Men, go to The Sun and the Rain, then end with It Must Be Love, and that was the shape of the movie. But they could only afford one song, so we only had It Must Be Love, which was a great disappointment.There’s a very funny bit in that movie where Jeff Goldblum sits down and listens to a radio and he’s heartbroken. He switches it and on comes a really sad song like Let the Heartaches Begin, so he switches it again and on comes another one called So Sad or Cry in the Rain or something, but if you listen carefully, they’re all sung by my friend Philip, because we couldn’t afford any of the songs. We had to spend an hour in a studio to do one impression of Long John Baldry and one of the Everly Brothers. So in the old days we couldn’t get what we wanted, but now it’s easier.The Boat that Rocked might be the first film I’ve seen with a double-CD soundtrack.RC: And I don’t think that’s all of them either – we’ve had to leave out one or two songs from the middle of the movie that haven’t made it onto the soundtrack. But yeah, it was very passionate. What you realise when you’re making a film like that is that people do love their pop music, and as people are finding out now at festivals, living with pop is a great way of leading your life. When we made the movie, everyday when we went out on the boat, all 140 of us, and they blared pop music for an hour. The moment it was lunch we would put it on over the huge speakers, and on the way home we put in on the speakers, and it was an idyllic life.And you were working with Bill Nighy, who we know is a huge music fan – that would have been fun…RC: Yeah, Bill loves his pop music. He’s obsessed, at the moment, with a guy called Maxwell, who he says is a great genius, and has just had a huge hit in America. What was nice was that there was one or two songs that I picked that nobody had heard of, like Crimson and Clover by Tommy James and the Shondells and All Over the World by Francoise Hardy. Everybody had one or two things they were absolutely delighted to meet in the film. And that was my aim, to have a mixture of very high-profile songs and songs that people didn’t know as well.What’s next for you as a director?RC: I’m doing a huge range of things, but I think my next movie is probably going to be a film about time travel, but it’ll be quite complicated so it’ll take a while to work out.Lots of paradoxes to figure out?RC: I’m not going to worry about things like that, but there are always going to be issues!","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"Fox, Dead, 2015, marvel, drama, Geographic, Star, twilight, Polls, drama, Crunchyroll, stoner, Walt, Sundance","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/RichardCurtis.jpg","slug":"five-favourite-films-with-richard-curtis"},{"id":"47508860550570","title":"Five Favorite Films With Kristen Bell","content":"Five Favorite Filmsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Five Favorite Films With Kristen BellThe star of this week's Couples Retreat reveals her most-loved moviesby Luke Goodsell | October 5, 2009 |  CommentsKristen Bell made her mark on the pop culture landscape as the star of TV’s Veronica Mars, which she followed with a run on the hit series Heroes and one of her most famous (if unseen) roles — as the voice of Gossip Girl in the much-loved teen drama. Last year she arrived on the big screen for real after starring in the Judd Apatow-produced comedy Forgetting Sarah Marshall, a surprise hit with both audiences and critics.This week, Kristen’s back on screens — and back in tropical climes — for Couples Retreat, a relationship comedy written by Vince Vaughn and Jon Favreau, and she’ll soon be heard as the voice of Cora in the animated film of Astro Boy.We caught up with the star to find what her all-time favorite films are.The Apartment (1960,90% Tomatometer)Okay… as they are now. I might change my answers. Let’s see… The Apartment, starring Shirley Maclaine and Jack Lemmon; I mean, you don’t get much better than that.The Last King of Scotland (2006,87% Tomatometer)I really like The Last King of Scotland, if I’m in a dramatic mood, because it was so furiously disturbing. Even though I don’t love the subject matter — it’s not a subject I crave, ’cause it scares me so much — I was sort of put into a real dark place after that movie.When Harry Met Sally… (1989,91% Tomatometer)Maybe When Harry Met Sally…, because I think Meg Ryan is adorable and I think that was a really nice look at a very funny relationship.National Lampoon’s Christmas Vacation (1989,61% Tomatometer)Christmas Vacation. It never fails to make me laugh.Fletch (1985,74% Tomatometer)And probably… Fletch. It’s definitely up there.Yeah I was big on Chevy Chase for a while.

The Rotten Tomatoes Show, now 25 weeks old, has been a success, featuring webcam reviews submitted by viewers, Current TV and RT community members, film critics, and filmmakers. However, another big reason for its success is the chemistry and wit of its hosts, Ellen Fox and Brett Erlich.Ellen majored in English at Rutgers University. She moved to Chicago and spent the next ten years writing about culture and entertainment for the city’s newspapers – including film reviews for the Chicago Tribune. Along the way, she also studied and performed in the city’s respected improv comedy scene. In The Rotten Tomatoes Show she has found a new home, and we just couldn’t picture the show without her. Read up on Ellen’s Five Favorite Films here, then check out her RT profile and add her as a friend!&nbsp;Xanadu (1980,41% Tomatometer)I’m not being sarcastic: Xanadu is the foundation of my aesthetic. It’s a 1980 musical in which angsty painter Michael Beck meets muse Olivia Newton-John and an aging musician (Gene Kelly) from the Big Band Era. Naturally, they team up to open a roller-disco complete with tap dancing, leg warmers, and Zeus. All of it woven together – in perfect sincerity – by an ELO soundtrack.The Wizard of Oz (1939,100% Tomatometer)Like Xanadu, it’s a phantasmagoria – but more menacing. A lone teenage gal and her dog hit the (yellow, brick) road and pick up a trio of men along the way. Try pitching that idea to a Hollywood studio! The only film in recent memory with a similar story was the lugubrious indie Wendy and Lucy, which I couldn’t even finish. Maybe a flying monkey or a smartly dressed munchkin might have perked things up.Gone With the Wind (1939,97% Tomatometer)My ideal man was Christopher Reeves’ Superman; my ideal woman Lynda Carter’s Wonder Woman. But here was my first glimpse of the electricity that can crackle between two such sexy grown-ups. Like Oz, it’s another 1939 tale about a dark-haired, willful farm girl. But Scarlett O’Hara’s desires aren’t as heady as Dorothy’s; they run hot and elsewhere. Thanks to the manic perfectionism of both producer David O. Selznick and Vivien Leigh, it’s the best depiction of female desire ever captured on film.Singin’ in the Rain (1952,100% Tomatometer)Gene Kelly plays a silent film star who falls for cloche-wearing babe Debbie Reynolds during the industry’s awkward transition to talkies. Hollywood: The sunshine! The song-and-dance! The handsome, dynamic men! It only took me 25 years to discover it’s all true. There’s a funny-terrifying scene about the complexities of wiring Kelly’s bitchy leading lady for sound. Sometimes I think of it when I’m taping a tiny microphone inside my bra and running the wire out through my armpit.Bring It On (2000,64% Tomatometer)This clever-enough confection about warring cheerleaders proves that films don’t have to be classics or award-worthy to work their magic. I wish I could say it was James Taylor’s music or Robert Frost’s poetry that soothed my post-9/11 anxiety. But no, it was star Kirsten Dunst’s perky, bouncing breasts that lifted my spirits. Whether ever-so-lovingly hoisted in a bikini top or shaking to-and-fro as she dances on her bed, with ta-tas like hers in our midst, I wondered, could the world still be that hopeless of a place?Watch The Rotten Tomatoes Show every Thursday at 10:30pm (check your local listings) on Current TV, or catch the most recent episode online, here.For more Five Favorite Films, check our archive.To add Ellen to your friends list, check out her profile here.","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"blockbuster, John, Family, VICE, Shudder","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"five-favorite-films-with-ellen-fox"},{"id":"47508863877584","title":"Five Favorite Films with Terrence Howard","content":"Five Favorite Filmsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Five Favorite Films with Terrence HowardThe Fighting co-star reveals a musical streak and discusses his acting philosophy.by Jen Yamato | April 23, 2009 |  CommentsThe Oscar-nominated actor Terrence Howard has amassed an impressive resume since making his Hollywood breakthrough in the 1995 drama Mr. Holland’s Opus (he also starred in that year’s Dead Presidents), excelling at giving each and every one of his characters an extraordinary complexity that always seems to simmer right beneath the surface, whether as part of an ensemble (Crash, Lackawanna Blues), as a villain (Awake, Idlewild), a sympathetic figure (Four Brothers, August Rush), or a hero in waiting (Iron Man). In this week’s Fighting, he plays mentor to a young street fighter (Channing Tatum) — a performance that critics are lauding as quietly powerful, and one of the standouts of Dito Montiel’s film.In a discussion about Howard’s favorite films, Rotten Tomatoes discovered that the actor’s affinity for music runs close to his cinematic tastes (in addition to performing his own songs in Craig Brewer’s Hustle &amp; Flow, he released an album in 2008). Read on for Howard’s Five Favorite Films, his anti-“acting” philosophy, and more.Jesus Christ Superstar (1973, 57% Tomatometer)The harmony of music with the simplistic style of telling that story, as a framework for it, and then the acting… It’s like bringing Broadway — true Broadway — to the desert. Picking up a little naturalism from the desert. I believed Carl Anderson; believed every word of him, every frown, every inflection of his eyebrow. I love musicals. Always have. I think you have to tell a full story; it’s like asking someone, “Do you like black and white films?” or “Do you love 3D?” Music creates that third dimension.That pick is impressive, especially since not a lot of men would admit to liking musicals.Well they’re not real men, then.On The Waterfront (1954, 100% Tomatometer)It was that basic human story, it was watching the fluid way in which Marlon [Brando] directed the wind around him. We were all moved and swayed by him, and it was the first time that I took notice of truth in acting. There was no acting; everyone else acted around him, but he was there.How would you compare the way Brando acted to your own approach?I made a vow never to “act.” Never, ever “act.” If you’re not there, if you’re not the person [whom you’re portraying], then get out of the way and let the real person in. If you’re acting like the person… People respect an ambassador, but they honor the king.So you’re of the school of acting that really lives in each role, as opposed to just temporarily taking on a character for the time being?Yes — or, allow the role to live in you. If you live the role, that world has its consequences when you bring it into our present world. But if you allow the character to live in you, then you are always in control and can direct where he is allowed; you allow the character to become a guest in your gracious space.Does that mean that every actor has multiple personalities living as a guest inside of him?Every human being is a composite of multiple, multiple atoms. All taking on different roles in the making of that person or that thing. Likewise, the end result of all of those atoms would be like those atoms; so we need a lot of different personalities; but in order to be one personality, you have to be a number of them because of how they balance off each other.Chitty Chitty Bang Bang (1968, 59% Tomatometer)Chitty Chitty Bang Bang: “A posh life!” [From the song “Posh!”] “Lullabye Bay.” [From the song “Hushabye Mountain”] Those songs that Dick Van Dyke (as Caractacus Potts) and his father (Lionel Jeffries, as Grandpa Potts) sang blew me away! I saw it as a child, and I watch it as an adult. I love that movie.Mary Poppins(1964, 100% Tomatometer)&nbsp;Mary Poppins is still one of my very, very, very favorites. There are so many wonderful jewels of knowledge that they put in that film. It’s like that book, “Oh, The Places You’ll Go!” by Dr. Seuss. There are some wonderful hints to achieving success in life, and the greatest success is to be happy. That’s what those movies seem to tell me.Are you a movie watcher who takes the lessons from films and employs them in your own life?Well, a true teacher is always a true student. And if you are willing and humble yourself, you can learn from a lot; you have to listen very carefully.Hustle &amp; Flow (2005, 82%)Hustle &amp; Flow showed me what could have happened to me. I hadn’t recognized that until I’d seen the movie completed; you never know what painting you’re making until the final stroke. And even then, it’s not finished until you put it into the frame. I didn’t understand the full impact of those individual strokes that we were making on a day to day basis until I saw [the film] — where A could have led me. I saw where A would end up at. And taking on B, C, and D… For a film to affect me that way, for a character to affect me that way, to where I feel worry and think about who Djay is… I still wonder about Shug and her baby. I still wonder about Key.Hustle &amp; Flow also had music in it, which told some of that struggle. Remember, music used to be written for films, conveyed by the actors themselves. They knew when that music was played and they responded to it. Now, [merging a film to its music] is something that’s done as a separate act, and it’s more manipulative and not honest. Music in Hustle &amp; Flow gave us another plane in which to relate everything to, and to play from. It widened the playing field; it brightened the road down the way, because you could move to that music, and be in step with the audience instead of the audience being manipulated into step with you.Taking that amount of pride in Hustle &amp; Flow‘s musical elements, how did you feel when Three 6 Mafia won the Oscar for Best Song?I felt absolutely elated, for the fact that the Academy was able to see past the genre lines and the lines of demarcation between individual people and could see the artists themselves, the work and the artistry. They didn’t care whose name was at the bottom of the painting, or who was the initial audience of it, they just saw a painting worth their appreciation. I was so honored to be a part of that.Watch Terrence Howard in Fighting this Friday.

(At 95 percent, The Hurt Locker is also one of the best-reviewed films of the year.) The intimate account of three bomb squad technicians (Jeremy Renner, Anthony Mackie, and Brian Geraghty) relates the experiences of the U.S. Army Explosive Ordnance Disposal unit, specialists charged with disarming and disposing of the homemade bombs credited with nearly half of all casualties of the current Iraq war. As such, Bigelow’s film is less an all-out action spectacle, more a character study of the kinds of soldiers it takes to perform such extremely stressful tasks — punctuated, ominously, by Bigelow’s flair for stunning, weighty action.Rotten Tomatoes spoke with Bigelow (who helmed such genre favorites as Near Dark, Point Break, and Strange Days) in Los Angeles to learn more about the action-genre specialist’s background, why she chose to make The Hurt Locker based on embedded journalist Mark Boal’s observations, and what films and filmmakers she looks to most for inspiration.The Wild Bunch (1969, 97% Tomatometer)I saw The Wild Bunch on a double bill with Mean Streets, midnight at the Waverly Place Cinema on Bleecker Street in New York [in the 1970s]. Those two played on a double bill; I was in New York, I had a studio and I was basically a practicing artist, working with various art groups — Art &amp; Language, kind of conceptual arts, political arts. We were doing environments, we were doing installations, performance pieces…and I stumbled into this incredible double bill. And it was a life-changing experience. I thought they were just extraordinary. [Sam] Peckinpah for his muscularity, his immediacy, his sheer genius in his storytelling and characters. I was knocked out.Mean Streets (1973, 98% Tomatometer)…and then [in Mean Streets], Robert De Niro; his kind of twitchy reverence to this wonderfully insane underworld. Somehow, the two [films] will always be forever linked in my mind. Whoever programmed those two movies together… it was at a moment when, in an art context, I was beginning to make short films. So film was definitely becoming a medium that was intriguing to me, and I hadn’t quite made a complete transition yet, but I found those two films just extraordinary, and they opened up a kind of unimaginable landscape for me. That kind of great irreverence, and intensity, and strength of purpose in those characters.Lawrence of Arabia (1962, 98% Tomatometer)No list would be complete without Lawrence of Arabia. Again, I’m constantly looking at that film for its sheer bravado, magnificence, scale, scope, and having just shot [The Hurt Locker] in Jordan in the summer of 2007, I visited Wadi Rum, which is the desert in which they shot Lawrence of Arabia, just about two hours outside of Amman. And it’s in the middle of the desert, to which David Lean brought — and this is in the ’60s — arc lights, and a whole production. If you see this desert, first of all, it’s gorgeous, it’s beautiful. But it’s a very forbidding landscape, not one you would imagine would be very film friendly; these beautiful, magnificent, extraordinary kind of red rock buttes that rise out of this red sand… I think Lawrence of Arabia brought us to Jordan and made that the location of choice for The Hurt Locker.The collected works of Alfred Hitchcock&nbsp;All of Hitchcock — I don’t think I can even identify a particular film. After I transitioned out of the art world into film, I was doing a graduate degree at Columbia University and I took a class with Andrew Sarris, who I think is one of the treasures of the film world. We looked at an overview of Hitchcock during the two-year course, starting with his silents. And there are some extraordinary silent movies of his; I’m not sure how readily available they are, but there’s a phenomenal film — I think it’s called Murder! — and it’s silent, but it’s as tense as Psycho or The Birds or Notorious or Rear Window. [Editor’s note: Hitchcock’s 1930 film Murder! was one of his first talkies, but his 1927 silent, The Lodger, is one of his most celebrated. Both were released jointly to home video in 2002.]It’s a silent film, but it’s Hitchcock. All of his signatures, all the signifiers, everything we’ve come to know and love about Hitchcock, they’re all in play.The Terminator (1984, 100% Tomatometer)Terminator was a real seminal piece. In fact, I read the script before [James Cameron] shot the movie. I was asking around, “Anybody read any great scripts?” I read the script — it’s a game changer. All of these films, I feel like they’re real game changers; there are films prior to these movies, and there are films after. It’s like you’ve opened up a Pandora’s Box, and the filmmaking world can never be the same — the language is different, the grammar is different. I think Jim did that in Terminator. I think he really changed the playing field. And so I read the script, and I was like, “I can’t wait to see it!” I didn’t know him, so I didn’t go and watch the shooting, but of course when it came out…the only way you can describe it is as a game changer.You have to change your rules! Again, not in any particular order, but Kurosawa has to be in there [among my favorite films and filmmakers]. Ran, Kagemusha, Dersu Uzala… and then Fassbinder‘s In a Year of 13 Moons, one of the most magnificent love stories ever made. Ozu. Pabst, who gave us the opportunity to move from one location to another and fuse it together. Anyway, that’s my story and I’m sticking to it.&nbsp;Next: Kathryn Bigelow on Andrew Sarris, why she made The Hurt Locker, and why “there’s no politics in the trenches.”[rtimage]MapID=1203845&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=2&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Being that we are a site that values and relies on film critics, we were intrigued to hear that you studied under one of the most celebrated living American critics, Andrew Sarris. Can you tell us more about that?Kathryn Bigelow: It was a track that I thought was really interesting — it was called Scholarship Criticism, and what it did was it kept contextualizing films and historicizing them. I had already shot some 16 mm films, not that I felt I had a command of the medium technically, but I had a better understanding of it and I was really hungry and curious for an opportunity to look at it from a more historical and contextual standpoint. Andrew Sarris, Peter Wollen… I also had some incredible teachers in the Philosophy Department, Sylvere Lotringer and Marshall Blonsky, who I both used in my first film, Set-Up, as commentators, and embedded their commentary into the text of the piece. So it really was an opportunity to look at film in a more analytical way, as opposed to just a mechanical way.What was it about Mark Boal’s screenplay idea that made you decide that The Hurt Locker was the next project you wanted to make?KB: I’m definitely drawn to artistically challenging material, and I predominantly make choices, and have always made them, identically, which is instinctually. But the opportunity to take advantage of Mark [Boal]’s embed and his firsthand observations, and to look at a particular conflict that’s fairly underreported and have a granular, visceral, immediate, boots-on-the-ground, you are there, fly on the wall approach, was a great opportunity.[rtimage]MapID=1203845&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=3&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Was there an issue of time sensitivity in making The Hurt Locker, considering that Mark’s experience in Iraq had been a few years prior?KB: You know, it’s interesting. I suppose, yes, in that it remains a very topical and relevant subject, but it was really a function of Mark crafting a very compelling script, that when I kind of submitted it into the independent financing community, it was met with a very receptive response. And then, the opportunity to shoot in the Middle East, and keep creative control and final cut, and the opportunity to cast emerging talent, those were all parameters that set into the realization of the piece. It gained a kind of life and steam of its own. But I think the relevancy underscored it.Even years after Mark’s experiences, the story you tell remains timely — especially in introducing this little-covered sub group of military life, the EOD bomb squad units.KB: It is the primary weapon of the insurgency, and I think we use terms like “roadside bomber” and “IED” [improvised explosive device] with, perhaps unless you’ve had a tour of duty or spent time over there, less information than we should have. I think it’s really pretty critical and vital information.[rtimage]MapID=1203845&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=7&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Many viewers have called The Hurt Locker an apolitical war film, in that it doesn’t overtly take a stance either in support or opposition to the war. Do you agree, or do you prefer to leave it to the audience?KB: You know, I refer to it as nonpartisan. There’s a quote that Mark used to use: “There’s no politics in the trenches.” When he was on his embed, people were not speaking about left, right, and center; they were trying to survive. So I think finally, that becomes the overriding sentiment in that survival, not only personal survival, but saving the lives of thousands of individuals — that’s what these bomb techs are doing every day. I think what his script did so successfully was humanize the guys on the ground, humanize the soldiers. Regardless of how you feel about the conflict, it’s an opportunity to look at the humanity of these men — the heroism, the courage, and also the price of that heroism.Do you feel that there’s an increasing responsibility on the part of artists, or at least an inclination, to convey what’s happening in the world when mainstream media fails to inform?KB: Yes, I think that’s vital to the medium — in this case, being film — but remaining artful does allow an opportunity to be experiential, to take you to a place that may or may not be too dangerous to experience, yet a kind of granular understanding of that place is extremely important to us as human beings. I totally agree. But that’s where I think you can combine entertainment and substance. The film &nbsp;obviously can be quite entertaining, but it also provides that substantive, granular look at a day in the life of an individual who has the most dangerous job in the world. When Mark came back from the embed and told me what a day in the embed was like, and not only that, but that these men volunteer for it so they’re there by choice… it just provided this extraordinary psychology that, again, the general public may not be aware of or understand in a palpable way.Watch clips from The Hurt Locker:Read more on The Hurt Locker, in limited release.

Greg Kinnear certainly hasn’t taken the usual career path. He may have starred opposite Tom Hanks in You’ve Got Mail, but he was also conjoined with Matt Damon, played a sex addict and a meat inspector, guest starred on Friends and voiced a character in the Beavis and Butthead movie. Not to mention leading the SAG-winning ensemble in one of the best indie comedies of recent years in Little Miss Sunshine.Now he’s on screen as the inventor Bob Kearns in Flash of Genius, and he was happy to be playing a real-life character no one’s ever heard of. “Well, it’s not like everybody comes in with a preconceived idea of who Bob Kearns is,” he says. “So it was kind of loose as to how I could portray him. You know, nobody’s ever going to stand up in the theatre and say, ‘Hey, that’s not what I remember the intermittent windshield wiper guy to be like!’ It’s not like with Clinton or Nixon or some sort of galvanising figure that everyone’s familiar with. At the same time, as an actor I felt absolutely obligated to try to, as best I could, make him real.”Later this year he’ll be sees in Paul Greengrass‘ new film Green Zone, about the hunt for WMDs in Baghdad after the American invasion. “Paul is a remarkable director,” he says. “He just has an immediacy on the set. He doesn’t come in with a prearranged agenda of how things are going to go, and he’s always chasing something that’s not easily found. It’s his own journey as a filmmaker, but I think everybody feels like you want to give him everything you’ve got, because the thing that he’s searching for always translates to the screen, always creates these pictures that feel very vibrant. He has a way of making even smallest moments really big and lifelike on screen. It was wonderful.”When asked about his five favourite films, he looks to the ceiling and comments that he’s going through his mental Rolodex…Click on a thumbnail below.Something WildThe GodfatherChinatownNorth by NorthwestWilly WonkaSomething Wild“Great performances from a great ensemble of actors. Jonathan Demme did such a great job of making that look so real, creating an atmosphere that felt very immediate. It’s a funny film, but it’s scary as hell in parts. And it’s a completely unpredictable movie, I think. There’s no expectation, as you go into that film, what to expect or where it’s going.”Click on a thumbnail below.Something WildThe GodfatherChinatownNorth by NorthwestWilly WonkaThe Godfather“For obvious reasons. It’s just painted on a giant canvas – it’s larger than life. There’s a reason it’s a classic, and I don’t know what else to say about it that hasn’t already been said. It’s just one of the greats. There’s not a character in it that I don’t like, and there’s not a performance in it that’s flawed. It’s incredible.”Click on a thumbnail below.Something WildThe GodfatherChinatownNorth by NorthwestWilly WonkaChinatown“I had a chance to work with Jack Nicholson, which was a real thrill. You can scoop out a lot of performances from Jack, and consider them as possible films you could add to this list, but that was a great performance. Roman Polanski‘s direction is incredible too.

I worked briefly on a television show with Mel Stuart, the director, and heard all sorts of fantastic stories about that remarkable film. And of course I knew all the songs – I still do. I have a 5-year-old, but I haven’t shown it to her yet.

That normal life is her “real” life as Miley Stewart, a high schooler whose pop identity is only known to family and friends and who is about to get a wake-up call in the form of an extended stay in the homegrown Tennessee countryside where she grew up, courtesy of dad Robby Ray Stewart (played by Miley’s real-life father, country music star-turned-actor Billy Ray Cyrus). RT talked to the elder Cyrus about his favorite films, his transition from “Achy Breaky Heart” recording artist to Hollywood thespian, and how he credits David Lynch (and a letter from Johnny Cash) with helping daughter Miley become the teen entertainment phenomenon that she is today.Bonnie and Clyde (1967, 91% Tomatometer)Oh my gosh! The incredible acting; the performances that are delivered in such an incredible true story. It’s a great film.The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly (1966, 98% Tomatometer)Clint Eastwood is an inspiration to me as an actor. He, Robert Redford, and Michael Landon, might be three of my biggest influences as an actor. In each of those cases, it’s the fact that they play everything with a “less is more” style. There’s just something about that style that I try to tap into every now and then; it’s definitely my approach to a lot of things.The Horse Whisperer (1998, 71% Tomatometer)I’m just a sucker for a good love story. And that would be another of my influences by Robert Redford. He’s been a definitive inspiration as an actor and as a role model, if you will.Blue Velvet (1986, 90% Tomatometer)Let’s go with Elephant Man — no, I’m going to go with Blue Velvet, for my David Lynch pick. I’m going to go with Blue Velvet because I love Roy Orbison so much. He was a great influence on me musically, and still is. That’s when I kind of put two and two together — with Blue Velvet — and thought, film is a great way for your music to be heard, without radio. It’s a great way for your music to be heard.And that came out before you actually met David Lynch and starred in his film, Mulholland Dr.Oh yes, it came out considerably before. I’m pretty sure I was a young hellion at the time, about wild enough to shoot at. Just rockin’ and rollin’, playing these little bars and clubs up in West Virginia and Kentucky and Ohio. Wild as can be, just crazy. It appealed to me.Twilight (2008, 49% Tomatometer)I’m gonna go with the most recent film I saw that was really good. I thought Twilight was pretty killer. Put it up there, I’m gonna go with it! Even though it was about vampires, I thought it was told in a really cool way. I thought the acting was strong. And, I thought the music that accompanied the film was really cool.&nbsp;Next: Billy Ray Cyrus on auditioning for David Lynch’s Mulholland Dr., how he credits Lynch with starting Miley Cyrus’ acting career, and his close friendships with country legends Johnny Cash, Carl Perkins, and Waylon JenningsThanks to his hit single, “Achy Breaky Heart,” Billy Ray Cyrus was a household name long before starring on TV shows like Doc and Disney’s Hannah Montana, which spins off into theaters in this week’s Hannah Montana: The Movie (he plays Robby Ray Stewart, father to secret superstar Miley Stewart — played by his real-life daughter, Miley Cyrus). Below, Cyrus shares how he made the transition from country music to Hollywood, how David Lynch figures prominently in both his and Miley’s career, and which fellow country icons helped him along the way.[rtimage]MapID=1207961&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=2&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]At what point did you realize you wanted to act?Billy Ray Cyrus: You know, it was in the mid-90s…my dad came down to ride horses with me, and we were sitting out in front of the campfire, just talking about things in my life. He said, “I always pictured you having one of those careers like Kenny Rogers and Dolly Parton.” And I said, “Dad, I’d love that, but you know, how do you do that? What’s the key?” And he said, “You’ve got to get into acting! You have all of your eggs in one basket with this music thing and you need to branch out.” And so the next week, I was in Los Angeles touring, and I saw in a little newspaper that David Lynch was casting for Mulholland Dr. I called my agent — I’d never been to an audition before — and I asked, do you think I could go in and audition for this movie? I’d seen that they were looking for a character named Gene the Pool Man, and I don’t know why but something told me, surely I could go be Gene the Pool Man. I went into the audition, and lo and behold, they hired me!During filming, David Lynch pulled me to the side and said, “I don’t have any reason to blow smoke up your butt, but I just want to tell you the truth — I think you could be a serious actor.” And I said, “Really? I’ve never done this before.” He said, “A director is looking for someone who is real, and you’re very real. I love the way you’re playing these scenes. If you just continue to be real, you can do anything you want to do as an actor.” With that note of embracement from David Lynch, I then went on to read a script called Doc, and Doc was about hope and faith and love, a very positive show on Pax TV. I went and auditioned for Dr. Clint Cassidy and they hired me, and four years, 88 episodes later, I was a full-time actor.[rtimage]MapID=1207961&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=19&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]You look back on it and without David Lynch, Miley wouldn’t be Hannah Montana. Without Toronto, Canada, and the fact that I did that first series…that’s when Miley fell in love with acting. She started taking a role on Doc — she became this little girl named Kylie in a recurring role — and I took her to see Mamma Mia! on the stage in Toronto. Toronto really embraced the arts and acting; at the time, it wasn’t so much like that in Nashville, they didn’t have acting classes. She was able to surround herself with some great coaches and some great thespians from the moment she said she was going to become a great actress. That was the turning point, when she said that’s what I’m going to do. She applied herself to become an actress. So without Lynch, that wouldn’t have happened.Does he know that you credit him with Miley’s Hollywood career?BRC: No, I don’t know that he knows that. I don’t know, but I sure would love to tell him. Why don’t you tell him for me? You put it out there, he’ll read it.Do you stay in touch with him at all?BRC: No, I haven’t seen him for quite some time. I haven’t seen him since we made the movie.[rtimage]MapID=1207961&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=14&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]One last question from our resident country fan — who helped you through the down times in your music career?BRC: Johnny Cash. Waylon Jennings. George Jones. Those were guys that I really looked up to. Carl Perkins. Johnny Cash wrote me a letter, encouraging me to continue to be real, continue to love the music, and continue to be an original. An original, he called me; he said I reminded me of a friend of his named Elvis Presley. And that in my case and in Elvis’, the good far outweighed the bad, and as long as I would always remember to give thanks to Almighty God from whom all things that are good come from, that I would be just fine. Then he signed it, “Let ’em have it, I’m in your corner — Johnny Cash.” That’s pretty killer, isn’t it? That letter lived on the wall, right outside of Miley’s bedroom in Nashville, Tennessee. She grew up reading that letter.Johnny Cash was a great influence in my life, as was Waylon Jennings. Carl Perkins was one of my best friends, if not my best friend at a certain point in my life. I sang at both of their funerals; I was out of town for Johnny’s, but I sung at Waylon and Carl’s funerals.&nbsp;Hannah Montana: The Movie opens nationwide this Friday.

The legendary helmer virtually redefined the horror movies with the likes of The Hills Have Eyes and The Nightmare on Elm Street. His very first film was the horrifically violent box-office smash The Last House on the Left. Unlike Elm Street – which is being reinvented without any input from Craven – Last House is being remade with the director’s blessing, under the stewardship of Dennis Iliadis, and hits UK screens this Friday. RT had some time with Craven, and with the scaremongering legend on the other end of our phone, we just couldn’t resist asking him for his five favourite films.Jungfrukällan (The Virgin Spring) (1960)  87%“Firstly I’m going to go for The Virgin Spring. It’s a film that may surprise people but it really had an impact on me and I was just amazed by it. I saw it in a relatively short period of my life when I was teaching at college. When I was younger I hadn’t been allowed to watch any because I went to a Baptist College, but by this time I had put the religion behind me and that was one of the first art films I saw and I was very impressed by it. I mean, I could list you a dozen movies from that era by European by European film directors by Godard, Truffaut – Breathless, 400 Blows, all those wonderful European movies.”To Kill A Mockingbird (1962)  92%“Thinking about my upbringing, this was actually one of the first movies I saw. I was about 15. I was always told that films were evil and such, but I started to realise what a load of crap it was that something this good should be forbidden. I had been allowed to read as much as I wanted when I was younger, so I recognised great art when I saw it, I just didn’t realise it would be at the cinema as well. And so I walked away from that. To Kill a Mockingbird was so important because it was such adult film-making – to see something that dealt with such an important issue and had such an enlightened outlook on the world.”Red River (1948)  100%“For some reason. I think the combination of the gruff, tyrannical old man pursuing the unruly, rebellious son really appeals to me. The scenario is, in some odd way, almost as scary as Freddy Krueger, you know! The evil father is an idea that’s really fascinating to me. Hawks is great, The Treasure of Sierra Madre, The Big Sleep… He could do the Salt-of-the-Earth very well. He was a very smooth director; a very good film architect in terms of his storytelling. That’s how he constructed this film, and got so deep into the characters.”Night of the Living Dead (1968)  97%“I saw this movie when it first came out and at that point I’d never see a horror film, believe it or not! I had a girlfriend at the time, she was an anthropology student, and she said, ‘I heard there’s this new film called Night of the Living Dead, c’mon lets go.’ Eventually we left and when we got there the theatre was buzzing before the film even started. And then it starts, and we’re in the cemetery with the brothers and sisters bickering and then the zombie lurches towards them! Some people are screaming, some were saying the lines of the characters and suddenly I was swept into it and jumping and laughing and afraid, and I realised that this guy Romero was incredible.“It also made me realise that with a genre film, as long as it scared you, you could say anything; about politics, about psychology. It made me realise as well that fear is one of the primary thresholds you experience things through. Fear of anything – even sex – is scary! The first time you do it you’re like, ‘Oh my God, what am I doing? Am I going to fail?’ And you get through it and you realise it’s a wonderful thing. That’s what’s great about the horror genre is that you’re getting a load of people together in the cinema at the same place and the same time, having them all experience extreme fear, and come out alive at the end. It’s an uplifting experience and there’s a sense of elation.”The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (1974)  89%“This really scared me coming out of it. You knew it was made for 10 cents – that was obvious – but it actually had some fabulous performances. Some of the moments – like when Leatherface kicks open the door and comes after them – I mean your blood just runs cold. It was just amazingly visceral visual storytelling. A few years earlier, I was at college and I wrote a synopsis for a novel and my teacher feedback was “this would make a great movie!” And I was crestfallen, but it made me realise I had a great visual imagination as well, and for years I fought it but eventually realised that was the thing I could do.”","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"CNN, Bowl","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/WesCraven.jpg","slug":"five-favourite-films-with-wes-craven"},{"id":"47508863847880","title":"Five Favorite Films with John Krasinski","content":"Five Favorite Filmsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Five Favorite Films with John KrasinskiThe Away We Go and Office star reveals his beloved list of movies.by Alex Vo | June 2, 2009 |  CommentsJohnKrasinski‘s character on The Office, paper salesman Jim Halpert, isone of pop culture’s most unlikely icons, a hero for nice (if mischievous andself-assured) guys to model after and for girls of more quirky, sophisticatedtastes to daydream over. Krasinski’s film roles have been thoughtful variationson Jim, including Burt Farlander of his new film, Away We Go. Directed bySam Mendesand written by power literary coupleDaveEggers andVendelaVida, Burt is an aimless, devoted husband who travels the nation looking fora new home for his equally aimless wife (played byMaya Rudolph).On the cusp of Away We Go‘s Friday limited release, RT spoke withKrasinski about his Five Favorite Films.Kramer vs. Kramer (1979,88% Tomatometer)Iwas one of those kids who had never seen an indie film before I got to college.If it wasn’t a big, huge tentpole movie, or if it wasn’t on the radio, I hadn’texperienced it. Then in college I started getting into independent movies, whichled me to classic movies, which led me to all this different stuff. The 1970smovies, for me, were only discovered, unfortunately, as little as six or sevenyears ago.So Kramer vs. Kramer. Some of the greatest writing I’ve ever seen, someof the gutsiest performances. It’s just so quintessential of what the 1970s werefor me. There’s just this unfiltered, raw energy, and despite how beautiful thatmovie is — and obviously, it’s a well done movie — the fact [is] that they’renot making movies like that anymore. [Kramer vs. Kramer is about] a horriblerelationship. It’s a really tough situation for the father to be in, and yet[for] everyone who went and saw the movie, there was this weird understanding orcommiseration with anger. I think people might have been angrier, or willing tosee angry movies.Ordinary People (1980, 91% Tomatometer)TimothyHutton turns in one of the best male performances I’ve ever seen. And thatfamily dynamic was so subtle in what could have been a really angsty movie.Everything from the way it was shot to the way it was acted. John Bailey wasactually the DP on my movie that I directed (Brief Interviews with HideousMen) and he was saying that when they shot the psychiatrist scenes hestarted out with the camera right over their shoulders, and then he moved thecamera back slowly and changed the lighting, because he said that if you’d beengoing to therapy for months, then the lighting would be different every time ofthe same day. And I thought, “That’s insane that someone thought of that.” Andthen he moved the camera back 100 feet so that they were compressed on eachother so it was a much more intimate scene. I was like, “Wait, wait, wait, thisis insane!”The Verdict (1982, 96% Tomatometer)Ithink it’s probably one of the most inspirational movies for me because ofPaulNewman‘s performance. I think that is, to me, some of the best, [most]controlled acting in a movie. I think that he has this incredible likability.Even though he’s a drunk, washed-up lawyer, you’re still rooting for him fromthe very beginning.I’m that sort of weird guy who will watch a movie almost every day if I can.It’s harder when you’re working on the show. I buy a lot of movies on used DVDso I can have certain scenes. I was really looking for things to inspire me.When I got out of college I was waiting tables professionally [and] couldn’tafford to go the theater [every] night. I think those great movies can actuallymake you feel a certain way. Not only emotionally, but if you’re inthis business, it’s one of those things where you see someone do something thatgood and it buys you a year of energy. That’s what I was really looking for. Itsounds so cliché,[but I wanted] to bask in the glow some of these amazingperformances, like [those of]Dustin Hoffman andMarlon Brando. But it was alsofun. To get back to what I was saying before, that 1970s raw energy, it’s almostfrustrating now that people aren’t making more movies like that because peoplewon’t go see them.Even Away We Go is, in a way, a tribute to the 1970s movies, too, butmore of the Hal Ashby thing. Again, I don’t think people are making movies likethis, so for Sam to do it is incredibly cool. And the fact that my name’s on theposter is totally surreal.On the Waterfront (1954,100% Tomatometer)Thatmovie for me was my Marlon Brando experience before The Godfather,before Streetcar. It’s weird to be living in a modern world whereacting has changed. Movies have changed so much, and yet you can still see whatdefined [Brando] and his performance. If I told you that so-and-so was the firstperson to do something 30 years ago, you’d be like, “Well, I don’t care, becausepeople do it now all the time.” There’s still nobody doing what he does in thatmovie. And so that really changed everything for me. Also, there was somethingreally exciting and sad about the whole political aspect of that movie. Thewhole blacklisting thing.The Godfather (1972, 100% Tomatometer)Onlybecause it’s everybody’s number one choice. I kinda feel, in this day and age —not to be sounding bad in any way — we live in a culture where something’sgood, and some people will say it’s awesome, and they may not have even seen itor they didn’t like it. But they want to agree with the cultural zeitgeist. Ifeel like that movie has stood up to time [and] criticism, and yet everybody canfind the exact same reasons as to why it’s awesome. I mean, it’s sowell-written. It’s a slow movie that you’re still riveted by. It’s [got]character development unlike anything I’ve ever seen before. And of course, theperformances are wild.Did you use any particular scenes from these movies for your performance inAway We Go?No. When we were shooting in Connecticut, I stayed in New York a bunch of thetime, and I had all those DVDs there. I did watch Kramer vs. Krameragain for no particular reason, because [Away We Go‘s] not about a dysfunctionalrelationship. Again, just to get into that particular mindset. I don’t know,it’s like when you see something in the theater that just blows you away, itmoves you in a different way for a couple of days. I remember when I saw EternalSunshine of the Spotless Mind, I wanted to go out and direct a movieright there on the streets of Manhattan. Unfortunately, you can’t withoutpermits. Or so they tell me. [Laughs] But that’s the thing; if you see somemagic show on television, you’re like, “I’m gonna go buy a deck of cards!” Whoa,just settle down there, guy. So that’s basically what I do with these movies. Itry to see that to just push me to think I wanna rush in and do the scene thenext day.Catch John Krasinski’sAway We Go in theaters this week.

Scott Fitzgerald once said there are no second acts in American lives. Obviously, he never met Fred Durst. Best known as the lead singer for rap/rockers Limp Bizkit, Durst has always had a passion for movies. His debut, The Education of Charlie Banks (out this week on DVD), tells the tale of an uneasy friendship between Charlie (Jesse Eisenberg) and Mick (Jason Ritter), a tough kid from his old neighborhood. When Charlie goes to an elite college, Mick follows him there, and for a while it appears he’s smoothed out his rough edges, before old tensions come back to the surface. (Charlie Banks was shot before, but released after, The Longshots, Durst’s second film, which starred Ice Cube).Durst (who spoke to RT from Poland while on tour with his band) reflected on five of his favorite films, as well as the differences between making music and making movies, and why he chose The Education of Charlie Banks to be his first film.The Bicycle Thief (1948,95% Tomatometer)It’s hard to have favorites because I just have so many that I like and I respond to them differently with different moods and different pieces of memory, but I tried to name five that just came to my head. So I came with Bicycle Thief. It’s amazing. It’s very touching and so ahead of it’s time, it seems, but so simple, yet so complex. Just a very, very unique film that someone turned me onto years ago and that I had no idea about.The Shining (1980, 87% Tomatometer)I like The Shining. There’s just so many things about composition and breaking the mold, the innovative steady-cam work and the character and the performances, and the master behind it putting it together, Stanley Kubrick, who I love.&nbsp;RT: I’ve read elsewhere that you’re a big Kubrick fan. What is it about his work that you particularly enjoy?Fred Durst: I dunno, I guess it’s his perspective on the world, his eye that we’re being able to experience the story through, his take on things. He’s diverse; you see his collection and lots of different styles, but then again, they all just sort of seem to fall under the same umbrella somehow. It’s pretty amazing. I mean, I love 2001: A Space Odyssey a lot, I love Dr. Strangelove. I just really love his movies, and The Shining had an effect on me when I was very young, and watching it as an adult, someone who is exposed to the magic of filmmaking, the technical aspect of different things, I think it’s just a really wonderful piece of work. I just watch it anytime it’s on, flipping through, or “I’m just gonna throw on a DVD.” I mean, I’ve watched the movie quite a few times. I remember watching the making of it; he’s just so brutal on Shelley. He’s such a different type of director than I am, but that’s just the way he worked. Powerful guy; it just seems like his mind’s very complex. He had a wall up around him and only a few people got close, and that fascinates me.Chinatown (1974, 100% Tomatometer)I love Chinatown. Great movie, I mean, it just is what it is. Unbelievable, just a classic. I just really respond to that movie. It’s real; it has this heightened reality about it. Very powerful. It’s something that sticks out in my head. Seeing it, and watching it again and again, then seeing it as an adult. Something I can continue to watch through the years and be inspired by, and get lost in, and just forget about everything and say, “I just had a movie experience.”Harold and Maude(1971, 84% Tomatometer)&nbsp;I love Harold and Maude. [Hal Ashby’s] amazing. His characters, just the way he tells his story, the way he lets them breathe, the way he makes them so real. There’s just something about it I identify with. All his choices seem to speak to me.RT: One of the things I really liked about Charlie Banks was the way you integrated the music into it, and Harold and Maude seems to have that sort of thing too. It doesn’t overwhelm what’s going on on the screen, and it’s not telegraphing the action.FD: It sort of becomes a character in the film. It’s sort of vital to the whole experience, but it doesn’t take you out of the movie; it just enhances the experience, and telegraphing things I don’t really believe in so much. Sometimes when it’s just part of the process and that’s what makes the movie fun, but not in the case of Charlie Banks. You know, if I had Cat Stevens in my hands, it would have been amazing. Charlie Banks, man, you should have heard the music before the studio bought it and took out all the music and made me replace most of it. You should have heard the original. Oh my God, I just felt so good about it. I mean, still, I love it; a lot of the original themes like Mick’s theme [hums song]. But some of the source stuff that was timeless and classic, but they just didn’t want to pay for it. I still love it, but I just thought it was better before they made me replace it. I mean, you know where they go, “Hey, we have $10,000 in music budget.” You go, “Whoa, well that’s definitely gonna be impossible.” I’ll call these publishers myself, I’ll pull any favor I can, but we need a little more than that. But, you know, when it still has the music, the character, and Charlie Banks is still there, and it’s the feel and overall tone and tension of those vibrations, I still think it works for it. The movie, personally, is a little long to me. I wish they would have let me finish editing it; I would have taken out 10, maybe 12, 15 minutes of it.Taxi Driver (1976, 100% Tomatometer)Coming off my head, I could just go on, but… Taxi Driver. I was really moved by the unraveling of this guy, and the interesting choices Scorsese made, the things he used to tell the story. You know, like zooming in to the bottle of Alka Seltzer fizzling, this guy’s about to really cross over to the next layer of dementia. Just amazing choices, and for him to be so meant to be a filmmaker. Be it and feel it. And De Niro, just, oh man, I just get carried away. Every time, in the beginning of that movie, when he — he’s just so not self aware — he goes in to ask the girl out at the campaign center, and the feeling’s so uncomfortable. I loved him also as Rupert Pupkin in King of Comedy. Man, I love the way De Niro can sorta just play a guy that’s not aware.So those are five. I wouldn’t say they’re my favorite movies of all time. I just say it if I had to, off the top of my head. It just came, and if you asked me again tomorrow, it might be maybe one of those, maybe a bunch of others.&nbsp;Next: Durst talks about how filmmaking was his first passion, how he identifies with the characters in Charlie Banks, and what kinds of stories he wants to tell.RT: I’m sure you get this all the time, but after watching Charlie Banks, I’ve heard people say, “I cannot believe Fred Durst directed that film.” But then I read some other things and find out that filmmaking was always your first passion.FD: I can’t explain it. It’s such a bizarre juxtaposition for me to be in, because I’ve always been affected by film, and living through film. I want to be a filmmaker, I want to tell stories, and then out of left field, comes this blindsided punch of having a rock band, being a rock star. It’s crazy. I mean, I’m passionate about it, and I enjoy it. It just wasn’t a goal, it wasn’t something that was in me, I didn’t think. I mean, it’s in me, obviously, but I wasn’t aware of it, and the music became this thing that I got put into and ultimately led me to have the opportunity to find something to sink my heart into, to tell a story.Once the music makes you successful, it’s like you have opportunities to make movies. If you want to do something, because of the success of the music, you can, but I always felt a lot of people abused that. You know, great musicians who are like, “Hey, I’m gonna go make a movie,” or “I’m gonna go act in a movie,” because they’re so popular. You know, to each their own; effort is A-plus to me, but sometimes you just can see that they abused the privilege. I turned down a lot of movies in the beginning because maybe they weren’t developing right, or maybe it was just the wrong mix… Like they were looking for a “Break Stuff” video, but in a movie, or they were looking for a Limp Bizkit movie-music video thing, angst-driven, quick-cut, stylistic craziness that reflected the times and what Limp Bizkit was about, and that’s not necessarily the movies I respond to at all. So it’s interesting that I always wanted to be a filmmaker, and then getting a chance to, I feel so blessed to even have been able to make two films, and you just learn so much, and you just want to go make another one. You learn so much, and you want to get back out there, but it just doesn’t work that easy. Ugh.[rtimage]MapID=1177738&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=5&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]RT: Obviously a movie audience is a lot more sedate than a crowd at a rock concert, but are there any similarities between being a musician and a filmmaker, regardless of the medium?FD: In film, I feel like I’m reaching for reactions, I’m reaching for things to cause an emotional reaction, the emotion that’s intended from me, or intended by this moment, or this movie, or this scene, or this character. I’m looking for scenes that make me react to it. And then the music, I don’t think past the fact that just me in the mix, not thinking of the outside, not thinking “Oh, this is going to make people go crazy,” or “This is going to make them feel this or that.” I’m sort of just in another mindset as a musician, sort of spilling it out, and being insecure, and realizing the things I can talk the most about are the things going on in my own life or my own head, and finding a vulnerable moment behind a microphone, in front of a lyric pad, and then laying it down, and no one gets to hear it because it’s private in the studio, and you have your band a couple other people going, “This is a good one. This is a good one, let’s put this on.”With the movie, I feel like I’m aware of the audience the whole time, and that’s a different type of approach for me. I just feel it’s very different, but somehow they can coexist in the same world. But I do have to go with different approaches with both. I mean, I’m a completely different person when it comes to making music as I am to working on a film.RT: So what are you working on next? Is it Psycho Killer?FD: Yeah, right now that’s the top of the list. There’s movies I’ve developed and scripts I’ve had written on the side to make, but right now Andy Kevin Walker’s new script Psycho Killer is my next film, and it’s very, very good. I mean, this guy is an amazing writer, and he’s just so smart, and it’s such a unique perspective into the mind of this psychotic serial killer without being gratuitous or being a slash-em-up gorefest movie. It’s just very smart; it’s written so good, and there’s a magnifying glass over every beat of this movie, so everything has to really tie itself together well once you see and experience it. A lot of times when I see a movie that I feel that there’s suspense in there, and there’s mystery, and there’s something thrilling about it, the characters are great, it keeps me going… Once you find out the story, or the plot, or you figure it out, a lot of times I’m not interested to go back and watch the movie again, unless the right pieces are in, the right character, the way the story was told, the way it was shot, the way it all kind of blended together and worked, the choices that were made to make it something I want to watch over and over again. When I read Psycho Killer, I just felt like, “Oh my God, I could watch this movie over and over again,” because I see it in my mind. In Fight Club, you know it’s Edward Norton’s alter ego, it’s in his mind, he made it up. But once you figure that out, you could go watch it again and be blown away by all the nuances of Fincher’s filmmaking.Even for, like, a horror film, the first Halloween… Oh my God, I can see that movie, you know, not a billion times, but I can watch it again and again. It’s so simple but so effective. And the characters, and Jamie Lee Curtis is so [great]. I’m not the biggest horror fan in the world, but I like suspense, and I like to be scared, but I also like it when there’s a lot of substance and integrity behind it. Just more depth, and this movie’s got it. Andy Kevin Walker’s just a great writer, man. I read the script and go, “Holy s—, man, I cannot believe that you can just spit something out like this.”[rtimage]MapID=1177738&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=2&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]RT: As for the characters in Charlie Banks, did you personally think that Charlie and Mick were sort of a yin and yang of you when you read the script? Did you see yourself in these characters?FD: I definitely did. The reason I felt I could tell the story is because I had to not only be able to understand and tell the story from Charlie’s point of view, but also I had to really understand who Mick was and give him a fair shake on his side. I identify with pieces of both of them. I’ve been in similar situations that they’ve both been in. This movie is about Charlie and Mick. In the original script there were some subplots that I took out, some things that went into The Big Chill-style. It went more into the characters and built this “bigger picture” around it. I just winnowed it down, and trimmed the fat off, and we really focused on what this movie was about. I do identify with the inevitably tragic story of Mick, and he just being the dealt the hand that he’s been dealt in life. Regardless of where his mind thinks he can go, he’s always gonna be this person living the life he’s been dealt. Getting out of his own way — sometimes it seems possible, but it’s really not for him. And Charlie, he’s just such a solid character in this movie, and Jesse Eisenberg… I had already seen Roger Dodger, and then I saw The Squid and the Whale, and I was just in love with that movie. I was like, “This movie’s incredible.” And it was in the beginning of working on the script for Charlie Banks, and I just said, “Jesse Eisenberg is Charlie Banks.” And I remember the producers being like, “What? We need a name.” And I was just going, “No, no, this is the guy. And I think he has a name. This guy’s gonna be somebody in the film world.” So we got to meet with him, and we got to see all these little subtleties and characteristics that he had, and it was like, he’s Charlie Banks. He’s gonna speak the dialogue in the script, but really he’s just gonna play himself here.RT: Obviously, you and Ice Cube go way back, since you toured together on the Family Values tour. Was it intimidating working with him on The Longshots, given the fact that he’s a guy who’s made the leap into acting and directing?FD: I got The Longshots script from one of his friends, a producer that produces a bunch of his movies. I’d known him for a while, and he said, “Hey, check out this script.” And I read it and said, “This is a good story, like with sunshine around the corner.” And I like those good feeling things. And the script was very dramatic; it was like a Hoosiers-meets-Rudy. Cube saw Charlie Banks and he really liked it. I was like, “That’s dope! That’s wild! Let me go and meet with Cube, because I responded to this story.” It was just gonna be going to meet Cube and hang out with him. And the meeting, he was so serious, man. He’s not joking around. He really wants to have a diverse career, and think a lot of people expect him to just keep doing these Are We There Yets. He was like, “I wanna make this movie. I want to do something different with my character.” And I said, “You know, that’s the movie that I wanna make, because I don’t want to make Are We There Yet.” We really stuck to it, we fought for it, we got the script where we wanted it to be, but obviously in the process of the movie, you’ve got the studio trying to make it The Mighty Ducks the whole time. You see the heart in there, and you feel it, but then you have these silly moments that they just can’t help themselves. They think, “Kids won’t like this movie if we don’t put this in!” But it was a great experience, and Cube’s very professional. It wasn’t intimidating at all; he really believed in me and my decisions. We had talks before each performance. We just really bonded. We’ve told each other that we can’t wait to work together again, and my mind’s always on what I can do with him next, which will obviously be way different than The Longshots.[rtimage]MapID=1196736&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=6&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]RT: What would be your dream project? What movie would you make if you could?FD: Well, I’d love to work with Daniel Day-Lewis, Sean Penn, I’d love to do something with Fincher… I dunno, I really like Mark Wahlberg. I think there’s something really special about him. I have a really good knack for comedy, and that’s something that I’m hoping to expose. A dream project… man, I don’t know what that would be. I think the fact that movies even get made is absolutely a miracle. It really is a miracle. There’s so much politics involved, so much bull—-, so much drama in different things, and you just hope that through all that turbulent sea that your ship comes out looking like a ship. My dream project would be for me to win the lottery and just start a film company for real filmmakers and people who don’t want the drama. Try to make a drama-free studio and let the artists go do what they do. There are a lot of things that I really want to make, but I’m very superstitious. I don’t want to jinx it.Catch The Education of Charlie Banks on DVD this week.

Adventureland follows recent college grad James Brennan (Jesse Eisenberg) — an uptight, overeducated intellectual who reads poetry “for fun” — who takes a job at a low-rent carnival one summer working with excitable bosses (SNL‘s Bill Hader and Kristen Wiig), unmotivated slackers (Martin Starr of Freaks and Geeks), a surly, punk-loving love interest (Twilight‘s Kristen Stewart), and lots of righteous retro tunes. (Falco’s “Rock Me Amadeus” has never borne such loathing, or been heard so often, since 1985.)But unlike Superbad, Adventureland isn’t all raunch and giggles — it’s a bittersweet comedy, a nostalgic look at self-discovery and first love that simultaneously provokes laughs and stumbles into moments of poignant beauty. Writer-director Greg Mottola took time out from prepping his next film (the geek road trip movie Paul, starring Simon Pegg and Nick Frost) to share his favorite movies with RT, which range from Truffaut to Allen to Fellini — auteurs whose works similarly explore the spaces between love, humor, and the painful glories of growing up. “I didn’t want to do an ironic list or just include movies I think sounded cool,” he said. “These are five movies that for whatever reasons I re-watch insanely, and informed me.”2001: A Space Odyssey (1968, 96% Tomatometer)My parents took me to see it in a re-release — it came out in the ’60s and they re-released it in the early ’70s — and I was only seven years old, so it totally blew my mind. My parents, I think, were just completely bored and baffled by it, but I was obsessed with it. It stuck in my head, and every time it came on television I would watch it, and I saw it again in the theater as a teenager; I would go to see it whenever they revived it. It was just a movie I’ve watched a lot. I think part of the reason is…when I was a kid, I didn’t know what to make of it. It was so unlike what I’d been exposed to on TV, or by watching Disney films in the theater. It was so fascinating to me. It has a really unique status, which is in my mind like a big Hollywood epic movie about esoteric ideas — which had never really happened before that, and I don’t think it’s going to happen again. No one would ever spend that kind of money on a movie that big, and with that scope, and be that strange and slow and oblique and unexplained.Some people, of course, think it’s incredibly pretentious; I think the ideas in it are really fascinating. That Kubrick meticulousness is incredible. But part of what makes it a great movie, I think, is that as it proceeds it turns into this really intimate kind of horror-thriller — with HAL — and when I think, “Who’s a great writer who wrote in that style?,” I think Edgar Allan Poe in outer space. It becomes this real, psychological, bizarre, unexplainable thing about a murdering supercomputer! Those are some of the most handsome, greatest, cinematic scenes I’ve ever seen, so the fact that it was attached to this esoteric thing… To me, it works on so many levels. And the design, and the use of music…there’s nothing else quite like it.The 400 Blows (1959, 100% Tomatometer)One of the reasons this movie is important to me is that I’m a big fan of personal storytelling; people who tell their own stories and tell them vividly and honestly, and without sentimentality. It’s such a beautiful, naturalistic film, but unlike a lot of movies about children, it is devoid of sentimentality, but it’s also incredibly rich with emotion, which are two different things.It’s a painful movie in a lot of ways, but it’s just never cheap. There’s nothing cheap about the depiction of that young man’s life. It’s also one of the best child performances I’ve ever seen in a movie, because he’s a very specific character, but there’s nothing about him that feels forced, or that the filmmakers are trying to make you like him or pity him in a phony way. Jean-Pierre Leaud clearly had something special that is fascinating to watch; he’s really funny and charming, but also it’s strange to see a child character depicted so richly — he’s got flaws, there are sh***y things about him, but he captures all of it.Manhattan (1979, 98% Tomatometer)I love Woody Allen‘s movies, and it’s hard for me to pick only one, but I’d pick Manhattan because so many of his films feel influenced by his heroes — you see some Bergman or Fellini or the Marx Brothers or whoever — and to me Manhattan is the one that most captures Woody. Even Annie Hall has bits of Amarcord in it; it’s a perfect movie, and it’s unique, but Manhattan seems to be the one where Woody does everything he does in his own particular way.One of the things I love about his movies is the tension between the sort of romantic ideals versus his true skepticism about human nature. There’s always this push, this back and forth, about how he loves people and hates people; the misanthropy and the idealism fight each other constantly in the movie, and that’s why I think his films have a special quality. Manhattan has beautiful cinematography and the Gershwin music, and the characters are actually pretty dark and lost and restless, and unhappy. You mix it together and I find it really fascinating. I know some people are really creeped out by him and the girl, but we’ll skip over that.The Godfather Part II (1974, 98% Tomatometer)I’m going Part Two only — I love Part One, but there’s something about the second film that takes the perfection of the first one and enriches it. Maybe it’s the novelistic detail, the flashback structure. I don’t know any other movie where the flashbacks are so long. I mean, the flashbacks aren’t just interspersed; they are entire long chapters of the movie. Somehow, with the contrast of the two stories unfolding — these two rich stories, the De Niro one and the Pacino one — all of the Shakespearean themes of the Godfather movies become so poignant. Also, it’s probably got the best cast of any American film, ever, down to every last character actor: Lee Strasberg is Hyman Roth; there’s this Fellini actor, Leopoldo Trieste — he’s in scenes with De Niro, and he was in Fellini’s first few films; and people like John Cazale, there’s no one better than him.8 ½ (1963, 100% Tomatometer)Like The 400 Blows it’s incredibly personal, but as opposed to naturalism it’s much more expressionist; the whole mix of reality, memory, and real fantasy — the character’s fantasy versus the movie fantasy that’s unfolding through the real-time story. The character being a director making a movie, and how it all gets jumbled together and mixed together … to me it creates this amazing concept, that a person’s identity isn’t just one fixed thing. It’s actually — and this is very Fellini-esque — like a carousel of several things that are just always changing and swapping around. You don’t only have one identity, you have several of them, and they’re always changing and you’re always trying to satisfy all of them. Hence, we’re never happy and we never get it right, and it’s all very confusing. But you know, for Fellini, 8 ½ is incredibly optimistic in its own humanistic viewpoint on the beauty of that, as opposed to being smothered and depressed by the realization that this character will never be satisfied and is always disappointing other people. There’s an embrace of the life around him that I find really beautiful. I guess people can say it’s sentimental, but I think he earns it by the end of the movie because it explores so many truthful, and often dark, corners of the human soul.&nbsp;Adventureland opens nationwide this Friday.

The vampire who earned his nickname by impaling his victims on railway spikes, he went from Big Bad to Buffy’s boyfriend when a shadowy government cell called The Initiative fitted a chip in his brain that prevented him from doing harm.He stars this week in Dragonball: Evolution, based on the Japanese Manga comic, as Lord Piccolo, the megalomaniacal villain out to destroy the world by uniting the seven Dragonballs.Continue on as he shares his five favourite films with RT.Click on a thumbnail below.Apocalypse NowAlienBlade RunnerThe Milagro Beanfield WarRatatouilleApocalypse Now“I felt that it was a very clear message about why America lost the war. It was a scene that really got me when, right at the very end, the villagers were killing the cow. Because when we want some cow, we have someone else kill the cow and wrap it up in plastic and eat it.But they anointed the cow with oils and paint, and the whole village got around and prayed and chanted to the cow and slaughtered the cow in a bloody brutalist way and nobody flinched. Like, they wanted beef, looked it in the eye, and knew what it takes to eat beef, and that’s why we lost the war, they were just tougher.For me the film was exploring the soft underbelly of our culture and of our weaknesses, and the film’s ending dealt with this; how did we become so weak?”Click on a thumbnail below.Apocalypse NowAlienBlade RunnerThe Milagro Beanfield WarRatatouilleAlien“I thought this was a really interesting mix of horror and sex. There are so many sexual references, from the robot attacking Sigourney Weaver, and he rolls up a magazine and stuffs it down her throat, I mean, wow! Or the fact that Ash’s blood looks like semen, it’s just a lot of that kind of stuff. Deep, deep psychological sexual stuff; like calling the computer ‘Mother’.It’s really fascinating, and I think that’s why it’s so successful in scaring you. It places imagery that’s deep and sexual in a horror show. It’s designed to scare people, all this stuff that is repressed, and gets inside their psyche and is truly uncomfortable, and I think it’s right in (Alien artist and production designer) HR Giger‘s designs, I think sex is what we’re all afraid of.”Click on a thumbnail below.Apocalypse NowAlienBlade RunnerThe Milagro Beanfield WarRatatouilleBlade Runner“Of course taken from Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep by Philip K. Dick, a short story, and like a lot of his books, it paints a world where technology has vastly outstripped our morality. We can create artificial beings that are every bit as human as we are, to any measurement, and yet we still treat them like a machine.What does that say about how human we are? I think in the age of cloning and bio-medicine that is exploding right now, with every month, it seems there is some new problem that is jeopardising our morality as human beings. It just seems like we should be very careful in the next hundred years. Philip’s very clever in saying this is what is going to happen, if we’re not careful.I also think it’s the best noir that doesn’t have to have gumshoes ever. He’s successfully made a noir in a new setting. One of my favourite things is the flying blimp with the picture of the Asian lady taking the pill in close-up. How perfect is that? We’re seeing those commercials now, where they say the side-effects maybe your hair falling out and so on. How they talked to Coca-Cola about the product placing on that building, I’ll never know. ”Click on a thumbnail below.Apocalypse NowAlienBlade RunnerThe Milagro Beanfield WarRatatouilleThe Milagro Beanfield War“This was Robert Redford‘s follow up to Ordinary People. It’s just about a small South-Western town that is being taken over by moneyed interests. There’s this beautiful scene in the beginning where this obnoxious pig comes and wakes everybody up in the village out of bed, and everybody is like “Ergh, get away from me you pig.” But actually the pig is a force of great good; he’s just rousing everybody for the morning. There’s a certain poetry and stillness to the picture, and a magic that seems to emanate from the land and it casts a delicate spell.”Click on a thumbnail below.Apocalypse NowAlienBlade RunnerThe Milagro Beanfield WarRatatouilleRatatouille“I think that film, for me, showed me what cooking is really about, in a way that line animation was never able to. It made we want to cook, it made me want to go out to a new restaurant, it made we want to appreciate life, to taste everything, not just food but the air, everything. Frankly, to be able to put that kind of magic back into a film that is targeted for kids is just amazing. That’s all it’s trying to do, is say to kids, “Hey look at the world, it’s an amazing world, did you see that?” ”Click on a thumbnail below.Apocalypse NowAlienBlade RunnerThe Milagro Beanfield WarRatatouilleDragonball: Evolution is out on 8th May in the UK, 9th May in Australia and 10th May in the US.","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"CW, Rom-Com, bad, poppins, Acorn, Book, History, Netflix, CBS, Universe","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/JamesMarsters.jpg","slug":"five-favourite-films-with-james-marsters"},{"id":"47508863880658","title":"Five Favorite Films with Ron Perlman","content":"Five Favorite Filmsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Five Favorite Films with Ron PerlmanThe star of Mutant Chronicles shares his favorite classic films and what it was like to work with his idol, Marlon Brando.by Jen Yamato | April 21, 2009 |  CommentsWhile he’s become best known for portraying a red, horned antihero in Guillermo del Toro‘s popular comic book adaptations Hellboy and Hellboy II: The Golden Army, Ron Perlman has long been a favorite character actor among fantasy and science fiction fans thanks to his work in films like Quest for Fire, The City of Lost Children, Cronos, and Blade II. This week, the classically-trained actor (who is between seasons on his critically acclaimed FX series, Sons of Anarchy) stars in Mutant Chronicles as Brother Samuel, a monk dedicated to guarding a set of scriptures that predict the coming of an ancient enemy.Rotten Tomatoes talked with Perlman about his favorite movies and directors, whose films he watches when he’s having a rough day, and his remembrances of working alongside one of his idols, Marlon Brando.&nbsp;The Godfather (1972, 100% Tomatometer)The two films that have to be tied for first — and this is probably a hackneyed answer, but it is the way it is — are The Godfather, Part 1 and Citizen Kane. The Godfather is a perfect film. There is not one shot out of place, there’s not one performance that’s not the best thing that actor has ever done. There is not one thing about the film, visually, that’s not mind-bogglingly beautiful and elegant and astounding. And it shines a light perfectly on its subject matter.I think that there’s a gravitas, because of the presence of Marlon Brando, in the first film, that elevates it [as opposed to The Godfather, Part 2]. Not to say that the second and third films aren’t great films also, but when you have something as historically important as the performance that Brando gives as Vito Corleone, as the kind of central fulcrum point, then it goes into a class all by itself. He achieved that three times in his career, as far as I’m concerned. One was On the Waterfront. One was A Streetcar Named Desire. And one was The Godfather. And although he was the prevailing genius of the day, on those three occasions he just elevated phenomenally brilliant films into a place that became uncategorizable. How did he do that? It’s so ethereal, and so indescribable, that you could try to analyze it from now until the end of time and you couldn’t begin to put your finger on it. That was an otherworldly gift, that he had.Citizen Kane (1941, 100%) is tied for first with The Godfather. It just has to be, it’s such an amazing achievement.Pan’s Labyrinth (2006, 96% Tomatometer)I don’t think I would name films as much as I would name filmmakers. You have to have a Frank Capra movie, you’d have to have a John Ford movie, and you’d have to have a Steven Spielberg movie in there. And then as a specific film, Pan’s Labyrinth would have to be in my Top Five. Because what Gabriel García Márquez was to fiction, that movie is to cinema. It’s magical realism, and it’s something that can only exist cinematically. It cannot be confused with any other medium. That makes it the perfect film. It’s also unlike anything you’ve ever seen before or will see again, it’s completely unique and not derivative, and it’s brilliant. Absolutely brilliant. Setting fascist Spain — or fascist anything, for that matter –against this fantasy world created by this perfect, pristine, beautiful, pure girl.Frank Capra (Career Tomatometer: 100%)He identified in a way that was so joyously American; an innocence and a humanism. Just a beautiful heart, that he had, and was able to put into his work. Adding screwball comedy elements to it, but at the center of which were these important thoughts about how lucky we are to be alive. He was able to do that in ways that are cinematic and entertaining as well. And eliciting these performances — like Jimmy Stewart in Mr. Smith Goes to Washington (1939, 96%) and Gary Cooper in Meet John Doe (1941, 92%), Cary Grant and everybody else involved in Arsenic and Old Lace (1944, 90%)…Director: John Ford (Career Tomatometer: 100%)I’d have to have a John Ford movie; there are four or five movies of his that are tied in my book. He added a secular audience involvement in what was the beauty of cinema. In other words, he was the first guy that I think made movies live up to the potential of what they could be, and continued to do so throughout his career. He was able to be, to me, the most profoundly humanistic bridge between the potential of cinema and how it relates to the human condition. (Pictured: 1940’s The Grapes of Wrath, 100%)Director: Steven Spielberg (Career Tomatometer: 78%)He has to be in the discussion. He made one masterpiece after another, and you can’t even pick which is the best. What are you going to say, that Close Encounters (1977, 95%) was better than E.T. (1982, 98%), was better than Raiders of the Lost Ark (1982, 94%)? You just can’t do it. You can’t do it with Ford, and you can’t do it with Capra either.&nbsp;Next: Why Ron Perlman would love “another crack” at his one-time co-star and idol, Marlon Brando, and what films he takes on the road to cure his bad days[rtimage]MapID=10010069&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=6&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Perlman as Brother Samuel in Mutant Chronicles (click for more images)&nbsp;You once worked with Marlon Brando, on The Island of Dr. Moreau. What was that like?Ron Perlman: I did work with him. The film I worked with him on does not fit into the category that we are grappling with at this moment in time [laughs], but it was amazing just to be in his presence.Did you ever talk to him about how much you admired his career?RP: He had two rules: You could talk to him about anything under the sun, except movies, and except the movie you were working with him on. Movies meaning acting; he refused to talk about acting to anyone. And if you happened to not know those rules going in, you know… that was going to be pretty much the last conversation you had with him. But he was a really cool dude, a very warm, friendly guy. He just didn’t want to talk about acting or the movie you were working on, almost like, “Hey, I don’t know how this stuff happens and I don’t even want to discuss it.” He was a magician; he was a Merlin. But he didn’t want to open it up for discussion, even with himself. It was just a magical thing.[rtimage]MapID=1174281&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=34&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Perlman as the titular Hellboy in Hellboy II: The Golden Army&nbsp;How do you feel about talking about your own craft?RP: I’m more eager to talk about my craft than he was, but you know, I don’t compare myself to him at all. I don’t compare anybody to him. He occupied a place that is — I don’t know if I would say unachievable — but we haven’t seen anything like him before or since.I’d love another crack at him, but you know… he loved, loved to laugh. The only time I had a really, really good day with Brando on the set was, I happened to be pretty funny one day and I got him going. From that point on, there was a kind of new gleam in his eye. But the first three or four days I was on set with him, I was so intimidated and so nervous that I was a complete asshole. And he never got to see the more relaxed, easy-going version of me, which I really regret. Which is why I’d love to have another crack at him now, but… it is what it is, and I thank God that I even got to be in his presence, just for a moment.[rtimage]MapID=1185203&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=9&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Perlman in the Certified Fresh indie thriller The Last Winter&nbsp;What other actors or filmmakers did you idolize when you were younger?RP: Gary Cooper. Errol Flynn. I think my number one guy, if you asked me, “Ron, we’re sentencing you to a month in your living room and you have to only watch one actor’s work,” it would be Cary Grant. I think he was the most entertaining, well-rounded, elegant gift to cinema that ever existed. Because his body of work is mind-boggling. He hit all the bases. To be able to have the same guy be the buffoon in Arsenic and Old Lace, and also the most sophisticated thing you’ve ever seen in Hitchcock movies like North by Northwest… he was fearless in his work. Fearless. There was nothing he was afraid to do or try. He had this elegance and handsomeness that’s also undescribable. You can’t put your finger on what made Cary Grant Cary Grant, you’re just thrilled that he existed.Monty Clift, Paul Newman, Clark Gable, Spencer Tracy, Gene Hackman. I carry around with me a couple of those CD carriers with movies wherever I go in the world, and that’s my kind of guilty pleasure — watching those guys’ work whenever I’m depressed and just got the s*** beat out of me on the set that day. I just go home and turn on one of those movies, and I’m all well again.&nbsp;Watch Ron Perlman, Thomas Jane, and John Malkovich in Mutant Chronicles, which opens this Friday in select cities and is available now on Video on Demand.

From a budget of $3.5m the film grossed $72m worldwide, and won critical praise the world over, currently sitting at 88% on the Tomatometer.Many trailers and posters for his subsequent work tout it as being “from the director of Trainspotting,” but Boyle’s drive to deliver fresh and eclectic cinema will be a surprise for anyone expecting a redux of that film. His follow-ups have run the full gamut; from bleak sci-fi to zombie horror, through spiritual romantic comedy and traveller thriller. If there’s one thing Boyle’s not, it’s predictable.Indeed, his most recent previous outing was 2007’s Sunshine, about a crew of astronauts in the not-too-distant future who are on a mission to reignite our dying sun. But it’s a far cry from his new film, Slumdog Millionaire, a fantastical romance set on the streets and in the television studios of India. The story of a young boy’s tragic upbringing in the slums and his appearance on India’s version of Who Wants to be a Millionaire?, it’s already attracting awards by the bucketload.As you’d expect from his body of work, his five favourite films are diverse and disparate. “I’ve got an odd list,” he told RT. “Things like your ‘top films’ or your ‘top end playlist songs’ — these are the things that keep me awake at night. I watch all of these films through the director’s eyes, and I’ve watched them multiple times — well, except for The Bicycle Thief — to try and bow down and learn.”&nbsp;Apocalypse Now (1979, 98% Tomatometer)Always, and always number one for me in every list is Apocalypse Now. There are lots of reasons. It’s imperfect; which every film should be. I love action movies. I believe in motion, in the motion picture industry. And Apocalypse Now is the ultimate action movie.Firstly, it’s the only period film you’ll ever watch where nobody ever says it still ‘stands up after 30 years.’ Every other film — like Alien, and I’m a huge fan of Alien, I even did some promotion for it when they re-released it — the main thing you say are phrases like “Even after 25 years it still stands up.” You never have to use that (phrase) for Apocalypse Now. Everyone always just says: “Wow.”The second reason it’s the ultimate action movie is every time it stops moving it’s weird and unnatural and disturbing. Everytime it stops moving: they stop to collect mushrooms, they get attacked by a tiger; they stop and watch the playboy bunnies arriving; the boat stops and they end up shooting these people over a puppy in a little boat. And it stops, of course, with the ultimate stop: When he (Martin Sheen) meets Marlon Brando, Colonel Kurtz at the end. You can tell by how unnatural the stops are, how natural an action movie it is.The Bicycle Thief (1948, 95% Tomatometer)To my everlasting shame — the film is so good I hate to admit to it — I never watched it until last Saturday because I was in Italy promoting Slumdog and they loved Slumdog and I felt abject because I hadn’t seen The Bicycle Thief. Nobody asked about it but I ran out and got it the Saturday following. It’s the most beautiful film.Do not be put off by the fact it’s black and white or in Italian. It is the most beautiful film about a father and a son than I’ve ever seen.Wallace and Gromit – The Wrong Trousers (1993, 100% Tomatometer)I’m a huge, HUGE fan of animation — and that sequence at the end, when he’s on the little mini train, is even better action than Apocalypse Now. Nick Park is one of the most underrated action directors in the world. If he weren’t only interested in doing Claymation they’d have him doing every action movie. That is the best action sequence I’ve ever seen in a film. Talk about breathless action! And with the multi, multi, multi-millions of dollars spent on explosions — nothing is as great as that action sequence on the train at the end of that film.Au Revoir Les Enfants (1987, 100% Tomatometer)Louis Malle is one of the great, underrated French directors. That’s the best film I’ve ever seen about children. It’s a very, very adult film so of course you have to take the kids very seriously. What is it they say? ‘Kids are father to the man,’ or something like that. What you are is what you were, really. It’s one of the most beautiful films I’ve ever seen; one of the saddest, most moving, genuine films ever.As a director I’ve done kids films — Slumdog has kids, and, I made a film called Millions — and it’s not easy to get kids to be good. You work hard at it. What is really difficult is to get every kid to be in the same film at the same time and I watch that film and every kid — and there’s a lot of kids in it, it takes place at a school — they’re all in the same film at the same time.Eureka (1983, N/A Tomatometer)I can guarantee you this film isn’t on anyone else’s list. It stars Gene Hackman and it’s made by my favorite British film director, even more than Nick Park. He’s a guy named Nick Roeg, and he’s most famous, probably, for Don’t Look Now. Eureka is the film that probably ended his American career. I think it was a disaster when it was released.The first half of this movie is as good as you’ll ever get in a movie. It’s about a guy who discovers, literally, liquid gold. He becomes the richest man in the world and the man who has everything and the man who has nothing. The second half of the film is a trial and takes place in a courtroom and that part doesn’t work as well, which is what probably led to it being a flop, but the first half is as good as it gets.And I love Nick Roeg. He’s idiosyncratic, highly individual and yet for a ten year period he was working in the studio system with big stars like Gene Hackman. Hackman’s never been better. People say “Hackman” and think of The Conversation but he’s never better than he is in Eureka. If you can imagine a man who has everything and he (Hackman) just plays it as a guy who has nothing.Slumdog Millionaire opens today in the UK and is out now in the US and Australia. And come back, because RT will have more from Danny Boyle later.","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"we, heist, best, Paramount, Reviews, Family, IFC, Turner, Awards, streaming, 72, Series","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/DannyBoyle.jpg","slug":"five-favourite-films-with-golden-globewinner-danny-boyle"},{"id":"47508867416558","title":"Five Favorite Films with Guillermo del Toro","content":"\n\n                                            Five Favorite Films\n                                        \n                        \n                        \n                            var mps=mps||{}; mps._queue=mps._queue||{}; mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[];\n                            mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function() {\n                                mps.rt.insertlogo('#article_sponsorship_ad', 'ploc=articlesponsorship');\n                            });\n                        \n                    \n                    \n                        Five Favorite Films with Guillermo del Toro\n                        The Hellboy II director tells us his most beloved films of all time.\n                        by Jen Yamato | November 14, 2008                          | \n                          \n                              Comments\n                          \n                     \n\n                     \n\n                     \n                       \n                         \n                           \n                         \n                           \n                         \n                           \n                         \n                           \n                       \n                     \n\n                    \n                                                With a reputation for excellence in the realms of fantasy and horror, filmmaker Guillermo del Toro brought a visionary touch to such critically-acclaimed films as Pan’s Labyrinth, The Devil’s Backbone, Cronos, and last year’s The Orphanage, which he produced. When del Toro turned his attentions to Dark Horse Comics’ Hellboy franchise in 2004 — infusing the big, horned anti-hero with a distinct sense of style and wit — fans and critics were summarily delighted, and the reins came loose for a bigger and more fantastical sequel. Hellboy II: The Golden Army surpassed the critical and box office performances of its predecessor and is Certified Fresh at 88 percent on the Tomatometer.\nRotten Tomatoes caught up with del Toro at the Hellboy II: The Golden Army DVD/Blu-ray Launch Party, where, in signature self-deprecating fashion, he guided those in attendance through the immersive Hellboy II Blu-ray experience. More importantly, del Toro announced plans to join fans in a ground-breaking BD-Live chat event (November 23rd at 6pm PST), where Blu-ray owners can log in and ask him their most burning questions. Except for, say, his favorite movies of all time; we’ve got that covered below.\nRead on for Guillermo del Toro‘s Five Favorite Films (click for the Five Favorite Films of Hellboy II star Doug Jones and Hellboy comics creator Mike Mignola, who shared at least one top movie with del Toro himself)…\n\n\nBride of Frankenstein (1935, 100% Tomatometer)\n\n\nBride of Frankenstein is absolutely perfect. It has the innocence and beauty of a fairy tale, but has the darkness of a gothic horror tale. So the combination is irresistible. [On hearing that Hellboy comics creator Mike Mignola also named Bride of Frankenstein among his favorite films, del Toro said with a smile, “Well, we are alike in some aspects.”]\n\n\n\nBlade Runner (1982, 91% Tomatometer)\n\n\n\nThe third film, Los Olvidados — Bunuel‘s movie — which I think is one of the best depictions of childhood ever made. \n\nThe Road Warrior (1981, 100% Tomatometer)\n\n\n\nThe Road Warrior — again, it transformed the way I see the world.\n\n\nThe Gold Rush (1925, 100%) / City Lights (1931, 100% Tomatometer)\n\n\n\n\nAnd [lastly] probably The Gold Rush, or City Lights, by Chaplin, because they are absolute pinnacles of filmmaking. You have precision comedy, precision filmmaking, and one of the best directors ever. He and Buster Keaton were fantastic, and they were two of my idols.\n\n\n\n\n \nClick for images from Guillermo del Toro’s Hellboy II production diary!For more on Hellboy II: The Golden Army, click here.\n                                            \n                \n            ","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"CW, thriller, Mudbound, rotten, 2015, nbcuniversal, HBO","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/GuillermoDelToro.jpg","slug":"five-favorite-films-with-guillermo-del-toro"},{"id":"47508868934131","title":"Five Favorite Films with Chuck Palahniuk","content":"Five Favorite Filmsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Five Favorite Films with Chuck PalahniukThe Fight Club author shares some killer movie faves and an exclusive clip from Choke.by Jen Yamato | September 22, 2008 |  CommentsBestselling author Chuck Palahniuk burst onto Hollywood’s radar when his psychological novel, Fight Club, was adapted into a major motion picture directed by David Fincher; the resulting film became every American male’s aggro-fantasy (“The first rule of fight club is, you don’t talk about fight club.”) This month, the Palahniuk touch returns to cinemas via Choke, a raunchy and delightfully vulgar adaptation of his novel about a sex addict (Sam Rockwell) who cons people using the Heimlich maneuver.Chuck Palahniuk took time to share his Five Favorite Films with RT. The results were morbid, to say the least. In no particular order, here are Chuck’s five favorites!Harold and Maude (1971, 86% Tomatometer)Ruth Gordon was so much more than Garson Kanin‘s beard. With music by Cat Stevens… as a motorcycle cop… this movie satisfies on so many levels. Death and sex have never been so beautifully linked together. This film is Love Story for the rest of us.They Shoot Horses, Don’t They? (1969, 83% Tomatometer)Once again, we see sex and death wed like chocolate and peanut butter. Jane Fonda looks like the angel of bitter, angry suicide girls before such girls were ever born. Bruce Dern plays the psycho hillbilly we loved him playing in ‘The Big Valley’ on television. Gig Young claws his way to the bottom of the bottom-feeders, winning the Oscar just before his own real-life suicide. Here’s my favorite “date movie” of all time.Alien (1979,97% Tomatometer)Do I really need to explain this? Except for the weird disco typeface spelling out “nostromo” on everyone’s uniform, this film seems timeless.Session 9 (2001,60% Tomatometer)Again, everybody dies. That is such the best, most-great formula for a true masterpiece film. A classic film should leave you thinking, “How in the hell did this idea ever get financing?” The director, Brad Anderson, does more with his small budget than most movies do with huge, fat mountains of cash. The moment the credits start to roll, I want to watch the whole story over again.Sunset Blvd (1950,100% Tomatometer)Everybody ends up dead or insane-slash-arrested. Nancy Olson is dismissed to wed Jack Webb — the real off-screen horror ending. Every performance is outlandish, as big as anything on any Mexican soap opera. The dead monkey. Buster Keaton. The fun never ends. The best noir comedy, ever.But wait, there’s more!

He stars in Smith’s Zack and Miri Make a Porno alongwith Elizabeth Banks as one of two roommates who embark on a porno shoot topay off debts, while slowly realizing the possibility they could be morethan just friends, roommates, and on-screen amateurs.RT spoke to Rogen for his five favorite films ever (clickhere for Monday’sFive Favorites article with Kevin Smith), and followed up with an interviewabout Zack and Miri, opening this Friday.The Big Lebowski (1998,77% Tomatometer)Obviouslyamazing. It’s hilarious. I can watch it over and over. Unbelievably funny.Ghostbusters (1984,93% Tomatometer)That was just good ol’ high-concept fun. Evan and I always like to takeridiculous situations and handle them as though they were real. That’s kind ofwhere the idea of Pineapple Express came from. These ridiculous action moviesituations and you handle it just how two idiots would handle it. And that’skind of what Ghostbusters did. It’s a ridiculous concept but it was handled verymuch, “How would four dudes do that, you know?” And it’s great. I love thatmovie.The Last Detail (1974,91% Tomatometer)I saw that more recently in life. Hal Ashby shoots very simply. He kind of takesa step back and shoots stuff as it happens. Things are never about the shot,you know? It’s always about the joke. It’s never about how the camera moves.That’s a very interesting style.Superbad is veryLast Detail-ish. We wrote Superbad before we saw Last Detail, but after we sawit, it helped clarify what we were going for, I think.Total Recall(1990, 79% Tomatometer)Total Recall‘s just f–king rad. And super violent. That movie is a goodindicator that you can take things much farther than you think you could.[Laughs.] And they will strike a chord with the mainstream, I think. That moviegoes really far. It’s pretty crazy. I love Paul Verhoeven. He’s the man.Goodfellas (1990 96% Tomatometer)I just love that movie. It’s a radmovie. It’s beautiful.Our interview withSeth Rogen continues as we discuss his upcoming projects, including The GreenHornet and Judd Apatow’s Funny People.Freaks and Geeks is now a show that means a lot to people. When fanstalk to you, do you feel like you’re required to be knowledgeable about theshow, Star Trek-style?SR: I’m not that familiar with some of the episodesbecause I’m not in all of them. [Laughs.] I actually have not seen the ones I’mnot in as many times as the [ones I am in]. But, no, [the fans] are nice, and Iknow it pretty well. I feel that I don’t disappoint those people too much.So among your upcoming projects is writing a Simpsons episode.&nbsp;SR:Yeah, we did it.When is it airing?SR: I don’t know. It takes a while toanimate them. It was the greatest thing we ever did. It was the smartest idea weever had, trying to do that. The greatest day of my life.And you also voiced a character?SR: Yeah. You do it all together, which is amazing. Thewhole cast is in one room. So it’s me and Homer…you’re talking to DanCastellaneta!Seth Rogen and Elizabeth Banks.Considering animated films now record everythingseparately, it surprises me The Simpsons still records in a single room.SR: Surprised me too. I can’t believe theydo it like that. I haven’t even met half the people [I co-star with] in[animated] films.And [the episode] is really funny. I think. I hope. I hope it’s a good one. Thefact that we came up with an idea at all that they hadn’t done before wasshocking. And I just got the script in the mail signed by the whole cast and I’mall, “This is the f–king best thing we ever did.”Before you came on board for The Green Hornet, Kevin Smith was attachedto the project. Did you discuss your versions during the Zack and Miri shoot?SR: Yeah, I asked him what his version was. I told him what we weredoing. It seems that we have totally different takes. They’re totally differentmovies. I had no idea that he was ever involved with it when we first came on.It’s funny. Funny how things work out. But it’s happened before. I’ve been firedfrom movies that my friends are later hired on. Everyone knows each other. It’sbound to happen. [Laughs.]Right now you’re filming Funny People, rumored tobe more dramatic than comedic?SR: I don’t know if I’d say it’s moredrama than comedy. I’d say [there’s] more drama than our movies generally have.But it’s still played pretty funny. I feel just the nature of having AdamSandler in every scene is [making] it funny. But it definitely is aboutsomething more serious, in that it deals with death in a lot of ways. It’s areally interesting tone. Normally, our movies balance sweet storyline with thedirty jokes, but this one seems to balance more dark, depressing storyline withthe dirty jokes.&nbsp;Craig Robinson and Seth Rogen.With the dramatic elements in Freaks and Geeks andKnocked Up, is Funny People not actually that big of a leap anyways?SR: I do feel like I’ve done quite a bitof drama. [The upcoming film] Observe and Report also has a lot of very dramatic stuff in it, sothat was good preparation. I think it’s actually easier to do drama to behonest. Like, because, you just…you just don’t have to try to be funny.[Laughs.] For me to act natural and real but also try to be funny while doingthat [is hard].Why was The Green Hornet the project that convincedyou to work out? Had it ever come up before with any other roles that you shouldget into shape?SR: No, it never had. [Laughs.] No, itjust never came up really. [Laughs.] I honestly think it serves the movie more.I don’t need to be in incredible shape for it. But it’s definitely served by [ahero] who’s into his image, a guy who’s a little more physical attentive thansome of my other characters. A guy who physically who just has to do a lot ofstuff.When was it known that Stephen Chow was going todirect in addition to co-starring?SR: It was simultaneous. We sent him thescript. We said, “The world is yours. Tell us what you want your involvement tobe, and that’s what it’ll be.” He wrote back that he wanted to direct it and beKato. And that was it.Was Chow familiar with your work when you sent himthe script?SR: I think maybe he was familiar withThe Green Hornet. And then he heard that a comedian was involved in it. I thinkhe had heard of our movies but I don’t know if he had seen them. He has seenthem all now, and he’s liked them. Enough to read the script, I guess. And wegot along really well.And vice-versa: how familiar were you with Chow’swork?SR: I remember when Shaolin Soccer cameout. I saw Kung Fu Hustle and that was the first I really saw of him. And itjust blew my mind. And then I went back and watched all the other stuff, God ofCookery and all that.&nbsp;Seth Rogen and Elizabeth Banks.How did you originally get involved with The GreenHornet?SR: You know, you tell your agent, “Wewant to work on our next movie. Is there anything out there that’s interesting?”She’ll tell you one ten things and one of them’s The Green Hornet. “Oh,[producer] NealMoritz has the rights to The Green Hornet. Maybe you can pitch an idea to thewriters. Maybe you can pitch an idea if you have one.” Me and [writingpartner] Evan [Goldberg] knew of TheGreen Hornet, we liked it. I wasn’t, like, f–king crazy about it or anything.But we’ve always wanted to write a movie about a hero and his sidekick. And wealways thought that was an interesting story. And one that’s never been toldwell. It’s a funny relationship. And we thought that’d be the perfect one to dothat with. Get the one thing where the sidekick’s more famous than the hero.Like, everyone knows Bruce Lee. We just pitched our idea. And I could be him inthis version because it’s about not really being your traditional hero. He needs[Kato]. He can’t do it on his own.In the new wave of superhero movies, you can’t havea sidekick anymore.SR: Exactly!Do you think a superhero/sidekick movie isinherently funny or campy?SR: Yes. It’s impossible for thatrelationship to not be slightly comedic. It just by nature is. That is why wealways wanted to make a movie about that. And our movies are all aboutrelationships. That’s where we always start. From Pineapple Express to Superbad,as dumb and weird as those movies are, we always start with the relationship.Again, yeah, we were huge comic book fans, but with this, it seemed like our wayin. It seemed like, “Ah, we get to make a comic book superhero movie, but it’salso based on a relationship.” And that’s something we know how to make moviesabout.And not that many people are fans of it. Which is also good. There’s very fewpeople to piss off. No one knows s–t about The Green Hornet.There’s four guys on a message board who are out for blood.SR: [Laughs.] There’s four guys who arereal pissed off about it, and f–k those guys. Who cares, you know? The factthat anyone right now is excited about a Green Hornet movie is a miracle. Like,it is unbelievable that we somehow got people talking about The Green Hornet.Zack and Miri Make a Porno opens in theaters this Friday.Want more 5 Favorite Films?

And yes, he’s turned a some of your most beloved video game titles into big-screen clunkers (none of which have yet broken 11 percent on the Tomatometer*). Heck, the man who gave us such stinkers as Alone in the Dark, BloodRayne, and Dungeon Siege: In the Name of the King has even agreed to retire if an online petition asking him to simply “stop” reaches one million signatures. But we bet you never expected Uwe Boll to pick veritable classics of cinema as his favorite films of all time…Read on for Dr. Uwe Boll’s five favorite films, as told to RT.*Boll’s latest film, the political satire Postal, currently has a career-high 29 percent Tomatometer.&nbsp;Apocalypse NowOne of my all-time favorites is Apocalypse Now, because it shows the craziness of war, and you have the feeling that the shooting also was a big adventure. And this is what I like.What is lost, if you see war movies today — not like Pearl Harbor, that’s one of the worst movies of all time — but like Mel Gibson‘s Once We Were Warriors or Soldiers or whatever (2002’s We Were Soldiers), all that stuff, you feel it’s all fake. You feel they go in the evenings to their hotel rooms and it’s all good.But in Apocalypse Now, you feel like these guys were f—ed!Dances with WolvesI love a big adventure; it’s one of the reasons I like Dances with Wolves, also on the list. Because I feel that this was also a big adventure [to film] and I like the very realistic feeling, what Kevin Costner did with that movie. I love that movie. It’s emotional, and it’s real, in a way. I really like it.[Editor’s note: check back for next week’s full interview with Uwe Boll as he tells us how he almost got Kevin Costner to join the cast of Dungeon Siege: In the Name of the King!]A Clockwork OrangeA Clockwork Orange would be [on the list]. Clockwork Orange and Citizen Kane, because they’re both all-time favorites, and I think Orson Welles did with Citizen Kane so much interesting stuff for the year that he did it, what nobody else did before. The same with Kubrick for Clockwork Orange. They broke a lot of filmmaking rules and the subject matter is, for me, very interesting.Citizen KaneCitizen Kane is, like you see now, P.T. Anderson‘s There Will Be Blood. It’s a good movie; it’s the same kind of thing. You follow a crazy character who gets really successful, and in a very bitter way. So I really love those two movies.It’s still one of the biggest crimes of Hollywood that they didn’t finance Orson Welles’ movies after a while. To have a genius like him, sitting there and trying to get his last 5,000 bucks together to make another movie after he did a movie like this… (Welles’ follow-up to Citizen Kane, The Magnificent Ambersons, was notoriously completed and re-cut without his input.)The SearchersNumber five…like I said, it always changes. There are a lot of good movies out there [that are] from time to time favorites. I would do The Searchers, from John Ford, with John Wayne. I’m a big Western fan, and this was a great Western.John Ford is interesting; if you are younger, you don’t appreciate John Ford so much. I liked more Howard Hawks and William Wyler Westerns when I was younger, and now, later, if you get a little older, you like John Ford more and more. It’s the same with some writers. There are some writers you love when you’re 20, and when you’re 30 or 35 you think it’s completely silly bulls–t what the guys wrote (laughs), but you appreciate other writers.Tune in next week for our full interview with Uwe Boll, in which the Postal director shares the secret of how exactly he makes money on flicks like Alone in the Dark and Dungeon Siege: In the Name of the King, and answers your submitted questions!","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"Disney, Association, female, VICE, Masterpiece, Black, See, Paquin, Creative, leads, Travel, Horror, fast, thriller, TV","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2008/05/UweBoll.jpg","slug":"five-favorite-films-with-uwe-boll"},{"id":"47508868949494","title":"Five Favorite Films with Starship Troopers‘ Casper Van Dien","content":"Five Favorite Filmsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Five Favorite Films with Starship Troopers' Casper Van DienJohnny Rico reveals himself to be...a Star Wars geek!by Jen Yamato | August 4, 2008 |  CommentsIt’s been eleven years since we last saw Casper Van Dien as Federation soldier Johnny Rico in Paul Verhoeven‘s sci-fi cult film, Starship Troopers.

It was another great sequel to a great movie. I loved the humanity of Arnold Schwarzenegger. I loved the humanity in the cyborg, in the Terminator. I loved the fact that he was not human and he had more humanity than most humans do. And he was just cool.&nbsp;Star Wars – Episode IV: A New Hope (1977, 95% Tomatometer)Then I would go with the first Star Wars, which is actually the fourth episode, because I remember standing in line; I was one of those bazillion kids that were standing in line opening day. My poor mother and father had to do that with me. I remember my mom left, and came back a day later. So my dad stood there with me. I think that is one of the most incredible memories for me. It was an awesome film; I’ll never take anything away from the film, but the fact that I had a father who was willing to stand in line with me all that while…let’s see, I was born in ’68, so I was 8 or 9. Eight or 9 and my dad stood in line for me. Yeah, I was there for like a day and a half!The Matrix (1999, 86% Tomatometer)And then I would put The Matrix. The first Matrix. Are there any others? [Because of] Neo. And it was just so cool. Everything in that movie made you see how we’re all interconnected; I think that the internet is like a man-made version of, the closest we can come to conceptualizing God. It shows how we’re all connected, and this Matrix is really that more defined. The Wachowskis were just a couple filmmakers who did an incredible job.Aliens (1986, 100% Tomatometer)And my all-time favorite number one science fiction movie would be…Starship Troopers! Because I’m vain! And full of myself! No, actually I’m excluding me from this, but I would put that on the list. But I can’t do myself, because it just isn’t right. I would say Aliens. Because, as Jim Cameron himself said, “Why are they making Starship Troopers? I already did!” He was wrong, by the way!Bonus Answer: RoboCop (1987, 85% Tomatometer)Actually, I have to add one more in. I have to add RoboCop only because of the one line at the very end, when they go, “What’s your name?” And he says, “Murphy.” It’s the greatest way to end any movie, ever. It’s true, if you think about that. Everybody in the audience stood up and screamed. They went ballistic; I know, I was there. I’m probably revealing some geekdom here. I was there in the theater opening weekend! I remember everybody — as soon as he said his name, he got his humanity back, and it was such a powerful moment. It was awe-inspiring.Next: Our full interview with Casper Van Dien!Casper van Dien: I love Ed Neumeier; I think he’s got a wonderfully sick, perverse sense of humor. It was a lot of fun to have in the first film, and to also see it in RoboCop as well, and to see him put it into this script — I had the opportunity to read five of the scripts for Starship Troopers 3 specifically over the last four years, and I just love reading his dark sense of humor. I love seeing it, and to get the opportunity to read it so many different times was awesome. And to see him make the film, it was a natural segue for him, so it was a thrill for me to be a part of.Were you close with Ed from working on the first Starship Troopers? Was he a presence on set back then?CvD: Ed is a unique writer — Paul Verhoeven is a unique director, but he demanded that Ed be on the set [of Starship Troopers] every day. So for RoboCop and for Starship Troopers he was on the set every single frickin day. He was there from the beginning to the end. It was fun for me, because he and I became friends. But Ed and I became friends actually when he saw me when I first walked into the audition for Starship Troopers. I was sitting out there with all the other guys that were auditioning for the role, and Ed poked his head out of the office; he was not only one of the writers, but he was one of the producers at that time. He poked his head out of the office, looked at me, pointed at me, and fingered me to come over to him. So I went over to him and in front of the other kids, I was like “Ha ha hah…” I walk into his office and he had a rifle there and I picked it up, and I did some drills with it from military school and we got to talking, and he said he knew when he poked his head out of the office that I was Johnny Rico. And Paul Verhoeven said that when I came into read he knew that I was Johnny Rico. So it was always a thrill to have these men believe in me. Ed really wanted me in the second one, but the director didn’t want any characters from the first film in it. Ed said if he got to do one of his own, that he would demand that I be in it, and I guess he got his way.I was wondering why you weren’t in the second Starship Troopers film, Hero of the Federation…CvD: The director [Phil Tippett] really wanted to go a different way, from what I gather. I don’t know everything for a fact — you’ll have to ask him personally — but he also, from what I hear, wanted the humor out of Starship Troopers. It might have been the studio at the time that wanted the humor out, but they really asked Ed to put it back in for this one. So Ed was like, well, that’s the way I like to write, and that’s what he did.This film was always meant to be a DVD release. But it’s getting a theatrical in Japan because they did such a phenomenal job with it that Japan said, we want this for a theatrical [release]. But it was always meant to be a DVD.Well, there’s definitely a collective love for the first Starship Troopers, and Marauder seems to fall much closer to the spirit of the original.CvD: Definitely. You are one hundred percent correct. Robert Heinlein created Starship Troopers, but Ed created the Starship Troopers movie world. He put in his political satire in the first film, he’s got it in this film and then some, and he’s also got this new religious twist, which some may or may not get. I think it’s hysterical, though. He’s a phenomenal writer. Different people will embrace it in different ways. And other people will hate it in other ways, but it’s always fantastic to have that kind of variation in appeal, or lack thereof.Next: Ed Neumeier vs. Paul Verhoeven, Johnny Rico vs. Stallone, Schwarzenegger, and moreHaving known Ed for a while and worked with him before, how would you describe him as a first-time director, especially in contrast to Paul Verhoeven?CvD: That’s a very good question. Ed Neumeier — this is a natural segue for him, to go from writer-creator to director, and this is an easier venue for him to do that as his debut. Because he is already known, and this is an established franchise that he’s affiliated with and have a lot more appreciation for and from. The advantage for him is as a director, he hired a great team around him. He did a superb job and the people really embraced it and loved him and went for it. But he also had the most incredible training and advantage over most debut directors, because he was on the set every day of RoboCop, and on the set every day of Starship Troopers, under one of the greatest directors of all time: Paul Verhoeven. So he had that instruction. Paul — even if you watch Black Book today…what a great film that is. Paul continues to grow as a director and his passion is unsurpassed by anybody. Ed was able to witness this and get these lessons and instructions. And also he’s a fan of films. Ed’s a huge fan of John Ford films, and you can talk to him about just about any film. Differences between them? Paul’s a bit more of a screamer, and he has more of an accent. [Laughs]Paul had a bigger budget, but what Ed had for this was phenomenal. Robert Skotak was the Academy Award-winning special effects guy for Aliens and T2, and he wanted to be on the first Starship Troopers because he was a big fan of the book, and he got to do this one and he did something like 420 more special effects than he was scheduled to do because he loved it so much. The bug that Ed wrote about, he created. The old bugs, he put his little flavors into. For the budget that he had, he did the most phenomenal job. What I also appreciate is Sony, they got Klaus Badelt, who did the music for Pirates of the Caribbean: Curse of the Black Pearl, who saw this and loved it and did the music for it. So they really got some remarkable people behind it. And Sony’s putting the most incredible campaign I have ever seen together for a DVD release. The Japanese website is incredible, and the posters that you see throughout the world, from Australia to America to Japan, are awesome! And I’m not just saying that because I’m on the cover…Where would you place Johnny Rico in the pantheon of great sci-fi heroes?CvD: Well, being the self-absorbed me…I remember seeing this article that rated different superheroes, and it had me beating Jesse Ventura from Predator, and it had me beating Demi Moore from G. I. Jane — it had Johnny Rico beating these guys — and it had Sylvester Stallone beating John Wayne…whatever! And Arnold Schwarzenegger beat me, but then Arnold Schwarzenegger beat Stallone. So I came in third. But right now, I could kick either of their asses, ’cause they’re old. I’m sorry! Put ’em down like the b****es they are! Just kidding, I don’t know. Arnold Schwarzenegger can still take me out, he’s the Governator; Sylvester Stallone, I just saw him in Rambo and he was huge. Huuuuge.Yeah, but how many of them still do nude scenes like the one you have in Starship Troopers: Marauder?CvD: [Laughs] I don’t think we’d want to see them in a nude scene right now! I hardly want to see myself in a nude scene, but I worked out really hard for that one.So tell us how Johnny Rico has changed in the near-decade since we last saw him in Starship Troopers.CvD: Well it’s eleven years later, and it’s eleven years later for him as well. He’s survived — one of the few in the Starship Troopers world to do so — men, women, an equal kill factor. It seems like he’s become more of a pure warrior. He might be more disillusioned with the higher ranking officers and their willingness to sacrifice good troopers, as many of us are disillusioned with the people in charge who are willing to sacrifice American soldiers who are willing to do their part, and do it well, and who have honorable intentions. I think that is what he’s become. He joined the military first for a girl, and was trying to impress her, though that of course didn’t work; we always do stupid things when we’re young to try and impress girls and it never works, but…he became a soldier, and now he’s a pure warrior, and he’s very good at what he does. Maybe not as good as everyone else because they get promoted a lot faster, but he’s good enough to survive, and that’s a definite plus in the Starship Troopers world.For more info, photos and news, check out our Starship Troopers: Marauder page.","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"Arrowverse, Larson, venice, live, Grant, Western, Hulu, cults, docudrama, Pride, TV, fresh, shows, ABC, LGBT","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/CasperVanDien.jpg","slug":"five-favorite-films-with-starship-troopers-casper-van-dien"},{"id":"47508867423729","title":"Five Favorite Films with Kevin Smith","content":"Five Favorite Filmsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Five Favorite Films with Kevin SmithWe get the films that influenced the foul-mouthed filmmaker.by Alex Vo | October 27, 2008 |  CommentsComing off his most accessible comedy (Jersey Girl) and his mostvulgar (Clerks 2), writer-director Kevin Smith concocts a mixture ofthe two styles for his latest, Zack and Miri Make a Porno, openingthis Friday. In a film by turns thoughtful and juvenile, Seth Rogen andElizabeth Banks star as two roommates who embark on a porno shoot to pay offdebts, while slowly realizing the possibility they could be more than justfriends, roommates, and on-screen amateurs.RT spoke to Smith for his fivefavorite films ever, and followed up with an interview about the process ofcreating the Zack and Miri universe.Jaws (1975, 100% Tomatometer)Comeon, it’s common sense. Jaws is a fantastic film. Maybe the second film Isaw in my life — I saw The Gumball Rally prior to Jaws — butJaws is the first one that made a deep, deep impression. I saw it a drive-inwith my parents when I was five, which is kinda weird in retrospective. It wasPG at the time.My kid’s nine and my wife still won’t let me show her Jaws.I made the mistake of showing my kid Gremlins when she was six and I haveheard no end of it from my old lady. She’s all, “She’s still afraid ofGremlins.” Gremlins is a harmless f–king movie.JFK (1991, 84% Tomatometer)Brilliant writing. Brilliant performances. Fantastic editing. That isthe most well-edited film I have ever seen in my life. I like a lot of OliverStone stuff in general.AMan for All Seasons (1966, 85% Tomatometer)A Man For All Seasons is basically porn for people who love dialogue.Paul Scofield’s brilliant performance. Robert Shaw’s equally brilliant performanceas Henry the VII. It’s always appealed to me. I was 13 years old the first timeI saw it. Absolutely fell in love with it because it’s wall-to-wall languagewith compelling performances. And [it’s] about something to me, in terms that Iwas raised Catholic. So Thomas Moore’s decision to not sign the oath ofsuccession appealed to me as I was growing up because this is a dude who’smartyred for his beliefs and whatnot.And people will always compare that movieto The Crucible for some reason. But I never felt the same connection to TheCrucible because in that instance John Procter is just going to greatlengths to try to keep his name. Whereas Thomas Moore went to great lengths tokeep, what he felt was his soul, intact. By taking that oath it would’ve beenselling out on his soul, it would’ve been lying. He couldn’t do it and I alwaysfound that insanely admirable and the life one wants to emulate to some degree,without being crazy Catholic at the same time.Do theRight Thing (1989, 100% Tomatometer)Spike Lee’s finest movie. One of the movies that made me want to getinto the movies as well. I knew I was never going to make Do the Right Thing, todo what he did with cinema and tell a story comedically but also dramatically.Very intense. That movie goes from a fun comedy — I don’t know if you cansay fun comedy, but it’s a funny comedy — to a dramatic shift in tone. It’s aslow burn. You don’t notice it when it happens. It comes out of left field butit’s keeping in what has come before. You realize how masterfully it’s puttogether.That movie informed Clerks to a large degree: it takes place all inone day, in one particular block, in one very specific city. So that was themodel I used for Clerks. So much so that the original version of Clerks Dantegets killed because I was like, “I want to do something like that.” Then Irealized I’m not Spike Lee.The LastTemptation of Christ (1988, 81% Tomatometer)I was raised Catholic and I still consider myself a fairly spiritualperson even though I have a hard time identifying with most Christians in thiscountry. But I still maintain a belief in God and in Jesus, and that gets triedon a daily basis. The older I get, the wiser I get, the tougher it is to believein a divine power or whatnot. So that movie appeals to me on that level alone.To take it beyond, it’s just a fantastic Martin Scorsese picture. Greatperformances in it. The first portrayal of Christ where I was, “Wow, this mightbe what it was like.” He wasn’t a guy of all beatitude and perfection. He was aman, first and foremost, who just happened to be the son of God.Our interview withKevin Smith continues as we discuss the MPAA, the process of movie appeals, andmaking comedies during a Judd Apatow era.NowZack and Miri Make a Porno is a really sweet movie.KS: Thank you.Jersey Girl is also a really sweet movie, but the reaction wasn’tquite-KS: [Laughs.] No, not nearly as good.With Judd Apatow’s productions currently the standard bearersof American comedy, do you think people are now more receptive to this mix ofvulgarity and sweetness?KS: Absolutely. It felt like once 40 Year OldVirgin did over $100 million, suddenly it made the type of movie that Imake, the kind that mixes vulgar stuff with sentimental stuff, or raunchy stuffwith sweet stuff, viable. Economically viable. For years, I felt any movie thatmixed raunch and sweetness couldn’t make more than $30 million. It was the bestwe’ve ever done.It was a niche thing.KS: Totally. Absolute niche. Judd blows the ceiling out,crashes through the glass ceiling, makes over $100 million with 40 Year OldVirgin, Knocked Up, and Superbad, and suddenly it proves thatgenre viable. So, that to me was a blessing. I’m like, “Right on.” Now I cantotally make Zack and Miri Make a Porno without having it on a $200,000budget on a 50 screen release.Seth Rogen and Elizabeth Banks.Has Zack and Miri‘s MPAA process given you a newenthusiasm to do [upcoming horror project] Red State?KS: [Laughs.] I don’t take as much umbrage with theMPAA fiasco, if you will, as everyone else. Like everyone else wants to scream“censorship” the minute it happens. I don’t feel that way because they’re notsaying, “Cut it or it don’t go out.” They’re saying, “If you want your rating,the rating you want, you’re gonna have to make some changes.” So I wouldmuch rather deal with one governing body than deal with it on a state-by-statebasis, which is what it was before the creation of the MPAA. A movie thatplayed in New York might not play in Texas, because that state’s censors couldshoot it down. And I assure you, if we were going state by state, I don’t thinkany of my movies would have played in Texas at this point.So I’m glad there’s only one body you have to deal withthat governs the entire country and how we view movies, as opposed to 50.They’re also fairly generous, and as much as it’s a pain in the ass, they dogive you the option to appeal. Like, you know, they’ll tell you what yourrating is, and they’ll tell you what you need to look at if you want to reachthe rating you want via cuts.Or they give you this last bite at the apple, which theyreally don’t have to do. Like, if I was in charge of the MPAA, I’d be like “F–kyou, the rating is the rating. Either cut or accept that rating.” But they giveyou this alternative, where you can actually go and flip it. Go above theirheads to a third party altogether, and I think that’s kinda generous, man. Thefact that they do that at all.I mean, to me, it is what it is. At the end of the day,it’s part of the business. If you want to be in this business, you have to bewilling to play that game. And you know, the key is finding a way to play thegame where it works in your favor. And so far we’ve gotten lucky. Three timesI’ve gone to the appeals process; three times we’ve flipped it without having tomake any cuts.Clerks for one.KS: Clerks. Jersey Girl they gave anR rating initially. I had to flip it to a PG-13. Clerks 2, first time wesubmitted it: R. That’s why I never thought we’d have problems on Zack andMiri because I’m like, “Nothing in this movie is nearly as outrageous as thedonkey show in Clerks 2. If they let that pass, this should be fine.” Iwas wrong.How does the appeals process work?KS: There’s a bunch of people that work on theratings board. I don’t know if they all watch every single movie or if theyjust use this many people and they rotate it or something.First, you go before the ratings board. They watch themovie, they give you your rating. Then you could either choose to work with theratings board, try to cut it to get to your rating, or you go to the appealsprocess. The appeals process is made up of an audience that has no ratingsboard members on it. There are MPAA members in the audience, people who work inthe studio system or whatnot, members of the Motion Picture Association, butthey’re not ratings board members. The other half of the audience is made up ofmembers of NATO, the National Association of Theater Owners. I’ve always feltthat those members of NATO should be what the ratings board is made up of.Craig Robinson and Seth Rogen.Because they’re the ones who exhibit the movie.KS: They are the last line of defense. They’re theones that deal with the public on a regular basis. So a guy who owns a movietheater, an exhibitor, can tell you precisely what will get a person on theirfeet, out of the theater, asking for a refund. And that’s an opinion I trustmore than some nebulous body with people who may or may not be parents ofchildren who are of a young age.Anyways, the appeals screening is made up of those membersof the audience. What you do is you screen the movie for them, and then you asthe filmmaker get up and you get 15 minutes to make an argument for why you feelthe movie should be rated R as opposed to NC-17. Then Joan Graves, who is thehead of the ratings board, gets up and she does 15 minutes as to why she feelsthe movie is NC-17. Then you get 10 minutes to rebut her, and she gets10 minutes to rebut you. Then you two leave the room, and people take a secretballot. That’s how it all works. And you have to win by 2/3 majority. Youcan’t win by one vote. So we had 14 people in our screening. If eight of themhad voted for us, we would have lost. We had to have 2/3, so we wound upwinning 10-4.Zack and Miri’s film crew.Now after getting the R rating, people are takingissue with the posters.KS: It’s weird. After we won the appeal, it feltlike the MPAA got a little more stringent with our marketing materials. Like,they started kicking back our posters and potential trailers. We had done abunch of behind-the-scenes shorts on Clerks 2 and put them up on theInternet and ran them for almost 6 months in advance of the movie. Never oncehad to approve them through anybody. We do what we want, because it’s theInternet, and who governs the Internet?We were gonna do [the shorts] again [for Zack and Miri,and] this time around, the MPAA told us that we couldn’t run without gettingthem approved by the MPAA first. The MPAA’s manifest is they have approval overall movies and of signatory members of the MPAA. A studio has to be a signatoryMPAA member [and] most studios are. All of them are, as a matter of fact. But[the MPAA] also governs the marketing material. So in the same way that they’relike, “We can tell you what can go in a trailer that plays on TV, we can alsotell you these can or cannot be played on the Internet.” And that’s the firsttime I’ve ever encountered that.Suddenly, after years of ignoring the Internet, they’re nowpaying attention. So all those [shorts] had to get rated through them as well,and that was kind of weird. They were insisting that we install an age gate onthe site. An age gate is ridiculous. Anybody can beat an age gate. You don’teven have to be Einstein to beat an age gate. You’re just f–king picking adate that makes you 18 or older. And in a world where you can jump to a pornosite and watch a 15-second mpeg of people f–king without clicking an age gate,how are you protecting people from anything, you know? It’s like, this movie isa comedy. It’s not true porn, you know. All the f–king is fake, and silly atthat. What about the real porn over here? But they’re like, “We’re not incharge of that. We’re only in charge of movies.” Because no parent calls up the MPAA to say, like, “My kid saw something weird on largelabia.com.”I’ll be honest with you, I’m shocked they’ve let it go aslong as they have. The one thing I’m really terrified about is when they startrating the extras on a DVD. So far, people have left that alone. Jersey Girlwas a PG-13 movie. Those two commentary tracks are R, if not worse. And some ofthe features we had on it were definitely not PG-13-friendly. So for yearsyou’ve been able to do that. I’m scared that one day those cats are gonna startturning on home video as well and being like, “We have to rate all the extras onthe disc.” So you could conceivably have a PG movie with R-rated extras. So aslong as they leave that alone, I’m fine.Largely, I don’t make PG-13 movies, so it doesn’t matter.If most of my [DVD extra] content was rated R, the movies are usually rated R,so I’m okay with it. But, you know, [a potential MPAA crackdown] will preventthings like that Jersey Girl commentary track from happening. Which, youknow, let’s be honest, wouldn’t be the worst thing in the world. It wouldn’t bethe collapse of the American infrastructure. But it is kinda vexing.Zack and Miri Make a Porno opens in theaters this Friday.Want more 5 Favorite Films?

Director Jimmy HaywardHorton Hears a Who! co-director Jimmy Hayward shares his essential cartoon quintet.by RT Staff | March 10, 2008 |  Comments“This is weird for me because I’ve spent so much of my life studying live action films. I love animation but I’m not one of those guys who can watch traditional Disney movies over and over. I’ll blow the needle off my princess-ometer if I do. I love those pictures, I just don’t go back to the well that often. I was always a Looney Tunes kid anyway. This is also difficult because I’m such a film nerd and I just can’t decide! Here goes nothin’!” — Horton Hears a Who Director Jimmy Hayward.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1) The Jungle Book“This picture is amazing. The design, the voice performances, and most of all the character animation is astoundingly accomplished. Frank and Ollie were at the height of their ability to exercise their extraordinary talents and animated huge chunks of the movie. Shere Khan is amazing, and Kaa is so fun to watch because he’s such an appealing villain.2) Toy StoryThis was the first picture I ever worked on and the one I learned the most from. John Lasseter is an amazing director and I was a wide eyed little punker who was lucky enough to watch him work every day. (John drove a Honda then, now he literally has a Nascar!) I got the chance to animate Buzz Lightyear for %#$@’s sake! Seriously though, it’s an incredible story with amazing characters and the amazing comedy talents of Andrew Stanton and late great Joe Ranft flowing out of it. After working on Toy Story I just assumed that’s how it was done.3) AkiraI love this picture because it showed me at a very young age the scope an animated movie could have. It also inspired me to look deeper into this genre and the different filmmakers working in it. I loved the graphic novels and it was the first time I saw a comic book translated to the big screen. It unspooled at a second run by my house and I saw it a TON of times. I also believe this is why I own a red Japanese motorcycle that goes really really fast. AKIRA HUUUUH?!&nbsp;4) Iron GiantBrad Bird is a triple badass. That’s all there is to it. I would have said Incredibles but I watched Giant more. It was so ground breaking with the mixed media. Great story, great characters, good heart, super smooth filmmaking AND Christopher McDonald is in it and I love him. Too bad they marketed a bunch of other movies that year. Good thing there’s life after death on DVD.&nbsp;5) Heavy MetalDon’t shoot! I know this picture is corny and sexist but nobody loves the whole “She-warrior in an iron bikini riding a snow leopard over her smited bloody fallen foes” more than me. You need to understand what a true cheese dealer I am. Heavy Metal is nothing if not living, breathing boogie van art. And what’s wrong with that? John Candy as Den of Earth?! Oh Canada! It came out when I was very young and I watched it a million times. It made me look at animation a whole other way and it had Black Sabbath in it! Dio AND Black Sabbath! So Rad!”See what Pixar, anime and Heavy Metal influences come through in Jimmy Hayward and Steve Martino’s co-directing debut, Horton Hears a Who!, starring Jim Carrey, Steve Carell, and Seth Rogen, in theaters this Friday.Click image to watch the Horton trailers!","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"CNN, drama, YouTube, Premiere, Chilling, Masterpiece, Games, TruTV, Wars, Pop, Fox, women","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2008/03/Jimmy-Hayward.jpg","slug":"five-favorite-animated-films-with-horton-hears-a-who-director-jimmy-hayward"},{"id":"47508878989901","title":"The Path Season 2, Rosemary’s Baby, and More Available to Stream This Week","content":"Now Streamingvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})The Path Season 2, Rosemary's Baby, and More Available to Stream This Weekby RT Staff | January 24, 2017 |  CommentsThis week on streaming video, we’ve got some a popular Hulu original series, a horror classic, some well-received TV on Netflix, a handful of worthy older films, and some brand new titles on FandangoNOW, including a pair of Oscar nominees (announced just this morning).
