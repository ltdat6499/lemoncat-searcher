Also opening well was the new horror hit Sinister in third as the overall marketplace was once again sharply ahead of last year’s grosses for a third straight weekend.Audiences powered Taken 2 into the top spot again as the kidnapping hit grossed an estimated $22.5M in its sophomore frame pushing the ten-day tally to a strong $86.8M. The Fox release played like a typical action sequel falling 55% from its better-than-expected $49.5M debut. The decline was far greater than the 17% dip that its predecessor enjoyed in February 2009, but that was a leggy sleeper hit that moviegoers found over time thanks to sensational word-of-mouth. Taken 2 is on track to finish its domestic run with $135-140M which would put it just shy of the $145M of Taken. This is the first time Neeson has ever been the solo anchor of a number one hit over back-to-back weekends.Audiences around the world continued to line up for the actor’s special set of skills as Taken 2 grossed an estimated $41M from international markets for a global weekend of $63.5M. The sequel has amassed $132.8M overseas and a stellar $219.6M worldwide to date.Ben Affleck’s hostage thriller Argo enjoyed a solid debut in second place with an estimated $20.1M from 3,232 theaters for a good $6,225 average. The R-rated film based on the true story of a CIA agent’s covert operation into Iran to rescue Americans in hiding during the hostage crisis won top marks from both film critics and paying audiences alike. Reviews were glowing across the board and audiences polled by CinemaScore gave a rare A+ grade which bodes well for the film’s long-term playability. Set in the aftermath of the 1979 attack on the U.S. embassy in Tehran, Argo skewed extremely old and more female. Studio research showed that a whopping 74% of the audience was over age 35 and 54% were women. Bryan Cranston, Alan Arkin, and John Goodman acted along with Affleck who played the lead.Argo did not reach the heights of Affleck’s last film The Town – another critically acclaimed drama with Oscar buzz released in the fall. That one, also released by Warner Bros., opened to $23.8M and a $8,322 average in September 2010 on its way to a $92.2M final. Despite being showered with awards buzz at the time of its release, it failed to earn a Best Picture Oscar nomination which many industry experts predicted it would earn. With its more contemporary story and younger cast, Town played a bit younger. Argo could find itself with better legs thanks to its older audience plus it seems likely to score more points with Academy voters. Argo’s pro-America theme should continue to play well at the box office during this election season with all types of voters and the next two weekends will offer very little direct competition so solid holds are likely.The new fright flick Sinister scared up the best opening for any horror film in ten months and placed third for the frame with an estimated $18.3M. The Summit title released by new owner Lionsgate averaged a stellar $7,222 from 2,527 theaters and was even the number one movie in the country on opening day beating Taken 2 by $425,000 on Friday before taking a drop on Saturday while all other films saw gains. The R-rated chiller stars Ethan Hawke but was sold more on its behind-the-scenes team with materials promoting that it was from the makers of the wildly successful Paranormal Activity films and Insidious.That helped the well-reviewed Sinister post big numbers upfront but grosses fell 8% on Saturday and the C+ CinemaScore grade indicates the usual fast-burning horror road ahead – especially with Paranormal Activity 4 opening this Thursday night starting with 9:00pm shows on both conventional and IMAX screens. Exit polls indicated a young adult audience as 67% of the crowd was in the 18-34 age range while 54% was male. Sinister beat out recent openings for horror titles like August’s The Possession ($17.7M) and September’s House at the End of the Street ($12.3M).Sony claimed the next two spots with a hit and a miss. The animated comedy Hotel Transylvania collected an estimated $17.3M in its third weekend, down 36%, pushing the cume past the century mark to $102.2M. It’s now the 13th $100M+ domestic grosser for Adam Sandler over the past 14 years. Though not sold as a Sandler vehicle, the spooky toon features the comedian voicing the main character Dracula. With Halloween still more than two weeks away, Hotel should continue to thrive at the box office and surpass $140M.The funnyman’s I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry co-star Kevin James stumbled with his new broad comedy Here Comes the Boom which opened in fifth with an estimated $12M from 3,014 locations for a lukewarm $3,981 average. The PG-rated pic about a teacher who enters Mixed Martial Arts to earn money for his school played to a mixed crowd of families and general audiences and with a male skew. Reviews were mostly negative, though critical comments generally play a small role in the commercial playability of movies like these. Boom was produced by Sandler’s Happy Madison production company and directed by Frank Coraci (The Wedding Singer, The Waterboy). On the bright side, it earned a good A grade from CinemaScore though that does not guarantee legs in the weeks ahead.In its second weekend of wide play, the college comedy Pitch Perfect dropped a reasonable 37% to an estimated $9.3M for a cume to date of $36.1M for Universal. The hold was certainly good, but not too impressive considering the very high exit polls it got from audiences. Still, the $17M production should finish up as a nice moneymaker in the $60M range before overseas and other ancillaries are factored in.Disney’s stop-motion toon Frankenweenie fell by 39% in its sophomore round to an estimated $7M – another good but not exceptional hold for a quality film. The Tim Burton creation has grossed $22M in ten days and may be headed for a disappointing $40M final. The sci-fi pic Looper got hit hard falling 48% to an estimated $6.3M giving Sony $51.4M to date.Competition for adult audiences proved to be too fierce this weekend for the well-reviewed crime saga Seven Psychopaths which opened poorly in ninth place with just $4.3M, according to estimates. The CBS release averaged a weak $2,889 from 1,480 playdates and will have a hard time as it tries to expand in two weeks to more of the country. Studio research showed that 62% of the audience was male and 71% was over 25. The CinemaScore was a decent B+. With Taken 2, Argo, and Looper to choose from, the target audience for Psychopaths found more high profile options to go with. Christopher Walken, Colin Farrell, and Woody Harrelson led the ensemble cast for the R-rated film.The indie drama The Perks of Being a Wallflower starring Harry Potter’s Emma Watson jumped into the top ten in its national expansion grossing an estimated $2.2M putting it in tenth place. The Summit film widened from 221 to 726 locations and witnessed its per-theater average drop to a mild $2,983. Total to date is $6.2M.Audiences rejected the Ayn Rand story Atlas Shrugged Part II which debuted outside the top ten despite a wide release in 1,012 theaters grossing an estimated $1.7M for a dismal $1,700 average. The opening weekend gross was identical to the bow that Part I generated in April 2011 however that one was released in less than one third of the theaters with only 299 sites for a more solid $5,640 average. Part II was backed by a larger investment into marketing and distribution but fans mostly ignored it.The top ten films grossed an estimated $119.2M which was up a hefty 64% from last year when Real Steel remained at number one with $16.3M; and up a scant 2% from 2010 when Jackass 3D opened on top with a then-record $50.4M.","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"CBS, on, criterion, Swim, History, TV, adaptation, ghosts, league, IFC, on, Grant","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-WrapupCIA-Super-Spies-Take-Top-Two-Spots"},{"id":"47509036325890","title":"Video: Dating Advice from the Cast of How To Be Single","content":"Video Interviewsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Video: Dating Advice from the Cast of How To Be Singleby Matt Atchity | February 10, 2016 |  CommentsRT’s&nbsp;Editor-In-Chief, Matt Atchity, spoke to the cast of How To Be Single (Dakota Johnson, Alison Brie, Rebel Wilson, Leslie Mann, Anders Holm, Jake Lacy, and Damon Wayans Jr.) about what&nbsp;heartfelt dating advice they have for his 12-year old son.

That is in no way meant to be a slight on its quality. After all, we are talking about a film with a 97% on the Tomatometer, a number reached — or surpassed — by only four other films that received a launch in over 3,700 theaters – Paddington 2, Mission: Impossible – Fallout, and Black Panther. Not bad company as audiences prepare to settle the film in for a nice run through the holiday season.King of the Crop:&nbsp;Spider-Man Swings to the Top(Photo by Sony Pictures Animation)Without looking, it would have been easy to assume that some animated title would have&nbsp;a massive opening this month. Most&nbsp;of them tend to get out early before the Thanksgiving holiday, which opened the door for&nbsp;Sing&nbsp;to grab the top spot for an animated film with a $35.2 million back in December of 2016. Now the mantle has been taken by Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse with a $36 million opening. Films opening between $30-40 million this month have averaged a final haul of $171 million. Sing’s $250 million is a big part of that, as is last year’s Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle, which finished with over $400 million. Scott Derrickson’s The Day the Earth Stood Still remake in 2008 is the only one to finish with less than $100 million ($79.3 million, to be precise). Spider-Verse&nbsp;will have some challengers opening this week, but this is still likely to be a top choice over at least one of them in the long run. Only the Hotel Transylvania films have opened better for Sony in their animation department, though if Spider-Verse can best the aforementioned average, it will pass all of them to become their biggest success to date.Rotten Returns:&nbsp;Mortal Engines Nearly Hits Bottom of Exclusive List(Photo by Universal Pictures)There is no way around the Mortal Engines numbers. They are abysmal, and we’re not talking about just the 28% it received on the Tomatometer. It has joined the list of&nbsp;bottom five December films opening in 3,000 theaters, a list that now looks like this:The Nativity Story ($7.8 million), Mortal Engines ($7.5), Collateral Beauty ($7.10 million), Walking with Dinosaurs ($7.09), The Wild Thornberrys ($6.0)Thanks to the holiday season playing out the way it does, those other films finished between $31 and $40.1 million. Mortal Engines, however, is the most expensive among them, with a budget of $100 million (Walking with Dinosaurs cost $80 million). Suggesting that this is the flop of the year might make for juicy headlines, but it simply is not the case. Mortal Engines could have made two cents this weekend and both A Wrinkle in Time and Solo: A Star Wars Story would have lost more money. It is not even the worst domestic opening vs. its overall production budget. In other words, yes, it is bad and it is a bit embarrassing, but look at the broader picture.The Peter Jackson production could still be saved with a decent international haul (it has made $19.3 million so far). But it shows the peril of trying to mount an expensive fantasy production in this day and age that did not come from the mind of George Lucas or the pages of comic books. Even adaptations such as John Carter, Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets, and Ghost in the Shell&nbsp;failed to&nbsp;generate enough interest with American audiences. Universal has also had their issues over the years (including 1995’s Waterworld) with failed attempts at&nbsp;Robin Hood&nbsp;(2010) &amp; Peter Pan&nbsp;(2003), but also more recently with 47 Ronin, Cowboys &amp; Aliens, The Great Wall, and their attempts at reimagining or rebooting their classic monster series (Van Helsing, The Wolfman, and The Mummy). Universal has had an otherwise solid year with big hits like&nbsp;Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom, Halloween, and Fifty Shades Freed&nbsp;(see a pattern?), but they are likely preparing Mortal Engines to join Pacific Rim Uprising and Skyscraper in the red column for 2018.The Top 10 and Beyond:&nbsp;Eastwood Has One of His Best Draws;&nbsp;Aquaman Gets a Head Start(Photo by Claire Folger/Warner Bros.)Clint Eastwood is in front of the camera for the first time since 2012’s Trouble with the Curve this weekend, and despite Warner Bros. almost going out of their way not to campaign the film for awards and keep it from critics as long as possible, it still managed to squeak by with a score of 63%. The $17.2 million opening for The Mule (63%) is actually Eastwood’s third best of any movie he’s starred in. Space Cowboys opened to $18 million in 2000 and Gran Torino, after four weeks of playing in less than 100 screens, exploded to a $29.4 million weekend in January 2009. Since 1990, 23 films have opened in December between $16-20 million and ten of them reached $100 million (four of which were R-rated Best Picture nominees, including&nbsp;Jerry Maguire, The Green Mile, and The Wolf of Wall Street). We will know better next week whether it can come close to the $90.6 million average final gross of those 23 films or even join Gran Torino, In the Line of Fire, Unforgiven, and Million Dollar Baby as Clint’s $100 million star vehicles.Meanwhile, Illumination’s The Grinch continues to forge a path to over $270 million with the smallest drop in the Top Ten (23%);&nbsp;Ralph Breaks the Internet has officially fallen behind it on the chart. Disney’s sequel has nearly an identical haul to Bohemian Rhapsody in its first 26 days, and it should still have enough in the tank to at least match the original’s $189 million gross. That Queen movie, though, remains the WOW of the holiday box office with nearly $609 million worldwide. Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald is not far behind with $575 million, though both are likely to be eclipsed by Mary Poppins Returns and Aquaman, which has already grossed over $263 million internationally.The PG-13 alternate cut of&nbsp;Deadpool 2, Once Upon a Deadpool, has grossed $3.8 million since it opened on Wednesday. Fox nearly made as much this weekend with The Favourite (just $30,000 less than Deadpool) and its total is up to $6.7 million after expanding into 439 theaters. Barry Jenkins’ adaptation of If Beale Street Could Talk is opening to $219,174 in just four theaters. Its $54,794 per-theater average is the fifth best of 2018 after Suspiria ($92,019), Eighth Grade ($65.949), Isle of Dogs ($60,011), and Avengers: Infinity War ($57,599)This Time Last Year:&nbsp;Everybody Went to See&nbsp;The Last Jedi(Photo by Walt Disney Studios)Star Wars: The Last Jedi had the second largest opening weekend of all-time with $220 million. It became the sixth highest-grossing film of all time. (It is now 8th thanks to Black Panther and Avengers: Infinity War this year.) Fox’s animated Ferdinand was a very decent second with $13.4 million while Coco was passing the $150 million mark. The remainder of the top ten grossed a grand total of $47.1 million, but thanks to the power of the Force, last year’s haul beat this weekend’s take $267.1 million to $102.8 million. With five films at over 90% on the Tomatometer, last year’s Top Ten averaged 74.4% while this year’s is currently averaging 65%.On the vine:&nbsp;Mary Poppins and&nbsp;Aquaman Hoping to Lead Holiday Box Office(Photo by Warner Bros.)A busy week is descending upon your local theater. Mary Poppins Returns heads into theaters on Wednesday; it may lose the battle for the weekend when Aquaman opens two days later, but could ultimately win the war for the top spot at the holiday box office. Transformers prequel/reboot/more-family-friendly adventure&nbsp;Bumblebee&nbsp;could end up being the most liked film in the series&nbsp;by critics but the least successful one to boot. Jennifer Lopez returns on screen for the first time since 2015 in Second Act, and Universal is taking a somewhat limited approach to Robert Zemeckis’ Welcome to Marwen with Steve Carell, based on the true-life inspiration of the documentary, Marwencol. Also on Monday, look for Peter Jackson’s WWII documentary, They Shall Not Grow Old.The Full Top 10: December 14-16Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse&nbsp;–&nbsp;$35.4&nbsp;million ($35.4 million total)The&nbsp;Mule&nbsp;–&nbsp;$17.2&nbsp;million ($17.2 million total)The Grinch&nbsp;–&nbsp;$11.5 million ($239.2 million total)Ralph Breaks the Internet –&nbsp;$9.5 million ($154.4 million total)Mortal Engines – $7.5 million ($7.5 million total)Creed II –&nbsp;$5.3 million ($104.8 million total)Bohemian Rhapsody&nbsp;–&nbsp;$4.1 million ($180.4 million total)Instant Family&nbsp;–&nbsp;$3.7 million ($60.2 million total)Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald –&nbsp;$3.6 million ($151.6 million total)Green&nbsp;Book&nbsp;–&nbsp;$2.7 million ($24.6 million total)Erik Childress can be heard each week evaluating box office on WGN Radio with Nick Digilio as well as on Business First AM with Angela Miles and his Movie Madness Podcast.[box office figures via Box Office Mojo]","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"Video, anime, DC, Broadway, YouTube, The, YA, HBO, Tumblr, kids, nbcuniversal, action","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/16123831/Spider-Verse-BO-Rep.jpg","slug":"weekend-box-office-results-spider-verse-scores-largest-opening-for-a-december-animated-release"},{"id":"47509090584035","title":"Weekend Box Office Results: Ralph Breaks the Internet Breaks Box Office Again with $25.8 Million","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Weekend Box Office Results: Ralph Breaks the Internet Breaks Box Office Again with $25.8 MillionPlus, Creed II fights on, The Favourite continues limited dream run, and there's no stopping Bohemian Rhapsody on the November 30-December 2 weekend.by Erik Childress | December 2, 2018 |  CommentsRalph Breaks the Internet&nbsp;had&nbsp;only one real challenge this week and it came from, well, the Internet, with Netflix releasing the Andy Serkis-directed&nbsp;Mowgli&nbsp;in a handful of theaters before it is released on the platform on December 7. Given that the streaming giant does not disclose pesky numbers like box office performance, we don’t know how the film did – though it’s split critics down the middle, with a 50% Tomatometer score. Still, we don’t need Netflix’s numbers to know that&nbsp;Ralph&nbsp;remained king of the box office for another weekend – and may be set to do it all again next week.King of the&nbsp;New Crop:&nbsp;Ralph&nbsp;Drops, But Remains On Top – And on Pace to Pass the Original(Photo by © Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures)Ralph Breaks the Internet had a near record-setting Thanksgiving. (We won’t get into the semantics over Frozen again.) And it is on top again this weekend with $25.8 million. With $119 million in the bank after 12 days, that puts it on par with both Moana and Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa, when it comes to November releases,&nbsp;which each had between $119 and $120 million at this point in their runs.&nbsp;Moana made $28.2 million in its post-Thanksgiving weekend and went on to make over $248 million. Ralph is in a similarly favorable position, though with nothing to challenge it next week. (Moana beat Office Christmas Party $18.5-to-$16.8 million in week three.) Barring some extreme drop-off, Ralph Breaks the Internet&nbsp;could still best Wreck-It Ralph’s $189 million finish. That film had $101 million by Day 12. The sequel’s worldwide haul is at $206 million.Rotten Returns: Horror Film&nbsp;Hannah&nbsp;Goes Mostly Ignored&nbsp;(Photo by © Screen Gems )The Possession of Hannah Grace (formerly titled, Cadaver –&nbsp;nice!) may have only cost $9.5 million, but a $6.5 million start for the film&nbsp;and a 17% on the Tomatometer is not going to put it into “sleeper” or “surprise hit” territory. That opening puts it just ahead of past November openers,&nbsp;Bad Santa 2&nbsp;and Babe: Pig in the City, which finished with $17.7 million and $18.3 million, respectively.&nbsp;A finish like that won’t be enough to cover Hannah’s minuscule budget (when you factor in marketing) but it is also nowhere near the losses of Sony’s The Girl in the Spider’s Web, which is looking to be the studio’s biggest&nbsp;disappointment of the year. Good thing it has the 100%&nbsp;Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse&nbsp;just around the corner.The Top 10 and Beyond:&nbsp;Fantastic Beasts&nbsp;Passes $500 million globally as&nbsp;Robin Hood&nbsp;Continues to Miss the Mark(Photo by © Warner Bros.)Last week’s honest-to-goodness record breaker, Creed II (a.k.a. the highest live-action Thanksgiving opening ever) is ahead of the pace of 2008’s&nbsp;Four Christmases&nbsp;at the moment, which&nbsp;puts its estimated finishing haul at about $125 million. Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald is already at $134 million, but that puts it behind the first Twilight film and Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa on the 17-day chart; neither of&nbsp;those films hit the $200 million mark. Nevertheless, it is the&nbsp;15th&nbsp;film this year to pass the half-billion mark at the worldwide box office, with $519 million so far. The next to cross that list will be Bohemian Rhapsody, and if you had bet on it grossing more domestically than Fantastic Beasts this season, you would have broken the bank in Vegas. But that is what’s shaping up here with the&nbsp;Queen biopic&nbsp;making $164 million after 31 days and just over&nbsp;$3 million separating them this weekend. Bohemian&nbsp;Rhapsody has a current worldwide total of&nbsp;$493 million.Illumination’s The Grinch is still the current champ of the season and does not look to be challenged until Mary Poppins Returns attempts to claim the crown. It joined the $200 million club on its 24th&nbsp;day, which has actually put it ahead of Ron Howard’s How the Grinch Stole Christmas – that film had $195.6 million by this stage in its run. The lowest-grossing November release to&nbsp;earn $190 million at this point in its run was&nbsp;Justice League, which left theaters&nbsp;with $229 million. We’re still liking a final estimate between $240 million and $250 million for The Grinch.Over on the disappointment side, we have Instant Family. The film looks like it may stretch itself to $60 million after a lackluster start, but without some international help it is going to come down on the red side of its $48 million budget. This&nbsp;despite&nbsp;being surprisingly well received by critics – it’s Certified Fresh at 82%.&nbsp;Widows cost $42 million and is just passing $33 million this weekend. Meanwhile, Universal might have been wise to expand the National Board of Review’s Best Picture of 2018, Green Book, further than just a couple theaters this weekend; instead it rests in 1,065 venues and dropped 26% to $4.1 million and a total of $14 million.(Photo by © Lionsgate)None of those disappointments compares to Lionsgate’s Robin Hood&nbsp;which, short of a forthcoming international haul (it’s made $26.3 million overseas so far), is shaping up to join&nbsp;the year’s $100 million-budget under-performers&nbsp;A Wrinkle in Time, Solo: A Star Wars Story, and The Nutcracker and the Four Realms.In limited-release news, The Favourite expanded into 34 theaters and made another $1.1 million, giving it the top per-theater-average for a second straight week with $32,500 per screen. In second place on that list is Anna and the Apocalypse (Certified Fresh at 84%) which made $50,163 in five theaters for a decent, if unspectacular, $10,033 average. Then Hirokazu Kore-eda’s Shoplifters, which is scoring 99% on the Tomatometer, had the third best average after grossing $106,000 in 14 theaters.This Time Last Year:&nbsp;Coco&nbsp;and&nbsp;Shape of Water&nbsp;Dominate Wide and Limited Markets(Photo by © Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures)A24 opened The Disaster Artist in 19 theaters to $1.2 million and Paramount put Titanic back into 87 theaters for its&nbsp;20th&nbsp;Anniversary. It made $438,602. But it was Coco again taking the top spot with $27.5 million for $110.1 million on its 12th&nbsp;day. It went on to finish with $209.7 million. Justice League was still a couple of days away from hitting $200 million. Plus, eventual Best Picture winner, The Shape of Water, began its run with the highest per-theater-average on the chart, making $166,564 in just two theaters.On the vine: Oscar Season is&nbsp;On(Photo by Liam Daniel / @ Focus Features)Speaking of re-releasing Oscar winners, Steven Spielberg’s Schindler’s List will be in theaters for its 25th&nbsp;anniversary.

The Marvel smash dropped only 34% to an estimated $27M to lead all films and boosted its domestic cume to a towering $605.4M in the process.Black Panther became the second fastest film in history to break the $600M mark doing it in just 31 days. Only Star Wars: The Force Awakens did it faster needing twelve days in 2015. Compared to the other biggest comic book movies ever after the same number of days, the T’Challa adventure is running 10% ahead of Avengers, 29% ahead of The Dark Knight, and 42% ahead of Avengers: Age of Ultron. By next weekend, Black Panther should surpass Star Wars: The Last Jedi and Avengers to rank number five on the list of all-time domestic blockbusters.Overseas, Panther suffered a disturbing second weekend crash in China. Though Hollywood movies often fall big there on the sophomore frame, the Wakanda hit tumbled by an enormous 81% from its big debut last weekend. International markets together grossed $30M this weekend lifting the offshore total to a sturdy $577.1M led by China’s $96M in ten days. Black Panther has amassed a powerful $1.18 billion worldwide to date and looks on track to finish up at about $1.3 billion which is far greater than any had expected when this year began.Opening in second place, which is the best any recent film could ask for, was Tomb Raider from Warner Bros. and MGM which debuted to an estimated $23.5M. The PG-13 reboot of the video game franchise averaged a respectable $6,104 from 3,854 locations and carried a production cost reportedly near $100M.Compared to the 2001 film Lara Croft: Tomb Raider starring Angelina Jolie, the new action pic opened 51% smaller and sold about 68% fewer tickets on opening weekend. The older Lara bowed to $47.7M which was the second best opening for a non-sequel during that summer of 2001, and its 2003 sequel opened to $21.8M closing out that chapter for this movie franchise.Alicia Vikander headlined the new Tomb Raider which earned mixed feelings from film critics. Studio data showed that the crowd was 56% male and 68% over 25. Those that came out were moderately satisfied as evidenced by the B grade from CinemaScore. With Black Panther still energizing the action crowd there was only so much business to be had, and next weekend’s Pacific Rim Uprising will provide plenty of direct competition on the sophomore frame.Tomb Raider attracted much more business overseas which is where the bulk of the grosses will come for this action entry. The reboot did an estimated $84.5M with nearly half of that coming from China’s big $41.1M debut which easily beat the American launch. Many Hollywood action movies, especially older properties, open bigger in China than in the U.S. The international cume is $102.5M putting the global gross at $126M with Japan set to open later this week. Getting near the $300M mark by the end of the global run is certainly a possibility as domestic may account for only 20% of the final tally.Shattering expectations to become the third most popular movie nationwide this weekend was the faith-based hit I Can Only Imagine which debuted to an estimated $17.1M despite playing in the fewest theaters of any movie in the top ten. The PG-rated film averaged a stellar $10,476 from 1,629 locations and posted by far the best per-theater average of any wide release this weekend. Released by Lionsgate and Roadside Attractions, Imagine played to an audience that was 67% female and 80% over 35. With a glowing A+ grade from CinemaScore plus the Easter holiday coming up soon, this uplifting film is looking at a promising – and profitable – road ahead.Disney’s big-budget fantasy A Wrinkle in Time tumbled 50% in its second weekend to an estimated $16.6M pushing the cume to $61.1M. The drop was in line with what the studio usually sees in March with its fairy tale genre films like Beauty and the Beast (-48%), Cinderella (-49%), and Oz the Great and Powerful (-48%). The final domestic gross is likely to reach about $100M.Opening well in fifth place was the teen drama Love, Simon which took in an estimated $11.5M from 2,402 locations for a solid $4,788 average. The PG-13 pic earned a great A+ grade from CinemaScore as word of mouth has been very positive which could lead to strong legs in the weeks ahead. Reviews were also positive for Fox which saw an audience that was 58% female, 59% under 25, and 59% white.The comedy Game Night has quietly become a sleeper hit this season and posted another solid hold in its fourth weekend dipping only 29% to an estimated $5.6M giving Warner Bros. a solid $54.2M to date. Also doing quite well and enjoying fantastic legs was the kidpic Peter Rabbit which eased just 23% to an estimated $5.2M boosting the cume to $102.4M. The Sony hit has now become only the second 2018 film to break $100M domestic. It will soon be followed by Fifty Shades Freed which ranks outside the top ten this weekend but has amassed $99.6M to date.Strangers: Prey at Night followed falling 54% to an estimated $4.8M giving Aviron $18.6M to date. Jennifer Lawrence was next with Red Sparrow which grossed an estimated $4.5M, down 48%, for a $39.6M cume for Fox. Rounding out the top ten was the Bruce Willis revenge pic Death Wish which collected an estimated $3.4M, off 49%, putting MGM at $30M overall.The top ten films grossed an estimated $119.1M this weekend which was down 53% from last year when Beauty and the Beast opened at number one with a March record of $174.8M; but up 3% from 2016 when Zootopia held onto the top spot in its third weekend with $37.2M.","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"YouTube, Searchlight, ABC, hard, RT, ABC, Sundance, FirstLook","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/18155019/600TombRaidr1.jpg","slug":"box-office-black-panther-fends-off-tomb-raider-for-5th-1-weekend"},{"id":"47509043081276","title":"Watch: Amy Schumer and Vanessa Bayer Guess Which Terrible Headlines Are Real","content":"Video Interviewsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Watch: Amy Schumer and Vanessa Bayer Guess Which Terrible Headlines Are Realby Sarah Ricard | July 16, 2015 |  CommentsWarning: Contains Mature ContentIn the new romantic comedy Trainwreck, Amy Schumer and Vanessa Bayer play editors at a top men’s magazine in New York City.

There were casualties of box office war as the overcrowded marketplace did not have room for all.Grossing an estimated $68.5M from Friday-to-Sunday in its second weekend,&nbsp;Last Jedi&nbsp;propelled its ten-day cume to a robust $365.1M. However, the decline of 69% was quite steep. Christmas Eve is a slower day at the box office because of last-minute holiday traveling and shopping plus many theaters close early and offer fewer showtimes. This impacts all films at the box office this Sunday and explains a portion of the&nbsp;Jedi&nbsp;drop, but also the tentpole sequel is eroding faster with much of the audience coming out upfront.Last year, Rogue One&nbsp;fell 59% on its second weekend. It would not be a fair comparison since it included both Christmas Eve and Christmas Day, a much more powerful day at the turnstiles. Between the yuletide holiday and New Year’s, every day plays like a Saturday so there is plenty of potential ahead for Jedi, and all other films too.But to examine a more appropriate comparison,&nbsp;Rogue One&nbsp;grossed $318.1M in its first 11 days which included both Christmas Eve and Christmas Day. Disney is projecting an additional $32.2M for Jedi&nbsp;on Monday’s holiday for an 11-day total of $397.3M. That would put Jedi&nbsp;at 25% above the pace of&nbsp;Rogue One&nbsp;after 11 days, even though the opening weekend was 42% bigger. And the estimated four-day holiday weekend gross of $100.7M for Jedi&nbsp;is only slightly better than the $96.1M four-day for&nbsp;Rogue One&nbsp;a year ago.Compared to The Force Awakens, Jedi&nbsp;opened 11% behind but through 11 days it will be down 30%. So the new&nbsp;Star Wars&nbsp;is slowing down its pace. Still, the road ahead sees Episode VIII breaking the $500M mark in its third weekend and possibly surpassing $550M through New Year’s Day which would make it 2017’s top-grossing blockbuster. A domestic final in the $650-675M range looks possible now.Overseas,&nbsp;The Last Jedi&nbsp;grossed an estimated $75.1M this weekend, off 67% from the opening frame. Through Sunday, the international cume is $380.3M while the worldwide tally has climbed up to $745.4M with a shot at passing the $800M barrier on Christmas night. The $1 billion mark could be cracked on Friday or Saturday with more to go including the entire China release which begins on January 5th.Sony scored a big holiday hit with the action adventure reboot&nbsp;Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle&nbsp;which opened with strength in second place grossing an estimated $34M over the Friday-to-Sunday period and $50.6M to date since its mid-week launch. That made for a muscular $9,031 average over three days from 3,765 locations. The PG-13 action comedy had broad appeal offering popcorn fun to all audiences and ticket buyers certainly connected, especially those not interested in a space adventure. Dwayne Johnson, Kevin Hart, and Jack Black provided plenty of starpower and as a bonus, reviews were quite good. That doesn’t always happen with films of this type.Studio data put the crowd at 56% male and 55% under 25. With strong audience buzz and the lucrative holidays ahead,&nbsp;Jumanji&nbsp;may break $100M by Friday surpassing the $100.5M of the Robin Williams film of the same name from 22 years ago this same month. International markets opened well too with $49.5M from 53 markets.The comedy threequel&nbsp;Pitch Perfect 3&nbsp;bowed in the number three spot with an estimated $20.5M from 3,447 locations for a $5,947 average. That amounted to less than one third of the $69.2M debut of part 2 from May 2015. Certainly Christmas Eve falling on the weekend had an impact, but for the most part, fan interest has subsided substantially. Universal was met with lackluster reviews for this PG-13 chapter which intends to close the franchise. Young women were the driving force again as studio data showed that the crowd was 69% female, 57% under 25, and 55% white. Saturday tumbled a troubling 37% from opening day (by far the most of any major film this weekend) indicating a rocky road ahead.Opening in fourth place was the Hugh Jackman musical&nbsp;The Greatest Showman&nbsp;which took in an estimated $8.6M over three days and $13.2M over the five days since its Wednesday debut. The PG-rated film averaged a mild $2,861 from 3,006 sites over the weekend period. Critics have had mixed feelings for the P.T. Barnum pic, however paying audiences are giving a thumbs up with an encouraging A CinemaScore grade. That bodes well for the school holidays ahead especially since this is not a film that audiences need to rush out and see upfront.&nbsp;Showman&nbsp;could possibly climb to the neighborhood of $50M by the time schools reopen on January 2.A pair of holdover toons followed. Fox’s&nbsp;Ferdinand&nbsp;fell 47% in its second weekend to an estimated $7.1M lifting the total to $26.5M. Disney watched its Pixar offering&nbsp;Coco&nbsp;slide 48% to an estimated $5.2M and $161.3M domestic to date with global at a solid $486.3M. Both films plan to score good daily grosses over the coming week with kids out of school.Audiences ignored Matt Damon’s new film&nbsp;Downsizing&nbsp;which opened poorly with an estimated $4.6M from 2,668 locations for a weak $1,724 average. Reviews were not very good and those who did see the R-rated film were not pleased as it earned a low C grade from CinemaScore. Studio research from Paramount showed an audience that was 51% male and 60% over 30. Awards contender&nbsp;Darkest Hour&nbsp;expanded nationally and jumped into the top ten with an estimated $4.2M from 806 sites for a good $5,149 average. Focus has banked $8.8M so far.Warner Bros. got nowhere with its R-rated comedy&nbsp;Father Figures&nbsp;which was dead on arrival with an estimated $3.2M from 2,902 sites for a poor $1,103 average. Reviews were negative and audiences had an abundant amount of other choices during this crowded frame. Expanding nationwide was one of the top Oscar contenders&nbsp;The Shape of Water&nbsp;which grossed an estimated $3.1M from 726 locations for a $4,201 average. Fox Searchlight has $7.6M and counting.Getting off to a sturdy platform start was Steven Spielberg’s acclaimed film&nbsp;The Post&nbsp;starring Meryl Streep and Tom Hanks which, to no surprise, has been generating Academy Awards buzz. The Fox release did an estimated $495,000 from just nine theaters for a stellar $55,000 average.&nbsp;Post&nbsp;goes nationwide on January 12.The top ten films grossed an estimated $158.8M which was off 4% from last year when&nbsp;Rogue One&nbsp;stayed at number one with $64M; and down 42% from 2015 when&nbsp;The Force Awakens&nbsp;remained in the top spot with&nbsp;$149.2M.Get earlier box office updates and analysis by following BoxOfficeGuru.com on&nbsp;Twitter.","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"french, video, DGA, comic, archives, Kemper, teaser, black, TCA, adaptation, Pet, indie, Hulu, 2016","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/26103310/RT_BoxOffice_last-jedi-wk-2_600X314.jpg","slug":"box-office-holiday-box-office-ruled-by-rebel-scum"},{"id":"47509043087422","title":"Video: Paul Rudd Gets His Face Licked AGAIN","content":"Video Interviewsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Video: Paul Rudd Gets His Face Licked AGAINby Grae Drake | July 15, 2015 |  CommentsMarvel’s Ant-Man interviews feature stars Paul Rudd, Michael Douglas, Evangeline Lilly, Corey Stoll, Michael Pena, David Dastmalchian, T.I., and director Peyton Reed, discussing the horror of fire ants, the glory of shoulder rolls and waffles, and of course…getting your face licked.","section":"Video Interviews","tags":"football, drama, Comic, Certified, comic, actors, watch, adventure","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Ant-Man-Paul-Rudd.jpg","slug":"video-paul-rudd-gets-his-face-licked-again"},{"id":"47509094747670","title":"Box Office: Coco Threepeats: The Calm Before The Storm","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office: Coco Threepeats: The Calm Before The StormIn yet another mostly uneventful weekend, Disney's Coco became the fourth film to threepeat at the top of the charts this yearby Sujit Chawla | December 10, 2017 |  CommentsIn yet another mostly uneventful weekend, Disney’s Coco&nbsp;became the fourth film to threepeat at the top of the charts this year while some award hopefuls debuted or expanded with big per screen averages. And there was one big flop.What do&nbsp;Split,&nbsp;The Fate of the Furious,&nbsp;The Hitman’s Bodyguard&nbsp;and Coco&nbsp;all have in common? They all led the box office for three straight weekends this year.&nbsp;Coco&nbsp;likely won’t be the last film to do it but for now the latest from Disney/Pixar once again topped the charts raking in an additional $18.3M, according to estimates, bringing its total up to $135.5M. Overseas the film added $55.3M bringing its international total to $254M and its worldwide numbers up to $390M.Leveling off a little from last weekend’s 60% decline was Justice League,&nbsp;which took in an estimated $9.6M bringing its total up to $212M. With it, Warner Brothers crossed the $2B mark this year led of course by&nbsp;Wonder Woman. Internationally,&nbsp;Justice League&nbsp;added $15.4M bringing its overseas totals to over $400M and its worldwide cume to over $610M. Weird to think that those numbers would be considered disappointing.Lionsgate remained in third place with its surprise hit of the season, Wonder, which took in an estimated $8.5M this weekend, bringing its total up over the magical $100M mark.Expanding into 840 theaters from distributor A24 was the James Franco-led The Disaster Artist&nbsp;which made an estimated $6.4M for a per screen average of $7,661, best in the top 10. With exceptional reviews and it being award season and all, the film could do pretty well over the upcoming weeks.Thor: Ragnarok slipped one spot to fifth with $6.3M, according to estimates, bringing its total up to $301M. Amazingly, that only places it 10th in the MCU out of 17 films, though it is far and away the best of the three Thor solo films. Fellow sequel Daddy’s Home 2&nbsp;took sixth place with an estimated $6M, bringing its total up to $91M after five weeks. Murder on the Orient Express&nbsp;made an estimated $5.1M this weekend, bringing its total up to $92.7M, also after five weeks.Landing in eighth place was The Star&nbsp;with an estimated $3.6M and a total cume now of $32.2M. The second A24 film on the charts was in ninth place with the acclaimed dramedy Lady Bird&nbsp;which took in an additional $3.5M, according to estimates, bringing its cume up to $22M. Both&nbsp;Lady Bird&nbsp;and&nbsp;The Disaster Artist&nbsp;have a great shot at passing&nbsp;Moonlight&nbsp;to become A24’s highest grossing film (currently at $27.8M).Debuting with disastrous results in 10th place was the action-comedy&nbsp;Just Getting Started&nbsp;starring Morgan Freeman and Tommy Lee Jones. The film made an estimated $3.1M from 2,146 theaters for a per screen average of $1,483. With a Rotten Tomatoes grade of 9%(!) and a CinemaScore of only a C, this will be streaming shortly.A bunch of award hopefuls debuted or expanded this weekend with positive results. Guillermo del Toro’s fantasy-romance The Shape of Water&nbsp;expanded to 41 theaters and took in an estimated $1.1M for a per screen average of 26,829. Best Actor frontrunner Gary Oldman’s&nbsp;Darkest Hour&nbsp;added 49 screens (bringing the total to 53) and took in $777K for a per screen average of $14,660.&nbsp;Call Me by Your Name&nbsp;continued to sizzle in limited release taking in an estimated $291K from 9 theaters for a per screen average of $32,345. And debuting on four screens with the best average on the charts was&nbsp;I, Tonya&nbsp;which raked in an estimated $245K for a per screen average of $61,401.The top ten films grossed an estimated $70.6M which was down 1.3% from last year when Moana&nbsp;stayed at number one with $18.8M; and up 6% from 2015 when Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 2&nbsp;remained in the top spot with&nbsp;$11.4M.Get earlier box office updates and analysis by following BoxOfficeGuru.com on&nbsp;Twitter.","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"Marathons, we, Sci-Fi","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/10135223/RT_BoxOffice_coco3_600X314.jpg","slug":"box-office-coco-threepeats-the-calm-before-the-storm"},{"id":"47509043100739","title":"Video: Dope Stars Drop Rhymes","content":"Video Interviewsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Video: Dope Stars Drop Rhymesby Grae Drake | June 19, 2015 |  CommentsDope, directed by Rick Famuyiwa, stars Shameik Moore, Blake Anderson, Kiersey Clemons, and Tony Revolori as nerds growing up in The Bottoms.

By comparison, the original fell 55% in its second weekend so even though sequels tend to front load their grosses, Guardians 2 seems to be holding on better than most. After 10 days the original was at $176M and ended its run at $333M. Following roughly the same trajectory, and realizing the box office at the beginning of the summer is more competitive than at the end of the summer, Guardians 2 could end at around $375-400M.Second place belonged to the leading ladies of Snatched. The R-rated comedy starring Amy Schumer and Goldie Hawn opened to a so-so $17.5M, according to estimates, from 3,501 theaters for a per screen average of $4,999. Critics were not kind as it currently sits at 36% positive on Rotten Tomatoes. Audiences didn’t seem too pleased either as it got a B CinemaScore. It doesn’t appear the counterprogramming to the male dominated summer blockbusters worked in this case. However, with a production budget around $40M, it will likely make back its money unlike…King Arthur: Legend of the Sword which tanked this weekend grossing only an estimated $14.7M from 3,702 theaters for a per screen average of $3,971. Its production budget was in the $175M vicinity and while a lot of films these days make up their money overseas, King Arthur is dying there too as it opened to $29M from 51 markets this weekend. Critics liked this one even less as it stands at 28% positive on Rotten Tomatoes, yet audiences liked it a bit more as it got a B+ CinemaScore. Still, this one is in the running for biggest bomb of the year and it’s only the second week of May.Holdovers, all with relatively small drops, took the next four places on the charts. Landing in fourth place was the multicultural crew of The Fate of the Furious which took in an estimated $5.3M in its fifth go around, bringing its cume up to $215M. In fifth place was The Boss Baby which added an estimated $4.6M to its coffers, bringing its total up to $162M after seven weeks. 2017s reigning champ fell to sixth place this weekend as Beauty and the Beast added another $3.86M, according to estimates, to its gargantuan total, bringing its cume up to $493M after nine weeks. Does it have enough left in the tank to become only the eighth film to hit the magical $500M mark? I’m gonna say yes. And in seventh place was How to be a Latin Lover which took in an estimated $3.75M bringing its total up to $26M after three weeks.There was s surprise entry in the top 10 as the unheralded Lowriders ended in eighth place this weekend with an estimated $2.4M from only 295 theaters for a per screen average of $8,810, second best in the top 10. A PG-13 drama about lowrider car culture with virtually no stars managed to do some pretty good business. Ninth place belonged to the disappointing thriller The Circle which added an estimated $1.7M to its bank, bringing the total up to only $18.9M… which is virtually the same total as the final film in the top 10, the biggest Bollywood hit of all time, Baahubali 2: The Conclusion which made $1.5M from only 375 theaters this weekend, bringing its total to $18.93M. If I told you a few weeks ago that a Bollywood film that had a 167 minute running time and never play in more than 425 theaters would outgross a film starring Tom Hanks and Emma Watson, would you have believed me? Also, I never would have said it because I never would have imagined it happening.The top ten films grossed an estimated $118M which was down 3.7% from last year when Captain America: Civil War remained at number one with $72.6M; and down 32.5% from 2015 when the ladies of Pitch Perfect 2 opened in the top spot with $69.2M.Get earlier box office updates and analysis by following&nbsp;BoxOfficeGuru.com&nbsp;on&nbsp;Twitter.","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"spanish, TCM, Family, Fox, foreign, Character, Family, Shudder, Searchlight, archives, Calendar, australia, Mary, GoT","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/14165901/unnamed.jpg","slug":"box-office-guardians-vol-2-tops-snatched-king-arthur"},{"id":"47614237885361","title":"30 Years Later, Tremors Is Still A Perfect Monster Movie, and It Keeps Getting Better","content":"Newsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})30 Years Later, Tremors Is Still A Perfect Monster Movie, and It Keeps Getting BetterTo celebrate its release in 1990, we look back at the cult classic that combined 1950s monster flicks, frontier westerns, and a timeless version of America that both never and always existed.by Jessica Kiang | January 19, 2020 |  CommentsPerfection – it’s not just a fictional town in Nevada. It’s also a film called Tremors, which is set in that fictional Nevada town (pop. 14, fluctuating) and was released 30 years ago this weekend. “Hang on, Val, let’s not go off half-cocked,” you cry (because in this scenario, you are dumb, skeptical Nestor, doomed to be sucked into a burrowing earth-monster’s mouth, while I, of course, am the reluctantly valiant Val). “Are you really saying that this unassuming, low-budget 1990 B-movie-pastiche flop starring an actor so ubiquitous there’s a game about it, the dad from Family Ties, a country singer-turned-actress, the little girl from Jurassic Park, the Asian guy from 3 Ninjas, and Fred Ward, is actually perfect?” Why, yes, I am.Tremors, starring Kevin Bacon, Michael Gross, Reba McEntire, Ariana Richards, Victor Wong, and Fred Ward, is the feature directorial debut of Ron Underwood, who would go on to hit massively with City Slickers&nbsp;and miss even more massively with The Adventures of Pluto Nash. Tremors&nbsp;is neither of those extremes: a perceived disappointment on release, it turned a $5m profit on an $11m budget but really found its groove on home video formats and TV syndication. So, like many others, my own lifelong love affair with this modest masterpiece did not begin with a trip to the theater. To this day, not one of my 60-odd viewings of this ridiculously rewatchable horror-comedy has ever been on the big screen.No, I first saw Tremors&nbsp;as God intended: on a dodgy VHS recorded off the TV and missing the first 40 seconds. We only upgraded to a store-bought video – and discovered that gorgeous, foreshadowing opening wide shot of Kevin Bacon’s Val peeing off the very cliff where the film will end, doubtless an homage to John Ford’s The Searchers – when that homemade copy grew snowy with overuse and threatened to gum up the VCR. My point here is that you can look back on the film’s lackluster 1990 reception and speculate that it somehow wasn’t made for instant-gratification contemporary mass consumption. Instead, destined to become more beloved by the chosen few who privately discovered it, Tremors&nbsp;was, despite its tone of breezy disposability, built to last.(Photo by MCA/Universal Pictures)The sturdiness of its construction begins with the screenplay. Writers Brent Maddock and S.S. Wilson, flirting with fame after the success of Short Circuit, and years before they’d flirt with notoriety by writing Wild Wild West (fun fact: Wild Wild West&nbsp;had a screenplay!) worked and reworked a concept that Wilson had jotted down years before while on a desert hike: “What if there was something under the ground that meant I couldn’t get off this rock?” That slim idea eventually blossomed into an archetypally classic screenplay — seriously, budding screenwriters could save a few hundred bucks by spending the weekend of their Robert McKee seminar just watching this movie repeatedly instead. All the rules are pristinely observed: the gradual escalation of stakes; the way character dictates destiny; and a climax in which the salvation of the community (the remaining townsfolk gathered on that “residual boulder”) and the solution of the hero’s previously established central flaw (Val’s inability to plan ahead) pivot around the same piece of action (the outwitting of Ol’ Stumpy, the final Graboid).No two of the four monsters are ever killed in the same manner – they are, variously, knocked out, shot to pieces, blown up with bombs, and finally, bested by gravity and their own imperfect evolutionary design (“Can you fly, you sucker?”). Acts of heroism and moments of ingenuity are shared liberally among the whole cast of oddball misfits — Miguel’s idea for the tractor decoy, Rhonda’s pole-vaulting escape plan, Heather’s precision shooting at the tentacle&nbsp;gripping her husband’s leg, Earl’s “going fishing” notion, the sheer overwhelming firepower represented by Burt’s basement (“Broke into the wrong goddamn rec room, didn’t you, you bastard!”). And everything,&nbsp;from Val and Earl’s frequent games of rock-paper-scissors to the constant yin-yang of their cigarette bit&nbsp;(one will have the pack and the other will have the lighter) and Val’s opening jibe about Earl’s “stampede” story, gets picked up on later. This is a film that refers back to itself in an endless enclosed loop, and that’s what I mean when I say perfection: Tremors&nbsp;is a complete system, a complete microcosmic universe, unto itself.(Photo by MCA/Universal Pictures)So the plotting, with its steady rhythms of snarky dialogue, spooky phenomena, slimy sight gags, and cheesy jump scares, is almost schematic. But it’s so skillfully fleshed out by an unusually characterful cast that we don’t notice the mechanics at work across its economical 96 minutes. Even minor players – many of them destined for grisly deaths – are unusually dimensional. We only ever see him dead from dehydration, clinging to a telephone pole and clutching his trusty Winchester, but that “damned old boozehound” Edgar Deems (Sunshine Parker) has a whole offscreen history behind his “sorry ass.” Ditto Old Fred (Michael Dan Wagner), the sheepfarmer whose terrified dead face provides the film’s best scare. The doctor (Conrad Bachman) and his wife (Bibi Besch) are given a lovely moment of long-married-couple sparring before being offed in the movie’s most affecting sequence. Even the two doomed construction workers drilling on the road to Bixby get a little moment of bumbling, Abbott-and-Costello action before winding up little more than a splodge of brain matter inside a hard hat.The town’s residents are better drawn still, up to and including the adorable natural chemistry that exists between Bacon’s Val and Fred Ward’s Earl. Yet they share a curious feature that contributes to the film’s endless rewatchability: they exist sharply in the present moment, but their lives are never actually explained. Really, the whole town of Perfection is inexplicable: where does Melvin (Bobby Jacoby), one of cinema’s greatest annoying-s–thead teenagers, come from? Where are his parents? How does he live? What did Burt do before moving here that gave him the financial wherewithal to build his desert fortress? Where does visiting student Rhonda “pleistocene alluvials” LeBeck (Finn Carter) actually live? How did Walter Chang (Victor Wong) end up owning the town’s sole amenity? (Side note: if you want to read about a storied life, just look into artist and actor Wong’s bio, which includes palling around with Langston Hughes and Lawrence Ferlinghetti and inspiring a character in Jack Kerouac’s Big Sur).(Photo by MCA/Universal Pictures)And of course, how did Val and Earl, among the most bromantic buddy pairings the medium has ever conjured up, come to occupy adjacent trailers in a two-horse town that’s little more than a wide spot in the dusty road to Bixby? How did they stumble into their pre-gig-economy jobs as hired hands/handymen? How did they meet and formulate their borderline Beckettian double act (just call them Valdimir and Earlstragon)?&nbsp;As with the Graboids, you can have theories on where everyone comes from, but the hows and whys are just not that important. In fact, it may be crucial to the film’s delicious longevity that those issues remain undefined: while some are addressed in the film’s four DTV sequels, its prequel, and its two TV show incarnations (the latter of which happened as recently as 2018 but never got beyond the pilot), those explanations always spoil the perfectly calibrated balance between goofy, gory, and good-natured that only the original Tremors&nbsp;ever achieved.Cliffs to the north, mountains to the east and west, and the only road out of town is blocked — Perfection exists in total “geographic isolation.” And Tremors, the movie, exists in a kind of temporal isolation, in which its multiple time frames combine to take it out of time altogether. This is a never-never land comprised of the throwback 1950s monster flicks it so affectionately parodies, the frontier westerns that its spectacular photography evokes (as well as the characterization of Val and Earl as anachronistic cowboys stranded in modern times), and the easing global tensions and general optimism of the glasnost era in which it was made. It’s a perfect bubble of contradictions that exists outside of real-world circumstance, politics, or anything as faddish as “relevance.” And yet that makes Tremors&nbsp;a curiously vital place to visit once in a while, especially in more divisive moments. It’s a cheesy, schlocky, irreverent entertainment that is also a timeless reminder of an America that both never and always existed, in which human qualities of decency, community and ingenuity always outweigh ideological differences, and all that’s really needed to defeat the beasts beneath our feet is gumption, good-heartedness, and​ ​a few household chemicals in the proper proportion.(Photo by MCA/Universal Pictures)Tremors&nbsp;was released on January 19, 1990.#1Tremors (1990) 86%#1Adjusted Score: 88.626% Critics Consensus: An affectionate throwback to 1950s creature features, Tremors reinvigorates its genre tropes with a finely balanced combination of horror and humor.Synopsis: Tremors is actually two movies in one.

The Lionsgate hit grossed an estimated $18.6M falling a steep 64%. That puts it in between the 65% of 2013’s Catching Fire and the 61% of last year’s Mockingjay Part 1. All were in their third weekend at this time.The final Panem pic has brought in $227.1M which is down 12% from where last year’s chapter was at the same point. Current trajectory puts it on course for a domestic final of about $295M, although it would not be surprising if Lionsgate gives it an extra push over the holidays to bump it into triple-century territory. Both Mockingjay sequels have grossed less than their predecessor.The international arena is a bit brighter thanks in part to China opening earlier than last time. This weekend collected an estimated $32.4M overseas to boost the offshore cume to $296.8M and the worldwide tally to $523.9M.Universal found a nice hit with its new horror-comedy Krampus which debuted above expectations in second place with an estimated $16M from 2,902 locations for a solid $5,520 average. The PG-13 film earned decent reviews and offered a unique mix of scares and laughs in a Christmas setting which moviegoers responded to. Krampus is the first film in ten years to open on the normally sluggish weekend after the Thanksgiving frame and debut north of $10M. Usually studios either skip opening any major films on this session, or program in titles that open to about $5M or so.Studio exit polls showed that the film played younger and had plenty of cross-gender appeal. 51% were under 21 while males and females were evenly split. Ethnic appeal helped too as 62% of the audience was non-white. The CinemaScore grade was a B- which is pretty good for a scary movie. Krampus cost only $15M to produce.Two Thanksgiving weekend openers tied for third place with an estimated $15.5M each. Final numbers to be reported on Monday will determine the final chart order. Regardless, the boxing drama Creed had a terrific hold dropping 48% which is superb for a franchise film coming off of a holiday frame. Strong word of mouth is allowing the Warner Bros.-MGM pic to grow beyond its older male base. With a strong $65.1M to date, Creed will surpass the $70.3M of 2006’s&nbsp;Rocky Balboa by this Friday on its way to becoming the first $100M+ grosser for the popular franchise in 30 years.In a virtual tie for third was Pixar’s The Good Dinosaur which fell 60% to an estimated $15.5M as well in its second weekend. That was a larger post-turkey decline than recent Thanksgiving toons from Disney like Frozen (53%) and Tangled (56%). After 12 days, Dinosaur‘s cume is just $76M. Pixar’s last two films Inside Out and Monsters University made more than that in just their first three days. At its current pace, The Good Dinosaur is on track to finish its domestic run with about $160M which would beat 1998’s A Bug’s Life to become the lowest-grossing Pixar movie ever.International markets have collected $55.4M for a global gross of $131.4M. The animation studio is going back to sequels (and summer) with its upcoming films being Finding Dory next June and Cars 3 in June 2017. Also on the calendar later on are Toy Story 4 in June 2018 and The Incredibles 2 in June 2019.Still in the top five in its fifth weekend was the James Bond film Spectre&nbsp;with an estimated $5.4M, down 58%, for a $184.5M total. It’s currently running 29% behind Skyfall which had banked $261.4M at the same point in 2012, while the global tally has climbed past $790M.The holiday comedy The Night Before enjoyed a good hold dipping only 41% to an estimated $4.9M boosting the total to $32M for Sony. The far more tame comedy The Peanuts Movie followed with an estimated $3.5M dropping 64% from Thanksgiving. Fox’s sum is now $121.4M.The priest molestation drama Spotlight has been generating plenty of awards buzz which is helping it at the box office. Adding a few more screens, the Open Road release held up very well with an estimated $2.9M from 980 locations for a $2,987 average. The steady expansion has been executed brilliantly and there is plenty of potential ahead as more end of year awards and nominations come out. Cume stands at $16.6M.Also faring well with arthouse audiences is Fox Searchlight’s Brooklyn which declined 38% and grossed an estimated $2.4M bumping the total up to $11.2M. Rounding out the top ten was The Secret In Their Eyes with an estimated $2M, off 56%, for a $17.2M sum for STX.Opening in platform release was Fox Searchlight’s Youth with an estimated $80,000 from four houses for a $20,000 average in New York and Los Angeles. Starring Michael Caine, Harvey Keitel, Rachel Weisz, Paul Dano, and Jane Fonda, the R-rated pic earned generally positive reviews and hopes to grow across December’s crowded specialty marketplace as more awards contenders arrive every week.Among specialty holdovers staying put in four theaters, Carol grossed an estimated $147,000 this weekend (down 26%) after winning best picture, director, screenplay, and cinematography from the New York Film Critics Circle. The Weinstein Co. release averaged a solid $36,750 and has a total of $817,000. Focus saw a 43% fall for The Danish Girl which averaged $26,500 with a weekend estimate of $106,000. Cume is $352,000 and Friday sees an expansion to 23 theaters as it debuts in seven new markets.The top ten films grossed an estimated $86.8M which was up 28% from last year when The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 1 stayed at number one with $22M; and up 4% from 2013 when Frozen rose to the top spot with $31.6M.Compared to projections, Krampus opened ahead of my $9M forecast.Follow Gitesh on Twitter!","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"supernatural, the, worst, book, shows, FXX, Bravo, History, Nominations, festivals, cartoon, sequels","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/06180143/600HungerGames3.jpg","slug":"box-office-mockingjay-still-1-krampus-opens-solid-2"},{"id":"47509050741888","title":"Video: Eddie Redmayne Says Scientists Are Like Real People","content":"Video Interviewsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Video: Eddie Redmayne Says Scientists Are Like Real Peopleby Grae Drake | November 24, 2014 |  CommentsEddie Redmayne stars as Stephen Hawking in the drama The Theory of Everything.

The low-budget party film Project X, 2012’s umpteenth overperformer, opened in second place with an impressive haul of its own. The one-two punch sent the North American box office soaring 26% ahead of the same weekend from last year continuing a boom year which has seen long lines at multiplexes.Surging to an incredible $70.7M this weekend, according to estimates, The Lorax dominated the marketplace with the year’s top opening. It was also the biggest bow for a Dr. Seuss film beating the $55.1M of 2000’s How the Grinch Stole Christmas and overall, the second largest non-sequel animated debut ever trailing just the $74M of 2007’s The Simpsons Movie. That puts Lorax ahead of such recent 3D toons from power players Pixar and DreamWorks as Cars 2 ($66.1M), Kung Fu Panda 2 ($47.7M), Up ($68.1M), and Monsters vs. Aliens ($59.3M) as well as Fox’s Rio ($39.2M) and Universal’s own Despicable Me ($56.4M). It was also the third largest opening in the month of March after Johnny Depp’s colossal 3D hit Alice in Wonderland ($116.1M) which debuted this weekend two years ago during the post-Avatar boom and the 2007 smash 300 ($70.9M).Lorax indeed played like a sequel bringing in parents familiar with the children’s book and kids interested in a fun and colorful ride. The studio partnered with dozens of corporate brands that provided extra marketing muscle hitting the target audience from every possible direction thereby boosting awareness and excitement by Friday, which was also the birthday of Dr. Seuss. The opening day saw a solid $17.4M in ticket sales but Saturday witnessed a spending surge climbing 80% to an incredible $31.3M. Most films this time of year never come close to that for the entire weekend. Sunday is estimated to drop 30% to $22M. Produced for $70M, Lorax averaged a sensational $18,965 from 3,729 theaters.The road ahead looks bright for the Danny DeVito-voiced pic which should find its way across the $200M domestic barrier plus solid overseas sales. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the toon a glowing A grade plus there are no major new releases aimed at younger kids until the Snow White film Mirror Mirror at the very end of this new month. The Easter holiday in early April could also provide a boost if the film is still holding on then. Positive word-of-mouth from families should more than offset mixed reviews from critics. It’s been a strong first quarter so far for Universal which already scored number one action hits with Contraband and Safe House.Another of this year’s low-budget, no-star vehicles had audiences opening their wallets as the party comedy Project X debuted with strength in second place with an estimated $20.8M from 3,055 locations for a solid $6,800 average. The R-rated film about three high schoolers that throw a wildly out of control party played mostly to older teens and young adults and an effective marketing campaign excited the target audience. The MPAA’s rating description was essentially an invitation to high school and college students everywhere as the raunchfest was cited for “crude and sexual content throughout, nudity, drugs, drinking, pervasive language, reckless behavior and mayhem – all involving teens.”Project X cost a mere $12M to produce and Warner Bros. used Hangover producer Todd Philips’ name in the marketing push to ensure that young adults knew they were in for some debauchery, only this time with characters too young to be concerned with getting married. Studio research showed that 67% of the crowd was under 25 while 58% were male. The CinemaScore grade was only a B, reviews were mostly negative, and Saturday sales dipped 6% from opening day so good legs are not expected. However, the modestly priced film will be a moneymaker and has continued the recent trend that has seen young adults come back to the multiplexes for their weekend entertainment.Falling from its number one ranking last weekend but still holding up moderately well was the military training-video-turned-movie Act of Valor which declined by 44% to an estimated $13.7M. The Relativity release has banked an impressive $45.2M in just ten days and could be headed for a domestic finish of about $75M. Valor cost just $12M to produce and joins other low-cost 2012 hits like Project X, Chronicle, and The Devil Inside. Combined, the four films cost $27M to produce and will end up grossing north of $240M from North America alone. Of course, marketing costs were extra.Denzel Washington’s CIA thriller Safe House followed with an estimated $7.2M, down only 34%, for a solid $108.2M cume for Universal. The film now ranks as the Oscar winning actor’s third biggest grosser after the $130.2M for his bad guy role in American Gangster and the $115.7M for his good guy role in Remember the Titans. Tyler Perry’s latest pic Good Deeds tumbled 55% to an estimated $7M for a ten-day tally of $25.7M. Look for Lionsgate to end its run with about $38M ranking among his lowest performers.With lots of kids fleeing to see The Lorax, the adventure hit Journey 2: The Mysterious Island fell harder than before dropping 48% to an estimated $6.9M in its fourth round. Warner Bros. has taken in $85.6M to date and should be able to break $100M domestically. Sony’s romance blockbuster The Vow held up well dropping 39% to an estimated $6.1M boosting the total to $111.7M. The Channing Tatum-Rachel McAdams hit is the top-grossing film of 2012, for now.Fox’s action-romance This Means War held up well again with an estimated $5.6M, off only 33% giving the Reese Witherspoon vehicle $41.5M to date. Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance fell 48% to an estimated $4.7M for $44.9M after 17 days. The Sony sequel is running 53% behind the pace of its 2007 predecessor though admissions are lagging even more since Spirit‘s take includes higher ticket prices and 3D surcharges.The Weinstein Co. nearly doubled the screen count of its Oscar champ The Artist which found itself in the top ten for the first time in its 15th week of play. But that didn’t mean the silent film connected with a more mainstream crowd. The Best Picture winner added 790 runs and grossed an estimated $3.9M from 1,756 locations for a dull $2,221 average. The estimate included a very optimistic 25% Saturday-to-Sunday decline so final numbers to be reported on Monday may come in lower. Despite the 82% increase in screens, the weekend gross rose just 34% putting the total at $37.1M. Though a low-budget production, The Artist was backed by an extensive and expensive marketing campaign over the past few months that simultaneously targeted consumers as well as industry voters. Adding hundreds of new prints and backing them with national advertising doesn’t come cheap either. A final domestic gross in the $45-50M range may result.Other Oscar winners tried to parlay statues into extra box office receipts. Original Screenplay champ The Descendants dropped 36% to an estimated $1.4M pushing the total to a hearty $80.5M for Fox Searchlight. It is now 2011’s top-grossing Best Picture nominee released during the most competitive fourth quarter. Hugo, the most expensive of the top contenders and a winner of 5 Oscars, dipped only 14% to an estimated $1.3M for a $71.4M cume to date. Both films lost screens this weekend.Also shedding a few playdates, but enjoying a healthy 30% surge from last weekend, was Meryl Streep’s The Iron Lady with an estimated $900,000. The double winner for Best Actress and Makeup generated more interest from adult audiences and added a bit to The Weinstein Company’s total which is now $27.1M.The Academy Award winners in the foreign language and documentary categories both expanded to capitalize on the added publicity. Iran’s A Separation added 160 screens and saw its weekend take jump 174% to an estimated $1M for a $3.7M sum and $4,123 average for Sony Classics. The football doc Undefeated expanded from five to 13 theaters and collected an estimated $84,000 giving The Weinstein Co. a $6,485 average and cume of $166,000 early in its run.The top ten films grossed an estimated $146.7M which was up 28% from last year when Rango opened in the top spot with $38.1M; but down 20% from 2010 when Alice in Wonderland debuted at number one with $116.1M.","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"target, TV, of, Reality, international, Originals, Nickelodeon, winner, Freeform, Chernobyl, Acorn, Disney+, Classic, reviews","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-Lorax-Scores-Best-Seuss-Debut-Ever-with-70M"},{"id":"47509106448014","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: Straight Outta Compton Stays at Number One","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: Straight Outta Compton Stays at Number OneMission: Impossible - Rogue Nation and Sinister 2 round out the top three.by Gitesh Pandya | August 23, 2015 |  CommentsThe late-August box office blues kicked in as North American multiplexes witnessed low attendance thanks in part to studios dumping out new releases nationwide that they have no confidence in. Easily holding onto the number one spot was Straight Outta Compton&nbsp;with an estimated $26.8M dropping 56% in the process. By comparison, 2002’s runaway hit 8 Mile fell 62% in its second weekend after a stellar opening.That was a harsh fall for a non-sequel drama but strong word-of-mouth is still pushing this one to great heights. Universal broke the $100M mark over the weekend with Compton now sitting at $111.5M. A final in the neighborhood of $170M may result for this low-cost $29M production.Ruling as the top mainstream action movie for the past four weeks, Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation saw a low 32% slide to an estimated $11.7M boosting Paramount’s cume to $157.8M. Tom Cruise has been in the top two spots for four straight weeks now. The only other film this summer to do that was Jurassic World with five. Add in $280.8M from overseas markets and MI5 has now grossed $438.6M worldwide with China still to come.New releases were mostly ignored by moviegoers but faring best was the horror sequel Sinister 2 with an estimated $10.6M falling below the $18M of its 2012 predecessor. The R-rated title from Focus averaged a mild $3,844 from 2,766 sites and was panned by critics.The action offering Hitman: Agent 47 fared poorly with an estimated $8.2M opening from 3,261 locations for a soft $2,515 average. The R-rated Fox release debuted below the $13.2M of 2007’s Hitman which played in 800 fewer theaters. Reviews were dismal.Warner Bros. saw its action entry The Man From U.N.C.L.E. decline 45% to an estimated $7.4M in its sophomore frame. With $26.6M to date, the Henry Cavill pic should end up with a modest $45M.The stoner action-comedy American Ultra failed to connect with audiences and opened poorly in sixth place with an estimated $5.5M from 2,778 locations for a puny $1,980 average. The Lionsgate release was rejected by critics and did not excite the target audience of young adults. The opening was almost identical to the weak $5.7M bow of 2009’s Adventureland which also starred Jesse Eisenberg and Kristen Stewart.Down 34% to an estimated $4.3M was the thriller The Gift which has grossed $31.1M to date for STX.

Puss in Boots at Top with $34Mby Gitesh Pandya | October 30, 2011 |  CommentsThe animated comedy Puss in Boots debuted at number one over the pre-Halloween frame while other new releases failed to generate much excitement averaging under $4,000 a piece. The overall marketplace got hit hard by a double whammy of game seven of the World Series on Friday which attracted over 25 million viewers followed by a powerful winter storm hitting the highly populated northeast region of the country on Saturday affecting tens of millions of people with unusually early snowfalls. Studio estimates may change significantly on Monday depending on how much lost business gets picked up on Sunday. Films with better word-of-mouth may also grab some of that lost cash in the weeks ahead if good buzz can spread.With its second top spot debut from a franchise film in as many weeks, Paramount hit number one with the launch of its Shrek spin-off toon Puss in Boots which debuted to an estimated $34M. The figure was one of the lowest debuts for a high-profile 3D toon in recent years and was a far cry from the openings of other DreamWorks titles like last year’s triumvirate of Megamind ($46M), the leggy How to Train Your Dragon ($43.7M), and Shrek Forever After ($70.8M) which was the last installment of this franchise. Even this year’s earlier non-sequel animated entries like Fox’s 3D Rio and Paramount’s 2D Rango debuted higher with $39.2M and $38.1M, respectively. The PG-rated cat pic averaged $8,603 from 3,952 theaters including 2,827 offering 3D.However, all indicators point to Puss in Boots having good legs in the weeks ahead despite the slow start. Weather and also pre-Halloween activities for kids helped to softened the bow but audiences and critics alike are giving high marks to the product suggesting good buzz will keep it relevant. Reviews were quite good and an encouraging A- CinemaScore grade bodes well for the weeks ahead. Studios typically pick the first weekend of November as the time to launch the holiday season’s first high-profile animated entry or kidpic as it’s been for the last ten consecutive years. In fact, Puss was originally slated for November 4 but was moved earlier one week to have a longer run before competitors roll in. Led by the voice of Antonio Banderas, the toon has clear sailing until Happy Feet Two arrives on November 18.If estimates hold, Puss in Boots will claim the record for best Halloween weekend opening of all-time. The milestone is not exactly one that comes with much bragging rights since the holiday falls on a different day each year and its activities often cause distractions that reduce box office activity. Horror films typically are the ones that excel with the previous top three best debuts for the holiday being recent installments of the Saw franchise. Studios rarely program big non-horror titles around Halloween.Puss in Boots skewed more to moms with females making up 59% of the crowd and 55% being 25 and older. Banderas and co-star Salma Hayek helped to mobilize the Latino-American audience which accounted for 35% of business spending nearly $12M this weekend. 3D screens including 270 IMAX locations accounted for 51% of the gross giving the film a higher share than recent animated films like Cars 2, Kung Fu Panda 2, and The Smurfs.Overseas, Puss in Boots launched to spectacular results in Russia which led the three-market debut of $17M this weekend. $15M came from the increasingly important Russian market making it the second biggest DreamWorks bow ever after the fourth Shrek as well as the third largest debut of 2011 after the latest 3D sequels for Pirates of the Caribbean and Transformers which were both monster hits there. With its international cast and setting, Puss in Boots should do robust business overseas where animated films typically perform incredibly well accounting for 70-75% of global box office.After scoring the best opening ever during the September-October corridor, the horror threequel Paranormal Activity 3 fell sharply in its second frame dropping 65% to an estimated $18.5M. That gave the $5M production a stellar $81.3M after only ten days of release with Monday’s Halloween holiday likely to deliver another solid day of business since horror films historically draw big audiences during evening shows on the pumpkin holiday. The Paramount hit has already come close to the $84.8M of the last installment of the lucrative franchise and is headed for a finish in the neighborhood of the $107.9M of the first chapter in the series. Overseas, the third Paranormal grossed an estimated $17M boosting the international tally to $54.2M and the global haul to $135.5M with top-tier markets Japan and Germany still to open. The trilogy as a whole has now grossed a mammoth $507M worldwide plus tons more on DVD.Justin Timberlake’s sci-fi thriller In Time opened in third place with a mediocre $12M, according to estimates, averaging a moderate $3,844 from 3,122 theaters. The PG-13 film about a world in the near future when only the wealthy can afford to buy time to extend their own lifespans played evenly across genders and skewed older with 58% being 25 and up. Reviews were more on the negative side and moviegoers were not that much more impressed as the Fox release got a B- CinemaScore. Timberlake has been growing his resume in the world of film with supporting turns in The Social Network and Bad Teacher followed by a lead role in the romantic comedy Friends With Benefits which had a nice late summer run grossing $55.8M.The dance remake Footloose followed in fourth place with an estimated $5.4M, down 48%, giving Paramount $38.4M after 17 days. A final gross near $50M seems likely.Johnny Depp stumbled into fifth place with his new offering The Rum Diary which bowed to a weak $5M, according to estimates. Playing in 2,272 locations, the R-rated drama about a New York journalist relocating to Puerto Rico averaged a poor $2,206 per theater. The older-skewing FilmDistrict release did not wow critics and even ticket buyers were disappointed as the troubling C CinemaScore and tiny 4% Saturday jump indicated large declines ahead. The opening for Rum was reminiscent of the debuts for many of Depp’s quirkier dramas prior to Pirates of the Caribbean vaulting him to the level of the top box office draws in the world. Those included $6.6M for The Ninth Gate, $4M for The Astronaut’s Wife, $3.3M for Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, and $4.6M for Don Juan de Marco.Two-time chart-topper Real Steel got clobbered in its fourth round falling 57% to an estimated $4.7M boosting Disney’s cume to $73.9M making it the fourth biggest grosser of the fall after The Lion King 3D ($93.2M), Paranormal Activity 3, and Contagion ($74.1M) which it will surpass later this week. Audiences also fled from The Three Musketeers which tumbled 60% in its second frame to an estimated $3.5M for a dull ten-day tally of $14.8M for Summit. A $20M final may result.Sony filled up the rest of the spots in the top ten with its fall slate. George Clooney’s Oscar hopeful The Ides of March grossed an estimated $2.7M, down 44%, for a $33.5M total. Brad Pitt’s Moneyball fell 40% to an estimated $2.4M while the faith-based hit Courageous dipped only 28% to an estimated $1.8M. Totals stand at $67.4M and $27.6M.In limited release, Sony’s Shakespeare drama Anonymous generated a lukewarm response from American audiences with an estimated $1M debut from only 265 theaters for a lackluster $3,774 average. The PG-13 film was originally set for a nationwide bow but the studio shifted gears less than two weeks before opening day to a moderate release instead. Anonymous earned a good A- CinemaScore from those few that did come out and pay to see it, but overall interest domestically had never been high at all. The audience breakdown was 51% female while 65% was 30 and over. Reviews were mixed.Doing well in platform release was the award-winning Sundance drama Like Crazy which debuted in just four theaters with an estimated $120,000 for a solid $30,000 average. Reviews were generally good for the PG-13 Paramount release which toured a number of film festivals generating buzz before heading into its commercial release.The top ten films grossed an estimated $90M which was up 8% from last year when Saw 3D debuted in the top spot with $24.2M; and up 16% from 2009 when This Is It opened at number one with $23.2M.Follow Gitesh on Twitter.","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"Black, FX, Writers, X-Men","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Puss-in-Boots-at-Top-with-34M"},{"id":"47509053216921","title":"Video: Bill Hader Is So Funny He Makes Kristen Wiig Cry","content":"Video Interviewsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Video: Bill Hader Is So Funny He Makes Kristen Wiig Cryby Grae Drake | September 12, 2014 |  CommentsBill Hader and Kristen Wiig star in The Skeleton Twins in limited release this week.

The Warner Bros. drama scored an estimated $23.1M bow from 3,222 theaters (including 257 higher-priced IMAX screens) for a sturdy $7,180 average playing to a mature adult crowd. The PG-13 film starring Matt Damon, Gwenyth Paltrow, Kate Winslet, Laurence Fishburne, Jude Law, and Marion Cotillard benefited from an intriguing end-of-world disaster plot, a well-respected cast led by six Oscar winners and nominees, strong reviews, weak competition, and a solid marketing push. Academy Award winner Steven Soderbergh directed.It was the fifth biggest opening ever in the first half of September which is typically among the slowest periods of the entire year at the box office. Contagion also infected six other markets this weekend with a modest roll out. The international gross was an estimated $2.1M from 544 screens including $705,000 from Italy, $531,000 in Singapore, and $392,000 from Hong Kong where the film’s story begins. Unlike the disease, the movie will take some time to spread to the rest of the world with most major markets opening in October.[rtimage]siteImageId=10246026[/rtimage]After becoming the only film of 2011 to remain number one for three weekends, The Help dropped to the runner-up spot with an estimated $8.7M but still held up well slipping only 41% from the holiday frame. The Disney release has now taken in a remarkable $137.1M on its way to $160M+. It was a notable weekend for Participant Media which co-financed both films in the top two spots.Great reviews and buzz-building sneak previews failed to get young men out to the multiplexes for the Mixed Martial Arts film Warrior which debuted in third with an estimated $5.6M. Lacking major starpower, the Lionsgate release about two brothers who face off in a championship match averaged a weak $3,000 from 1,869 theaters. Warrior‘s performance has underscored how increasingly difficult it has become to pull males away from football during the fall season with college and NFL games dominating the TV airwaves on Saturday and Sunday. Teens and young adults in general have become elusive except for when top movie brands roll out.The rest of the top ten was filled with leftovers which fell into a tight range between $2.5M and $5M a piece. Focus witnessed a 51% decline for its espionage thriller The Debt which no doubt took a hit from Contagion and collected an estimated $4.9M. Falling 46% to an estimated $4M was the younger-skewing actioner Colombiana for Sony. Totals are $22M and $29.8M, respectively.[rtimage]siteImageId=10246027[/rtimage]Vicious animals followed as Rise of the Planet of the Apes grossed an estimated $3.9M, down 51%, while Shark Night 3D tumbled 58% to an estimated $3.5M. Fox has banked a stellar $167.8M while Relativity Media has collected $14.8M.Rounding out the top ten was The Weinstein Co. with a trio of end-of-summer releases still lingering on the charts. After a soft debut followed by instantly negative buzz, the fake moon thriller Apollo 18 collapsed in its second weekend falling 67% to an estimated $2.9M for a $15M total. The Paul Rudd comedy Our Idiot Brother declined by 49% to an estimated $2.8M while the 4D kidpic Spy Kids: All the Time in the World took in an estimated $2.5M, off 48%. Cumes stand at $21.4M and $34.2M, respectively.Other new films opening outside of the top ten saw some highs and lows. The stand-up comedy concert pic Kevin Hart: Laugh At My Pain was rock solid with an estimated $2M from only 97 locations for a potent $20,619 average for CodeBlack Entertainment.[rtimage]siteImageId=10246028[/rtimage]Not delivering any laughs was the Nick Swardson comedy Bucky Larson: Born To Be A Star which had an aggressive 1,500-theater launch from Sony but came up with only $1.5M, according to estimates, for an embarrassing $967 average. The fact that it even had this wide of a release speaks to the clout that producer Adam Sandler has in Hollywood. Bubble Distribution did not release an estimate for its campy horror film Creature but sources put the three-day figure in the vicinity of $300,000 from an amazingly large 1,657 theaters in the U.S. and Canada for an abysmal $181 average. That equates to less than two tickets sold per showtime.The top ten films grossed an estimated $61.9M which was even with last year when Resident Evil: Afterlife opened in the top spot with $26.7M; but down 13% from 2009 when I Can Do Bad All By Myself debuted at number one with $23.4M.Written by Gitesh Pandya, Box Office Guru!","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"TV, on, RT, Black, Arts, Animation, biography, caribbean, Apple, Out","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-Contagion-Wins-Modest-Weekend"},{"id":"47509107642012","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: Avengers: Age of Ultron Posts Second Highest Opening Weekend of All Time","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: Avengers: Age of Ultron Posts Second Highest Opening Weekend of All TimeThe Age of Adaline and Furious 7 round out the top three.by Gitesh Pandya | May 3, 2015 |  Comments&nbsp;&nbsp;It didn’t match lofty industry expectations, however the super hero jumbo-pack sequel Avengers: Age of Ultron still did colossal business and generated the second biggest opening weekend of all-time with an estimated $187.7M. That was 10% below the record $207.4M of its predecessor The Avengers from this same weekend in 2012, but ahead of every other movie in history as it kicked off another busy summer movie season.Because the first Avengers movie shattered the all-time record and was a well-loved film with great legs, the follow-up was expected to go even higher by some margin. Instead, it joined other recent action franchises that saw part two’s open below or just barely above part ones such as Star Trek, The Hobbit, and The Hunger Games. Marvel has had a better track record with all Iron Man, Captain America, and Thor sequels opening significantly higher than their predecessors so Ultron was expected to edge out the first assembly flick from 2012. Still, no film opening north of $180M can ever be called a disappointment.Factors in the weekend business were the many live sports distractions on Saturday which appealed to a big part of the Ultron audience. The Mayweather-Pacquiao match smashed boxing sales records, the NBA had a critical playoff Game 7, plus there was the Kentucky Derby and the NFL Draft going on. These were all scheduled well in advance so moviegoers interested in watching any of them had time to shift their multiplex habits to accommodate everything. But the new Avengers did suffer a sharp drop in box office on Saturday, more than what was expected. The key for Disney and Marvel will be to pick up that lost business on Sunday or future days.Age of Ultron began its weekend with $27.6M in Thursday night pre-shows starting at 7 pm which ranked sixth best all-time. It was well behind the $43.5M of 2011’s Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 which was the final film in the series and opened in July when all students were out of school. The full opening day of Friday (including pre-shows) was $84.5M which was second best of all-time trailing the $91.1M of the final Potter. It beat the $80.8M of the first Avengers by 5% but that film started later with midnight shows on Thursday night.Saturday came crashing down by 32% to $57.2M. The first Avengers dropped 14% while the following year’s Iron Man 3, again on the same first weekend of May, fell by 10%. Sports certainly had an impact especially in the Pacific time zone where the fight was on in primetime. Disney is projecting a slim 20% decline on Sunday to $46M making for a weekend estimate of $187.7M. Because of Saturday’s distractions, the studio expects Sunday to have a softer fall.But what if Sunday falls harder? Holdovers saw Saturday increases that were well below the jumps they would have seen so the impact was felt throughout the marketplace. Other films in the top five are all projecting Sunday declines of 35-50%. If Ultron were to dip by 30% on Sunday instead of 20%, it would shave another $6M off of the weekend estimate. 2012’s Avengers – which had stronger reviews and audience scores – dipped only 18% on its first Sunday but was not looked at as a true sequel.Robert Downey Jr. now owns the top three opening weekends of all-time with Avengers, Ultron, and Iron Man 3‘s $174.1M. Of course, Marvel and Disney have co-ownership of these three medals with Mr. Stark with two more Avengers films on the calendar for 2018 and 2019.Ultron averaged a potent $43,886 per location this weekend from 4,276 theaters. 44% of the gross came from 3D screens which was down from the 52% of the 2012 pic but up from the 40% of last year’s Captain America: The Winter Soldier. IMAX accounted for $18M from 364 screens this weekend, or 10% of the total take. Many theaters had higher prices than three years ago including the AMC Lincoln Square in New York City which offered the IMAX 3D version for $22 per ticket – and yes, some of those shows were sold out. For this weekend, Ultron alone commanded a whopping 82% of all ticket sales in North America.Studio data showed that Age of Ultron played to the usual super hero audience. Males were 59% of the crowd and 59% were over 25. Reviews were generally good, but critics were not rushing to pile on the praise as they did with the last film. Paying fans also liked the film as evidenced by the solid A CinemaScore grade. It was a notch below the rare A+ that the first Avengers earned, but equal to all three Iron Man pics. Though adding some new characters, Ultron essentially gave fans the same concept of putting several mighty super heroes under one roof. It was a novelty the first time around, not as exciting or special the second time.The road ahead may be promising, globally speaking. Sequels are typically front-loaded, but Ultron is getting respectable buzz and there is nothing substantial on its second weekend to challenge it. But if the tentpole follows the same path as Iron Man 3, it would reach a domestic final in the neighborhood of $440M which would be 29% below the $623.4M of The Avengers.Overseas markets have been red hot for Age of Ultron. With Mexico and Spain opening and Friday’s May Day injecting holiday business into many markets, the weekend delivered a stellar $168M from 88 territories pushing the international cume to $439M for a global gross of a stunning $626.7M.Mexico scored the biggest opening weekend of all-time with a fantastic $25.5M while Korea leads all overseas markets with a cume of $55.4M after its second weekend. Part of the film is set there. China opens on May 12 and has the potential to gross north of $300M all by itself. Japan launches on July 4.That gives Ultron the potential to score an international box office haul that easily beats the $895M of the first Avengers and break the $1 billion mark. Worldwide, the new super hero spectacular may still be on a trajectory to cross the $1.5 billion box office milestone becoming one of the top five largest global blockbusters of all-time.Marvel routinely stakes out the first weekend of May for its many properties. The comic studio already has claimed the summer kickoff frame for the next few years with Captain America: Civil War in 2016, Guardians of the Galaxy 2 in 2017, and Avengers: Infinity War parts 1 and 2 on the following years, all through Disney. But hey, May 1 in 2020 is wide open.No other film came anywhere close to Ultron‘s levels this weekend. In fact, nothing else managed to break $7M over three days. Rising one position from third to second place was the romance The Age of Adaline with an estimated $6.3M in its sophomore frame. Lionsgate positioned the Blake Lively drama in the marketplace to serve as counter-programming for adult women and it managed to win the silver medal sandwiched in between two testosterone action sequel tentpoles. Off 53%, Adaline has grossed $23.4M to date and could be headed for the $35M range.Following its four-week run at the top, Furious 7 dropped down to third place this weekend with an estimated $6.1M, down a steep 66% thanks to direct competition from another action sequel tentpole. Universal is still amassing huge numbers around the world with North America rising to $330.5M (number 34 on the list of all-time domestic blockbusters) and the international haul climbing to an incredible $1.1 billion.Furious 7 has grossed a staggering $1.43 billion globally led by China’s $381.8M where breaking the $400M mark is a possibility since it still has more than a week before Ultron arrives. Friday’s May Day holiday in much of the world helped drive the international weekend estimate to $52.8M from 67 territories. In 23 months, Universal will unleash the eighth Fast &amp; Furious film with the franchise grossing a stunning $3.8 billion globally to date.Kevin James stumbled with his comedy sequel Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 which fell a hefty 62% in its third weekend to an estimated $5.6M. The $30M Sony production has banked a solid $51.2M though and may see a final domestic gross that doubles its budget.The animated hit Home also got shoved to the side by Earth’s mightiest heroes. Fox’s toon release tumbled 59% to an estimated $3.3M putting the new total at $158.1M.Thanks to revenue from being coupled with Ultron at drive-in double features, Disney’s other major release Cinderella saw its weekend gross slip only 15% from the last frame to an estimated $2.4M. All other films in wide release fell by at least 50%. That puts the princess at $193.7M domestic and $494.3M worldwide.The sci-fi drama Ex Machina fell 58% to an estimated $2.2M putting the new cume for A24 at $10.9M.

Office Guru Wrapup: Bradley Cooper More Popular Than Lawyers and AliensLimitless bests Lincoln Lawyer and Paul in a modest weekend.by Gitesh Pandya | March 20, 2011 |  CommentsThe paranoia-fueled action thriller Limitless led a trio of new releases and opened at number one with a sturdy debut. The crime drama The Lincoln Lawyer and the road comedy Paul both attracted respectable business landing in the top five but the overall marketplace once again failed to match up to last year’s levels.Relativity Media’s new distribution operation scored its first top spot bow with the Bradley Cooper drama Limitless which premiered on top with an estimated $19M finishing a few notches above industry expectations. The fast-paced thriller about a washed up writer who finds wealth and success after taking a top-secret drug that unleashes the full power of his brain averaged a solid $6,894 from 2,756 theaters and played well to adults of both genders. Produced for $30M, the PG-13 film marked the first hit for Cooper as a leading man after numerous wins at the box office in ensemble pics, most notably 2009’s sleeper smash The Hangover. Robert De Niro co-starred.Audience research showed that cross-gender appeal was strong as females only slightly outnumbered males with 52% of the crowd. 60% was 25 and over while 57% was non-Caucasian. Despite heavy competition for adults right now, Limitless connected with its target audience thanks to an effective marketing push that included a high-profile TV spot during the Super Bowl over a month ago.Holding steady in second place in its third weekend of play was Johnny Depp’s animated comedy Rango which slipped only 32% to an estimated $15.3M. After 17 days the Paramount release has tallied an impressive $92.6M and will break nine digits by the end of the week becoming the bankable actor’s sixth $100M+ hit over the last eight years.Depp and Cooper will again face each other over Memorial Day weekend when The Hangover Part II opens against the second session of Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides. The debut of Kung Fu Panda 2 over the sequel-filled holiday will put Paramount in the mix too with another toon.With three new male-led films entering the marketplace, the military actioner Battle: Los Angeles took a huge hit tumbling 59% to an estimated $14.6M for third place. Produced for $70M, the Sony release has amassed an impressive $60.6M in its first ten days and looks headed for the $80-90M range.Matthew McConaughey’s courtroom drama The Lincoln Lawyer opened to respectable results in fourth with an estimated $13.4M playing to an older adult audience. Lionsgate’s R-rated pic averaged $4,950 from 2,707 theaters and was well-liked by critics which helped its chances at the box office given its older skew. Ryan Phillippe, Marisa Tomei, and William H. Macy also were part of the cast. The distributor won some industry press with its promotion with discount finder Groupon which allowed users to buy tickets for only $6. For the sake of box office reporting, Lionsgate used full ticket values and not the actual discounted price paid by consumers.The alien comedy Paul debuted close behind in fifth with an estimated $13.2M from 2,802 sites for a decent $4,695 average. Starring Simon Pegg and Nick Frost of Shaun of the Dead fame, the R-rated road picture also featured Seth Rogen voicing the title character. Studio research showed that the audience was 56% male and 58% 25 and older. Reviews were generally positive. Universal began the global release a month ago with its United Kingdom bow and has grossed $28.1M overseas so far.Only $245,000 separated the estimates for Lincoln and Paul so the film could swap positions when final grosses are reported on Monday. The distributors estimated similar Saturday-to-Sunday declines with Lincoln at 35% and Paul at 32%.The fairy tale remake Red Riding Hood fell 48% to an estimated $7.3M in its second weekend giving Warner Bros. $26M in ten days. A final total of around $40M seems likely. Matt Damon’s The Adjustment Bureau followed with an estimated $5.9M, off 49%, putting Universal at $48.8M to date.After a weak opening, the 3D toon Mars Needs Moms enjoyed a good sophomore hold slipping only 23% to an estimated $5.3M thanks to no new competition. But the Disney film stands at just $15.4M after ten days and looks set to end its run with only $30M.Off only 35% in ninth was the teen drama Beastly with an estimated $3.3M followed by the raunchy flick Hall Pass with an estimated $2.6M dropping 48%. Totals are $22.2M for the CBS Films pic and $39.6M for the Warner Bros. comedy.In limited release, Fox Searchlight debuted the critically acclaimed Paul Giamatti comedy Win Win in just five theaters and grossed an estimated $154,000 for a strong $30,723 average. Focus expanded its period drama Jane Eyre from four to 26 locations and delivered an estimated $478,000 for a sturdy $18,385 average. The total stands at $731,000.The top ten films grossed an estimated $99.8M which was down 10% from last year when Alice in Wonderland stayed in the top spot for a third time with $34.2M; but up 7% from 2009 when Knowing debuted at number one with $24.6M.Author: Gitesh Pandya, Box Office Guru!twitter.com/giteshpandya","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"spy, mutant, crossover, love, of, Film, Disney, Shondaland","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-Bradley-Cooper-More-Popular-Than-Lawyers-and-Aliens"},{"id":"47509060111560","title":"Video: Sex Tape Includes Puppets","content":"Video Interviewsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Video: Sex Tape Includes Puppetsby Grae Drake | July 18, 2014 |  CommentsCameron Diaz, Jason Segel, Rob Corddry, and Ellie Kemper star in Sex Tape.

The Owen Wilson comedy Hall Pass stumbled into second place during its opening weekend while Nicolas Cage’s latest action effort Drive Angry crashed and burned with an embarrassing ninth place debut for the actor who won an Oscar 15 years ago this spring.Thanks to strong legs and weak results from new releases, Disney’s 3D hit Gnomeo &amp; Juliet climbed into the top spot with an estimated $14.2M in its third weekend. Off just 26%, the G-rated tale has pulled in a stellar $75.1M and is headed for $110M or more. Solid word-of-mouth from kids and parents plus a lack of other family options has helped. This Friday, a new animated competitor arrives in the form of Johnny Depp’s Rango which is being backed by a massive marketing and distribution assault. However, that PG-rated pic may play a little older since its rating is due to “rude humor” and “smoking” so it may not hurt Gnomeo‘s hold on younger children.[rtimage]siteImageId=10240456[/rtimage]The Farrelly brothers, the ex-kings of raunchy comedies, hoped for their first number one hit in over a decade but were beaten down by a three-week old garden gnome. Their vacation-from-marriage pic Hall Pass debuted in second with an estimated $13.4M from 2,950 theaters for a mild $4,549 average. Falling below industry expectations, the R-rated film starring Owen Wilson and Jason Sudeikis failed to excite its target adult audience and its story about two husbands granted a no-questions-asked week away from their marriages turned off many women. Reviews were mostly bad and starpower wasn’t ample with Wilson just seen in two December comedies and Sudeikis never anchoring a feature film before.Falling from first to third was Liam Neeson’s action thriller Unknown which dropped a moderate 43% to an estimated $12.4M for a ten-day total of $42.8M. Warner Bros. should end its domestic run with about $70M. Adam Sandler’s Just Go With It followed with an estimated $11.1M, down 40%, for a $79.4M cume for Sony.Sophomore I Am Number Four grossed an estimated $11M thanks to a 43% decline, a good hold for a sci-fi flick with a built-in audience. With $37.7M in ten days, Disney should end up with around $60M. Paramount added more 3D footage to its tween sensation Justin Bieber: Never Say Never and fans responded with a weekend dip of only 31% to an estimated $9.2M. A film like this would normally fall by more than 50% at this point in its run. Total stands at an impressive $62.8M.[rtimage]siteImageId=10240460[/rtimage]Leading all films with 12 Oscar nominations, The King’s Speech added 300 more runs over Oscar weekend and rose 17% to an estimated $7.6M. That put The Weinstein Co. at a robust $114.5M with more to come in the weeks ahead. Close behind with an estimated $7.6M as well was a film likely to receive less Oscar attention next awards season, Big Mommas: Like Father, Like Son. Fox’s Martin Lawrence threequel fell 54% in its second frame and has banked $28.6M in ten days. Look for a $40M final and possible Razzie nods.In one of the worst showings ever for both Nicolas Cage and the 3D format, the action film Drive Angry bombed in its opening grossing a puny $5.1M, according to estimates. The Summit release averaged a lousy $2,241 from 2,290 theaters and failed to excite paying moviegoers. The marketing emphsized that the R-rated film was actually shot in 3D and wasn’t a conversion, but action fans still found no need in spending top dollar on Cage’s second film in as many months. His Season of the Witch also struck out with its $10.6M debut in January.Rounding out the weak top ten was the college thriller The Roommate which fell 48% to an estimated $2.1M in its fourth frame raising Sony’s total to a solid $35.9M.[rtimage]siteImageId=10240229[/rtimage]Below the top ten, top Oscar contenders enjoyed good holds as the awards drew near. Among Best Picture nominees, True Grit dipped just 20% to an estimated $1.9M, The Fighter rose 2% to an estimated $1.6M, and Spirit Award champ Black Swan inched up 2% as well to an estimated $1.4M. Totals stand at $167.1M, $90.4M, and $103.6M respectively. Seven of the ten Best Picture nominees have now grossed over $90M.The top ten films grossed an estimated $93.8M which was down 10% from last year when Shutter Island stayed in the top spot with $22.7M; but up 17% from 2009 when Madea Goes to Jail remained at number one with $16.2M. The Academy Awards did not fall on either of those frames.Author: Gitesh Pandya, Box Office Guru!","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"movies, Television, Amazon, Universal, on, and, TV, unscripted, Mystery, thriller, kaiju, CBS, drama","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-Gnomeo-and-Juliet-Holds-on-to-Top-Spot"},{"id":"47509060121802","title":"Video: The Purge Should Feature Dancing","content":"Video Interviewsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Video: The Purge Should Feature Dancingby Grae Drake | July 17, 2014 |  CommentsGrae Drake interviews Zach Gilford and Frank Grillo of The Purge: Anarchy on a very unusual set.

Another snowstorm affected theaters in the Northeast but a weekend with football made audiences more available.Opening at number one with a respectable but not stellar debut was the supernatural thriller The Rite starring Anthony Hopkins which scared up an estimated $15M which was enough to lead the weak frame. The Warner Bros. release about an American sent to the Vatican to study with a priest that specializes in exorcisms averaged a decent $5,027 from 2,985 locations. Reviews for the PG-13 pic were poor. Given the lack of scary movies since Halloween and the past success of exorcism-related films, a larger opening could have been expected. Last summer’s no-star mockumentary The Last Exorcism debuted to $20.4M. The CinemaScore for Rite was a B and the film skewed older as 64% of the crowd was 25 and over.Dropping a notch to second place, but holding up very well in its sophomore frame, was the Natalie Portman-Ashton Kutcher comedy No Strings Attached with an estimated $13.7M. Declining by only 31%, the Paramount release raised its ten-day tally to a solid $39.7M and could see a final gross of $70-80M. Unlike many other recent star-driven comedies, Strings was not too expensive to produce thanks to a $25M budget and will turn into a nice moneymaker for its backers. A lack of football this weekend certainly helped the female-skewing pic broaden its audience to include more young men.Two action films claimed third place with each reporting an estimated Friday-to-Sunday take of $11.5M. Sony’s The Green Hornet fell only 35% and enjoyed a good hold pushing its 17-day total to $78.8M on its way to a little past the $100M mark.Jason Statham’s latest action vehicle The Mechanic opened with an estimated $11.5M as well and reached the higher end of the range the actor has seen lately when anchoring a film. The R-rated remake of the 1972 Charles Bronson film averaged a decent $4,255 from 2,703 theaters for CBS Films. It was the second widest debut ever for a Statham-anchored action film behind only the 3,303 playdates for Transporter 2. Mechanic‘s debut came as good news to the action star who has stumbled in recent years with Crank: High Voltage and The Bank Job which debuted with $7M and $5.9M, respectively, but bounced back last summer as one of the main ingredients in Sylvester Stallone’s action hit The Expendables.To no surprise, Mechanic played best to the guys. The audience was 61% male and 64% over the age of 25. The CinemaScore was only a B- but the Friday-to-Saturday increase of 30% was more than twice the 14% of the frame’s other new release The Rite. CBS Films paid only $5M for North American rights plus P&amp;A.Final grosses to be released on Monday will determine the true third place film. Sony projected a 38% Saturday-to-Sunday decline for Hornet while Mechanic‘s Sunday was estimated to fall by only 31%. Most films in the top ten were projecting in the 35-40% rangeBest Picture contender The King’s Speech, which led all films with a dozen Academy Award nominations last week, saw its ticket sales surge thanks to the extra media attention and 877 additional screens. The Weinstein Co. release took in an estimated $11.1M, up a solid 41%, from 2,557 theaters after an expansion from 1,680 sites. Its average of $4,342 was only slightly down from last weekend’s $4,676. The Colin Firth-Geoffrey Rush drama has banked a strong $72.2M and is now headed past the $100M mark. Fueling its Oscar momentum, Speech director Tom Hooper won the top prize on Saturday from the Directors Guild of America boosting his odds significantly for winning the comparable award at the Oscars. Until this weekend, The Social Network‘s David Fincher had been seen as the front-runner.Rival Best Picture foe True Grit enjoyed a bump at the box office too inching up 4% to an estimated $7.6M. But unlike Speech, Grit actually lost theaters. Paramount’s hit Western now stands at $148.4M and is on course to reach more than $175M which is incredible for the genre and for the Coen brothers. The Dilemma suffered the worst decline in the top ten sliding 40% to an estimated $5.5M upping the cume to a lackluster $40.6M for Universal.Another pair of contenders for the top Oscar followed, each displaying potent legs. Fox Searchlight’s Black Swan dropped 13% to an estimated $5.1M and was followed by Paramount’s The Fighter which took in an estimated $4.1M for a scant 3% dip. Both films have been in wide release since December 17 and shed some screens this round. Totals stand at $90.7M and $78.4M, respectively. Still on the road to nine-digit territory, the leggy kidpic Yogi Bear rounded out the top ten with an estimated $3.2M, off 17%, for a $92.5M total.Fox Searchlight re-expanded its other Best Picture contender 127 Hours going from 69 to 916 locations and collected an estimated $2.1M this weekend bumping the cume to $13.4M.The Mexican-American comedy From Prada to Nada saw a soft debut in limited release opening to an estimated $1.1M from 256 theaters. Lionsgate’s pic about privileged Beverly Hills sisters forced to move to a tough Latino neighborhood in East Los Angeles averaged a mild $4,297. The Spanish-language drama Biutiful, featuring an Oscar-nominated performance by Javier Bardem, fared well in its limited bow grossing an estimated $461,000 from 57 sites for a solid $8,088 average. Including previous grosses from its Oscar-qualifying run in late December, the Roadside Attractions title has taken in $623,000 to date. Snubbed during the early part of awards season, the serious drama about a dying father has now entered the spotlight thanks to nods for Best Foreign Language Film and Best Actor.The top ten films grossed an estimated $88.2M which was down 15% from last year when Avatar stayed in the top spot with $31.3M; and off 8% from 2009 when Taken opened at number one with a surprisingly strong $24.7M.Author: Gitesh Pandya, Box Office Guru!","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"social, comic, Certified, Oscars, Summer, Netflix, TV, Toys, Disney, 93rd, Reality, Musical, Emmys, IFC, dragons","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-Anthony-Hopkins-Has-The-Rite-Stuff"},{"id":"47509062758611","title":"Video: Is Gerard Butler Crying or Falling Asleep","content":"Video Interviewsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Video: Is Gerard Butler Crying or Falling Asleepby Grae Drake | June 11, 2014 |  CommentsDan Deevy talks to Gerard Butler, Craig Ferguson, Djimon Hounsou, and Kit Harington about How to Train Your Dragon 2.

Paramount captured the top two spots as its other fall sequel Jackass 3D fell sharply from its opening last weekend but still kept bringing in the cash with a strong second place finish. The studio’s dynamic duo accounted for half of all ticket sales for the Top 20. Clint Eastwood’s Hereafter enjoyed a moderate debut in fourth place as it went nationwide while most holdovers remained solid with declines of less than 35%.Following up on 2009’s surprise blockbuster, Paranormal Activity 2 debuted at number one with a terrifying $41.5M, according to estimates, easily leading all films in the marketplace. The R-rated prequel haunted 3,216 locations and averaged a potent $12,904 with ticket sales being very front-loaded. Friday saw a stunning $20.1M debut including $6.3M from Thursday night’s midnight shows, Saturday tumbled by 35% to $13M, and Sunday was estimated to fall 36% to $8.4M. The first Activity became a phenomenon thanks to its midnight shows which helped to add a creepy feel to the theatrical experience and so the studio aggressively advertised those first shows on Thursday night allowing the Friday gross to account for a whopping 48% of the weekend take.[rtimage]siteImageId=10237966[/rtimage]Still, a massive audience came out allowing the demon-in-the-house pic to beat out the $39.1M debut of 2004’s The Grudge which had held the October horror opening record for six years. The Sarah Michelle Gellar pic sold more tickets since prices were lower back then, but it had the advantage of a PG-13 rating and a major star allowing it to reach a broader audience. Breaking $30M on opening weekend is a major feat for a fright flick while surpassing $40M is extremely rare. Last year’s Friday the 13th remake held the record for best R-rated horror debut with $40.6M, 48% of which came from Friday which was the 13th of February. Some of M. Night Shyamalan’s films have debuted higher, but many would categorize them as dramatic thrillers even though they were marketed as scary movies.Unlike the first Paranormal which slowly built its fan base and reached the number one spot in its fifth weekend, the second installment went wide right from the start. The opening nearly doubled the $21.1M that the last film grossed when it hit the top spot with what was the largest weekend gross of its entire run on its way to a $107.9M final. While it is too early to tell if the new film can match that cume, it certainly will be an extremely profitable movie thanks to a tiny $3M production cost. Marketing costs were much more though. Activity 2 should take a big hit next weekend when Lionsgate unleashes Saw 3D, the seventh and final chapter of the torture franchise which has ruled the Halloween season during most of the last six years.[rtimage]siteImageId=10237967[/rtimage]Following its record-breaking opening, Jackass 3D suffered an expected large sophomore drop but still pulled in solid numbers grossing an estimated $21.6M this weekend. The Paramount release has locked down an impressive $87.1M and has quickly become the top-grossing movie of this fall season after a mere ten days. Johnny Knoxville and company saw sales drop by 57% which was large but understandable given the front-loaded nature of three-quels. In fact, a fall of 60% or more would not have been surprising so the hold was good.Jackass: Number Two, which dropped by 50% in the second weekend, collected 72% of its eventual $72.8M final in the first ten days. Helped by extra surcharges, Jackass 3D should erode by a slightly faster pace and could end up in the vicinity of $120M which would be $100M more than its production cost.[rtimage]siteImageId=10237816[/rtimage]Among non-Viacom films, Red led the charge with an estimated $15M finishing in third place in its second weekend. The PG-13 action comedy starring Bruce Willis, Morgan Freeman, and Helen Mirren declined by only 31% and boosted its ten-day tally to a solid $43.5M. A final gross in the area of $80M seems likely. The Summit release cost $58M to produce (after subsidies are realized) and is playing to a mature adult audience so legs could remain strong.Also targeting the older crowd was Clint Eastwood’s latest drama Hereafter starring new dad (again) Matt Damon which expanded nationwide to the tune of $12M, according to estimates. The Warner Bros. tale of people from three parts of the world with their own connections to the afterlife averaged a decent $5,504 from 2,181 locations after playing in just six houses last weekend. Cume to date is $12.3M. Films Eastwood directs but does not star in generally depend on favorable reviews but Hereafter earned only mixed marks. Oscar buzz has been virtually non-existent for this entry, but the performance did beat out the first wide weekend tallies for the 80-year-old director’s Invictus ($8.6M), Changeling ($9.4M), and Flags of Our Fathers ($10.2M).[rtimage]siteImageId=10237817[/rtimage]Oscar hopeful The Social Network followed in fifth place with an estimated $7.3M sliding just 29% as it continues to show remarkable strength in its fourth frame. Sony has banked $72.9M to date and still has an outside chance of hitting $100M if the Facebook pic can still hold up this well in the coming weeks. Also displaying great legs with audiences was Secretariat which dipped only 26% to an estimated $6.9M for a $37.4M cume in 17 days for Disney.Rounding out the rest of this weekend’s robust top ten were four films that also dropped by less than 35% each. Off 31% in its third round was the parenting comedy Life as We Know It with an estimated $6.2M and $37.6M total for Warner Bros. The studio’s kidpic Legend of the Guardians took in an estimated $3.2M, down 25%, raising the sum to $50.2M.[rtimage]siteImageId=10237261[/rtimage]Ben Affleck’s crime drama The Town fell 32% to an estimated $2.7M putting Warner Bros. at $84.7M thus far. The Emma Stone comedy Easy A placed tenth with an estimated $1.8M, down 34%, and a solid $54.8M for Sony to date.The top ten films grossed an estimated $118.1M which was up 17% from last year when Paranormal Activity climbed into the top spot in its fifth weekend with $21.1M; and up 2% from 2008 when High School Musical 3: Senior Year debuted at number one with $42M.By Gitesh Pandya of Box Office Guru","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"movie, Pacific","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-Paranormal-Activity-2-Scares-Up-The-Top-Spot"},{"id":"47509062781142","title":"Video: Maleficent‘s Elle Fanning Hopes She Doesn’t Seem Crazy","content":"Video Interviewsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Video: Maleficent's Elle Fanning Hopes She Doesn't Seem Crazyby Grae Drake | May 30, 2014 |  CommentsDan Deevy talks to Elle Fanning, Sharlto Copley, and Sam Riley about bird beaks, genuflecting and perceived insanity during the filming of Maleficent.&nbsp;","section":"Video Interviews","tags":"school, Unbreakable, game-of-thrones, Access, Walt, Paramount, Family, movies, Film, marvel","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"video-maleficents-elle-fanning-hopes-she-doesnt-seem-crazy"},{"id":"47509062792408","title":"Video: Hugh Jackman Covers Justin Bieber Songs","content":"Video Interviewsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Video: Hugh Jackman Covers Justin Bieber Songsby Grae Drake | May 21, 2014 |  CommentsEllen Page divulges Hugh Jackman’s ultimate secret: that he sings Justin Bieber songs in his spare time.

Sandler won the runner-up spot with a strong debut for his latest comedy Grown Ups while Cruise struggled with his action-comedy Knight and Day which posted only moderate results in third place.[rtimage]MapID=1196045&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=48&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Disney and Pixar easily held onto the box office crown for a second straight weekend as Toy Story 3 captured an estimated $59M in ticket sales in its sophomore frame, according to estimates. The 3D toon’s drop of 47% was large, but was still the lowest of any film in the top ten. The cume to date rose to a stellar $226.6M after just ten days, the best start ever for any Pixar film. With kids out of school for summer vacation and the busy Fourth of July holiday coming up, Toy Story 3 may just surge to the $400M mark making it the one to beat this year for all other blockbusters.The animation studio’s last film Up, also a 3D pic with extra high ticket prices, soared to $137.2M in its first ten days which accounted for 47% of the eventual $293M domestic total. Ten-day shares for previous June releases from Pixar include 57% for WALL-E , 53% for Ratatouille, and 48% for Cars. For WALL-E and Ratatouille, Independence Day holiday business fell within the first ten days leading to the higher shares. Later this week, Toy Story 3 will surpass the $245.8M of Toy Story 2 and later will fly past the $339.7M of Finding Nemo to become Pixar’s top grosser ever, but is unlikely to match the fish flick’s 56 million tickets sold.[rtimage]MapID=1223577&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=33&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Adam Sandler returned to his safe zone and landed the fourth best opening of his career with the broad comedy Grown Ups which bowed to an estimated $41M. Sony released the PG-13 pic in 3,534 locations and averaged a strong $11,602 per site. The reunion laugher co-starring Kevin James, Chris Rock, David Spade, Rob Schneider, and Salma Hayek opened almost exactly like some previous Sandler films that featured little to no extra starpower. The comedian’s only bigger debuts were $47.6M for 2005’s The Longest Yard, $42.2M for 2003’s Anger Management, and $41.5M for Big Daddy which sold about 50% more tickets when it opened this very weekend eleven years ago.As usual, reviews were terrible for Grown Ups. However these Sandler vehicles are not made to impress critics, but to give moviegoers interested in low-brow humor a few chuckles as they escape the aggravations of everyday life. Budgeted at under $80M, the film skewed younger and more female despite being centered around men approaching middle age. Studio research showed that 53% of the crowd was female and 52% was under 25. Sandler saw his impressive streak of seven consecutive years with $100M+ blockbusters come to an end last year with his Judd Apatow project Funny People which bombed grossing just $51.9M overall. The funnyman’s summer comedies usually end up tripling their opening weekend figures so Grown Ups should have no problem reaching nine-digit territory.[rtimage]MapID=1226594&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=9&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Coming in third for the weekend were Tom Cruise and Cameron Diaz who pulled in an estimated $20.5M for their new secret agent pic Knight and Day. The Fox release averaged a decent but not stellar $6,617 per theater from 3,098 playdates. Since its Wednesday launch, the PG-13 film has grossed $27.8M. Despite today’s higher ticket prices, Knight delivered the second lowest opening for Cruise over the last decade faring better than only the $6.7M of 2007’s Lions For Lambs.Given that it returned Hollywood’s former most bankable star to the type of action hero role audiences have always liked, and that it boasted additional starpower from the well-liked Diaz who can do action and comedy with the greatest of ease, the turnout was soft. Reviews were mixed but generally not too bad. Still, audience excitement was never too high for this movie. Fox is hoping that good word-of-mouth will carry the film forward since Knight is not a sequel or a franchise pic so it was never expected to have huge upfront demand. The $100M+ budgeted film may have been hurt by following a string of star-driven action-comedies like Killers, The A-Team, Date Night, and The Bounty Hunter. A bad title didn’t help either.[rtimage]MapID=1226668&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=43&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Sony’s hit remake The Karate Kid fell 49% in its third round taking in an estimated $15.4M. The Jaden Smith fight flick has banked an impressive $135.6M and could be headed for the $175M mark beating the $162.6M of the young actor’s debut film The Pursuit of Happyness opposite his father Will Smith.[rtimage]MapID=1212410&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=51&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]The A-Team fell 58% in its third weekend to an estimated $6M pushing its 17-day tally to a mediocre $62.8M for Fox. Universal’s comedy Get Him to the Greek grossed an estimated $3M, off 51%, raising Universal’s cume to $54.5M. Close behind with an estimated $2.9M was the 3D sequel Shrek Forever After which dropped 49% for a $229.3M total.[rtimage]MapID=1205710&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=19&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Down 50%, Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time took in an estimated $2.8M and lifted its domestic tally to $86.2M. The assassin comedy Killers followed in ninth place with $2M, down a troubling 60%, giving Lionsgate $44M to date. The Warner Bros. megaflop Jonah Hex collapsed by 70% grossing an estimated $1.6M for a lousy $9.1M in ten days.The top ten films grossed an estimated $154.2M which was down 19% from last year when Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen opened in the top spot with $109M; and down 13% from 2008 when WALL-E debuted at number one with $63.1M.Written by Gitesh Pandya of Box Office Guru.","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"Channel, Comic","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-Toy-Story-3-Stays-on-Top"},{"id":"47509064388839","title":"Video: Captain America Isn’t Getting Any","content":"Video Interviewsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Video: Captain America Isn't Getting Anyby Grae Drake | April 4, 2014 |  CommentsChris Evans, Samuel L.

But the overallmarketplace was still in a late-spring funk with the Top 20 failing to reach$100M for the second consecutive frame. But the rebound is just a week away asthis summer’s kick-off picture Iron Man 2 made aloud entrance overseas grossing over $100M this weekend from internationalterritories ahead of its domestic launch on Thursday night.New Line Cinema’s iconic horror franchise came back to life thanks to the topspot debut of the new version of ANightmare on Elm Street which bowed to an impressive $32.2M, accordingto estimates, to score the seventh best April opening in history. Scaringaudiences in 3,332 theaters, the R-rated redo averaged $9,665 per location andwas extremely front-loaded over the course of the weekend. Friday launched witha stellar $15.8M including Thursday night midnight shows. Saturday tumbled 33%to $10.6M while Sunday is expected to drop by another 45% to $5.8M. Horrorfilms, especially remakes and sequels, tend to attract their biggest crowd onopening day and then suffer sizable declines.[rtimage]MapID=1211478&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=22&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Nightmare‘sdebut fell below the $40.6M bow of last spring’s fright remake Friday the13th, but beat out the $28.1M opening of 2003’s The TexasChainsaw Massacre redo. All three were produced by Michael Bay’sPlatinum Dunes which has cornered the market in this field. The new Freddy beatout the debuts of many other recent fright remakes like Halloween($26.4M), My Bloody Valentine ($21.2M), and Prom Night($20.8M).While Freddy Krueger held a tight grip on domestic multiplexes, Tony Starkseized control of the rest of the world with Paramount and Marvel’sinternational launch of Iron Man 2 whichgrossed a sensational $100.2M from 6,764 theaters in 53 markets around the worldsince its first debuts on Wednesday in certain territories. Leading the way werethe United Kingdom with $12.2M from 528 sites, Korea with $10.8M from 855,Australia’s $8.8M from 251, and France’s $8.2M from 722. IMAX also set a newrecord for an overseas 2D opening grossing $2.25M from 48 large-format screensfor a sizzling $47,000 average beating the old high of $2.1M set by Transformers 2 last summer.Iron Man 2 opens next week in several more countries like China, India,Turkey, and Germany and will fly into more than 4,000 theaters across NorthAmerica. Paramount had previously slated the Jon Favreau-directed sequel to openthis very weekend but when Disney pulled The Chronicles of Narnia: The Voyage of the Dawn Treader out of its May7 date, Paramount pushed its tentpole back a week domestically. The Mouse Houselater dropped out of the Narnia business with Fox stepping in to release DawnTreader this December 10 in 3D.[rtimage]MapID=1197264&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=49&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]TheViking toonHow To Train Your Dragon dropped out of the number one spot again butdeclined by only 30% to an estimated $10.8M boosting the cume for the 3Dblockbuster to $192.4M. Look for the DreamWorks Animation-Paramount title tobreak the $200M mark next weekend. Last summer’s Up from Pixar and Disneyis the only other 3D animated film to ever cross the double-century barrier.A pair of female-skewing comedies followed. Date Night withSteve Carelland Tina Feyenjoyed the smallest dip among all wide releases dropping only 27% to anestimated $7.6M for a sturdy $73.6M total to date for Fox. The Jennifer Lopezpic The Back-up Planfared well in its second weekend sliding a moderate 41% to an estimated $7.2M.With $23M in ten days, CBS Films should end up with a decent $40M or so.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Opening in fifth place with dismal results was the family comedy FurryVengeance starring Brendan Fraser which grossed an estimated $6.5M.Averaging a poor $2,169 from 2,997 locations (an unusually high playdate countfor a film that has always had little to no buzz), the PG-rated film aboutforest animals seeking revenge on a real estate developer trying to build ontheir land played mostly to kids and moms. Though in its sixth weekend of play,Dragon proved to be a much stronger draw for families despite the higher3D ticket prices so Furry suffered from both lack of consumer interestplus formidable competition.[rtimage]MapID=1212891&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=6&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]WarnerBros. claimed the next two spots. The action thriller The Losersgrossed an estimated $6M in its second mission dropping only 36%. But with only$18.1M in ten days and Stark Industries set to monopolize the action crowdstarting this Thursday night at midnight, an underwhelming $30-35M final seemsset. Clash of the Titans fell by 36% to an estimated $5.7M for a $154M tallythus far. Like most high-profile 3D films, Clash has been displaying goodlegs later into its run.The super hero flick Kick-Assfell 52% to an estimated $4.5M giving Lionsgate $42.2M so far. Death at aFuneral followed with an estimated $4M, down 50%, putting Sony’s totalat $34.8M. Disney’s Oceans sank adisturbing 57% in its second weekend to an estimated $2.6M.

The brutal R-rated drama averaged a sturdy $7,406 from 3,173 locations and opened in between the $22M of George Clooney’s The Monuments Men from February and the $25.7M of Tom Hanks’ Captain Phillips from this same month last year. All skewed to an older adult audience using an A-list actor as the anchor.Fury&lt; scored good reviews from critics and pleased paying audiences too as evidenced by its good A- CinemaScore grade. Studio research showed that the crowd was, not surprisingly, 60% male and 51% over 35. Connecting with older men at this time of year is often difficult due to sports competition from NFL and college football plus the baseball playoffs. While Fury&lt; did not score one of top ten opening weekends of Pitt's career, its older skew, good buzz and light competition over the next two weeks should allow the $68M production to build nicely. And overseas potential is solid given the star's drawing power and the Germany-set story.Despite competition from Brad and the other new releases, two-time champ Gone Girl held up quite well in its third round slipping only 33% to an estimated $17.8M and joining the century club in the process. This fall’s biggest hit has now banked $107.1M and could find its way to the vicinity of $150M from North America. Only five September/October releases have ever climbed to that level before. Girl cost $61M to produce and may reach a global gross five times that amount.The new animated offering The Book of Life premiered in third place with an estimated $17M from 3,071 sites for a good $5,536 average. That was about even with the recent toon The Boxtrolls which bowed to $17.3M and a $4,987 average in late September. Both were non-sequels offering a unique visual style for family audiences. Fox’s PG-rated Book had Mexican influences from its director, producer and source material and 30% of the audience was Latino. Overall demos showed the crowd to be 57% female and 54% under 25. 3D screens made up 31% of the gross, a low figure but common nowadays for toons. Book of Life features voices from Channing Tatum, Zoe Saldana, Diego Luna, Christina Applegate, Ice Cube, and Cheech Marin plus earned positive reviews.The best weekend gross among the sophomore titles was an estimated $12M for Disney’s Alexander and the Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Day. Off only 34%, the Steve Carell comedy has collected a sturdy $36.9M to date and could be headed for the neighborhood of $70M.Author Nicholas Sparks suffered his worst opening weekend ever for a film based on his novels as the romance The Best of Me opened in fifth to an estimated $10.2M from 2,936 locations for a mild $3,474 average. It was the ninth movie adapted from his books but audiences did not show up. Reviews were terrible and starpower was low with Michelle Monaghan and James Marsden anchoring. The PG-13 entry was released by Relativity which has not yet opened a film north of $13M this year.The effects-heavy thriller Dracula Untold fell 58% in its second weekend to an estimated $9.9M boosting the cume to $40.7M for Universal. A solid $95.7M from overseas markets during these pre-Halloween weeks has raised the global gross to $136.4M.Fellow sophomore The Judge held up moderately well with an estimated $7.9M, off 40%. The Warner Bros. release has grossed a modest $26.8M and looks headed for about $45M. The studio’s horror hit Annabelle dropped 50% to an estimated $7.9M as well for $74.1M to date making it 2014’s highest grossing fright film. A final of close to $90M seems likely.A pair of September hits rounded out the top ten. Denzel Washington’s The Equalizer grossed an estimated $5.5M, down 44%, for a $89.2M cume for Sony. Fox’s The Maze Runner fell 40% to an estimated $4.5M banking $90.8M to date. Both will reach nine digits.Oscar hopeful Birdman got off to a thunderous start in platform release debuting to an estimated $415,000 from only four locations in New York and Los Angeles for an eye-popping $103,750 average. That was the second highest opening weekend average of any film over the past two years. Only Wes Anderson’s The Grand Budapest Hotel fared better when it bowed last March to a $202,792 average. Both were released in four theaters on the first weekend by Fox Searchlight.Directed by Alejandro González Iñárritu, Birdman stars Michael Keaton, Zach Galifianakis, Edward Norton, Emma Stone, and Naomi Watts and earned sensational reviews. The R-rated film is eyed as a major contender in the picture, director, cinematography, and acting races. Searchlight will expand Birdman on Friday into 18 new markets for a total of about 50 theaters and continue to roll the awards contender out into November.Also faring very well in its limited release debut was the race relations satire Dear White People which grossed an estimated $344,000 from 11 playdates for a strong $31,273 average. The Roadside Attractions release has earned great reviews across the board and also took home a Special Jury Award from Sundance last winter.The top ten films grossed an estimated $116.3M which was up 28% from last year when Gravity remained at number one with $30M; and even with 2012 when Paranormal Activity 4 opened on top with $29M.Follow Gitesh on Twitter!","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"mockumentary, Geographic, Grammys, TV, jones, aliens, Arrowverse","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-Fury-Wins-the-Weekend-Battle"},{"id":"47509112765128","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: Transformers Leads Sluggish Holiday Frame","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: Transformers Leads Sluggish Holiday Frameby Gitesh Pandya | July 6, 2014 |  CommentsThe Independence Day holiday session was lacking in box office fireworks as the Autobots tentpole Transformers: Age of Extinction led the marketplace for a second straight time while new releases brought one good debut and a handful of lackluster ones that paying audiences were mostly uninterested in.The Paramount four-quel tumbled hard in its sophomore session, by 64%, and grossed an estimated $36.4M to boost the cume up to $174.7M. That puts the Michael Bay actioner on track to finish its domestic run in the vicinity of $275M making it the lowest-grossing installment of the series.But overseas, the picture continues to shine with an estimated $95.8M weekend from 37 markets lifting the international total to a stunning $400.9M. Extinction is running an impressive 21% ahead of the last film Dark of the Moon in the same markets after the same number of days proving again how important foreign markets are for aging franchises. China accounts for more than half of the overseas take with a mind-blowing $212.8M which is 22% higher than the current domestic tally. Worldwide stands at $575.6M with a large number of top territories still to open after the World Cup.The new Melissa McCarthy comedy Tammy opened far back in second place with an estimated $21.2M over the Friday-to-Sunday period and $32.9M since its launch on Tuesday night. The R-rated film was slammed by critics as being unfunny but instead was hoping to connect with average moviegoers over the long weekend. Given the heat the star carried into the release thanks to all her success last year, it was a rather uneventful launch. Luckily the Warner Bros. release did not cost too much.The five-day holiday figure came close to the three-day non-holiday $34.6M opening of McCarthy’s hit Identity Thief and below the $39.1M of her summer smash The Heat. Both opened last year and positioned the actress as one of the most popular comedy stars of today, male or female. But the same rules of the movie industry apply to all – audiences will keep coming unless you don’t make a good product.Sony launched the new fright flick Deliver Us From Evil and audience turnout was the same as for most films of the genre all year long – unimpressive. The R-rated pic from former super-producer Jerry Bruckheimer opened to an estimated $9.5M from 3,049 locations for a lackluster $3,116 average. Total since Wednesday is just $15M. 2014 has certainly been a horrible year for horror. Still in the top five was the buddy cop smash 22 Jump Street with an estimated $9.4M, off 41%, for a new cume of $158.9M for the studio.Also in its fourth weekend, the toon sequel How to Train Your Dragon 2 grossed an estimated $8.8M which was down just 34% helped by the holiday. The Fox release has banked $140M to date. Rival kidpic Earth to Echo debuted with an estimated $8.3M from 3,230 theaters for a mild $2,554 average. The PG-rated sci-fi film for tweens struggled to capture its audience although Relativity is hoping that students on summer vacation will continue to find the film in the weeks to come. Cume since its Wednesday start is $13.5M.The smash hit Maleficent eased only 27% in its sixth round to an estimated $6.1M for Disney. Domestic climbed to $213.9M while the worldwide tally soared to $630.2M. Older audiences came out for the Clint Eastwood film Jersey Boys which slipped only 33% to an estimated $5.2M for a new total of $36.7M for Warner Bros.Think Like A Man Too fell another 53% in its third weekend to an estimated $4.9M putting Sony at $57.2M to date. Tom Cruise’s latest sci-fi thriller Edge of Tomorrow rounded out the top ten with an estimated $3.6M, down 33%, for a $90.9M domestic cume surpassing last year’s Oblivion.Lionsgate generated a soft debut for its documentary America which bowed to only $2.7M from 1,105 theaters for a weak $2,466 average per site. The 5-day wide opening was $4M and reviews were mostly negative. However, the CinemaScore grade was a terrific A+.The top ten films grossed an estimated $113.3M which was down a troubling 48% from last year when Despicable Me 2 opened at number one with $83.5M; and down 36% from 2012 when The Amazing Spider-Man debuted on top with $62M.Follow Gitesh on Twitter!","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"Sundance, Disney","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-Transformers-Leads-Sluggish-Holiday-Frame"},{"id":"47509076056415","title":"Video Interviews with The Host Cast: Saoirse Ronan, Max Irons, and Jake Abel","content":"Video Interviewsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Video Interviews with The Host Cast: Saoirse Ronan, Max Irons, and Jake Abelby Grae Drake | March 28, 2013 |  CommentsTo the unschooled, The Host is just a movie about aliens taking over the planet and leaving teenage girls confused about which boys to make out with.

The Fox tentpole averaged a muscular $18,402 from 3,967 locations and took advantage of stellar reviews, low competition in the marketplace, and a built-in audience which liked its predecessor Rise of the Planet of the Apes from three summers ago. Dawn opened 33% better than Rise.The studio had a solid product to sell and marketed it very aggressively and in advance including promotions during high-profile sports events over the past month to raise awareness. Demographic data showed that the audience was normal for this type of action flick. Males made up 58% of the crowd and 55% were over 25. 36% of the gross came from 3D screens and a good A- CinemaScore indicates that customers were mostly satisfied with Caesar and his crew as they fought for their survival against the damn dirty humans.Dawn was not the typical sequel. The story took place a decade after Rise plus the director and human cast were all new. With positive buzz and no new action tentpoles opening next week, the $170M-budgeted film could find its way to about $200M from North America alone beating the $176.8M of Rise.Overseas, Fox is waiting until the completion of the World Cup before attacking most markets but it did enter 26 territories this weekend with an estimated $31.1M. Korea and Australia were the only major ones, however. Rise enjoyed an incredible run in overseas markets and with substantial growth since 2011 in the international box office – especially in China – Dawn looks to find its way to over $600M in global box office. The next film in the series is already slotted on the calendar for July 29, 2016 with Matt Reeves returning to direct.After two weeks at number one, Transformers: Age of Extinction fell to second place and grossed an estimated $16.5M. The Michael Bay actioner fell 56% in its third weekend which was not shocking considering the direct hit it took from Dawn and the fact that four-quels erode quickly. Paramount has banked $209M to date and is headed for a domestic finish of about $250M making North America the second biggest market for the Autobots flick.China continued to shine with another $25M this weekend lifting the total there to an amazing $262.6M making it the all-time box office champ in that market. That’s a bigger total than any film has made in the U.S. this year. 12 new markets opened and combined with strong holdover territories to deliver a stunning $102M this weekend. That sent the international cume soaring to $543.5M and the worldwide tally to $752.5M. Age of Extinction is now 2014’s top-grossing global blockbuster and it still has not opened in many key markets such as Brazil, France, Germany, and Italy which all launch this coming week. The new Transformers even has a realistic shot at beating the international gross of The Avengers. No studio exec would dare put a stop to funding more of these Bay smash-a-thons.With no new comedies opening, Melissa McCarthy’s Tammy enjoyed a decent second weekend hold falling 40% to an estimated $12.9M for a new total of $57.4M. Reviews were poor and even the CinemaScore was a dismal C+ so a larger tumble was expected. However, sophomore films opened mid-week last week for the holiday session so second weekend declines were not as bad as usual. Costing just $25M to produce, the road comedy from Warner Bros. looks to end its domestic run with about $85-90M.The summer’s top-grossing comedy, 22 Jump Street, followed with an estimated $6.7M in its fifth weekend. Off just 32%, the leggy Sony sequel has banked an impressive $172M. Down 35% in its fifth round, How to Train Your Dragon 2 grossed an estimated $5.9M pushing the domestic tally to $152.1M. It is running 15% behind the pace of its 2010 predecessor. Given that this is the first summer in nine years without a Pixar film, Dragon should be doing better.Kidpic Earth to Echo followed its soft debut with a 34% slide to an estimated $5.5M giving Relativity $24.6M so far. A $40M final seems likely. Horror pic Deliver Us From Evil dropped 52% in its second weekend to an estimated $4.7M giving Sony $25M to date. Look for a $35-40M finish. 2014 remains dreadful for the fright genre.No summer film has spent more weeks in the top ten than Maleficent. The Angelina Jolie smash took eighth place in its seventh weekend with an estimated $4.2M, down 32%, for a new domestic cume of $222M making it the top-grossing non-sequel of the season. Disney’s worldwide tally is now a stellar $669M.The indie film Begin Again expanded from 175 to 939 locations nationwide and jumped into the top ten with an estimated $2.9M. Averaging a mild $3,126 per theater, The Weinstein Co. release starring Keira Knightley and Mark Ruffalo has collected $5.3M to date. Reviews have been fairly good.Jersey Boys and Think Like A Man Too dropped by about half and tied for tenth place with an estimated $2.5M each. Cumes are $41.7M for Warner Bros. and $61.9M for Sony.The critically-acclaimed drama Boyhood enjoyed a sparkling debut in platform release with an estimated $359,000 from only five theaters in Los Angeles, Manhattan, and Brooklyn for a sensational $71,800 average. That was the second best opening weekend average of the year behind The Grand Budapest Hotel‘s industry record $202,792 from four theaters back in March. Film critics have been gushing over Boyhood which was shot over 12 years with the same cast and centers around a boy’s life from ages 6 to 18. With Oscar buzz spreading and expansions to more markets to come, the IFC Films release will remain a major box office factor for the rest of the summer.The top ten films grossed an estimated $134.8M which was down 27% from last year when Despicable Me 2 stayed at number one with $43.9M; and off 10% from 2012 when Ice Age: Continental Drift debuted on top with $46.6M.Follow Gitesh on Twitter!","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"Pop, Fire, Hulu, Quiz, shows, breaking, facebook, heist, awards, 99%, Ice, Review, Films","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-Dawn-Of-The-Planet-Of-The-Apes-Outshines-the-Competition"},{"id":"47509077126508","title":"Date Slate:  Happy Valentine’s Day","content":"Video Interviewsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Date Slate: Happy Valentine's Dayby Grae Drake | February 13, 2013 |  CommentsIn her time off, Grae Drake enjoys loitering around theaters and asking people questions.

Titles like The Unholy and Separation inspired neither critics nor moviegoers to escape a real-life horror for a fictional one. Established horror, on the other hand – with the exception of Saw reboot, Spiral – appears to be connecting with folks at just the right time. Warner Bros. chose not to budge with their latest Conjuring entry when A Quiet Place Part II moved into the Memorial Day slot the weekend before its planned release. Turns out the new story featuring Ed and Lorraine Warren lured enough folks away from last week’s sequel – despite being available with an HBO Max subscription – to win this week’s big horror battle. But John Krasinski’s film looks as if it will be winning the war and then some.King of the Crop: Devil Impresses at the Top, But May Still End Up Low Point in Conjuring Universe(Photo by Ben Rothstein, © 2021 Warner Bros. Entertainment Inc. All Rights Reserved.)The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It, the third movie in the Conjuring series, switched directors from James Wan to The Curse of La Llorona’s Michael Chaves. With the change, the series’ Tomatometer scores went from 86% for&nbsp;The Conjuring&nbsp;and 80% for The Conjuring 2 down to 60% for The Devil Made Me Do It, and box office-wise, the movie opened to $24 million compared to the original’s $41 million and the first sequel’s $40 million. Once again, that’s a very solid number for the pandemic era (the third best three-day weekend), even if it will soon be judged amongst numerous other light-at-the-end-of-the-tunnel pandemic numbers.How many more people would have spent money for the movie if it were not also available on HBO Max? That’s a number lost to history, but the movie still opened bigger than the third Annabelle film ($20.26 million), which is the lowest grossing film in the Conjuring universe with a still impressive $74.1 million. The Devil Made Me Do It is now likely to have that distinction, given what we’re seeing in terms of “legs” at the pandemic box office. (WB’s Mortal Kombat opened to $23.3 million and will fail to even double that amount.) At a budget of $39 million (the highest in the Universe), The Devil Made Me Do It will need a little international help (but not a lot) to turn a profit as every other film in the universe has done.Rotten Returns: Spirit Fails To Draw Families, Despite A Two-Decade Wait(Photo by © Universal / courtesy Everett Collection)Universal may have been better off taking a Trolls World Tour approach to animated sequel Spirit Untamed. The film, spun off from the nearly 20-year-old Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron, earned just $6.2 million in theaters this weekend. That is less than both Tom &amp; Jerry ($14.1 million) and Raya and the Last Dragon ($8.5 million) opened to in February and March when only a quarter of the country was vaccinated and some theater chains had not even re-opened yet. Untamed is not a heavily budgeted film, at $30 million, but it is doubtful it will have anything like the kind of sustained attendance that Raya had. The $80 million 2002 film was hardly a success story but had a decent turnover from its $17.7 million opening towards a $73.2 million domestic finish. Untamed may only get about 25-30% of that and is likely to see attendance drop now that family-friendly competitor Peter Rabbit 2 has moved its release up to next week.The Top Ten and Beyond: A Quiet Place II Comes In Second and Is About to Break a $100 Million DroughtA Quiet Place Part II may have fallen to second place (barely), but these are all fairly solid numbers in its favor. The first film dropped just 34.3% during its second weekend to $32.97 million and was bested by Rampage by less than $3 million; Part II fell 59% this weekend to $19.5 million, which is a much steeper drop than fellow $47 million Memorial Day weekend films (Madagascar, Kung Fu Panda 2, 2005’s The Longest Yard), which fell between 40.5-49.9%, but it is in the vicinity of Godzilla vs. Kong, which fell 56.9% off its opening weekend after a front-loaded Wednesday-Thursday start and $15 million less in its Friday-Sunday weekend than the Quiet Place sequel.Krasinski’s film is becoming the new standard to beat in this period, taking in over $88 million in its first 10 days, and is hoping to pass GvK to become the first film since Sonic the Hedgehog on February 23, 2020 to gross $100 million. After $463,000 this weekend, GvK stands at $99.1 million; if Quiet falls off just 55% or less from last week’s weekdays haul, it could reach $100 million by Thursday. A Quiet Place Part II is currently on pace somewhere between Mad Max: Fury Road and Terminator Salvation, which would put it on the path for somewhere between $130 million and 140 million when all is said and done. It’s nice to be able to consider first estimates again as theaters begin to make their comeback.Meanwhile, Cruella – which, like A Quiet Place II this weekend, made news when it was announced a sequel was on the way – took in $11.2 million this weekend, which is the third-best second weekend of the pandemic era. But the $43.6 million it has made to date puts it in the territory of After Earth and Battleship, two notorious failures for their studios that finished with $60 million and $65 million domestically. Even aided by international grosses of $183 million and $237 million, they were expensive failures. Cruella’s costs have been widely disparate in reports, but the answer is likely somewhere between the $130 million and $209 million budgets of those summertime busts, and Disney’s film has only made $16 million internationally so far, less than the premium streaming total of $20-plus million it made last weekend. They must be feeling optimistic given the sequel announcement.On These Dates In Box Office History…(Photo by © Warner Bros. )June 4: In 2017, Wonder Woman reached $100 million in just its third day of release with $29.75 million. Gal Gadot’s future villain, Kristen Wiig, saw Bridesmaids reach the same milestone with $4.96 million on its 23rd day in 2011. Over to the $150 million club, where Shrek made $2.48 million on day 20 to reach it. Four years earlier, The Lost World: Jurassic Park took only 13 days to do it with $2.36 million. Then in 2018, Solo: A Star Wars Story grossed $2.96 million on just its 11th day of release, though it would ultimately gross less than The Lost World and Shrek. Fast Five achieved $200 million in 37 days with $1.37 million on this day in 2011. Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith made $10.45 million in its 17th day to cross $300 million.June 5: This has been a big day for animated films (and one live-action remake). In 2011, Kung Fu Panda 2 reached $100 million in 11 days with $7.26 million; Madagascar did it in 10 days in 2005 with $8.41 million; and Up took only eight days to reach it in 2009 with $13.07 million. Guy Ritchie’s Aladdin grossed $5.1 million on this day to hit $200 million in 13 days. It was also the day in 2004 that Shrek 2 grossed $15.56 million to hit $300 million on its 18th day of release.June 6: The $100 million line was crossed by three films this day. In 2009, it took 17 days for Terminator Salvation to do it with $3.37 million, and both Disney’s Maleficent (2014) and Finding Nemo (2003) did it on their eighth day with $10.18 million and $12.3 million, respectively. While Nemo was reaching $100 million in 2003, that same day Bruce Almighty reached $150 million on its 15th day with $6.7 million. But the biggest milestone of this date was reached in 1999 when Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace grossed $10.62 million on day 19 to hit $250 million.On the Vine: In the Heights Dances Into Theaters with Huge Critical Acclaim(Photo by Macall Polay/©Warner Bros.)In the Heights, based on Lin-Manuel Miranda’s 2008 Broadway musical, currently sits high on the Tomatometer, Certified Fresh at 99%, and could be poised to be one of the breakout hits of the summer.

Meanwhile, Chaos Walking and Boogie disappoint while Tom &amp; Jerry proves a force on the weekend of March 5-7, 2021.by Erik Childress | March 7, 2021 |  CommentsMovie theaters are reopening in New York City — some of them anyway. And to 25% capacity. Vaccination levels are exceeding estimations from January and now we have been told that vaccines will be available for every American by the end of May. Normalcy is seemingly coming and people can sense it, especially those at the movie studios who continue to make schedule moves. The waters are being tested. After the numbers posted by Tom &amp; Jerry last week does the performance of Raya and the Last Dragon tell us anything more? Well, yes. And no.King of the Crop: Raya’s $8.6 Million Opening Might Be A Sign Of Hope – And Not Quite As Soft As It Seems(Photo by ©Walt Disney Studios Motion Picture)Disney’s Raya and the Last Dragon is yet another test of the theatrical/streaming model. Back in September the studio tried Mulan on for size with its Premier Access pricing on Disney+. The result was not nearly as lucrative as they had hoped and it surely has been a factor in the way they have weathered the storm with the release of Black Widow, still scheduled for May 7 in theaters.Mulan only played overseas in theaters and the response to the film was mixed in general (it’s Certified Fresh on the Tomatometer but has a Rotten Audience Score of 49%). So we did not have quite the same measuring stick of a day-and-date release with streaming on top of theatrical. That changed with the Warner Bros./HBO MAX deal and began with Wonder Woman 1984 over Christmas weekend. That film opened to $16.7 million over the holiday with COVID spikes still raging and an option to sit at home comfortably with a HBO MAX subscription for the cost of less than a single ticket price in some markets. That film went on to gross $44 million to date (with another $117 million internationally) and is the third-highest grossing film U.S. theaters have had since last March.(Photo by Warner Bros.)The same studio’s delayed Tenet grossed $57.9 million and The Croods: A New Age has grossed over $53.6 million and most of that actually came after it hit VOD on its 24th day of release. It grossed $25.02 million in theaters up to that point. Flash-forward to last weekend – the first non-holiday weekend since March 13-15, 2020, to post an overall gross of over $20 million, and just the third overall, when Tom &amp; Jerry opened to $14.1 million. That was the second-best opening of that timespan to Wonder Woman 1984’s $16.7 million. (Tenet’s $20.2 million also included previews from Tuesday and Wednesday of earlier that week.) That means despite the availability of the HBO MAX option, folks still opted to give those films the best openings of the pandemic era. This brings us to the latest family offering from Disney.Disney – and, frankly, the whole industry – would have loved to have seen a $20 million opening for Raya and the Last Dragon. Even just a few million above Tom &amp; Jerry would have sufficed – something to show that, as vaccinations increase and major markets begin to open again, the numbers are headed in the right direction. An $8.6 million start is not what anyone had hoped. After all, a $30 premium price tag at home is double what a month’s subscription to HBO MAX costs and Tom &amp; Jerry opened around 70% higher just a week earlier. (Par for the course, Disney has not released any figures on Raya’s streaming performance.) Sure, Tom &amp; Jerry is an established property over the new world-building of Raya, which also opened in 400 fewer theaters, partially thanks to Disney unable to come to terms with bookings at Cinemark, but can it still be spun as a positive?(Photo by Warner Bros.)Another way to look at it is simply within the numbers produced by a similar theater output. Tom &amp; Jerry opened in 2,475 theaters with a $5,701 per-theater-average. Here are the best openings for films opening between 2,400-2,500 theaters from 2010-2020: Into the Woods ($31.05 million), Tyler Perry’s A Madea Family Funeral ($27.06), All Eyez On Me ($26.43), Heaven is For Real ($22.50), Legion ($17.50), Death at a Funeral ($16.21), The Crazies ($16.06), Den of Thieves ($15.20), Tom &amp; Jerry ($14.11), Nobody’s Fool ($13.74).Not bad considering Tom &amp; Jerry opened with theaters operating at minimal capacity and none opened in New York City. The animated/live-action hybrid grossed another $6.6 million this weekend. That’s a 53% drop from its opening. The WB/HBO MAX hybrid releases, Wonder Woman 1984 and The Little Things dropped 67.1% and 55.3%, respectively, in their second weekends, so those numbers are headed in the right direction for WB. Tom &amp; Jerry’s total stands at $22.9 million, just behind The New Mutants’ $23.8 million gross – the fourth-highest during the pandemic.Now let’s look at Raya and the Last Dragon, which opened in 2,045 theaters with an estimated $4,205 per-theater-average, and the films from 2010-2020 that also opened between 2,000-2,100 theaters: Think Like a Man ($33.63 million), The Best Man Holiday ($30.10), Tyler Perry’s Temptation: Confessions of a Marriage Counselor ($21.64), Tyler Perry’s Acrimony ($17.17), Jumping the Broom ($15.21), Super Troopers 2 ($15.18), Harriet ($11.67), Annihilation ($11.07), The Hundred-Foot Journey ($10.97), Cloud Atlas ($9.61), Baggage Claim&nbsp; ($9.03), The Witch ($8.80), Raya and the Last Dragon ($8.6), The Switch ($8.43), Black and Blue ($8.37), Wanderlust ($6.52).It’s a little bit further down the list, but again, theaters are mostly working with 25% capacity on the nearly one-year anniversary of the worst pandemic in 100 years. Raya and the Last Dragon is only the fifth film to open in over 1,000 theaters during this time to post a per-theater-average over $4,000. In normal times that would be a disaster. Now, it’s a hopeful sign that we have had that happen two weeks in a row. That’s where we are. In a week-by-week game now seeking the signs that normalcy is coming and each week shall be judged accordingly.Lesser Returns: Chaos Walking and Boogie Fail to Pull People From Their Homes(Photo by © Lionsgate)Family films and wannabe blockbusters are the only films garnering moviegoer’s interest enough right now to get them to leave the house. Chaos Walking may have once believed itself to be the latter, but it was not to be. In a glass-half-full way of thinking, $3.8 million is the fourth best opening of 2021 behind Tom &amp; Jerry, Raya and the Last Dragon, and The Little Things ($4.7 million), but that’s with a $100 million price tag and no streaming profits to think of yet. The basketball drama, Boogie, had the sixth best opening of the year behind those four films and Liam Neeson’s The Marksman ($3.1 million), starting with just $1.2 million.On these Dates In Box Office History…(Photo by @ Universal)March 5: Two years ago, How To Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World grossed $2.6 million on this day to cross the $100 million mark on its 12th day of release. A big record was broken in 2010 when Tim Burton’s Alice in Wonderland posted the highest Friday opening ever in the month of March with a $40.8 million start. That bested the three-year record of Zack Snyder’s 300, which opened to $28.1 million. Alice lost the record two years later to The Hunger Games and currently ranks fifth behind that, Batman v Superman, 2017’s Beauty and the Beast, and Captain Marvel.March 6: The only major milestone crossed on this day also occurred in 2010 when The Blind Side grossed $636,218 on day 107 of its release to cross the $250 million line. Sandra Bullock had won the Oscar for her performance just one week earlier.March 7: In 2017, The Lego Batman Movie made $820,416 to pass $150 million at the box office on its 26th day. It was also the day that Alice In Wonderland became the first film ever in March to gross over $100 million in its opening weekend. Its $116.1 million remains the fifth best opening ever in this month.What Should Have Been: A Different Tom Holland Sci-F Epic And More PranksRaya and the Last Dragon was originally supposed to open over the Thanksgiving holiday last year on November 25. Originally, we were supposed to get the fourth entry in the Jackass film series and a different Tom Holland science-fiction epic in Uncharted.

Fellow franchise flick Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa dropped to the runnerup spot in its second weekend and joined forces with the super spy to generate over $100M in ticket sales continuing a boom in business at North American multiplexes that Hollywood hopes will last throughout the rest of the holiday season.Aiming to become the biggest Bond ever in every way, Quantum of Solace attacked theaters and hauled in an estimated $70.4M this weekend exceeding industry expectations. Averaging a scorching $20,400 from 3,451 venues, the PG-13 film flew past the old record for the largest debut in the four-decade-old franchise which was held by 2002’s Die Another Day with $47.1M. Quantum‘s debut was a whopping 50% bigger and even adjusting for ticket price increases it was still a healthy 23% stronger. The new globe-trotting saga also bested the last film Casino Royale‘s opening by an amazing 72% (60% adjusted).[rtimage]MapID=1190699&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=23&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Solace marked Daniel Craig‘s second turn as the British secret agent and featured a continuation of the direction away from the glossy clean-cut James of old who had a cheesy one-liner for every situation, and towards a vengeful younger man with no need for fancy gadgets. Much has changed since the Brosnan administration. Reviews for Quantum were mixed and were certainly not as glowing as those for Royale. Nevertheless, Craig proved himself two years ago as moviegoers spent $167.007M domestically and over $595M worldwide on the spy flick making it the top-grossing Bond ever, without adjusting for ticket price increases. That good will transferred over to Quantum as fans all showed up right away without having to wait to see if this new blond Bond was any good. Having no new wide releases to compete against also helped.[rtimage]MapID=1190699&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=30&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]If estimates hold, Quantum of Solace will also set a new opening weekend record for a spy actioner edging out the $69.3M of last year’s The Bourne Ultimatum. Word-of-mouth will need to be stellar if Quantum wants any shot at beating Ultimatum‘s $227.5M domestic total. This weekend, the new 007 banked $27M on Friday, dipped 4% to $26M on Saturday, and is estimated by Sony to drop 33% to $17.4M on Sunday. With a production budget estimated to be $200M or more, Solace also ranks as the fourth biggest opener of 2008 and the fifth best November bow ever. Studio research showed that 54% of the audience was male while 58% was over 25.Overseas, Craig and company raked in another $56.1M on 10,460 screens in the third weekend of international play to boost that tally to $252M putting the worldwide cume at an eye-popping $322M. Look for the $400M barrier to crumble as soon as next weekend as Quantum eventually makes its way past Casino Royale to set a new high for the lucrative franchise, especially with major markets like Japan and Australia still to open.Last weekend’s top film Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa held up well for a sequel in its second frame falling 43% to an estimated $36.1M. Still averaging a stellar $8,888 from 4,065 theaters, the PG-rated comedy upped its ten-day total to $118M and became the first film since August’s Tropic Thunder to join the century club. Both were distributed by Paramount. Escape 2 Africa has a reasonable shot at matching the $193.2M of the first Madagascar flick from 2005 and will be tested next weekend when Disney unleashes its digital 3D toon Bolt which will target the same audience.The R-rated buddy comedy Role Models followed its potent debut with a solid hold in its second weekend dropping 39% to an estimated $11.7M. With $38.1M in ten days, the Universal release could find its way to $65-70M. Off 36% in its fourth term was High School Musical 3 with an estimated $5.9M boosting the cume to a robust $84.4M for Disney.[rtimage]MapID=1191742&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=6&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]With Bond stealing away older adults, Clint Eastwood’s Changeling dropped harder than it did in past weeks falling 41% to an estimated $4.2M. Universal’s Angelina Jolie starrer has collected $27.6M to date and is running somewhat behind the pace of the director’s 2003 pic Mystic River which had grossed $33.5M at the same point in its run. Sliding 49% to an estimated $3.2M was the comedy Zack and Miri Make a Porno which has taken in $26.5M to date for The Weinstein Co.A pair of films led by African American stars followed. MGM’s Soul Men starring Samuel L. Jackson and the late Bernie Mac tumbled 55% in its second weekend to an estimated $2.4M. With $9.4M in ten days, look for a disappointing $15M finish. The Secret Life of Bees continued to enjoy some of the best legs of any fall film slipping only 22% to an estimated $2.4M boosting the cume for Fox Searchlight to $33.7M.Rounding out the top ten were two fright flicks with similar weekend grosses, but vastly different overall totals. Lionsgate’s Saw V took in an estimated $1.8M, down 56%, for a $55.4M sum. After 24 days, the latest torture flick is running 31% behind the pace of Saw II, 26% behind Saw III, and 10% behind Saw IV. The Haunting of Molly Hartley scared up an estimated $1.7M, off 50%, for a $12.7M sum for Freestyle Releasing.[rtimage]MapID=1198041&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=8&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Opening to sizzling results in limited release was Danny Boyle’s critically acclaimed Slumdog Millionaire which debuted in only ten theaters in six cities but grossed an estimated $350,000 for a muscular $35,000 average – tops among all films in the marketplace. Since its Wednesday bow, the Fox Searchlight release about an uneducated orphan from Mumbai who gets to within one question of winning the top prize on India’s version of Who Wants to be a Millionaire has collected $418,000 over five days. Slumdog has earned some of the best reviews of any film in 2008 and expands to ten more major markets this Friday.The top ten films grossed an estimated $139.8M which was up a stunning 55% from last year when Beowulf opened in the top spot with $27.5M; and up 8% from 2006 when Happy Feet and Casino Royale debuted with $41.5M and $40.8M, respectively.","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"CMT","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-Bond-Tops-Toons-With-70M"},{"id":"47509142414286","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: Witch Mountain Races to the Top","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: Witch Mountain Races to the TopWatchmen falls to second; Last House completes top 3by Gitesh Pandya | March 15, 2009 |  CommentsThis weekend Wrestler-turned-actor Dwayne Johnson became the undisputed heavyweight champion of the North American box office with his Disney adventure film Race to Witch Mountain which opened strongly at number one. The comic book saga Watchmen plunged in its sophomore frame settling for second place while the new horror entry The Last House on the Left bowed impressively in third. Existing films held up very well as five of the seven holdover titles in the top ten dipped by less than 30%. However, the overall marketplace fell from last year’s levels for the first time in six weeks.Dwayne Johnson scored his sixth career number one opener for a lead role with Race to Witch Mountain which easily claimed the top spot with an estimated $25M. Playing to a broad audience, the PG-rated adventure averaged an impressive $7,844 from 3,187 theaters and did especially well with family audiences. The debut beat out the launch of Johnson’s last Disney vehicle with director Andy Fickman The Game Plan which bowed to $23M on its way to a solid $90.6M which amounted to four times the debut weekend figure. Race was inspired by the Witch Mountain franchise Disney had in the late 1970s.[rtimage]MapID=1200842&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=4&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Following the biggest opening weekend for any film this year, Watchmen saw more than two-thirds of its audience disappear in its second weekend as the superhero epic fell a steep 67% to an estimated $18.1M. It was the fourth largest second weekend drop for a number one opener over the past year trailing last month’s Friday the 13th (80%), July’s Hellboy II (71%), and December’s The Day the Earth Stood Still (68%). After ten days, Watchmen has taken in $86M and now looks headed for a domestic finish of about $120M. The pricetag for the effects-heavy comic pic has been estimated at $125-150M. The much-hyped actioner has played mostly to its core audience of comic fans and has not branched out much beyond that. With most seeing the film in its first week, a huge sophomore plunge was expected.Universal generated a solid opening for its new horror film The Last House on the Left which grossed an estimated $14.7M from 2,401 theaters. The R-rated thriller about a couple’s revenge after a teenage daughter is brutally assaulted averaged a sturdy $6,105 and played to a young female audience. Studio research showed that 57% of the crowd was female and 60% was under 25. House is a redo of Wes Craven’s 1972 classic fright flick and is the fifth horror film this year to open with an average north of $6,000. Being the first scary movie in a month also helped as there was little competition.[rtimage]MapID=1205377&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=5&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]The Liam Neeson kidnapping thriller Taken once again posted unbelievable strength dipping a ridiculously low 9% in its seventh weekend to an estimated $6.7M for fourth place. Fox has now boosted its cume to an amazing $126.8M and should have no problem breaking the $150M barrier with this sleeper sensation. Over the past two years, the only other film to spend seven weeks in the top five was The Dark Knight, the follow-up to Batman Begins which co-starred Neeson.Lionsgate followed in fifth with Madea Goes to Jail which took in an estimated $5.1M, down 40%, to lift the total to $83.2M. Oscar king Slumdog Millionaire ranked sixth dipping 26% to an estimated $5M. Fox Searchlight’s sum to date stands at $132.6M with the $150M mark within reach.[rtimage]MapID=1199053&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=2&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Another durable blockbuster Paul Blart: Mall Cop followed with an estimated $3.1M, off just 25%, giving Sony $137.8M thus far. The Kevin James smash may also join the century-and-a-half club. Warner Bros. saw a low 28% drop for the comedy He’s Just Not Into You which grossed an estimated $2.9M in its sixth frame for a cume of $89M to date. Reaching the $100M barrier is not out of the question. The family hit Coraline took in an estimated $2.7M declining only 19% and gave Focus a sum of $69.1M.Rounding out the top ten with a weak start was the sex comedy Miss March which bowed to an estimated $2.4M from 1,742 locations. The Fox Searchlight release about a young man who wakes up from a four-year coma to learn that his lady friend has become a famous Playboy bunny averaged only $1,349 and drew negative reviews across the board.[rtimage]MapID=10010760&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=3&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]The indie comedy Sunshine Cleaning made a sensational debut in platform release this weekend grossing an estimated $214,000 from only four sites in New York and Los Angeles for a scorching $53,500 average. Starring Amy Adams and Emily Blunt as sisters that run a crime scene clean-up business, the R-rated film premiered to plenty of buzz over a year ago at the Sundance Film Festival and was snapped up by Overture a month later. Insiders put the film’s budget at $7M with the distributor acquiring domestic rights for $2M. Sunshine hopes to keep the momentum going this Friday when it expands to 15 additional markets across the country to become the year’s first new breakout indie smash.The top ten films grossed an estimated $85.5M which was down 16% from last year when Horton Hears A Who opened in the top spot with $45M; and down 15% from 2007 when 300 remained at number one with $32.9M in its second weekend.","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"Reality, thriller, of, movies, Drama, films","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-Witch-Mountain-Races-to-the-Top"},{"id":"47509144335327","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: Madagascar Surges to #1 Opening","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: Madagascar Surges to #1 OpeningRole Models also opens strong.by Gitesh Pandya | November 9, 2008 |  CommentsBusiness was booming at North American multiplexes as the cartoon sequel Madagascar: Escape 2 Africadominated the marketplace with a sensational opening weekend to kick off theholiday movie season.

Universal’s George Clooney-Renee Zellweger football comedy Leatherheads and Fox’s Abigail Breslin-Jodie Foster family adventure Nim’s Island fought fiercely over the number two spot with each studio claiming its new release would edge out the other. The race was essentially too close to call and final numbers to be released on Monday will determine which will win bragging rights over the silver medal position. Regardless of the final rankings, the marketplace slumped to its second worst performance of the year as a lack of exciting films forced people to look elsewhere for their weekend entertainment.Sony enjoyed a very good hold for its Kevin Spacey gambling flick 21 which dropped only 37% from its opening to an estimated $15.1M. After ten days, the PG-13 film has won $46.5M and looks on its way to cash out with $80-85M. The story of MIT math wizards who spend their weekends winning big money in Las Vegas was helped by the fact that most of the new openers had little appeal to its core audience of teens and young adults. However if the estimate holds, 21 will tie Will Ferrell’s basketball flop Semi-Pro for having the smallest gross for a number one film this year.Expected by many in the industry to open at the top in the mid to high teens, George Clooney’s starring and directing vehicle Leatherheads collected an estimated $13.5M during its kickoff frame. The PG-13 film about a love triangle between a reporter and two football players in the 1920s landed in 2,769 theaters and averaged a decent $4,870 but fell short of expectations. Renee Zellweger and John Krasinski also star. Carrying a $58M pricetag, the Universal release proved to be a disappointment for the studio and loudly told Hollywood something that the rest of America has known for years – that Clooney and Zellweger are not A-list stars. Moviegoers don’t rush out and pay top dollar to see their films.Leatherheads was one of the oldest-skewing films of the year. Studio research showed that a remarkably high 75% of the audience was over the age of 30 and that more than half were over the age of 40. Females made up 54% of the crowd. A lack of starpower, uninteresting subject matter, and a wave of bad reviews all contributed to the lackluster debut. With the exception of the Ocean’s films which boast tons of stars, most movies starring Clooney have not opened well. Universal estimated a rather low 29% Saturday-to-Sunday decline for Leatherheads. Fox expects Nim’s Island to drop by 35% on Sunday.Fox estimated an opening weekend gross of $13.3M for its adventure tale Nim’s Island starring Abigail Breslin, Jodie Foster, and Gerard Butler. The PG-rated family film launched ultrawide in 3,513 locations and averaged a lukewarm $3,786 per site. The audience was 60% female and split evenly between those over and under 25. Budgeted at $37M, Nim’s connected with its core audience of young girls and their moms, but lacked the muscle to make it a strong box office performer.2008’s most popular film Horton Hears A Who dropped down to fourth place in its fourth weekend with an estimated $9.1M. Down 49%, the PG-rated comedy lifted its total to a robust $131.1M after 24 days. Compared to Fox’s previous March toons, Horton is running 7% behind the pace of 2002’s Ice Age but 26% ahead of 2005’s Robots.The DreamWorks horror entry The Ruins debuted in fifth place with only mild results. Distributed by Paramount, the R-rated film grossed an estimated $7.8M from 2,812 locations for a weak $2,788 average. The frightfest about a group of Americans finding ancient terror in Cancun continued the diminishing returns seen by this year’s crop of horror titles. January’s One Missed Call bowed to $12.5M, February’s The Eye opened to $12.4M, while last month’s Shutter launched with $10.4M. All of those were remakes of Asian chillers and were rated PG-13.The spoof comedy Superhero Movie had a moderate sophomore hold dropping 43% to an estimated $5.4M. The MGM/Weinstein Co. film has grossed $16.9M in ten days and should finish with $25-30M.Two films tied for seventh. Lionsgate’s latest Tyler Perry offering Meet the Browns dropped 53% to an estimated $3.5M upping the total to $37.8M. The Owen Wilson bodyguard comedy Drillbit Taylor grossed an estimated $3.5M as well, off 39%, for a cume of $25.6M thus far for Paramount.Fox’s horror flick Shutter, the studio’s third entry in the top ten, fell 45% to an estimated $2.9M putting the remake at $23.2M. Rounding out the top ten was 2008’s top-grossing global blockbuster 10,000 BC with an estimated $2.8M, off 44%, which put Warner Bros. at $89.3M from North America. Overseas the tally rose to $153.4M for a stellar worldwide haul of $243M.Martin Scorsese and The Rolling Stones joined forces for the concert film Shine A Light which opened in limited release with respectable, but not spectacular numbers. The PG-13 pic collected an estimated $1.5M from only 276 halls for a moderate $5,475 average. One-third of those venues were Imax theaters which charged higher ticket prices. Paramount Classics distributed the rock pic.The top ten films grossed an estimated $76.9M which was down a steep 27% from last year when Blades of Glory remained at number one with $22.5M; and down 22% from 2006 when Ice Age: The Meltdown stayed in the top spot with $33.8M.","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"Go, indiana, York, cops, witnail","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-21-Wins-Again-as-Leatherheads-Fumbles"},{"id":"47509138484143","title":"Box Office Guru Wrap-Up: Theaters Buzz With Paranormal Activity","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrap-Up: Theaters Buzz With Paranormal ActivityPlus, Astro Boy flies under the radarm and Amelia crashes and burns.by Gitesh Pandya | October 25, 2009 |  CommentsThis weekend what looked to be a close race between two major horror films ended up being no contest at all as moviegoers demanding a scare on the final full weekend before Halloween rallied behind the indie sensation Paranormal Activity which rose to number one in its fifth frame brutally punishing the opening for Saw VI which suffered the worst debut ever in the profitable franchise’s history. Three other new releases ended up with small chunks of change outside of the top five while the overall marketplace slumped below last year’s performance.A month of building buzz and excitement paid off for Paramount as the studio went fully wide with its no-budget ghost story Paranormal Activity seizing the top spot with an estimated $22M. The R-rated supernatural thriller expanded from 763 to 1,945 locations and watched its gross creep up 12% from last weekend. The total now stands at an incredible $62.5M after two weeks of midnight-only shows and 17 days of conventional release. The per-theater average stood at a solid $11,311. With Halloween still a week away, Paranormal Activity could go on to crack the $100M mark which would be an amazing feat for a film that cost a mere $15,000 to make and did not have the usual pricey marketing investment.Rather than serving up brutal torture like the Saw pics or using the slasher formula of so many other horror movies, Paranormal uses basic but very creative techniques to examine ghosts and things that go bump in the night as we sleep. The creepy thriller has come as a refreshing alternative to gory fright flicks and has scored big points with young women, and the men who follow them in order to get a date. Becoming a pop culture phenomenon, it still has plenty of untapped potential with curious ticketbuyers wanting to find out what the buzz is all about.[rtimage]MapID=1205735&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=7&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]The success of Paranormal Activity was devastating to the debut of Saw VI which attracted an estimated $14.8M in ticket sales this weekend. Grosses were sliced in half compared to the last four installments of Lionsgate’s signature franchise which all consistently opened in the $30-34M range. Saw VI‘s bow stumbled a troubling 51% from Saw V‘s $30.1M and dropped a steep 53% from Saw IV‘s $31.8M. The new chapter averaged a moderate $4,874 from 3,036 theaters.Part of the success of the Saw series came from a lack of competition. Generally when a new pic opened, no new fright films would debut against it and the strongest horror holdovers would gross relatively low amounts. So on the weekend before Halloween, Saw was virtually the only game in town. When Saw V opened a year ago, the only other scary movie in the top ten was Quarantine which grossed a measly $2.6M in its third frame while Saw IV‘s only competition in its top ten was 30 Days of Night which captured just $6.9M in its sophomore session.[rtimage]MapID=1205735&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=10&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]But this year was different. Paranormal Activity and the second weekend of The Stepfather combined for $28.5M worth of business from moviegoers looking to be terrified. So is this the beginning of the end to the Jigsaw franchise? Not necessarily. Paranormal represents a unique situation that may not be repeated any time soon so the next Saw flick may just face a better competitive environment. Plus Saw VII is being shot in 3D and films like My Bloody Valentine and The Final Destination have shown this year that horror fans are more than willing to shell out the extra cash for a good extra-dimensional screamfest. But other studios have now tasted blood and know that the Saw franchise is not indestructible anymore so they may be more aggressive in their programming of horror movies next October.Last weekend’s wild rumpus cleared pretty quickly as Spike Jonze’s Where the Wild Things Are tumbled 56% in its sophomore frame to an estimated $14.4M taking third place. With $54M in ten days, the $75M production should end its domestic run with about $80-85M for Warner Bros as the PG-rated film is not holding up like most good kidpics do, especially since it faced very little direct competition this weekend.[rtimage]MapID=10008827&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=49&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]The Jamie Foxx-Gerard Butler action thriller Law Abiding Citizen remained strong in its second weekend dropping only 40% to an estimated $12.7M putting it in fourth place. In only ten days, the R-rated revenge pic edged past the $40.1M of Righteous Kill to become the highest-grossing release in Overture’s short history. A final tally of around $70M may result.Moviegoers looking for a laugh continued to show up for Vince Vaughn’s Couples Retreat which grossed an estimated $11.1M, down 36% in its third frame, boosting the 17-day tally to $78.2M. The Universal release is still on a trajectory to hit $100M.[rtimage]MapID=10008727&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=19&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Kids don’t seem to care about animated films if they aren’t in 3D anymore. Summit released the toon adventure Astro Boy very wide in 3,014 sites but pulled in just $7M in ticket sales, according to estimates, leaving a dismal $2,328 average. The PG-rated film carried a $65M production budget and was financed by Hong Kong’s Imagi Animation Studios which hit number one two years ago with the turtle power toon TMNT.Considering all the fright competition, The Stepfather fared well in its second outing dropping just 44% to an estimated $6.5M. With $20.4M in ten days, look for Sony’s $19M production to finish with $30-35M.Universal’s Cirque Du Freak: The Vampire’s Assistant flopped in eighth place grossing just $6.3M, according to estimates, averaging a weak $2,305 from 2,754 locations. The PG-13 film failed to pull in that many fans of the book series and couldn’t convince fright fans when two much bigger scary movies were topping the charts. Studio research showed that 51% of the audience was female and 53% was under 25.[rtimage]MapID=1194951&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=20&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Sony rounded out the top ten with a pair of former number ones which have both done very well for the studio. The animated hit Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs dipped 30% to an estimated $5.6M while the horror-comedy Zombieland dropped 44% to an estimated $4.3M. Totals now stand at $115.2M and $67.3M, respectively. Zombieland now has the distinction of being the year’s top-grossing horror pic, although Paranormal Activity will swipe that title by Wednesday or Thursday.Opening outside of the top ten with a small gross and a respectable average was Hilary Swank’s biopic Amelia which bowed to an estimated $4M from 818 locations for a $4,921 average. The Fox Searchlight release about aviator Amelia Earhart earned weak reviews and played to an older and more female audience. The average almost matched the $5,055 that last October’s Changeling with Angelina Jolie generated when it went wide after a limited bow.The top ten films grossed an estimated $104.8M which was down 10% from last year when High School Musical 3 opened in the top spot with $42M; but up 29% from 2007 when Saw IV debuted at number one with $31.8M.Author: Gitesh Pandya, Box Office Guru","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"on, Sundance, dark, street, BET, IFC, TCA, video, BBC, Tomatazos, scene","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-WrapUp-Theaters-Buzz-With-Paranormal-Activity"},{"id":"47509146302447","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: Kapow!

The Bat Slams The Box OfficeBox Office Records Smashedby Gitesh Pandya | July 20, 2008 |  CommentsThe eagerly awaited new Batman film The Dark Knight broke the all-time opening weekend box office record and drove the overall North American marketplace to the largest frame in history with moviegoers dumping over $250M into theater cash registers over three days. The new musical Mamma Mia! managed to connect with its non-superhero fan base and posted a strong opening of its own in Knight‘s shadow while the animated comedy Space Chimps debuted to mild numbers. After back-to-back weekends when ticket sales were softer than last year’s, the box office soared to heights never before seen.Records fell this weekend thanks to sky high demand to see the latest Caped Crusader vehicle The Dark Knight which hauled in a jaw-dropping $155.3M over the Friday-to-Sunday period to set a new industry benchmark. Averaging a stunning $35,579 from 4,366 theaters, the PG-13 comic book flick edged past the previous opening weekend record of $151.1M held by another superhero sequel Spider-Man 3 from the first weekend of May last year. The Peter Parker pic even had more total screens with roughly 10,000 which was about 800 more than Knight‘s tally. Batman’s gross included $18.5M from Thursday night shows between midnight and 3am which also set a record beating the $16.9M of 2005’s Star Wars Episode III. Critics piled on praise for the $180M-budgeted Dark Knight which scored some of the best reviews of the year.The new Batman film reunited director Christopher Nolan and actor Christian Bale who successfully rebooted the franchise with 2005’s Batman Begins after the series was left for dead after 1997’s disastrous Batman &amp; Robin starring George Clooney and Arnold Schwarzenegger. Begins opened on a Wednesday in mid-June with $48.7M over three days and $72.9M over its five-day opening period leading to a solid $205.3M domestic final. The Dark Knight will surpass that mark in under a week’s time. Veteran character actors Gary Oldman, Michael Caine, and Morgan Freeman also returned while Aaron Eckhart, Maggie Gyllenhaal, and Heath Ledger joined the cast. Ledger’s acclaimed performance as The Joker became a magnet attracting millions of comic and action fans and his accidental death in January only heightened the curiosity factor making the must-see film of 2008.The Dark Knight blew open the bank vault door on Friday and made off with an eye-popping $67.9M (including Thursday night midnight sales) smashing the records for best opening day and best single day gross ever. Both of those marks were held by Spider-Man 3 with $59.8M. Sales fell sharply on Saturday by 29% to $48M, still an amazing haul, and Warner Bros. is estimating that Sunday’s gross will slip by only 18% and come in at $39.5M. Knight‘s Saturday and Sunday tallies were the second best ever. The Spidey threequel can still claim those records with $51.3M and $39.9M, respectively. Rival studios on Sunday projected a three-day tally between $151-153M. Final numbers will be released on Monday.Also adding excitement to the film’s release was the fact that Dark Knight was the first regular movie to use IMAX cameras during filming. Six action sequences were shot with the heavy-duty equipment allowing those who see the film in IMAX theaters a greater entertainment experience. This helped Knight set a new record for biggest IMAX opening with $6.2M from 94 venues this weekend for a scorching $66,000 average. Ticket prices are also higher for the large screen format.After just three days of release, The Dark Knight is already the sixth biggest blockbuster of the summer and is virtually guaranteed to swipe the 2008 box office crown away from Iron Man in the coming weeks. With all students out of school in July, midweek grosses will be much stronger than in early May when the metal man and the last webslinger pic debuted.This weekend’s achievement was nothing new for the Caped Crusader. In fact, Dark Knight is the fourth Batman film to break the all-time opening weekend record. The first Batman did the deed in 1989 with its $42.7M bow at a time when no film had ever debuted to $30M, much less $40M, over a three-day weekend. That record stayed for three years and was broken in 1992 by Batman Returns which bowed to $47.7M. Jurassic Park would swipe the record the following summer but Batman Forever took the title back with its $52.8M launch in 1995. All three Batman films opened in mid-June.Warner Bros. did not opt for a global attack with The Dark Knight, but it did release the superhero pic in 20 markets this weekend and grossed an estimated $40M from 4,500 international screens led by Australia’s $13.1M over five days. Many European markets open this coming weekend including Italy and the United Kingdom while Asia’s top markets Japan and Korea will launch in early August.Led by the staggering sales for the new Batman-Joker feud, the overall box office soared to more than $255M in ticket sales making it the best weekend in movie history. The previous high was $218.4M over the July 7-9, 2006 frame when Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man’s Chest bowed to a then-record $135.6M. Studios are hoping that the roughly 36 million moviegoers who saw trailers and posters at multiplexes this weekend will keep coming back in the weeks ahead for more summer films.Opening in second place with a solid showing of its own was the Meryl Streep-led musical Mamma Mia! which bowed to an estimated $27.6M for Universal. The PG-13 film averaged a stellar $9,276 from 2,976 locations performing just like last summer’s musical hit Hairspray which debuted to $27.5M this very weekend. Mamma, which also stars Pierce Brosnan, Colin Firth, and Christine Baranski, played to an audience of adult women with studio data showing that 75% of the crowd was female while 64% was over the age of 30.It was aimed as an alternative to Dark Knight and the strategy worked like a charm. Streep’s The Devil Wears Prada received the same treatment bowing to a similar $27.5M against Superman Returns two summers ago on its way to a sensational $124.7M domestic and $325M worldwide.Mamma Mia! has already been playing to sell-out crowds overseas over the last two weeks. This weekend, the $65M production bowed at number one in seven new territories including Germany and displayed great holds in existing markets like Australia, Sweden, and the United Kingdom to total an estimated $26.8M weekend take. That propelled the international cume to $72.6M and the global gross to $100M with much more to come.Falling one spot was Will Smith’s own take on being a superhero, Hancock, which tumbled 56% to an estimated $14M in its third outing. The Sony blockbuster has grossed a sturdy $191.5M in 19.5 days and is still following the same path as 2005’s Independence Day weekend offering War of the Worlds which had taken in $192.4M by the same point. That Tom Cruise pic finished its run with $234M and Hancock looks likely to end up with just under that amount. Globally, Smith’s latest zoomed to $444M and will crash through the half-billion barrier in a week.The 3D adventure tale Journey to the Center of the Earth enjoyed a great hold despite the arrival of Batman and slipped only 43% in its second weekend to an estimated $11.9M. New Line’s final film has now taken in a solid $43.1M for distributor Warner Bros. and could be headed for a $75-80M final tally. The PG-rated Brendan Fraser film cost $60M to produce.Last weekend’s superhero champ Hellboy II: The Golden Army got hit hardest by the folks of Gotham City. The Universal comic book actioner tumbled 71% to an estimated $10M dropping from first to fifth place. After ten days, the $85M production has collected $56.4M putting it just shy of the $59M that 2004’s Hellboy grossed during its entire run. Hellboy II should find its way to about $75M and become the summer’s only number one opener to not reach the $100M mark.The animated wonder WALL•E declined by 48% and ranked sixth with an estimated $9.8M. Disney and Pixar have pushed the tally up to $182.5M and are hoping to keep going towards the $215M mark which should eventually put it slightly ahead of Kung Fu Panda to become the year’s top-grossing toon.Fox saw an uneventful seventh-place bow for its animated offering Space Chimps which debuted to an estimated $7.4M. Playing in 2,511 theaters, the G-rated pic about, well… chimps in space, averaged a mild $2,927 per location. Fox has struggled this summer and remains the only one of the six major studios without a $100M hit this season. The studio’s hopes are pinned to this Friday’s launch of The X-Files: I Want to Believe which will try to persuade the bat-crowds to come its way.Angelina Jolie’s Wanted dropped 58% to an estimated $5.1M giving Universal $123.3M to date. Warner Bros. followed with Get Smart which took in an estimated $4.1M, off 43%, for a $119.6M sum for Warner Bros. Paramount’s Kung Fu Panda rounded out the top ten with an estimated $1.8M in its seventh frame dropping 60% pushing the total to $206.5M.The top ten films grossed a record estimate of $247M which was up a stellar 72% from last year when I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry opened in the top spot with $34.2M; and up an astounding 80% from 2006 when Dead Man’s Chest spent a third weekend at number one with $35.2M.Compared to projections, The Dark Knight flew higher than my $132M forecast while Mamma Mia! bowed on target with my $28M prediction. Space Chimps opened above my $5M projection.Author: Gitesh Pandya, www.BoxOfficeGuru.com","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"poppins, free, scary, Avengers","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-Kapow-The-Bat-Slams-The-Box-Office"},{"id":"47509142450127","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: Watchmen Scores $55.7 Million Opening","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: Watchmen Scores $55.7 Million OpeningMadea drops to second best but continues its stellar run.by Gitesh Pandya | March 8, 2009 |  CommentsThe adult-themed superhero film Watchmen seized control of the North American box office posting the biggest debut of the year with an estimated $55.7M in ticket sales over the Friday-to-Sunday period. Directed by Zack Snyder (300, Dawn of the Dead), the R-rated film based on the acclaimed 1986 comic series averaged a muscular $15,413 from 3,611 theaters. It was the third best March opening ever trailing 300 ($70.9M) and Ice Age: The Meltdown ($68M) and the sixth largest bow for an R-rated film after The Matrix Reloaded ($91.8M), The Passion of the Christ ($83.8M), 300, Hannibal ($58M), and Sex and the City ($57M).[rtimage]MapID=1184697&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=40&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]With a reported budget of about $125M, the anti-heroes began the weekend with a terrific $25.1M on Friday including $4.6M in Thursday night shows beginning at midnight. Saturday fell sharply by 25% to $19M while Sunday is estimated to drop 38% to $11.6M.Expectations were high for Watchmen with many thinking it could match or even beat 300‘s debut given that it boasted the same director, studio, release weekend, and rating. But the Spartan tale played broader as an exciting stylish actioner of the moment with more female appeal. Watchmen generated less interest with women and stuck mostly to a finite fan base of lovers of the comic and graphic novel. Still, the debut was impressive as it wasn’t an easy sell. Reviews were mixed and the longer running time of 2 hours and 43 minutes meant less showtimes per auditorium.But Watchmen did enjoy a less competitive field as no studio dared to counter with another wide release this weekend. The rest of the Top 20 stole away $56.5M versus $75.5M for 300‘s opening weekend. The superhero saga managed to gross more than the next 17 films combined and eked out a new record for the widest launch of an R-rated pic inching past the 3,603 sites for Reloaded from May 2003.[rtimage]MapID=1184697&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=11&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]In the world of superheroes that jump from the page to the screen, Watchmen performed just like the first films in the X-Men and Fantastic Four franchises which bowed to $54.5M in 2000 and $56.1M in 2005, respectively. All three were based on ensemble groups of characters, had large built-in fan bases, but were not universally known heroes like Spider-Man or Batman. Watchmen had a more restrictive rating and played outside of the prime summer season, however it also enjoyed higher ticket prices.Imax played an important role in Watchmen‘s debut. 124 of the total theaters offered the large-screen presentation at slightly higher prices grossing an estimated $5.5M making it the second biggest Imax bow ever after The Dark Knight which debuted in 94 sites. That translated to a sensational average of $44,556. Imax accounted for just 3% of the Watchmen locations but 10% of the weekend gross.Overseas where Paramount is handling the release, Rorschach and company grossed a solid but not spectacular $27.5M from 45 markets. The global bow was $83.2M.[rtimage]MapID=1199053&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=15&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Following its two-week stint on top, Tyler Perry’s Madea Goes to Jail dropped down to second place with an estimated $8.8M in its third weekend of release. The PG-13 comedy has so far grossed $76.5M in 17 days and currently ranks as Lionsgate’s fourth biggest grosser ever after Fahrenheit 9/11 ($119.2M), Saw II ($87M), and Saw III ($80.2M). Already Perry’s top career pic, look for Jail to end its run as the second biggest hit ever for the distributor. The movie mogul remains busy with his next film I Can Do Bad All By Myself, which also features the Madea character, set to be released this September and the sequel Why Did I Get Married Too slated for Easter weekend next year. Lionsgate once again will distribute. Perry’s seven films to date have grossed a combined $356M domestically.Fox’s sleeper hit thriller Taken enjoyed yet another solid performance with audiences taking in an estimated $7.5M for a low decline of just 25%. That boosted the cume to a robust $118M. Dropping 42% in its 17th weekend was Oscar champ Slumdog Millionaire with an estimated $6.9M boosting the tally to date to $125.4M. The Danny Boyle-directed hit is on course to beat Juno’s $143.5M to become the top-grossing film ever for Fox Searchlight. The global cume has now surpassed $225M.Climbing one spot to fifth place was the durable comedy Paul Blart: Mall Cop which dipped only 25% to an estimated $4.2M boosting the remarkable cume to $133.6M. Now in its eighth weekend, the Sony release has never dropped by more than 40%. Another comedy showing good legs is the date flick He’s Just Not That Into You which declined by only 33% to an estimated $4M for sixth place. Warner Bros. has taken in $84.6M with this New Line production.[rtimage]MapID=1189949&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=7&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Falling 37% to an estimated $3.3M was the stop-motion animation hit Coraline. The Focus release has now taken in a stellar $65.7M to date and ranks as one of the year’s top ten grossers. The Isla Fisher comedy Confessions of a Shopaholic got off to a rocky start but has now posted back-to-back weekends with drops of less than 35%. The Buena Vista release took in an estimated $3.1M, off 33%, and lifted its sum to a decent $38.4M.Disney’s Jonas Brothers: The 3D Concert Experience suffered one of the largest second weekend drops in box office history crumbling a stunning 78% to an estimated $2.8M. This followed what was widely considered an underwhelming debut last weekend of $12.5M which was enhanced by $15 ticket prices. After ten days, the G-rated music pic has grossed $16.8M underscoring how the Jonas brand is not nearly as popular as the Hannah Montana name. That character’s 3D concert film from last year fell by 67% in its sophomore session and banked an amazing $53.2M in its first ten days despite playing in half as many theaters.Rounding out the top ten was the high school comedy Fired Up with an estimated $2.6M for Sony, down just 30%, for a new total of $13.4M.The top ten films grossed an estimated $98.9M over the weekend which was up 14% from last year when 10,000 B.C. opened in the top spot with $35.9M; but down 27% from 2007 when 300 debuted at number one with a stunning $70.9M.Author: Gitesh Pandya, BoxOfficeGuru.com","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"Out","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-Watchmen-Scores-557-Million-Opening"},{"id":"47509150781467","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: Tyler Perry, Box Office King","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: Tyler Perry, Box Office KingThree other films duke it out for second place.by Sujit Chawla | October 14, 2007 |  CommentsTyler Perryonce again proved he is a forced to be reckoned with as his latest film WhyDid I Get Married? easily took the number one spot at the box officethis weekend, nearly doubling the nearest competitor. The other debuting filmsmet with so-so results and there’s a tight race for the runner-up spot.The filmgoing audience showed once again that if Tyler Perry headlines a film,they’re going to come out to see it. WhyDid I Get Married?&nbsp; brought in an estimated $21.5M this weekend fora powerful per screen average of $10,691. The opening was on par with Perry’sfirst smash, 2005’s Diary of aMad Black Woman which opened with $21.9M and an even stronger $14,771average. Unlike the last film with Perry’s name attached, Daddy’s LittleGirls, which opened with a softer $11.2M, Why Did I Get Married?features Perry in a starring role. Throw in the popularJanet Jacksonas a co-star and you’ve got a formula for success.Dropping one spot was two-time box office champThe Rockin The Game Planwhich fell only 30% this weekend to an estimated $11.5M. The 30% drop was easilythe best hold in the top 10 this week, and its cume now stands at $59.4M. Withthe recent success of comedies featuring tough guys and cute kids, it seems onlya matter of time before there’s a sequel to Mr. Nanny.Battling The Rock for second place were two films that were within $10,000 ofeach other this weekend. Currently sitting in third is theGeorge Clooneystarrer MichaelClayton. Expanding nationally from its successful debut last weekend,the Warner Bros. award hopeful took in an estimated $11M this weekend, for asolid per screen average of $4,385, bringing its cume to $12.1M. Followingclosely on its heels was theJoaquinPhoenix/MarkWahlberg thriller We Own the Nightwhich also debuted to an estimated $11M, for a per screen average of $4,179.When the actual numbers come in on Monday, the 2nd through 4th films couldeasily move around.Falling 47% from its less-than-powerful opening last weekend was theBen StillerR-rated comedy The Heartbreak Kid which laughed up an estimated $7.4M this weekend,bringing its total to a disappointing $26M. Look for a final theatrical run inthe $45-50M range, which is reasonable for a lot of films, but not for a BenStiller/FarrellyBrothers comedy.Opening in sixth place this weekend was the historical sequel Elizabeth: The Golden Age.Bringing back starCate Blanchettand director Shekhar Kapur nine years after the success of the originalElizabethdidn’t mean much for audiences as the film brought in an estimated $6.2M thisweekend for a per screen average of $3,169. A run on early season awards couldhelp the overall gross of the film, otherwise it may fade away quickly.In seventh was the war drama The Kingdom whichfell 53% from last weekend to an estimated $4.5M. Its total now stands at ashade under $40M. Adding a few hundred screens this weekend and crashing intothe top 10 was Across theUniverse which features the songs of the Beatles. The film took in $4Min its fourth weekend, according to estimates, bringing its total to $12.9M.In ninth place this weekend was ResidentEvil: Extinction which took in $2.6M in its fourth lap around thecountry, bringing its total to $48M. And rounding out the top 10 was The Seeker:The Dark is Rising which fell 42% from its soft opening last weekend toan estimated $2.1M. Its cume stands at $7M and it should end up in the $12-14Mrange with some hope for success on DVD. The only other film debuting thisweekend was the high school baseball pic The Final Seasonwhich opened to an estimated $665K for a per screen average of a pitiful $658.Look for the film to quickly appear in DVD bargain bins.The top 10 grossed $81.4M this weekend, which was down 15% from 2006 when The Grudge 2 openedwith $20.8M, but up 23% from 2005 when another horror film, The Fog, bowed on topwith $11.7M.Author: Sujit Chawla, www.boxofficeguru.com","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"99%, American, sag, to, spy, movies, bond, ViacomCBS, crime, Max, Horse, news","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-Tyler-Perry-Box-Office-King"},{"id":"47509161692293","title":"Box Office Preview: Invincible Aims for First Place Finish","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Preview: Invincible Aims for First Place Finishby Gitesh Pandya | August 24, 2006 |  CommentsAnother wave of new releases hits the multiplexes across North America this weekend in hopes of capturing the final dollars of the summer movie season.Leading the charge are Disney’s football tale \"Invincible\" for all audiences and the raunchy Warner Bros. comedy \"Beerfest\" aimed at young men. Music fans will get Universal’s \"Idlewild\" starring the OutKast duo while the New Line comedy \"How to Eat Fried Worms\" will play to school kids. Indie hit \"Little Miss Sunshine\" advances to another round in the box office pageant doubling its theatrical run in hopes of winning over new fans in all parts of the country. Overall, the marketplace looks to remain sluggish with moviegoers not being too impressed with Hollywood’s late-summer menu.Mark Wahlberg hopes to score a box office touchdown this weekend with the football drama \"Invincible\" from Disney. The Good Vibrations rapper-turned-actor plays Vince Papale, a 30-year-old bartender who earns a spot on the starting lineup of the 1976 Philadelphia Eagles. With a PG rating and the studio’s brand name behind it, \"Invincible\" should play to a broad audience with men connecting to the sports angle, women responding to the emotional true story, and kids coming in for the inspirational underdog tale. The studio has devised a strong marketing promotion with the NFL which has been pushing the film to football fans during the pre-season.Greg Kinnear and Mark Wahlberg in \"Invincible\"Excitement does not match what the studio saw with \"Remember the Titans\" or what Universal had with \"Friday Night Lights.\" Those fall football films opened with just over $20M a piece. But, \"Invincible\" does offer a feel-good story that could work for the moment. And Disney can crank out these uplifting sports dramas with its eyes closed. Wahlberg is hit or miss at the box office, but here he should add some decent starpower to the picture. And Greg Kinnear, who plays Coach Dick Vermeil here and also stars in \"Little Miss Sunshine,\" will have a great weekend at the turnstiles allowing his agents to start asking for more bucks for future projects. Charging into more than 2,400 theaters, \"Invincible\" could live up to its name and score a top spot debut with around $14M.The Broken Lizard group returns in \"Beerfest,\" a new comedy about a group of American dudes who train to take on the Germans in a secret beer drinking competition in Munich. Warner Bros. is looking to target the frat boy crowd with this R-rated gross-out comedy. With lots of belching and the most shots of bare breasts of any movie released in theaters this year, the studio should hit its mark with older teens and twentysomethings. \"Wedding Crashers\" and \"The 40-Year-Old Virgin\" may have been doing brisk business at this time last year, but R-rated sex comedies with no stars often end up struggling at the box office before finding gold on DVD. Films like \"The Girl Next Door,\" \"Eurotrip,\" \"Harold &amp; Kumar Go To White Castle,\" and even Broken Lizard’s \"Super Troopers\" all opened in the $5-7M range. The troupe’s fan base has grown thanks to cable and video so \"Beerfest\" should benefit. Plus the studio is giving it a relatively strong push for an end-of-August flick. But it has also been a tough year for R flicks and there is plenty of competition for young males right now. Chugging down brews in over 2,800 theaters, \"Beerfest\" might drink down about $11M this weekend.The Broken Lizard troupe is back in \"Beerfest\"Andre Benjamin and Antwan A. Patton of the Grammy-winning hip hop act OutKast reunite for the new music-driven film \"Idlewild\" which also stars Terrence Howard, Cicely Tyson, Patti Labelle, and Ving Rhames. The R-rated drama about the goings-on at a Prohibition-era nightclub will have significant appeal to hardcore fans of the popular musical act and should see much of its business come from African American adult audiences. Casual fans who only know them as the \"Hey Ya\" guys are not likely to spend money on tickets. Last summer, \"Hustle &amp; Flow\" played to a similar audience and bowed to $8M from 1,013 theaters for a solid $7,915 average. \"Idlewild\" is going out in about the same number of playdates and could end up in the same neighborhood. Debuting in 973 theaters, the Universal release could capture about $7M over the frame.Outkast’s Big Boi in \"Idlewild\"New Line offers up \"How to Eat Fried Worms,\" the big-screen adaptation of the best-selling kids book.The PG-rated film is aimed at school children and the tween set with a pic filled with immature boy pranks. Last weekend’s top five lacked any movies for kids so \"Worms\" should not face too much direct competition. However, excitement might not be high enough to generate a large opening. Parents and children familiar with the book might take a trip to the local cinema for this one. But the real cash will be made on DVD. Opening in about 1,800 theaters, \"How to Eat Fried Worms\" could bow to around $6M this weekend.New Line Cinema’s \"How To Eat Fried Worms\"In limited release, Sony Classics opens its dramatic thriller \"The Quiet\" which stars Elisha Cuthbert as a popular cheerleader whose life changes when her parents adopt an orphaned deaf girl into the family. Edie Falco co-stars in the R-rated film which opens in six sites in New York and Los Angeles on Friday. Reviews have been mixed.Last weekend, \"Snakes on a Plane\" eked out a victory atop the box office charts with a less-than-expected $15.2M bow. About half of that business was generated on Thursday night and Friday leaving little audience left for the days and weeks ahead. A steep drop is sure to occur this weekend now that the hype is all gone. Most people interested in \"Snakes\" in the first place have already gone and seen it. A 60% fall would leave New Line with a $6M weekend and a ten-day tally of $26M.Will Ferrell has been satisfying audiences with \"Talladega Nights\" all month long. A 35% drop could result giving the Sony hit about $9M for the frame which would push the cume to $128M. A similar decline could be in the works for Paramount’s \"World Trade Center\" which may grab around $7M this weekend boosting its total to $56M.The comedy sensation \"Little Miss Sunshine\" will more than double its run this weekend and further infiltrate theaters across the country. Fox Searchlight’s unstoppable hit will expand from 691 to over 1,400 locations on Friday and could collect about $7M in its fifth frame. That would put \"Sunshine’s\" cume at $22M putting it on course to become a bigger hit than \"Snakes on a Plane\" will be.LAST YEAR: The Steve Carell surprise hit \"The 40-Year-Old Virgin\" enjoyed a small decline and held onto the top spot with $16.3M dropping only 24% in its second frame. Miramax opened its Matt Damon adventure \"The Brothers Grimm\" in second with $15.1M on its way to $37.9M. The airline thriller \"Red Eye\" followed with $10.3M with the revenge actioner \"Four Brothers\" in fourth place with $7.9M. Opening poorly in fifth was \"The Cave\" with $6.1M leading to a disappointing $14.9M finish. The teen flop \"Undiscovered\" opened to an embarrassing $676,000 from 1,304 theaters for a pathetic $518 average landing in the number 20 spot. The Lions Gate release ended up with a miserable $1.1M.Author: Gitesh Pandya, www.BoxOfficeGuru.com","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"rom-coms, the, dceu","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Preview-Invincible-Aims-for-First-Place-Finish"},{"id":"47509158686819","title":"Box Office Guru Preview: Museum Open For Business Over Crowded Christmas Weekend","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Preview: Museum Open For Business Over Crowded Christmas Weekendby Gitesh Pandya | December 21, 2006 |  CommentsMoviegoers will have plenty to choose from over the long Christmas holiday weekend as four new star-driven wide releases hit the marketplace adding to an already crowded marquee.The Ben Stiller fantasy pic \"Night at the Museum\" leads the way as the frame’s only new comedy while the Matthew McConaughey football drama \"We Are Marshall\" offers an inspirational story based on true events. Meanwhile, a pair of Italian Stallions hop into the director’s chair as Sylvester Stallone‘s boxing drama \"Rocky Balboa\" and Robert De Niro‘s espionage thriller \"The Good Shepherd\" offer even more choices to holiday moviegoers. As is typical of this time of year, Christmas Eve will hurt the box office on Sunday as last-minute shopping and early theater closings will take their toll. But the Monday holiday will see a major recovery since Christmas Day brings forth a surge in traffic to the multiplexes.Blasting into nearly 3,700 theaters including 72 Imax venues is the comedy \"Night at the Museum\" which finds Ben Stiller playing the new night watchman at New York’s Museum of Natural History where all the artifacts and statues come to life each night. Director Shawn Levy (\"Cheaper by the Dozen,\" \"The Pink Panther\") leaves behind Steve Martin to work with a younger funnyman and more special effects. The PG-rated film is aiming for broad audiences hoping to bring in entire families looking for a fun time this holiday season. \"Museum\" also plans to score with teens and young adults as the only major comedy option for them. With \"The Holiday\" being the only other laugher in the top ten to register with that lucrative group, look for a solid response.Stiller brings considerable starpower to the film but he also gets backup from comedians like Robin Williams, Ricky Gervais, and Dick Van Dyke. Plus with the prestigious ‘and’ credit already claimed by Williams, Owen Wilson takes a sizable supporting role but is so cool that he is nowhere to be found in the credits at all. Audiences want happy and funny films during the Christmas holidays and \"Night at the Museum\" should post muscular numbers thanks to its starpower, lack of comedy competition, mild rating, and formidable marketing and distribution push. Fox looks to close up the books on 2006 by taking over the number one spot this weekend. Attacking 3,688 locations, \"Night at the Museum\" could debut to about $34M over the four-day Friday-to-Monday holiday period.Ben Stiller in \"Night at the Museum.\"Sylvester Stallone brings the eye of the tiger back to the multiplexes one last time in \"Rocky Balboa\" which got a jumpstart on the holiday weekend with its Wednesday launch. The MGM release brings the iconic boxer back to the screen in what is supposedly the end of the franchise with Stallone back in the saddle as writer and director. In this tale, Rocky is brought back into the ring when media hype prompts fans to wonder who the best boxer is of all time. The underdog story on screen mirrored the one within industry circles. How could a franchise that died 16 years ago with the poorly-received \"Rocky V\" find its way back into the hearts of today’s moviegoers. MGM and the \"Judge Dredd\" star moved forward. Today, they proudly claim one of the best reviewed films of the Christmas season and the Wednesday bow is being counted on to get die-hard fans out early so they can spread positive buzz at work and in school going into the lucrative yet overcrowded weekend period.With so many other films in the marketplace, and plenty with PG or G ratings aimed at luring in full families, \"Rocky Balboa\" will have to take its time at the box office as many moviegoers may need some convincing before spending money on the followup to the Tommy Gunn flick. Older adults are the ones who remember the excitement of the franchise, but the studio is hoping they could bring their kids with them for an uplifting tale that makes you feel good inside. \"The Pursuit of Happyness\" and \"We Are Marshall\" will be direct competitors in the feel-good genre and the latter will steal away many sports fans too. \"Balboa\" will have to rely on nostalgia and good word-of-mouth to carry it through round after round. Already playing in 2,752 theaters and adding more locations on Friday, \"Rocky Balboa\" may gross about $16M over four days and around $21M over six days.Stallone is back for one more round in \"Rocky Balboa.\"For football fans this holiday weekend, Warner Bros. trots out another pigskin drama with \"We Are Marshall\" starring Matthew McConaughey, Matthew Fox, and David Strathairn. The PG-rated film tells the true story of the football program at Marshall University in West Virginia which had to be rebuilt from scratch after a plane crash killed most of the players and coaches. Hollywood seems to have an endless line-up of sports dramas these days and since most of them become commercial successes, it’s no wonder that they keep getting churned out. Just a few months ago, moviegoers powered the football flicks \"Invincible\" and \"Gridiron Gang\" to the number one spot with bows of $17M and $14.4M, respectively. \"Marshall\" should play to much of the same audience and with its underdog feel-good story, the time of year will help since people are in the mood for that type of emotion.Reviews have not been too good, but that should not matter much. \"We Are Marshall\" is meant for sports fans and those who love stories about overcoming adversity, regardless of how predictable they may be. Sales from the heartland should be solid and with the tame rating, entire families can come out together. Plus McConaughey is a reliable draw at the box office and is believable as a quirky football coach. Still, competition will be strong and coming from all directions so a blowout will not be possible. Opening in 2,606 theaters, \"We Are Marshall\" could score about $14M over the Friday-to-Monday frame.They are Marshall.Countering the parade of PG flicks is the R-rated CIA thriller \"The Good Shepherd\" directed by Robert De Niro. The Universal release stars Matt Damon as Edward Wilson, a loyal government agent who helped to create the agency during the Cold War. Angelina Jolie, Alec Baldwin, William Hurt, John Turturro, and De Niro also star. \"Shepherd\" boasts solid starpower which could help the film have broad appeal. The subject matter appeals to the 30+ crowd, but Damon and Jolie should help to pull in twentysomethings. Teens and ethnic audiences will have minimal interest. Critics have been mixed on the film which could impact the overall turnout.The last few months have not been kind to star-driven period dramas aimed at adult audiences. Pictures like \"Hollywoodland,\" \"All the King’s Men,\" and \"Bobby\" have all struggled to find paying audiences with none reaching the $15M mark in total sales. \"Shepherd’s\" cast is what will allow it to rise above those failures. But the fight for the attention and time of mature adults will be fierce and a running time of nearly three hours will allow for one less showtime per day on every screen further cutting into its commercial potential. Infiltrating 2,217 locations, \"The Good Shepherd\" might capture around $13M over four days.Matt Damon and Alec Baldwin in \"The Good Shepherd.\"With the calendar year coming to a close, things continue to get crowded in the specialty arena this weekend. Clint Eastwood‘s award-winning war drama \"Letters From Iwo Jima\" debuted on Wednesday in limited release ahead of a January expansion similar to what Warner Bros. did two years ago with the director’s \"Million Dollar Baby\" which went on to reign at the Oscars. Edward Norton and Naomi Watts star in the period romance \"The Painted Veil\" from Warner Independent which also platformed on Wednesday in New York and Los Angeles. Thursday brings the limited launches of Miramax’s \"Venus\" starring Golden Globe nominee Peter O’Toole and the Chinese period drama \"Curse of the Golden Flower\" from Sony Classics which stars Gong Li and Chow Yun-Fat.Zhang Yimou’s \"Curse of the Golden Flower.\"Last weekend, Will Smith scored a number one hit with \"The Pursuit of Happyness\" which continues to please audiences. Overall moviegoing should increase over the holiday weekend, but more choices for adult audiences will give Sony some competition. \"Pursuit’s\" four-day take could drop 25% from its three-day debut gross giving the film about $20M and a cume of $58M after 11 days.As a sci-fi actioner, Fox’s \"Eragon\" is likely to see one of the largest drops in the top ten. The dragon adventure might fall by 35% to around $15M over the four-day session leaving the studio with $46M.Kidpics score big points over Christmas so \"Charlotte’s Web\" might see many of those fans who skipped out last weekend actually show up this time. The Paramount release’s four-day tally may slip 10% from its three-day bow and bring in roughly $10M. That would give the family film a total of $27M after 11 days.LAST YEAR: With Christmas falling on a Sunday, the observed holiday on Monday gave the box office an expanded four-day holiday frame allowing the mega holdovers to repeat atop the charts. \"King Kong\" spent its second weekend at number one and grossed $33.3M over four days and was closely followed by \"The Chronicles of Narnia\" with $31.7M in its third adventure. The combined haul for the pair soared to $285M with much more still to come. Newcomers rounded out the top five with Jim Carrey defeating Steve Martin in the battle of the comedies. Sony’s \"Fun With Dick and Jane\" opened in third with $21.5M over four days while Fox’s sequel \"Cheaper by the Dozen 2\" settled for fourth with $15.3M. Final tallies reached $110.3M and $82.6M, respectively. Sony also claimed fifth with \"Memoirs of a Geisha\" which expanded nationally and took in $10.2M over the long weekend. Also opening were Fox Searchlight’s Johnny Knoxville comedy \"The Ringer\" with $7.7M over four days, the Jennifer Aniston pic \"Rumor Has It\" with $7.5M in two days for Warner Bros., and Universal’s \"Munich\" with $6M in four days. The films went on to reach $35.4M, $43M, and $47.4M respectively. The debuting horror pic \"Wolf Creek\" opened outside the top ten with $4.9M in two days on its way to $16.2M.Author: Gitesh Pandya, www.BoxOfficeGuru.com","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"Network, reboot, thriller, FX, GLAAD, SundanceTV, Premium, Mindy, of, PaleyFest, ViacomCBS","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Preview-Museum-Open-For-Business-Over-Crowded-Christmas-Weekend"},{"id":"47509165499555","title":"Box Office Wrapup: \"Mission: Impossible III\" Big, But Not Huge at #1","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Wrapup: \"Mission: Impossible III\" Big, But Not Huge at #1by Gitesh Pandya | May 7, 2006 |  CommentsTom Cruise climbed into his usual number one spot at the box office with his heavily-hyped spy sequel Mission: Impossible III, however ticket sales fell below most industry expectations as the debut was not spectacular.The weekend’s other new releases, the horror flick An American Haunting and the kid drama Hoot, both generated lukewarm openings. But thanks to a weak early May in 2005, the overall marketplace still beat out last year for the seventh consecutive frame.Paramount claimed the top spot with MI3 which invaded a staggering 4,054 theaters collecting an estimated $48M in ticket sales over the Friday-to-Sunday period. The third installment in the decade-old franchise averaged a potent $11,846 per venue. But Tom Cruise’s box office muscles were expected to lift the tally much higher given all the factors that were working in the $150M film’s favor. The newest Mission pic obviously had plenty of starpower but with its early May bow, it had virtually no competition in the multiplexes to deal with. Plus the studio’s marketing hype was deafening, the pic opened in the second highest number of theaters in history for a live-action film (behind Spider-Man 2‘s 4,152), and even the reviews were mostly favorable. That was a welcome bonus as critics are rarely kind to big-budget action sequels.According to studio research, MI3 connected with the same audience that the previous two did. Men made up 56% of the crowd and 64% were age 25 or older. Joining Cruise in the PG-13 film’s cast were Ving Rhames, Jonathan Rhys Meyers, Keri Russell, and recent Oscar winner Philip Seymour Hoffman.Openings for other high-profile action films debuting on the first weekend of May include $68.1M for 2001’s The Mummy Returns, $85.6M for 2003’s X2: X-Men United, and $51.7M for 2004’s Van Helsing. MI3 didn’t even reach the level of Van Helsing. In fact, its opening gross was even weaker than that of Mission: Impossible 2 which launched over Memorial Day weekend six years ago with $57.8M over three days, $70.8M over four days, and $91.8M over its six-day Wednesday-to-Monday span. Even with higher ticket prices, a Friday bow, and hundreds of more theaters, MI3 still failed to reach the heights of MI2. Adjusting for inflation, MI3’s opening was the weakest among the Ethan Hunt flicks. The first Mission bowed to $74.9M over its six-day holiday frame in May 1996 including $45.4M over the Friday-to-Sunday span.Instead, the new J.J. Abrams-directed IMF saga opened in the same neighborhood as other recent star-driven spy films like last summer’s Mr. &amp; Mrs. Smith ($50.3M), 2004’s The Bourne Supremacy ($52.5M), and 2002’s James Bond film Die Another Day ($47.1M). Although opening near the $50M mark over three days is an impressive feat, Cruise’s new film was backed by one of the most expensive marketing campaigns in recent memory. The highly-paid star/producer attended premieres all around the world, popped up on major talk shows and magazine covers, and press coverage, not surprisingly, was non-stop.Industry watchers must now wonder – was there too much marketing? Were audiences sick and tired of hearing and seeing Tom Cruise everywhere? Did they really want to spend money seeing even more of him? Media-saavy moviegoers voted with their dollars and those who seemed to have had enough chose to stay away. The MI3 hype machine brought back memories of Sony’s Charlie’s Angels: Full Throttle from three years ago. That action sequel also arrived in theaters on a disturbingly loud wave of promotion revolving around its flamboyant stars and Demi Moore‘s relationship with Ashton Kutcher which was constantly covered on the airwaves. Despite the pricey marketing investment, Throttle debuted weaker than expected with $37.6M and crumbled 63% in its sophomore frame.Charlie’s Angels: Full ThrottleParamount was pleased with the international results for Mission: Impossible III as the actioner took in an estimated $70M over the weekend opening in almost all major markets around the world except for Japan. The spy sequel blanketed the globe with roughly 9,500 theaters in 55 markets putting its worldwide opening weekend tally at $118M. The ratio between sales outside and within North America remained the same as with previous Mission pics. The 1996 original grossed 61% of its $465M global tally overseas while MI2 took in 60% of its $538M internationally. This weekend, 60% of MI3’s dollars came from abroad.With no major competition for the family audience, the Robin Williams comedy RV enjoyed the smallest decline in the top ten easing just 32% to an estimated $11.1M. The Sony release dropped one notch following its top spot bow and has grossed a solid $31M to date. In just ten days, RV has already become the second biggest live-action grosser for Williams in the past seven years after the $67.4M of 2002’s Insomnia. Look for the $50M road trip flick to end its journey in the neighborhood of $60M.R.V.Opening in third place was the supernatural thriller An American Haunting which scared up an estimated $6.4M in ticket sales in its first three days. The PG-13 film averaged a decent $3,825 from 1,668 theaters. Reviews were mostly negative for the Donald Sutherland–Sissy Spacek starrer about a possessed young woman in the 1800s. Distributor Freestyle Releasing’s weekend estimate included an unusually low Saturday-to-Sunday decline of less than 5%. Final grosses released on Monday could see the figure come down.\"An American Haunting,\" \"Stick It,\" and \"United 93\"The gymnastics comedy Stick It tumbled 49% in its second weekend to an estimated $5.5M giving Buena Vista $18M in ten days. Look for the teen pic to reach $27-29M which is commendable for its genre. After a solid takeoff last weekend, the 9/11 hijack thriller United 93 declined a substantial 55% in its sophomore frame and grossed an estimated $5.2M. After ten days, Universal’s $15M pic has collected $20.1M and should find its way to roughly $30M domestically.Fox’s Ice Age: The Meltdown dropped 45% to an estimated $4M in its sixth frame to boost its cume to $183.3M. Crumbling 58% in its third spook was Sony’s fright flick Silent Hill which grossed an estimated $3.9M lifting the cume to $40.8M.\"Ice Age: The Meltdown,\" \"Silent Hill,\" and \"Scary Movie 4\"The spoof sequel Scary Movie 4 fell 52% to an estimated $3.8M and brought its total to $83.7M. The Starbucks-promoted kid drama Akeelah and the Bee enjoyed a respectable second weekend hold dropping 43% to an estimated $3.4M. After ten days, the Lionsgate release has still only grossed $10.7M and seems likely to finish close to $20M.Opening to dismal results with an estimated $3.4M from 3,018 theaters was the kid drama Hoot from New Line. The PG-rated story of a group of boys who set out to save endangered owls averaged a pitiful $1,127 per location. Fans of the best-selling book apparently avoided the film adaptation and critics for the most part were unimpressed.\"Akeelah and the Bee,\" \"Hoot,\" and \"The Promise\"A handful of films opened in limited release to mixed results. Warner Independent debuted the Chinese epic The Promise in 213 theaters but grossed only $271,000 according to estimates for a poor $1,272 average. The Golden Globe-nominated adventure was China’s official submission to this year’s Oscars and is reportedly that country’s most expensive film ever made. U.S. critics were not very pleased.Sony Classics bowed its indie comedy Art School Confidential which grossed an estimated $142,000 from a dozen sites in New York and Los Angeles averaging a strong $11,833 per site. The Terry Zwigoff-directed film expands to nearly 800 theaters in most major markets on Friday. ThinkFilm debuted its Edward Norton starrer Down in the Valley to an estimated $26,000 from three New York houses for a solid $8,770 average. The film widens to three more cities on Friday before gradually expanding throughout May.\"Art School Confidential\"Among holdovers, Fox Searchlight expanded its widow drama Water from five to 36 theaters and grossed an estimated $188,000 for a $5,222 average. The ten-day total stands at $270,000 and this Friday the Deepa Mehta film will widen to about 60 sites. The distributor’s indie sensation Thank You for Smoking collected an estimated $1.1M, off 40%, for a $20M cume.Three April releases were pushed out of the top ten this weekend. The Michael Douglas political thriller The Sentinel took a big hit from MI3 and crashed 62% to an estimated $3M putting its 17-day cume at $30.9M. Fox should find its way to about $36M. Disney’s underperforming toon The Wild slumped 46% to an estimated $2.6M. With only $32M in the bank, the animated film looks to conclude with $36-38M. Sony, on the other hand, has generated solid numbers for its sports comedy The Benchwarmers which grossed an estimated $2M this weekend. Down 54%, the Rob Schneider–David Spade film has taken in $55.6M thus far and is set to end with just under $60M.The top ten films grossed an estimated $94.7M which was up a healthy 24% from last year when Kingdom of Heaven opened at number one with $19.6M; but off 4% from 2004 when Van Helsing debuted in the top spot with $51.7M.Author: Gitesh Pandya, BoxOfficeGuru.com","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"series, LGBT, Bros., movies, killer, your, female, TruTV, Awards, CW, crime, shows, Marathons","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Wrapup-Mission-Impossible-III-Big-But-Not-Huge-at-1"},{"id":"47509163327639","title":"Box Office Wrapup: \"Cars\" in Pole Position Again, \"Da Vinci Code\" Reaches $679M Globally","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Wrapup: \"Cars\" in Pole Position Again, \"Da Vinci Code\" Reaches $679M Globallyby Gitesh Pandya | June 19, 2006 |  CommentsDespite the arrival of four new films cluttering the multiplexes, the Disney/Pixar animated film Cars remained the most popular movie in North America for a second straight weekend.Among the freshman class, both the comedy Nacho Libre and the actioner The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift opened with impressive numbers targeting young male moviegoers. The Keanu Reeves–Sandra Bullock romance The Lake House appealed to adult women and saw a respectable showing while the kid sequel Garfield: A Tail of Two Kitties opened poorly. With so much new product entering the marketplace, most holdovers suffered large declines.Cars was once again the box office champion and grossed an estimated $31.2M in its second weekend boosting its ten-day cume to a stellar $114.5M. Though taking home another trophy, the G-rated film experienced a disturbing decline of 48% from last weekend which was much higher than the sophomore drops of previous Disney/Pixar toons. The last film from the companies, The Incredibles, dipped only 29% while 2003’s Finding Nemo eased 34%. Each bowed to about $70M and raced to over $143M in ten days. Cars opened last week about $10M weaker and is now eroding faster which means it is not likely to come close to the lofty heights reached previously. After ten days, Cars is running 20% behind the pace of Nemo and Incredibles. The talking automobile flick will still try to reach the $200M mark before running out of gas.Opening a few notches behind in second place was the wrestling comedy Nacho Libre with an estimated $27.5M from 3,070 theaters. Averaging a muscular $8,962 per ring, the Paramount release stars Jack Black as a cook who moonlights as a flamboyant wrestler and was directed by Napoleon Dynamite’s Jared Hess. The $35M film appealed to young guys with studio data showing that 53% of the audience was male and 55% was under the age of 25. Nacho Libre began its weekend a bit early with 10pm preview shows on Thursday night which helped propel Friday’s opening day to a solid $11M. The PG-rated film dropped 14% to $9.4M on Saturday however, which could indicate a bumpy ride ahead.Universal raced into third place with its street racing sequel The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift which opened with an estimated $24.1M. The PG-13 pic debuted in 3,027 locations and averaged a strong $7,947 average. The studio generated a strong performance considering this was the third time around for the franchise and that most of the stars of the first two Furious films were nowhere to be found. Young guys were the driving force behind the $75M Drift which like its predecessors appealed to a multicultural audience. According to studio data, 58% of the audience was male, 60% was under 25, and 71% was non-white.Lucas Black and Bow Wow led the mostly unknown cast as fans responded more to the fast cars and racing attitudes than to starpower. The studio’s decision to include Vin Diesel‘s cameo in the television commercials also may have sparked interest from fans of the franchise. Tokyo Drift did not open as well as the first two pics in the series, but that was expected. In 2001, The Fast and the Furious opened to $40.1M on its way to $144.5M while its 2003 sequel 2 Fast 2 Furious debuted to $50.5M leading to a $127.2M tally. Tokyo Drift also opened in eight international markets this weekend grossing an estimated $7.5M from 825 theaters including number one openings in the U.K., Australia, New Zealand, Malaysia and Thailand. Japan, where the film is set, will open in September.A dozen years after exciting audiences in Speed, Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock reunited in the romantic drama The Lake House which debuted in fourth place with an estimated $13.7M. The Warner Bros. release averaged a respectable $5,166 from 2,645 theaters. The PG-rated film was a remake of the Korean drama Il Mare and told the story of a man and a woman from two different years who communicate and fall in love through letters they send to each other in a magical mailbox at a lake house. Reviews were not very good and both stars routinely see bigger openings for their films.Universal’s The Break-Up dropped 53% in its third weekend and took fifth place with an estimated $9.5M boosting the 17-day cume to $91.9M.Fox took up the next three spots on the chart starting with its kidpic sequel Garfield: A Tail of Two Kitties which flopped in its debut grossing an estimated $7.2M. Playing in 2,945 theaters, the PG-rated comedy averaged a weak $2,445 per venue. The first Garfield opened to $21.7M in June 2004 on its way to $75.4M domestically and a stellar $198M worldwide forcing the studio to dip into the well again with a new story. Bill Murray returned to voice the fat cat in Kitties which brought the characters to England for another adventure, but most families did not show much interest.The year’s top-grossing domestic hit, X-Men: The Last Stand, tumbled another 56% in its fourth outing and grossed an estimated $7.2M. With a stellar $215.5M in the bank, the mutant sequel became the top-grossing installment of the super hero trilogy surpassing the $214.9M of X2: X-Men United from 2003. The horror remake The Omen placed eighth with an estimated $5.4M conveniently making its decline 66.6%. The top ten’s only R-rated pic has now grossed $46.9M to date for Fox.Sony’s The Da Vinci Code followed with an estimated $5M, off 52%, pushing the domestic cume to $198.5M. Overseas, the Ron Howard–Tom Hanks vehicle uncovered another $15.2M this weekend as the international sum surged to $480M. The world’s biggest blockbuster of the year has now taken in an incredible $678.5M globally. Rounding out the top ten was the animated pic Over the Hedge with an estimated $4M, off 60%, for a $138.8M total.The biggest summer hits continued to keep pace with last year’s. The collective gross for the top five summer releases reached $797.3M which was down less than 1% from the $802.5M from this point a year ago.Four films dropped out of the top ten over the weekend. Robert Altman‘s A Prairie Home Companion fell 43% in its sophomore frame to an estimated $2.6M giving the Picturehouse release a ten-day tally of $8.8M. Look for a finish in the vicinity of $15M. The hit family comedy RV held up well during its seven-week run in the top ten, but this weekend the Robin Williams pic crashed 74% and grossed an estimated $500,000. With $66.4M in its tank, the Sony release is not expected to collect much more.The Tom Cruise spy sequel Mission: Impossible III tumbled 61% in its seventh mission to an estimated $1.2M putting its cume at $130M. The Paramount sequel is the highest-grossing summer kick-off film since 2003’s X2, but with a $150M budget and a deafening amount of marketing hype, it has to be considered somewhat disappointing for the studio. The first two Mission pics grossed $181M in 1996 and $215.4M in 2000. MI3 should end its campaign with around $132M. Overseas, the Ethan Hunt film has grossed more than $200M to date.The summer season’s second big offering Poseidon continued to sink dropping 66% in its sixth weekend to an estimated $620,000. The $160M Warner Bros. disaster film has taken in only $56.5M from North America making it one of the biggest underachievers of the summer. However, like most effects-driven action films, Poseidon is doing much better internationally where it grossed another $9M from 41 countries this weekend to boost the overseas take to $70.8M. Korea and Japan continue to be the most successful markets for the ocean liner pic with grosses that far outdistance those in key European territories.The top ten films grossed an estimated $134.7M which was up 6% from last year when Batman Begins debuted at number one with $48.7M; and up 5% from 2004 when Dodgeball opened in the top spot with $30.1M.Author: Gitesh Pandya, www.BoxOfficeGuru.com","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"ViacomCBS, Mary, Rocketman, drama, of, the, Emmy, movie, park, Election, Pixar, Esquire, comedy, drama, Tumblr","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Wrapup-Cars-in-Pole-Position-Again-Da-Vinci-Code-Reaches-679M-Globally"},{"id":"47509158696038","title":"Box Office Wrapup: Moviegoers Choose War, Not Love, as \"Apocalypto\" Conquers #1 Spot","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Wrapup: Moviegoers Choose War, Not Love, as \"Apocalypto\" Conquers #1 Spotby Gitesh Pandya | December 11, 2006 |  CommentsMel Gibson ruled the box office once again as his latest directorial effort \"Apocalypto\" beat out a string of newcomers and strong holdovers this weekend to become an unlikely number one hit.The romantic comedy \"The Holiday\" had to settle for a second place showing following close behind while Leonardo DiCaprio’s new actioner \"Blood Diamond\" finished the frame a few notches back in fifth with a not-so-sparkling bow. Overall, the marketplace was sluggish as total ticket sales fell significantly from the corresponding weekends from each of the last two years.The ancient Mayan adventure \"Apocalypto\" shot to the top of the box office charts with an estimated $14.2M over the weekend giving Gibson a major industry victory just months after a scandalous summer. Playing in 2,465 theaters, the R-rated action film averaged a solid $5,747 per location. Apocalypto entered the marketplace as a tough sell given its unknown cast, subtitles, and extreme brutality. However, good reviews helped the film and the free publicity Gibson received since being arrested in July certainly boosted the overall awareness of the picture.The Oscar-winning filmmaker’s last movie, 2004’s \"The Passion of the Christ,\" generated tons more controversy and found itself with a colossal $125.2M opening over five days on its way to a domestic haul of $370.3M. \"Apocalypto\" stood as a very different film and was never expected to come close to that level. Studio research showed that 60% of the audience was male which was expected given its action story and extreme levels of torture and violence. Buena Vista has been on a roll in the second half of 2006 and \"Apocalypto\" should become the studio’s ninth consecutive wide release to reach past $50M domestically.Movie patrons looking for lighter fare lined up for the new romantic comedy \"The Holiday\" which debuted close behind in second place with an estimated $13.5M. The PG-13 film stars Cameron Diaz and Kate Winslet as two women who switch homes for the Christmas season and find love with a pair of new chaps played by Jude Law and Jack Black. Spreading cheer in 2,610 locations, \"The Holiday\" averaged a good $5,172 per site. Not surprisingly, adult women made up the largest part of the audience. According to studio research, 65% of the crowd was female and 57% was 25 and older. Reviews were not very kind. The film was helmed by Nancy Meyers who directed Mel Gibson in the smash hit \"What Women Want\" in 2000. The two went head-to-head this weekend with their new projects but it was Gibson who managed to race ahead and claim the box office crown.The debut of \"The Holiday\" was on the lower end of the range reached by similar films opening in mid-December like last year’s \"The Family Stone\" ($12.5M), 2003’s \"Something’s Gotta Give\" ($16.1M), and 2002’s \"Two Weeks Notice\" ($14.3M). Unlike the other eleven months of the year, December usually sees movies enjoy better legs thanks to the extra time people have off from work and school. Those who miss a film on opening weekend often have time to see it later on and movies routinely reach a final gross that is five to seven times their debuts. \"Stone\"’s bow accounted for only 21% of its overall tally while \"Something\" and \"Notice\" enjoyed shares of 13% and 15%, respectively.Following its three-week stint at number one, the penguin hit \"Happy Feet\" dropped down to third place but still witnessed a strong hold. The Warner Bros. toon enjoyed the smallest decline in the top ten dipping only 28% to an estimated $12.7M and raised its cume to $137.7M. With solid word-of-mouth and the upcoming school holidays approaching, \"Happy Feet\" stands a good chance of reaching the $200M domestic mark. Internationally, the animated film grossed an estimated $25.4M from 37 markets this weekend boosting the overseas cume to $40.8MFor the fourth consecutive weekend, \"Casino Royale\" followed right behind the penguins on the box office chart. The new James Bond actioner fell 42% to an estimated $8.8M putting the domestic total at $128.9M. \"Casino\" is now running only 2% behind the pace of the last Agent 007 flick \"Die Another Day\" which had banked $131.9M after its fourth weekend. Overseas, Daniel Craig continued to shine lifting \"Casino\"’s international tally to $247.2M putting the global gross at a stunning $376.1M and counting. By the end of the week, the Sony smash will zoom past the worldwide tallies of \"Superman Returns\" ($390M) and \"Mission: Impossible III\" ($395M).Opening in fifth place with mediocre results was Leonardo DiCaprio’s \"Blood Diamond\" with an estimated $8.5M from 1,910 sites for a decent $4,458 average. Directed by Ed Zwick (\"The Last Samurai,\" \"Glory\"), the R-rated film finds the \"Titanic\" star playing a white African diamond smuggler hunting down a rare pink diamond found by an enslaved fisherman. Djimon Hounsou and Jennifer Connelly co-star and reviews were generally positive. \"Blood\" attracted media attention for its story which examines how conflict diamonds are used by rebel groups to finance their wars in parts of Africa. The opening weekend average did not reach the levels of the debuts of last year’s R-rated political thrillers set near that part of the world. \"The Constant Gardener\" bowed to $8.7M and a $6,444 average while \"Syriana\" opened nationally this weekend in 2005 to $11.7M with a $6,699 average.Warner Bros. also opened its new family comedy \"Unaccompanied Minors\" but was met with weak results thanks in part to a crowded market for kidpics. The PG-rated film grossed an estimated $6.2M from 2,775 theaters for a poor $2,234 average. \"Minors\" finds a group of kids stranded in an airport during the holiday season.Denzel Washington’s action thriller \"Deja Vu\" dropped 45% to an estimated $6.1M in its third weekend and upped its cume to $53M for Buena Vista. Following in eighth place was the Biblical drama \"The Nativity Story\" with an estimated $5.6M declining only 29%. With $15.8M in ten days, the New Line release may find its way to $35-40M.More Christmas pics rounded out the top ten. Fox’s \"Deck the Halls\" grossed an estimated $3.9M, off 41%, to push its total to $30.1M. Disney’s \"The Santa Clause 3\" dipped 32% to an estimated $3.3M giving the studio $77.2M to date. The holiday comedy is running 36% behind the pace of the last Tim Allen installment which had taken in $120.1M at this same point in its run. Factor in ticket price increases since 2002 and \"Clause 3\" is trailing by 43%.Four films dropped out of the top ten this weekend. Fox’s smash hit \"Borat\" fell 46% to an estimated $2.6M giving the blockbuster comedy $120.3M to date. Budgeted at only $18M, look for the Sacha Baron Cohen concoction to finish with $125-130M domestically. Cohen’s \"Talladega Nights\" foe Will Ferrell has not met with the same kind of success with his latest comedy \"Stranger Than Fiction.\" The Sony release fell 55% to an estimated $1.5M to put its cume at $39.2M. Budgeted at just under $30M, \"Fiction\" should end up with $40-45M.The horror thriller \"Turistas\" from Fox’s new teen genre division Fox Atomic tumbled 63% in its second weekend to an estimated $1.3M. With only $5.9M in ten days, look for the R-rated film to harvest just $8-10M from its theatrical run. Fellow sophomore \"Van Wilder: The Rise of Taj\" has grossed less than $4M to date and seems headed for a finish of just $5-7M for MGM.The top ten films grossed an estimated $82.8M which was down 27% from last year when \"The Chronicles of Narnia\" opened at number one with $65.6M; and down 16% from 2004 when \"Ocean’s Twelve\" debuted in the top spot with $39.2M.Author: Gitesh Pandya, www.BoxOfficeGuru.com","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"composers, shows, service, Academy, period, movies, Access, movies, Mirror, fiction, Fox, justice","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Wrapup-Moviegoers-Choose-War-Not-Love-as-Apocalypto-Conquers-1-Spot"},{"id":"47509163308180","title":"Box Office Preview: Son of Krypton Returns to Theaters","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Preview: Son of Krypton Returns to Theatersby Gitesh Pandya | June 29, 2006 |  CommentsOne of the summer’s most anticipated films flies into theaters everywhere ready to kick off the second half of the blockbuster season. Superman Returns brings life back to one of cinema’s favorite franchises after nearly two decades of silence.The early Wednesday opening will allow the super-expensive super hero saga to dominate the North American box office over the weekend preceding the Fourth of July holiday. Offering an alternative this weekend, Meryl Streep also hits the big screen with her new comedy The Devil Wears Prada which opens on Friday. With Monday being a day off for some and Tuesday being a national holiday for all, heavy traffic is expected at the multiplexes over the coming week which should propel box office revenue as we hit the year’s midway point.After jumping from the Marvel to the DC Comics camp, director Bryan Singer presents to the world a new vision for what could arguably be the most popular super hero in Superman Returns. The PG-13 film stars unknown Brandon Routh as mild-mannered Clark Kent and the brave title character. Oscar winner Kevin Spacey plays arch-nemesis Lex Luthor, Kate Bosworth steps in as Lois Lane, and Cyclops himself James Marsden plays Lane’s new love interest. Singer directed Marsden in X-Men and its sequel and also directed Spacey in The Usual Suspects. With plenty of special effects and expensive aquatic scenes, Superman Returns is said to be the priciest film ever produced with a budget hovering in the neighborhood of $250M.In this new story, Superman returns to Earth after a five-year absence and picks up the pieces in his life where he left off. Clark Kent magically returns to his job at the Daily Planet at the same time after a similar time away, but of course co-workers find this to be nothing more than coincidence. Luthor devises a new scheme to conquer the world and Superman must defeat evil while at the same time figure out if there is any hope for a reconnection with Lois. At 2 hours and 37 minutes, Superman Returns is an extra long piece of comic book entertainment taking over the marquees in 3,915 theaters on Wednesday and a total of 4,065 locations by Friday including Imax sites. The studio, along with its promotional partners, has spent every possible dollar available to market and promote what it hopes will be the rebirth of a lucrative franchise.The two films that Superman’s opening can best be compared to are the tentpoles that conquered this same frame over the previous two summers – last year’s War of the Worlds and 2004’s Spider-Man 2. Each film was an expensive, effects-driven actioner that opened on the Wednesday leading up to the holiday weekend plus had a huge built-in fan base and tapped into the large sci-fi/comic book audience. The webslinger sequel bowed to a stunning $40.5M in its first day including Tuesday night midnight shows. Its massive totals for the long opening frame included $88.2M over the Friday-to-Sunday period, $115.8M over the Friday-to-Monday holiday frame, and a jaw-dropping six-day cume of $180.1M over the entire Wednesday-to-Monday span.War of the Worlds was more subdued which was understandable since it did not have a passionate fan following like Spidey. The alien invasion pic debuted to $21.3M on Wednesday and opened with $64.9M over the Friday-to-Sunday portion, $77.1M over the Friday-to-Monday span, and $112.7M during the entire six-day period. Comparing the Wednesday-to-Monday premiere periods, War was 37% weaker than Spider-Man 2. Superman Returns has more fan frenzy than the Tom Cruise flick did so its opening should be bigger. But getting to the heights of the Doc Ock pic could be a serious challenge. Afterall, that film arrived just two years after its predecessor shattered the all-time opening weekend record (which it still holds) and became a $400M+ megablockbuster.For the most part, critics have been very supportive of the Kal-El film calling it a welcome new installment. However, Warner Bros. received some big blows thanks to bad reviews from two of the most influential and most respected outlets – Roger Ebert and The New York Times. Fan boys won’t care, of course. They will be there in full force and since students are all out of school, grosses will be strong everyday. Spider-Man 2 had tremendous female appeal allowing it to reach the broadest possible audience. Warner Bros. has been key on getting girls and women interested in Superman by pushing the good looks of Routh, the modern sensibilities of Bosworth, and the on-screen love story between the two. While the hero-villain storyline is very much a carbon copy from the past, the romantic tale is the main part of the film that offers something new to Superman’s saga.A special bonus the studio is giving to moviegoers is the Imax 3D presentation of the film which opens day and date in 76 locations with the standard run. Not only will it help boost the gross thanks to the higher Imax ticket prices, but it also generates an added level of excitement making it even more of an event. Plus it could help boost repeat sales as those desperate to see the film right away, but can’t get an Imax ticket upfront, might return soon after for the large-format experience. Warner Bros. has launched recent Harry Potter and Batman pics in Imax alongside the standard 35mm prints, however with Superman, the film includes 3D elements which can only be enjoyed in this format. What better way to see Krypton explode? The public is eating it up too. Well before the film opened to the public at the Loews Lincoln Square theater (New York City’s Imax outlet), the Tuesday night show was already sold out as were all of Wednesday’s Imax shows. At $15 per ticket in a huge auditorium, you can bet the grosses from that Imax theater, in addition to others across the country with slightly lower prices, will beef up the overall Superman totals.Soaring like a bird, or a plane, Superman will undoubtedly reach great heights at the box office this weekend and early word-of-mouth could have a great impact on how many are encouraged to take a trip over the weekend. Over the Friday-to-Sunday period, Superman Returns could find itself in the vicinity of $78M while the five-day Wednesday-to-Sunday tally might climb to around $135M.Not every moviegoer will want to see a Kryptonian in blue tights this weekend, so Fox is rolling out the femme-driven comedy The Devil Wears Prada starring Meryl Streep and Anne Hathaway. Directed by HBO helmer David Frankel (Sex and the City, Entourage), the PG-13 film finds the former princess playing a new employee at a fashion magazine who finds herself working for an overbearing and evil editor. Clearly, Prada is aiming almost exclusively for women and fashionistas given the stars and the subject matter, although the appeal could spread across a wide age range.Critics have been kind to the film and especially to Streep’s performance which some have called worthy of her 14th Oscar nomination. Good reviews certainly won’t hurt at the box office and could be the key to attracting women over 30. Hathaway is being counted on to bring in the young vote. The actress rose to fame anchoring the two Princess Diaries movies at Disney which grossed $108.2M and $95.1M, respectively, but has shown a more mature side recently in the acclaimed Brokeback Mountain. But Streep is the big star in Prada and will be the one to draw in ticket buyers. When headlining a female-oriented film, she doesn’t necessarily guarantee a crowd. Last fall’s Prime bowed to just $6.2M and 1998’s One True Thing opened to only $6.6M.Since her latest film is a much more commercial vehicle, it should generate a stronger debut. However, like with every other film in the marketplace, Devil will have to deal with Superman which like a vacuum could suck up all dollars in its path given its wide appeal. Although it should skew more male, millions of women will still be going to see the super hero this weekend. That, plus the lack of male interest, will prevent Prada from flying off the shelves. Opening in over 2,800 theaters on Friday, The Devil Wears Prada might debut with around $14M over the weekend.After a short stint at number one, Adam Sandler‘s Click will get booted down by at least one notch in its second session. The arrival of Superman should have a big impact on sophomore weekend sales. Sandler pics are not known for legs as his built-in fan base typically makes the trek out to the cinemas upfront. The last time the comedian came out with a comedy in late June was in 2002 with Mr. Deeds which bowed to $37.2M which at today’s ticket prices would be a bit higher than the $40M debut of Click last weekend. Deeds sunk by 51% in its second frame thanks to the arrival of Sony stablemate Men in Black II which, like Superman Returns, opened mid-week ahead of the Independence Day holiday. This weekend, Click might see a 45% drop to around $22M which would give the studio $79M in ten days.Disney and Pixar have been driving away with some solid sales for Cars, but many kids will shift their attention over to the Man of Steel this week. A 40% decline would give the animated hit about $14M over the Friday-to-Sunday period and a cume of $180M after 24 days. Nacho Libre is sure to take a beating so a 50% drop to $6.5M would give Paramount a total of $64M in 17 days.LAST YEAR: With the Fourth of July holiday falling on a Monday, the long four-day frame saw an explosive opening for the Tom Cruise sci-fi flick War of the Worlds which grossed $77.1M over the Friday-to-Monday span. Launching on a Wednesday, the Steven Spielberg-helmed hit collected a towering $112.7M in its first six days in theaters. Paramount found its way to $234.3M domestically making War the second biggest blockbuster of the summer after Revenge of the Sith. Worldwide, the alien invasion saga pulled in a colossal $596M. Holdovers rounded out the top five. Batman Begins placed second with $19.3M over four days and was followed by Mr. &amp; Mrs. Smith with $12.7M, Bewitched with $11.1M, and Herbie: Fully Loaded with $10.8M. Opening far back in seventh with only $6M was Martin Lawrence‘s basketball comedy Rebound. The Fox release ended its season with just $16.8M.Author: Gitesh Pandya, www.BoxOfficeGuru.com","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"book, mutant, killer, medical, docuseries, 21st, 2019, One, blaxploitation, child's, MSNBC, 71st, screenings, boxoffice, toronto","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Preview-Son-of-Krypton-Returns-to-Theaters"},{"id":"47509160155256","title":"Box Office Wrapup: Leo and Matt Face Off at #1 with The Departed","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Wrapup: Leo and Matt Face Off at #1 with The Departedby Gitesh Pandya | October 9, 2006 |  CommentsMartin Scorsese scored the best opening of his career, and his first number one film in fifteen years, with the star-studded gangster thriller \"The Departed,\" which led the North American box office over the Columbus Day holiday weekend.Moviegoers also showed interest in the horror prequel The Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Beginning which debuted in second place, as well as the new comedy Employee of the Month which bowed in fourth with respectable results. The new releases helped to boost attendance at multiplexes as the top ten set a new record for the holiday frame selling just a bit less than $100M worth of tickets.Starpower ruled the box office this weekend as the ultraviolent pic The Departed starring Leonardo DiCaprio, Matt Damon, and Jack Nicholson opened convincingly at number one grossing an estimated $27M in its first outing. The Warner Bros. release averaged a vicious $8,954 from 3,017 theaters and set a new opening weekend record for acclaimed director Scorsese beating the $10.3M bow of his 1991 Robert De Niro thriller Cape Fear, which also happened to be the filmmaker’s last top spot opener. The 63-year-old director usually sees more narrow releases for his films. His last picture The Aviator took off in limited release before expanding nationally over Christmas weekend in 2004 with 1,796 theaters while his previous pic Gangs of New York bowed in 1,504 locations. Both were set in the past, starred DiCaprio, and released by Miramax. The Departed marked Scorsese’s first film ever to debut in more than 2,000 theaters.A remake of 2002’s award-winning Hong Kong blockbuster Infernal Affairs, The Departed finds Nicholson as a crime boss who sends a mole (Damon) into the Boston police force. DiCaprio plays an undercover cop infiltrating the crime syndicate. Alec Baldwin, Martin Sheen, and Mark Wahlberg co-star in the R-rated feast. Critics drenched the pic with praise giving it some of the best reviews of the year. Starpower combined with strong reviews and a solid marketing push from Warner Bros. contributed to a powerful turnout from movie fans. Departed brought badly-needed good news to the distributor which is struggling through a year full of costly misfires. It ranks dead last among Hollywood’s big six studios in 2006 market share and has only generated two other number one debuts this year – V for Vendetta and Superman Returns.Produced for a hefty $90M, The Departed does seem to have a promising road ahead of it. Not only have critics been giving it high marks, but so have ticket buyers. The gangster film has earned an encouraging A- grade from over 2,000 users on Yahoo Movies. Plus it has given DiCaprio only the third number one opener of his career and his first since Titanic set sail on its record-shattering voyage in 1997. Damon has enjoyed several top spots debuts in recent years most notably with his Bourne and Ocean’s flicks. Meanwhile, Nicholson proved once again why he remains the biggest box office draw of his generation.Opening with strength in second place was another violent R-rated film, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Beginning, which bowed to an estimated $19.2M. Scaring audiences in 2,820 theaters, the New Line franchise pic averaged a strong $6,791 per venue. The opening was below the $28.1M debut of the 2003 remake of Chainsaw Massacre which went on to gross a terrific $80.1M. However, Beginning was never expected to reach the same neighborhood and with its relatively low $16M production cost, it should easily be yet another profitable horror film.The new film benefited from a lack of scary movies in the current marketplace, but the road ahead should be tough with a pair of horror sequels set to attack the box office in the coming weeks. The Grudge 2 launches this Friday the 13th while Saw III will be unleashed on the weekend before Halloween. The new Leatherface frightfest performed just like another of New Line’s horror franchise pics from this year, Final Destination 3, which debuted to $19.2M in February on its way to a $54.1M final. The two scary movies have delivered the best openings for its distributor over the past year.Sony’s hit toon Open Season fell from first to third place but managed to show good legs easing only 32% to an estimated $16M in its second hunt. Enjoying the smallest decline in the top ten, the PG-rated pic has upped its ten-day cume to a solid $44.1M and could continue to post impressive holds in the weeks ahead as there is little competition for its family audience until November. Look for Open Season to reach $80-85M from North America. Though impressive, Sony Pictures Animation’s debut venture still does not seem like it will reach the heights of other non-sequel non-summer digital toons like Ice Age ($176.4M), Shark Tale ($160.8M), Robots ($128.2M), or even 1998’s Antz ($90.7M).The new Lionsgate comedy Employee of the Month opened in fourth place with an estimated $11.8M from 2,579 theaters. Averaging a respectable $4,575 per venue, the PG-13 film stars Dane Cook, Jessica Simpson, and Dax Shephard and tells of a love triangle among workers at a superstore. Reviews, not surprisingly, were mostly negative.Ashton Kutcher and Kevin Costner dropped three spots with their Coast Guard actioner The Guardian which collected an estimated $9.6M in its second mission. Down 46%, the Buena Vista release has collected $32.4M in ten days and should find its way to $50-55M domestically.The fall season’s top-grossing hit Jackass: Number Two dropped 56% in its third weekend to an estimated $6.4M pushing its stellar total to $62.7M in 17 days. Later this week, the Paramount sequel will fly past the $64.3M of its 2002 predecessor. The MGM comedy School for Scoundrels tumbled 60% to an estimated $3.4M in its sophomore frame. With $14M in ten days, the Billy Bob Thornton–Jon Heder pic should wind up with around $20M.The Rock‘s football flick Gridiron Gang followed with an estimated $2.3M, down 50%, for a $36.6M total to date for Sony. Jet Li was close behind in ninth place with Fearless which fell 56% to an estimated $2.2M putting its sum at $21.7M for Focus. Rounding out the top ten was the durable period mystery The Illusionist which slipped only 33% and took in an estimated $1.8M. Yari Film Group has taken in a respectable $34.1M after its eighth weekend, the last six of which were spent in the top ten.In limited release, ThinkFilm launched its unrated sex romp Shortbus in only six arthouses but grossed an estimated $121,000 for a potent $20,108 average. Playing in New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Toronto, and Vancouver, the John Cameron Mitchell-directed film will expand to ten more markets next weekend.New Line premiered its Kate Winslet–Jennifer Connelly pic Little Children in five theaters in New York and Los Angeles and grossed an estimated $108,400. The suburban drama averaged a sturdy $21,680 and will expand over the weeks ahead.Among holdovers expanding in limited release, Miramax’s The Queen reigned supreme taking in an estimated $401,000 from eleven theaters for a stunning $36,455 second weekend average. The acclaimed Helen Mirren drama widened from its three-theater debut in New York and has grossed $634,000 to date with a promising road ahead.Fox Searchlight’s Idi Amin tale The Last King of Scotland expanded from four theaters in two markets to 30 sites in 14 markets and grossed an estimated $300,000. With a solid $10,000 average this weekend, the Forest Whitaker pic will invade 20 new markets on Friday expanding its dictatorship into more of North America. Cume to date is $541,000 after 12 days.The Michel Gondry flick The Science of Sleep held steady in 221 theaters but dropped 39% to an estimated $680,000 in its third dream. Warner Independent averaged a mild $3,077 and pushed the cume to just $2.7M.Three films dropped out of the top ten this weekend. Fox Searchlight’s word-of-mouth hit Little Miss Sunshine grossed an estimated $1.3M in its eleventh weekend, down 36%, and pushed its total to a stellar $55M. Acquired at the Sundance Film Festival in January for a hefty $10.5M, the dysfunctional family comedy has become the second biggest grosser ever for the distributor and looks to end its run close to the $60M mark. That would also make it the second highest grossing R-rated film of the summer after the $63.4M of Miami Vice which cost tons more to produce and market.MGM’s World War I adventure Flyboys crashed 56% in its third flight and took in an estimated $1M. With only $11.8M in 17 days, the James Franco flop should finish up with under $14M. The Black Dahlia, another of this fall’s historical dramas to be rejected by moviegoers, has collected just over $22M to date. Budgeted at $60M, the Universal release should close its case with a mere $24M.The top ten films grossed an estimated $99.7M which was up 23% from last year when Wallace and Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit debuted at number one with $16M; and up 5% from 2004 when Shark Tale remained in the top spot for a second time with $31.3M.Author: Gitesh Pandya, www.BoxOfficeGuru.com","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"hist, e., guild, horror, Awards, The, PlayStation, scene, Amazon, Super, boxing, LGBT","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Wrapup-Leo-and-Matt-Face-Off-at-1-with-The-Departed"},{"id":"47509160149109","title":"Box Office Guru Preview: Eastwood vs. Scorsese – Round 2","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Preview: Eastwood vs. Scorsese - Round 2by Gitesh Pandya | October 19, 2006 |  CommentsHollywood sure loves to dwell on yesteryear. Another wave of historical films hits the multiplexes on Friday led by the World War II drama \"Flags of our Fathers\" directed by Clint Eastwood.Going back another half-century is the Hugh Jackman–Christian Bale thriller \"The Prestige.\" Kirsten Dunst rewinds even further to the 18th century playing the title role in \"Marie Antoinette.\" Moviegoers who want to stick to the today’s times get to ride the family film \"Flicka\" which also is added into the mix this weekend. Overall, the North American box office should simmer down after two weeks of red-hot action thanks to a quartet of new releases that does not seem to be exciting the public too much.What happens when two-time Oscar winners Clint Eastwood and Steven Spielberg join forces to produce a film? You get the DreamWorks/Warner Bros. production \"Flags of our Fathers\" which chronicles the famous battle at Iwo Jima and the notoriety that followed for the soldiers photographed hoisting the American flag. The R-rated film is low on starpower boasting a cast featuring Ryan Phillippe, Adam Beach, and Jesse Bradford. Clearly it will be subject matter and the director that will draw in audiences. \"Flags\" is likely to become the oldest-skewing film in the marketplace. Young adults should not show too much interest and female appeal will be limited as well for this war story. Competition for adult men will be tough given the start of the World Series and the continuation of all sorts of live football all weekend long on television.Clint Eastwood’s WWII epic \"Flags of Our Fathers.\"But loyal Eastwood fans will probably find the time for \"Flags\" this weekend and some reviews have been good. Critics have not been giving the type of support this time that they gave in recent years to \"Million Dollar Baby\" and \"Mystic River\" giving it a lesser sense of urgency. Plus a fall season full of period films really doesn’t need more of them. A narrow release will curtail box office potential too. This weekend, it could turn out to be a rematch where Eastwood will square off against Martin Scorsese whose \"The Departed\" is proving to be an exciting option, set in modern times, for ticket buyers.The New York-based filmmaker wants revenge after losing to Dirty Harry at the Academy Awards a year and a half ago. \"Mystic River\" opened wide in October 2003 to an average just north of $7,000. Paramount’s \"Flags of our Fathers,\" which debuts in roughly 1,800 locations, could reach the same vicinity and collect about $13M this weekend.Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale play dueling magicians at the turn of the 20th century in \"The Prestige.\" The current Caped Crusader reteams with director Christopher Nolan in this PG-13 period drama which co-stars Scarlett Johansson as, you guessed it, the beautiful young woman both men desire. Michael Caine also appears in another Alfred-like role. The Buena Vista film’s biggest challenge will be to convince audiences that this is not that Edward Norton film they just saw a few weeks ago. While \"The Illusionist\" was not a big blockbuster, it was very well-liked by moviegoers and has had some of the best legs of 2006. Those who paid to see it may not be in the mood for another one so soon. Just ask Mr. Capote. Starpower in \"The Prestige\" is good, but the two leads do not usually sell well outside of their comic book flicks. \"The Departed\" and \"Flags of our Fathers\" will steal away adult audiences providing ample competition, but \"The Prestige\" does have more female appeal than Clint’s war tale so adult couples that have seen Leo vs. Matt already might give Wolverine vs. Batman a try. Opening in over 2,000 theaters, \"The Prestige\" could debut with around $10M.Michael Caine and Hugh Jackman, in that other 19th century magician movie.The weekend’s only family offering comes on horseback in the form of \"Flicka.\" 27-year-old Alison Lohman stars as a stubborn 16-year-old girl who befriends a steed against the wishes of her dad on a scenic Wyoming ranch. The PG-rated film should mostly appeal to girls and play to the same crowd that spent $9.2M this weekend a year ago for the bow of another girl-and-her-horse flick, \"Dreamer.\" Business will be stronger in the heartland than in large urban centers. Fox is giving \"Flicka\" the widest release by far of any of this weekend’s new openers so the sheer size of the distribution will give it some traction, even if the average limps a bit. \"Open Season,\" which is still strong going into its fourth hunt, will be the only real threat to business. While bad girls might line up for \"Marie Antoinette\" this weekend, the good girls will get to ride with \"Flicka\" which will gallop into over 2,000 more theaters. Opening in 2,876 sites, the horse flick could take in around $10M this weekend.Alison Lohman and Tim McGraw in \"Flicka.\"Spidergirl Kirsten Dunst tosses on a fancy wig to play the famous queen of France in \"Marie Antoinette,\" written and directed by Sofia Coppola. Booed last May at the Cannes Film Festival, the PG-13 film is a biopic aimed squarely at teenage girls and young women with a story of a bold gal with a strong head on her shoulders, for most of the time. The studio is marketing the film in a hip way hoping to appeal to young people. \"Marie\" should skew heavily female as interest from guys will be weak. Dunst will have a chance to test her starpower as the only big-name actor in the cast. Her date movie \"Wimbledon\" did not fare too well in the Fall of 2004 with a $7.1M opening from over 2,000 theaters. Reese Witherspoon‘s \"Vanity Fair\" bowed to $4.8M from just over 1,000 playdates by appealing to a similar audience. \"Marie Antoinette\" will launch in only 859 theaters on Friday limiting its box office potential. A weekend gross of about $5M could result.Kirsten Dunst is \"Marie Antoinette.\"Last weekend’s box office champ \"The Grudge 2\" has seen its audience get frightened away during the week as the Sony thriller dropped to second place on Monday and third on Tuesday. A hefty tumble of 55% could result giving the spookfest about $9M for the weekend and a ten-day sum of $33M.On the other hand, Warner Bros. has been enjoying great legs from its mob thriller \"The Departed\" which eased only 29% in its second mission. \"Flags of our Fathers\" and \"The Prestige\" will eat into its adult audience, but the Martin Scorsese hit should continue to remain a very popular moviegoing option. A 30% fall to about $13M might lead \"The Departed\" back into the top spot this weekend unless one of the newbies breaks out. Regardless, that would push the cume to a stellar $76M.LAST YEAR: The Rock cooked up a number one opening with his sci-fi actioner \"Doom\" which opened with $15.5M. Universal’s video game-inspired flick fell apart quickly and found its way to only $28M. Debuting in second place was the less expensive family film \"Dreamer\" with $9.2M on its way to a stronger $32.8M final for DreamWorks. The Spielberg studio also claimed the third spot with the leggy kidpic \"Wallace and Gromit\" with $8.6M, off only 26% in its third weekend. Sony’s horror pic \"The Fog\" fell from first to fourth with $6.7M. Warner Bros. saw a weak opening for its Charlize Theron drama \"North Country\" which grossed just $6.4M. Cume reached a mere $18.3M.Author: Gitesh Pandya, www.BoxOfficeGuru.com","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"Elton, Nat, Lionsgate, Annual, reviews, Stephen, movies, Turner, Studios, Winners, Arts, Hallmark","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Preview-Eastwood-vs-Scorsese-Round-2"},{"id":"47509167172784","title":"Godzilla vs. Kong Director Adam Wingard Takes on Thundercats, and More Movie News","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Godzilla vs. Kong Director Adam Wingard Takes on Thundercats, and More Movie NewsNetflix lands two Knives Out sequels, Jordan Peele recruits Steven Yeun, Paramount may not have Breakfast at Tiffany's, and WB pulls the plug on New Gods and The Trench.by Greg Dean Schmitz | April 2, 2021 |  CommentsThis week’s Ketchup brings you more headlines from the world of film development news, covering such titles as Knives Out 2 (and 3), ThunderCats, and the 7th and 8th Transformers.This WEEK’S TOP STORYGODZILLA VS KONG DIRECTOR YELLS THUNDER, THUNDER, THUNDER, THUNDERCATS HO!&nbsp;(Photo by Jason Mendez/Everett Collection, (c)Telepictures Corp.)So many iconic comics, toys, games, and TV shows have at some point been adapted into movies that it might be surprising&nbsp;to learn which ones&nbsp;haven’t. The original American animated series ThunderCats is remembered fondly by many 1980s kids and teenagers, but despite a couple of revival series in 2011 and 2020, ThunderCats has eluded a live-action movie. Some of that might have to do with the necessary makeup, as they’re basically humanoids of various big cats (Lion-O is a lion, Cheetara is a cheetah, and so forth). Rumors of a possible ThunderCats movie date back at least 2007, when test footage for a CGI ThunderCats was done (which you can watch right here). This week’s Godzilla vs Kong (Certified Fresh at 78%) features a setting that sort of resembles the Third Earth of ThunderCats, so&nbsp;it’s not entirely surprising that the film’s director,&nbsp;Adam Wingard, has signed with Warner Bros.&nbsp;to direct and co-write the ThunderCats movie. Wingard’s writing partner on the CGI/live-action hybrid ThunderCats will be Simon Barrett, who was previously Wingard’s writer on You’re Next (Certified Fresh at 79%), The Guest (Certified Fresh at 91%), and Blair Witch (Rotten at 37%). You can read interviews with Wingard where he talks about ThunderCats and his upcoming Face/Off sequel at Deadline and The Hollywood Reporter.Other Top Headlines1. WARNER BROS PULLS THE PLUG ON NEW GODS AND AQUAMAN SPINOFF(Photo by Priscilla Grant/Everett Collection)From the hiring of Ta-Nehisi Coates to reboot Superman to the casting of the first Latina Supergirl to their new Blue Beetle, Hourman, Batgirl, and Zatanna movies,&nbsp;Warner Bros. has been particularly busy in early 2021 seemingly readying to move their DC Comics movies in a new direction. Although Zack Snyder didn’t direct all of their recent movies (obviously), the three DCEU films he did direct left a long unifying shadow over many of them. This week, Warner Bros. appeared to make room for some of those new projects by shelving two of them. Warner Bros. has stopped development of Ava DuVernay’s New Gods (based on a Jack Kirby series similar to his Eternals for Marvel) and James Wan’s The Trench, which would have been an underwater horror movie spun off from the monsters in Aquaman. Although both movies were shelved, Warner Bros is holding out the possibility that they could be revived at some later point. In related news, this week Warner Bros. also hired screenwriter Randy McKinnon, who wrote the football drama Safety for Disney+, to work on their adaptation of DC Comics’ Static Shock, which Michael B. Jordan is producing for the studio.2. NETFLIX LANDS KNIVES OUT SEQUELS IN MASSIVE DEAL(Photo by Claire Folger/©Lionsgate)After the star-studded ensemble mystery Knives Out (Certified Fresh at 97%) earned over $311 million from a budget of just $40 million, it was quickly obvious that the film would probably get at least one sequel, and by January of last year, that’s exactly what began to take shape. With Knives Out, Lionsgate suddenly had a lucrative franchise that promised to be the mini-major studio’s biggest since The Hunger Games. Director Rian Johnson planned Knives Out very wisely, however, retaining all rights after that first film, so he was in a position this week to sell two Knives Out sequels to Netflix in a deal worth over $400 million (i.e. $93 million than the first movie earned). Daniel Craig will return as detective Benoit Blanc for both sequels, the first of which will start filming at locations in Greece this summer, 2021.3. IN THE HEIGHTS STAR JOINS ONE OF MULTIPLE UPCOMING TRANSFORMERS PROJECTS(Photo by Jason Mendez/Everett Collection)Although the Transformers movies have mostly earned Rotten Tomatometer scores (except the most recent, Bumblebee, which was Certified Fresh at 91%), those movies have also earned nearly $5 billion worldwide, so Paramount Pictures obviously has an incentive to keep on making them. This week, Paramount’s efforts to keep the Transformers franchise alive got a little confusing, as two separate Transformers projects made the news within a few days of feach other. Let’s start with In the Heights star Anthony Ramos, who is being eyed by Paramount to be the lead in the next Transformers movie to be filmed, under the direction of Steven Caple Jr. (Creed II, Certified Fresh at 83%). Also this week, we learned&nbsp;Charm City Kings director Angel Manuel Soto is now developing another Transformers project, separate from the one starring Ramos. Soto is also developing the Blue Beetle movie for Warner Bros., which was announced earlier this year. Finally, in addition to these two projects, Paramount is also developing an animated feature film to be directed by Josh Cooley (Toy Story 4).4. STEVEN YEUN TO STAR IN JORDAN PEELE’S MYSTERIOUS NEXT FILM(Photo by Priscilla Grant/Everett Collection)Following the success of his directorial debut Get Out (Certified Fresh at 98%), Jordan Peele cast Lupita Nyong’o to star in his mysterious next film, which we now know as Us (Certified Fresh at 93%). Two years later, Jordan Peele is again preparing for a project shrouded in mystery, but this time around, the Academy Award-nominated star that he is eyeing to cast is Steven Yeun, who is&nbsp;up for an Oscar this year&nbsp;for his role in Minari (Certified Fresh at 98%). So little is known about the project that we don’t even know what genre it is, much less any clue about the premise or setting. The only other details we have right now is that Get Out star Daniel Kaluuya, who is also Oscar-nominated this year for his supporting role in Judas and the Black Messiah (Certified Fresh at 96%), is also in talks, as is Keke Palmer, and that the release date is July 22, 2022.5.&nbsp;RUSSELL CROWE JOINS THOR: LOVE AND THUNDER (BUT AS WHO… OR WHAT?)(Photo by © Universal Pictures)Thor: Ragnarok and Jojo Rabbit director Taika Waititi has been filming the fourth Thor movie,&nbsp;Thor: Love and Thunder, on sets in Sydney, Australia for over two months now, and as late as this week, we’re still finding out about new cast members. In addition to the various returning MCU stars (including Chris Pratt and other Guardians of the Galaxy), the Thor: Love and Thunder cast even before this week’s news included Christian Bale as Gorr the God Butcher and Melissa McCarthy as the actress who plays Hela in an Asgardian play. To that list, we can also now include Australian star Russell Crowe, but that’s really all we know about his participation right now. Fans have been making lots of guesses (including Beta Ray Bill), but one strong possibility, given his late addition, might be as just another of the Asgardian play actors. We haven’t, for example, heard about anyone playing the Hulk in the play, so perhaps that’s what Crowe will be doing? Marvel Studios has scheduled Thor: Love and Thunder for release on May 6, 2022, just a little over a year from now.6. MEDICAL HISTORY MOVIES ABOUT JONAS SALK AND HEINRICH HIMMLER(Photo by Elizabeth Goodenough/Everett Collection)There are frequently more than just ten movies worth mentioning, so when it’s applicable, the we’ll sometimes group stories together to get them covered. The common theme here is “20th century true stories involving doctors.” Let’s start with Woody Harrelson, who is now signed to star in the drama The Man with the Miraculous Hands as a Finnish doctor who was forced to become the doctor of Heinrich Himmler, the Nazi leader of the S.S. during World War II. With his Texas drawl, Harrelson doesn’t seem like an obvious choice to play a Finnish doctor in the 1940s, but he’s proven himself capable of handling serious material, so it could work. The other similar project announced this week is the drama Splendid Solution, which will feature Jeremy Strong (The Trial of the Chicago 7) as Dr. Jonas Salk, the inventor of the polio vaccine. Splendid Solution will be adapted from a bestselling non fiction book by Gillian Weeks, whose book Lost Moon: The Perilous Voyage of Apollo 13 was adapted as the Ron Howard film Apollo 13.7. JOHN WOO PRODUCING UNPUBLISHED STAN LEE COMIC MONKEY MASTER(Photo by Elisabetta A. Villa/Getty Images)Although Stan Lee was obviously “The Man” steering the ship through Marvel Comics’ most creative period during the 1960s and most of the 1970s, he actually stopped writing comics for Marvel in 1972, and had completely stepped away from Marvel in the 1990s. Despite this, Lee did continue&nbsp;to be active in other projects, both in and out of comics, well into the 21st century, although none of those projects came close to the fame of even some of his more obscure Marvel titles. Hong Kong producer and director John Woo now has his eye on raising the profile of at least one of those Stan Lee projects, as he is now developing a feature film based on Lee’s unpublished comic book series Monkey Master. The project was something Lee was working on in 2016, just two years before his death in 2018 at the age of 95. Monkey Master is described as an adaptation of the classic Chinese legend of the Monkey King, which has found its way into all sorts of pop culture works. It is not yet known if Woo will also direct the Monkey Master movie. In 2016, Stan Lee was quoted as saying, “I’ve written countless superheroes of every nationality and every part of the world before. I’ve even created many heroes from other planets and galaxies, but Monkey Master will be unique in how it interweaves myth to create a modern day hero that will entertain fans across the world with his martial arts skills and unstoppable super-powers.”8. BREAKFAST AT TIFFANY’S REMAKE RESULTS IN $20 MILLION COPYRIGHT SUIT(Photo by Everett Collection)Although it’s true that Hollywood has been remaking movies since the Silent Era, the last decade or so has&nbsp;felt like there have been more than usual. Right about now, Paramount Pictures may be feeling like there was one remake they never should have commissioned. The statutory heirs of the late author Truman Capote have brought a $20 million copyright claim&nbsp;against Paramount over a Breakfast at Tiffany’s remake screenplay that Paramount executives have been circulating “internally.” The question behind the claim is whether the rights to remake Breakfast at Tiffany’s reverted back to Capote’s heirs at some point, or whether Paramount retains those rights in perpetuity. Of course, neither side seems to be asking perhaps the most relevant question, which is whether a beloved (and at the same time, problematic) classic like Breakfast at Tiffany’s (Certified Fresh at 89%) should even be remade at all.9.&nbsp;ARMIE HAMMER DROPPED FROM YET ANOTHER FILM(Photo by Daniel Smith/Warner Bros.)Two weeks ago, the Los Angeles Police Department began a probe into charges&nbsp;filed against actor Armie Hammer following allegations earlier this year about possible assault. In February, Hammer had already lost his starring role in the Jennifer Lopez romantic comedy Shotgun Wedding (in which he was replaced by Josh Duhamel). This week, he was dealt another career blow as he has been dropped from the thriller &nbsp;The Billion Dollar Spy&nbsp;starring Mads Mikkelsen.&nbsp; The producers of that project have not yet announced a replacement&nbsp;to play what would’ve been Armie Hammer’s role.On an Apple device?

Besides the various Flash Gordon serials of the 1930s and 1940s, the last Flash Gordon movie was produced in 1980, as recently memorialized by Seth McFarlane in his comedy Ted. Now that 20th Century Fox is part of Disney’s properties, the studio is apparently working with one of their Marvel collaborators on reviving the Flash Gordon project. Taika Waititi, who had both a box office and critical hit with Thor: Ragnarok (Certified Fresh at 93%), is now attached to take a “crack” at adapting Flash Gordon not as a live action project, but as an animated film. It could be easily argued that animation might be the most exciting (and affordable) way to adapt an ambitious space opera like Flash Gordon, as his adventures take place on the fantastic planet Mongo, including such settings as the Ice Kingdom of Frigia, the underwater kingdom of the Shark Men, and the floating city of the Hawkmen. Taika Waititi will probably need a few years at least before Flash Gordon will be ready for release, especially since he is currently working on his next film, the World War II-set fantasy satire Jojo Rabbit (10/18/2019), in which Waititi will play a young boy’s imaginary friend, Adolf Hitler (yes, really).Fresh Developments1. SALMA HAYEK MAY JOIN ANGELINA JOLIE IN MARVEL’S THE ETERNALS(Photo by Dee Cercone/Everett Collection)Marvel Studios hasn’t officially announced any films past next week’s Spider-Man: Far from Home (currently Certified Fresh at 91%), but we do know that they’re currently filming Black Widow, and the only other film currently casting up is The Eternals. (We can probably expect some official announcements at San Diego Comic-Con in a few weeks.) Like Guardians of the Galaxy in 2014, The Eternals is sort of a “deep cut,” and it has never been one of their more popular titles despite dating back to 1976. The latest name to be mentioned for The Eternals is Salma Hayek, who recently wrapped filming of the sequel The Hitman’s Wife’s Bodyguard with Marvel stars Ryan Reynolds (Deadpool) and Samuel L. Jackson. Angelina Jolie and Richard Madden (Robb Stark from Game of Thrones) are expected to star as long-time Avengers member Sersi and Eternals leader Ikaris, respectively. As their name suggests, Marvel’s The Eternals are long-lived beings who inspired various mythological figures.2. PAUL RUDD JOINS GHOSTBUSTERS 2020(Photo by Universal Pictures)For a while now, we’ve had to awkwardly refer to the next Ghostbusters (7/10/2020) as “Ghostbusters 3,” despite it being the fourth Ghostbusters (after the 2016 reboot), with the “3” being a reference to the fact that it’s a direct sequel to the first two movies. Ant-Man star Paul Rudd joined the sequel this week, which he himself confirmed through a Twitter video. In their story about Rudd’s casting, Variety also revealed that the film is now called Ghostbusters 2020. Rudd will reportedly be playing a teacher in Ghostbusters 2020, but the context for that role is still unknown, such as whether he’ll be the teacher of the new characters played by Finn Wolfhard (Stranger Things) or Mckenna Grace (Annabelle Comes Home), or perhaps is related to Carrie Coon’s mother character. These new characters are expected to be joined by original 1980s stars Dan Aykroyd, Ernie Hudson, Bill Murray, Annie Potts, and Sigourney Weaver.3.&nbsp;HENRY CAVILL CAST AS SHERLOCK IN ENOLA HOLMES&nbsp;(Photo by David James /©Paramount)The Enola Holmes Mysteries were a series of six young adult novels&nbsp;published from 2006 to 2010 that followed the adventures of Sherlock Holmes’ younger sister. Stranger Things star Millie Bobby Brown signed on in early 2018 to star as Enola Holmes, but it wasn’t until this week that we found out who’s going to be joining her as her older brother. Henry Cavill, former Superman of the DCEU, will co-star as detective Sherlock Holmes&nbsp;in the upcoming film, with Helena Bonham Carter also co-starring as her mother. (It’s unclear if that means that Carter’s also playing Sherlock’s mom.) Henry Cavill will also soon&nbsp;appear in Netflix’s series adaptation of the popular video game franchise The Witcher.4.&nbsp;MERYL STREEP, NICOLE KIDMAN, AWKWAFINA, AND ARIANA GRANDE WILL ATTEND NETFLIX’S THE PROM(Photo by Dee Cercone/Everett Collection)Netflix scored really well at the Academy Awards this year with Alfonso Cuaron’s Roma, and the streaming service isn’t slowing down. Last year, Netflix began a five year deal with TV showrunner Ryan Murphy (American Horror Story, American Crime Story, Feud), and this week, his first major project at Netflix was revealed with an impressive cast attached. Murphy is going to adapt the Tony-nominated Broadway musical The Prom, which he will direct in addition to producing. Murphy’s cast for The Prom will include Awkwafina, James Corden, Ariana Grande, Keegan-Michael Key, Nicole Kidman, Meryl Streep, and Andrew Rannells, who received a Tony nomination for his lead role in The Book of Mormon. Ryan Murphy is expected to start filming this December, aiming for an awards season release in late 2020.5. CONSTANCE WU SAYS GOODBYE, VITAMIN(Photo by Warner Bros.)Last month, Crazy Rich Asians star Constance Wu found herself at the center of a Twitter controversy after a Tweet interpreted by many as “apparent displeasure” about ABC renewing her sitcom Fresh Off the Boat for another season. In her apology, Constance Wu explained that her response was because the “renewal meant I had to give up another project that I was really passionate about.” We still don’t know what that mystery project was, but there is a possibility that might have been this week’s news, a novel adaptation&nbsp;called Goodbye, Vitamin. Wu is now attached to star in the “dramedy” for Universal Pictures as a daughter who fakes a class so that her history professor can continue to teach after being diagnosed with Alzheimer’s.6. SHAZAM! STAR ZACHARY LEVI JOINS THE LONELY ISLAND’S SPY GUYS(Photo by Warner Bros. Pictures)Over a decade before starring in this year’s superhero comedy Shazam! (Certified Fresh at 91%), Zachary Levi first shot to fame as the star of NBC’s Chuck, in which he played a regular guy who becomes embroiled in the secret world of international espionage. This week’s news therefore finds him coming full circle, as he will play a spy who has to recruit the assistance of his “regular guy” friends from college in the action comedy Spy Guys. The New Line Cinema comedy is being produced by Andy Samberg and his Lonely Island collaborators Jorma Taccone and Akiva Schaffer, who all originally started work on Spy Guys with the intent of it being a starring vehicle for Samberg (with Zachary Levi apparently taking that role instead).&nbsp;Spy Guys will be the second feature film from director Jeff Tomsic, who made his debut last year with the thematically similar “old friends reunion” comedy, Tag (Rotten at 56%).7.&nbsp;REMAKE OF&nbsp;THE CRAFT&nbsp;MOVES FORWARD WITH FIRST CASTING&nbsp;Fairuza Balk, Neve Campbell, Rachel True, and Robin Tunney starred in the 1996 supernatural thriller The Craft (Rotten at 57%) as four teen girls who start practicing witchcraft. Now, some 23 years later, Blumhouse is developing a reboot of The Craft&nbsp;that will tell a new, contemporary version of the same story. The first young actress to join the reboot of The Craft is 21-year-old Cailee Spaeny, who is still relatively unknown&nbsp;despite featured roles in Bad Times at the El Royale and the giant robot sequel Pacific Rim: Uprising. This new version of The Craft will be directed by Zoe Lister-Jones, who made her directorial debut in 2017 with the indie rock musical Band Aid (Certified Fresh at 85%).8. TERENCE STAMP AND DIANA RIGG JOIN EDGAR WRIGHT’S THRILLER(Photo by ©Outsider Pictures)Director Edgar Wright (Hot Fuzz, Shaun of the Dead) reportedly still wants to direct a sequel to Baby Driver&nbsp;someday, but until that project gets going, his next film will instead be a psychological thriller called Last Night in Soho. The premise is still being kept secret, but we do know that the stars will include Anya Taylor-Joy (The Witch, Split), Matt Smith (TV’s Doctor Who), and Thomasin Harcourt-McKenzie (Leave No Trace). This week, Wright further filled out the cast with three veteran English actors: Terence Stamp (The Limey, General Zod in Superman II); Diana Rigg (Olenna Tyrell from Game of Thrones); and Rita Tushingham (Doctor Zhivago). The other thing we know about Last Night in Soho is that it reportedly is set in two different timelines, so it’s possible that some of the older actors might be playing the same roles as the younger ones (but that’s just speculation).Rotten Idea1. TRANSFORMERS: THE LAST KNIGHT SCREENWRITER&nbsp;TAPPED FOR&nbsp;HELLO KITTY MOVIE(Photo by Saban International courtesy Everett Collection)Last month’s Pokémon Detective Pikachu isn’t quite a massive blockbuster ($425 million to date on a budget of $150 million), but as the first video game adaptation to maintain a Fresh Tomatometer rating in wide release (67% to date), it’s not an embarrassment, either. Much like The LEGO Movie did in 2014, Pokémon Detective Pikachu may have established a template for how similar concepts, especially from Japan, could be adapted in the near future. Sanrio’s Hello Kitty is not exactly a “video game” character, as it represents&nbsp;a brand in anime, games, manga, clothing, and accessories. New Line Cinema has the movie rights to Hello Kitty, and to get things going, the studio this week hired screenwriter Lindsey Beer, who doesn’t yet have a WGA feature film credit, but did work on Transformers: The Last Knight&nbsp;and the upcoming&nbsp;Masters of the Universe (3/5/2021).Like this?

For Now, And More Movie NewsMarvel's Kevin Feige is developing a Star Wars movie, Jonah Hill might be The Batman's Riddler, and Jurassic Park stars return for Jurassic World 3.by Greg Dean Schmitz | September 27, 2019 |  CommentsThis week’s Ketchup brings you another 10 headlines from the world of film development news (the stories about what movies Hollywood is working on for you next), covering such titles as&nbsp;The Batman, Clue, Jurassic World 3, and the next Spider-Man.This WEEK’S TOP STORYDISNEY AND SONY MAKE NICE FOR ANOTHER SPIDER-MAN MOVIE IN 2021(Photo by Chuck Zlotnick/ © Columbia Pictures)You may remember that last month, there was a huge story that talks between Sony Pictures and Walt Disney Pictures (and their Marvel Studios) had fallen apart over future Spider-Man movies starring Tom Holland within the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Reportedly, Disney and Marvel wanted a 50% cut of future Spider-Man movies&nbsp;, and Sony wasn’t willing to budge.&nbsp;People understandably reacted quite passionately to the news, with plenty of folks saying one or the other studio was being greedy at the expense of what the fans wanted.&nbsp;Well, after all of that attention and feedback, the relevant parties started up talks again, resulting in today’s big news, which is that Sony Pictures and Marvel Studios will indeed work together on a third solo Spider-Man film starring Tom Holland, which will be released on July 16, 2021. The financial compromise calls for Disney to receive 25% of the film’s profits (leaving 75% for Sony), down from their original request of 50%. As part of the new deal, Tom Holland will also appear as Spider-Man in one more MCU movie, the title and premise of which haven’t been revealed yet. The new release date (7/16/2021) for the next Spider-Man movie is the same as Space Jam 2, a week after Indiana Jones 5 (7/9/2021), and a week before Mission: Impossible 7 (7/23/2021). Marvel Studios’ other films scheduled for 2021 are: Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings (2/12/2021), Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness (5/7/2021), and Thor: Love and Thunder (11/5/2021).Other Top Headlines1. MARVEL STUDIOS BOSS KEVIN FEIGE IS DEVELOPING A STAR WARS MOVIE(Photo by Greg Doherty/Getty Images)Before the&nbsp;news about Spider-Man&nbsp;broke, this writer thought for sure that the top story of the week was going to be this revelation about the future of Star Wars. In addition to the Star Wars movies that have actually been released since Disney acquired Lucasfilm, there are nearly as many projects that have been rumored or are still in development for the future, past 2020. We’re thinking, for example, of the now apparently cancelled “Star Wars Story” movies for Boba Fett, Obi-Wan, and Yoda, and the projects from both director Rian Johnson and Game of Thrones showrunners David Benioff and D.B. Weiss.&nbsp; As far as we currently know, the first movie from Benioff and Weiss is still scheduled for December 16, 2022 (with two more to follow in 2024 and 2026). It was announced this week, however, that what appears to be another Star Wars project is being developed by Marvel Studios boss Kevin Feige. No other details have been revealed, except that there is reportedly a “major actor” that Feige hopes to attract. Considering it was reported earlier this year that Feige had been talking to Keanu Reeves about joining the Marvel Cinematic Universe, Reeves is now everyone’s top guess as to who Feige is courting. Other names included in this piece by The Hollywood Reporter include previous Marvel stars Hugh Jackman and Michael B. Jordan, current Captain Marvel star Brie Larson, former Dark Knight star Christian Bale, and Leonardo DiCaprio, who has mostly avoided starring in “franchise” movies.2.&nbsp;JONAH HILL LIKELY JOINING THE BATMAN AS THE RIDDLER(Photo by Glen Wilson/©Sony Pictures Releasing)Few modern actors have transformed themselves within the last 15 years or so quite like Jonah Hill has. Based on some of the speculation this week, it would seem a lot of people haven’t actually seen what he looks like since 2010 or so. It all started with the news that Hill had begun early talks with Warner Bros. about joining The Batman (the one starring Robert Pattinson) as one of the superhero reboot’s villains. That led many to conjecture about&nbsp;him playing the Penguin, but Collider quickly confirmed that the role Jonah Hill is up for is the Riddler instead. The Penguin is still thought to be in The Batman, but another actor will&nbsp;take on that role. The Jonah Hill news ended up overshadowing the report a few hours earlier that Jeffrey Wright (of HBO’s Westworld and the Hunger Games franchise) is also in talks to join The Batman as Gotham City Police Commissioner James Gordon, taking over the role previously played by Gary Oldman and, briefly, J.K. Simmons. Warner Bros has scheduled The Batman for release on June 25, 2021 (a week before Sing 2, and two weeks before Indiana Jones 5).3. ORIGINAL JURASSIC PARK STARS TO RETURN FOR JURASSIC WORLD 3(Photo by Universal courtesy Everett Collection)In the past, we’ve seen some of the stars from the original Jurassic Park return for sequels, with Sam Neill and Laura Dern returning for Jurassic Park III, and Jeff Goldblum having a small role in last year’s Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom. What hasn’t happened yet, however, is all three of them&nbsp;returning for the same movie, and in more than just small roles or cameos. That is, until this week, as Laura Dern, Jeff Goldblum, and Sam Neill are all now set to reunite for Jurassic World 3 (6/11/2021). Jurassic World director Colin Trevorrow, who skipped Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom, will return to the franchise with Jurassic World 3&nbsp;after also recently releasing a&nbsp;Jurassic World short&nbsp;film called Battle at Big Rock. No official premise for Jurassic World 3 has been announced yet, but the most common speculation involves the world’s response to the various dinosaurs expanding their dominance over the Earth after escaping into the wild at the end of Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom. Jurassic World 3 is scheduled for release on June 11, 2021, which puts it a week after the Micronauts and Sesame Street movies on June 4, 2021.4. THIS WEEK IN RYAN REYNOLDS, PART I: JASON BATEMAN TO DIRECT CLUE REMAKE(Photo by Matt Winkelmeyer/Getty Images)Sometimes a given star or director will have more than one big story in the same week. That’s what happened this week for Ryan Reynolds, who we last saw on the big screen in Pokémon Detective Pikachu (Fresh at 68%), back in May. Let’s start with a movie we already knew about, namely the reboot of Clue, based on the popular board game. Clue&nbsp;came out in 1985, and though it currently has a Rotten Tomatometer score of 59%, its legacy suggests fans feel otherwise. Jason Bateman is now in early talks with Fox and Disney to direct and star in the Clue reboot, along with Ryan Reynolds, who is also producing and expected to star. Bateman and Reynolds previously costarred together in 2011’s The Change-Up (Rotten at 25%).5.&nbsp;THIS WEEK IN RYAN REYNOLDS, PART II: A CHRISTMAS CAROL WITH WILL FERRELLL(Photo by Hilary Bronwyn Gale / © Focus Features)Not only did we get news about two movies starring Ryan Reynolds this week, but they’re both basically remakes/reboots. Unlike Clue, however, the other reboot is something that has been adapted dozens of times in film and television. Reynolds is teaming up with Will Ferrell to star in a new musical adaptation of Charles Dickens’ A Christmas Carol. So far, none of the stories about this new project specify which roles Reynolds and Ferrell will be playing, although this writer is going to speculate that Ferrell might be playing Ebenezer Scrooge, and Reynolds might be playing his unlucky and much put-upon employee, Bob Cratchit. (The roles could be going the other way, as well.) Musical adaptations of A Christmas Carol in the past have included the 1970 film Scrooge starring Albert Finney and 1992’s The Muppet Christmas Carol, among others.6. SYLVESTER STALLONE’S SUPERHERO MOVIE SAMARITAN SCHEDULED FOR 2020(Photo by Barry Wetcher/MGM)Now that Sylvester Stallone has starred in what is reportedly the last film in his most popular 1980s action movie franchise, Rambo: Last Blood (Rotten at 26%), it appears&nbsp;he now wants to jump on the superhero bandwagon in earnest. After a brief appearance in Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2, Stallone will now reportedly star in&nbsp;Samaritan, which we first heard about in February. In a time when some movies take decades to get produced (like Will Smith’s Gemini Man), Stallone’s Samaritan is moving at breakneck speed, as MGM has already scheduled Samaritan for release on November 20, 2020. The director will be Julius Avery, who is coming off last year’s World War II zombie movie, Overlord (Certified Fresh at 81%). Other movies coming out in November of 2020 will include Clifford the Big Red Dog (11/13/2020), Disney’s Raya and the Last Dragon (11/25/2020), and King Richard (11/25/2020), in which Will Smith will star as the father of future tennis stars Serena and Venus Williams.7. SONY PICTURES CONTINUES SPIDER-VERSE PLANS WITH&nbsp;MADAME WEBAlthough Marvel Studios retains the film rights to most of their characters, Sony Pictures retains the feature film rights to over 900 Marvel characters who are directly connected to Spider-Man. That number might seem outrageously high, but one has to remember exactly how many Spider-Man comics there have been since the early 1960s, especially since, for decades now, there have been multiple Spider-Man comics running concurrently. That being so, not all of the Spider-Man supporting characters and villains are necessarily well-known, even to most comic book fans. Case in point:&nbsp;Madame Web&nbsp;is one of those lesser-known characters, but that is indeed the latest title that Sony Pictures is now developing with the writers of next year’s Spider-Man spinoff vampire movie Morbius (7/31/2020). What remains unclear is which Madame Web this movie will actually be about, as that name has been used by two very different characters in the comics: the elderly blind psychic Cassandra Webb and the much younger superhero (formerly known as Spider-Woman II), Julia Carpenter.8. HOW TO TRAIN YOUR DRAGON DIRECTOR SAYS, “LET’S GET SMALL” WITH MICRONAUTS(Photo by Priscilla Grant/Everett Collection)The argument can be made that one of the casualties of the immense popularity of the Star Wars action figures in the late 1970s and early 1980s was the Micronauts toy line, which had just started to take off in 1977 and 1978. The Micronauts toys were relatively innovative in that they allowed for mix-and-match play (you could attach the wheels of one Micronaut to the body of another). However, what Micronauts is best known for today is for inspiring a long-running Marvel Comics series in which the tiny heroes from the “Microverse” ended up coming to our larger Earth. Paramount Pictures, the studio which has in the past given us movies based on other Hasbro toy lines like Transformers and G.I. Joe, has scheduled Micronauts for release on June 4, 2021, but until this week, we didn’t know who might direct&nbsp;it. That job is going to&nbsp;Dean DeBlois, who has spent much of the last decade writing and directing the various movies in the animated How to Train Your Dragon franchise. Micronauts remains scheduled for June 4, 2021, which is the same week as the Sesame Street musical film starring Anne Hathaway, and the week before Jurassic World 3.9. REMAKE FRENZY CONTINUES TO REVISIT THE 1990S WITH NEW JACK CITY(Photo by Warner Bros. courtesy Everett Collection)Hollywood has been hooked on revisiting its past for decades now, with&nbsp;most reboots and remakes usually centered about&nbsp;20 or 30 years in the past at any given point. We’re just now starting to see the focus move on from the 1980s&nbsp;to the 1990s, and the expectation is that the 1990s will continue to be revisited for most of the 2020s. The latest such remake to be announced will&nbsp;take audiences back to&nbsp;1991’s New Jack City (Fresh at 77%), which was part of a wave of early 1990s “urban crime dramas,” featuring such future stars as Wesley Snipes, Ice-T, and Chris Rock. Warner Bros. has started development of the New Jack City remake by hiring actor and filmmaker Malcolm M. Mays (Snowfall) to start work on the screenplay. New Jack City was very much about the then-topical crack cocaine epidemic, but it’s not yet known if the remake will remain&nbsp;in the early 1990s as a “period film,” or if the setting&nbsp;will be updated.Like this?

The year-in-review continues this week with the “Rotten Ideas” of the year (setting aside, of course, most of the COVID-19-related bad news, which is all bad).JANUARY: TRANSFORMERS TO BE REBOOTED (POSSIBLY AS BEAST WARS, RAWWWRRR)(Photo by ©Paramount Pictures)In 2018, Paramount released their Transformers prequel Bumblebee to a surprising critical reaction and a Certified Fresh rating of 91%. Part of the “Rotten Idea” here relates directly to that: rather than continuing from that point (after five Transformers movies that ranged from 15% to 58%, all Rotten), Paramount is opting for new reboot projects. The reason for dropping the “solo Transformers spin-off” concept of Bumblebee is probably related to the $468 million Bumblebee made versus the $1+ billion the two previous Transformers movies earned, but there’s also no guarantee that new reboots will do any better, either. Anyway, we learned in January that Paramount is indeed developing two separate Transformers reboots from separate screenwriters. The two screenwriters ostensibly still working on rebooting Transformers are James Vanderbilt (Indepdence Day: Resurgence, White House Down) and Joby Harold (King Arthur: Legend of the Sword, itself an attempt to start a new franchise that didn’t take off). Paramount didn’t give any premise details for either project, but around that time, there was a rumor that one of them might be Beast Wars, the Transformers line that transforms into animals instead of modes of transportation. Here are some other possible premises.FEBRUARY: UNIVERSAL TO MEET THE MISTER FROM FIFTY SHADES OF GREY AUTHOR(Photo by ©Universal Pictures)Wasting very little time, from 2015 to 2018, Universal-owned Focus Features released their three adaptations of the Fifty Shades trilogy (Fifty Shades of Grey, Rotten at 25%; Fifty Shades Darker, Rottten at 11%; and Fifty Shades Freed, Rotten at 12%). In February, just before the idea of people getting super intimate without masks seemed in possibly extremely bad taste, a “heated bidding war,” Universal Pictures also won the rights&nbsp;to author E.L. James’ 2019 novel called The Mister. The book tells the story of “a wealthy British aristocrat who falls in love with his Albanian housekeeper, unaware that she is on the run from human traffickers.” E.L. James’ next novel has not yet been announced, and there has been no news about The Mister since February.MARCH: VIN DIESEL CONFIRMS SEQUEL PLANS FOR THE LAST WITCH HUNTER(Photo by Scott Garfield/©Summit Entertainment)Vin Diesel has arguably become synonymous with his most successful franchise, the Fast &amp; Furious movies. Obviously,&nbsp;he stars in other movies (like this year’s comic book adaptation Bloodshot, Rotten at 35%, or as the voice of Groot in the Guardians of the Galaxy movies), but when most people think of Vin Diesel, they probably think Fast &amp; Furious first. Perhaps looking for another possible franchise (especially with Fast &amp; Furious 11 in 2023 or so expected to be the last in that run), Diesel is now talking about his plans for a sequel to the 2015 fantasy action adventure The Last Witch Hunter (Rotten at 17%). It’s understandable if you can’t remember that The Last Witch Hunter was even a movie (people will probably feel the same way in 2025 about Bloodshot), as it only earned $27 million domestically. Vin Diesel confirmed in March that Lionsgate has hired a writer for the sequel (though he doesn’t drop their name), and that he’s sometimes approached by fans who want to see him and Michael Caine return for a sequel. (Michael Caine, incidentally, turns 88 in March, so it might be overly “optimistic” to expect him to return for another medieval action adventure.)APRIL: NICOLE KIDMAN THRILLER&nbsp;THE OTHERS GETTING MODERN REMAKE(Photo by (c)Dimension Films courtesy Everett Collection)There is a strong argument to be made that 2001’s The Others (Certified Fresh at 83%) is a close-to-perfect claustrophobic ghost story that is only aging better (partly because its visual style has been adapted by other scary movies in the last 15 years). The Others worked despite its hinging upon a “twist” ending during a time (late 1990s, early 2000s) when many, many horror or suspense films had such “twists.” One would think, therefore, that a story like The Others would be impossible to “remake,” since the twist is already out there for anyone who saw the original. Regardless, that’s exactly what is happening, as a modern retelling of The Others has been reported to be in development&nbsp;at least twice this past year. The remake’s producer, Renee Tab, said of the project, “It is almost eerie and uncanny how timely the themes are today: self-isolation, paranoia and fear, and of course the intense desire to protect our children and ourselves from harm.” From a 2020 perspective, one has to wonder if the remake will involve a mother keeping her children in the house because of fears of them catching a deadly virus. Universal’s production partner on the remake will be Sentient Entertainment, which also gave us the TV miniseries Feud: Bette and Joan.MAY: YET TO BE RELEASED G.I. JOE SPINOFF SNAKE EYES ALREADY GETTING SEQUEL(Photo by Jaimie Trueblood/Paramount Pictures courtesy Everett Collection)Due to COVID-19 shutting down many movie theaters, many movies that had been scheduled for 2020 have instead been shuttled back roughly a full year to a similar date in 2021. The thing is, most moviegoers, even those who are specifically G.I. Joe fans, probably don’t even know right now that Henry Golding (Crazy Rich Asians, Last Christmas) filmed a G.I. Joe spin-off in 2019 about the mute ninja assassin Snake Eyes, which was one of those movies that got bumped back a full year from 10/23/2020 to 10/22/2021 (i.e. two years after it was filmed). Despite the “Rotten” RT scores for both G.I. Joe the Rise of Cobra (Rotten at 34%) and G.I. Joe: Retaliation (Rotten at 28%), and without knowing what the reaction to Snake Eyes might be, Paramount Pictures is still moving forward with development of a Snake Eyes sequel. The sequel was described in May as “a deeper expansion and exploration of the G.I. Joe mythology,” and screenwriter Joe Shrapnel and Anna Waterhouse, who previously delivered the historical biopics Race (Fresh at 62%) and Seberg (Rotten at 34%) are the co-writers now working on the sequel.JUNE: GERARD BUTLER TO KEEP ON BUTLERIN’: DEN OF THIEVES 2, NIGHT HAS FALLEN(Photo by Susie Allnutt/©Focus Features)In some ways, Gerard Butler is an “old school” action movie star, but the reasons he resembles 1980s and 1990s stars is that like, say, Steven Seagal or Jean-Claude Van Damme, his movies frequently have Rotten Tomatometer scores. Those green splotches include 2018’s Den of Thieves (Rotten at 42%) and all three Has Fallen franchise entries: Olympus Has Fallen (Rotten at 49%), London Has Fallen (Rotten at 28%), and last year’s Angel Has Fallen (Rotten at 39%). In June, Butler confirmed that that two of his upcoming projects will be sequels. One of them will be Den of Thieves 2: Pantera, which Butler described as a “fun ride, spreading across North America into Europe and the diamond district of Marseilles.” Then, more news about the fourth Has Fallen movie came out last month, including confirmation that the title will be Night Has Fallen.JULY: JENNIFER GREY RETURNING FOR DIRTY DANCING SEQUEL SET IN THE 1990S(Photo by Vestron Pictures courtesy Everett Collection)The nostalgic 1987 musical Dirty Dancing left such an indelible stamp on pop culture that it might be easy to forget that its success was not at all expected, especially not to the degree that it was, since its worldwide box office of $213 million was more than 35 times larger than its $6 million production budget. That’s probably why Dirty Dancing has continued to resurface every few years as something to be sequelized or remade, as producers might see the film&nbsp;as something that can be made relatively cheaply for a potential cash windfall. Of course, that’s not what happened at all in 2004 when the prequel Dirty Dancing: Havana Nights (Rotten at 23%) was released and only earned $14 million in the USA. Regardless, in July, rumors started to surface that&nbsp;Jennifer “Baby” Grey was executive producing and would star in a Dirty Dancing sequel set in the 1990s. In August, we heard more about the project, this time in a more official announcement, which confirmed pretty much everything we heard the first time around in July, except we also found out that it will be directed by Jonathan Levine, whose Tomatometer ranges from films like Snatched (Rotten at 36%) and All the Boys Love Mandy Lane (Rotten at 45%) all the way up to Certified Fresh films like 50/50 (93%), Warm Bodies (81%), and Long Shot (81%).AUGUST: ARE YOU READY TO GET KLUMPED AGAIN? HERE COMES ANOTHER NUTTY PROFESSOR REBOOT&nbsp;&nbsp;(Photo by Universal courtesy Everett Collection)This column frequently opines about the seemingly unceasing announcements of remakes of films from the 1980s and 1990s, but the biggest comedy hit of 1996 was itself a remake. The Eddie Murphy version might be more famous now, but Murphy actually took over the role as The Nutty Professor (Fresh at 64%) from Jerry Lewis, who starred in the 1963 original (Fresh at 85%). Both movies were about an awkward scientist who transforms himself into an alter ego called “Buddy Love,” but Eddie Murphy’s version also made the scientist morbidly obese (Jerry Lewis’ version was just goofy). We learned in August that The Nutty Professor is now getting a new reboot,&nbsp;and it’s coming from the same production company behind the upcoming Scream (1/14/2022) (which is movie #5, despite the title). It’s not yet known if this third iteration of The Nutty Professor will have any “horror” elements (one could see how it could easily drift into “body horror“), or if it will just be a straight up comedy romp.SEPTEMBER: THE WORLD TO GET THE TROOP BEVERLY HILLS SEQUEL IT DESERVES(Photo by Columbia Pictures/courtesy Everett Collection)Hollywood loves making sequels to 1980s movies almost as it loves remaking 1980s movies. They do, however, have an inherent problem, as there were only so many movies actually made in the 1980s that are available for sequels or remakes. One has to guess that’s the best possible explanation for the news in September that someone is now actively developing a sequel to the 1989 Shelley Long kids comedy Troop Beverly Hills (Rotten at 25%). Basically, Shelley Long played a rich lady who decides to become the troop leader of a fictionalized Girl-Scouts-But-We-Can’t-Call-Them-Girl-Scouts to show that she is a capable adult. Israeli director Oran Zegman will direct the Troop Beverly Hills sequel from a screenplay by television writer Aeysha Carr (Born Again Virgin, Everybody Hates Chris) and Tamara Chestna, who adapted last year’s After (Rotten at 19%) (which was also part of a “Rotten Idea” in the same week as Troop Beverly Hills 2).OCTOBER: POWER RANGERS TO BE REBOOTED (AGAIN) AS PART OF A CINEMATIC UNIVERSE(Photo by ©Lionsgate)It was about three and a half years ago that Lionsgate released their ambitious Power Rangers reboot (Rotten at 49%), which earned just $142 million worldwide from a budget of over $105 million. One might argue that the low box office was a sign that the moviegoing audience isn’t interested in a new Power Rangers theatrical film franchise, but Paramount Pictures (taking over from Lionsgate) is moving forward with plans for a new Power Rangers cinematic universe with stories set both in feature films and new TV shows. Paramount, eOne, and Hasbro have enlisted Jonathan Entwistle (The End of the F***ing World, I Am Not Okay With This) to shepherd all of the potential Power Rangers projects in both film and TV. None of the actors and actresses in the 2017 reboot (including Elizabeth Banks) are expected to be involved with Paramount’s projects.NOVEMBER: CLIFFORD THE BIG RED DOG TEASER REVEALS TERRIFYING VISION OF THE FUTURE(Photo by Paramount Pictures)Some movies, especially if they’re based on popular franchises or properties, take a very long time to actually get developed, produced, and released in theaters. Consider, for example, the popular children’s book series (and animated TV series)&nbsp;Clifford the Big Red Dog. It was eight years ago in 2012 that we first heard about a Clifford the Big Red Dog movie, which at one point was scheduled for release on April 8, 2016 (yes, over four years ago). More recently, Clifford the Big Red Dog was supposed to have come out earlier this year on November 13th (until the deadly virus delayed it all the way back to November 5, 2021). Clifford the Big Red Dog may now still be ten months away, but Paramount Pictures decided last month to whet people’s appetites regardless, but what we actually got might have caught some people by surprise. Although Clifford the Big Red Dog in book and animated TV form has a very “cartoony” look, the movie appears to be applying a more “life like CGI” approach, which when you also factor in his size and (unnatural) coloring makes actually seeing Clifford the Big Red Dog something you have to experience for yourself.DECEMBER: KINGSMAN PRODUCER REVEALS PLANS FOR SEVEN MORE SUPER SPY MOVIES(Photo by Giles Keyte/©20th Century Fox Film Corp.)The X-Men are one of Marvel Comics’ most popular comic book franchises, but even so, by the time the tenth movie in the Fox franchise (or 12th if you count the&nbsp;Deadpool&nbsp;movies), Dark Phoenix, came out, some people thought there had been too many. Now, compare the massive popularity of the X-Men comics to the relatively obscure comic book title Kingsman: The Secret Service, and consider this question. If people got tired of X-Men by the tenth movie, what are people going to think of the King’s Man movies by the time it gets to movie #10? That might seem like a far off question with just two movies released to date, and the third, a prequel called&nbsp;The King’s Man, still a few months off, but that’s until you hear the news that broke earlier in December. Talking about his company’s ambitious expansion plans, Marv Group CEO Zygi Kamasa revealed that producer and director Matthew Vaughn&nbsp;has plans for “something like seven more Kingsman films,” as well as a Kingsman TV series, and two or three other franchises. It’s unclear what those seven additional Kingsman movies might be, but it could be that the prequel The King’s Man, starring Gemma Arterton and Ralph Fiennes, could serve as a launching point for additional prequels, in addition to further Kingsman movies starring Taron Egerton. Kingsman could also inspire spin-off movies, and Mark Millar’s comics are part of a “Millarworld” shared universe which also includes Kick-Ass (Certified Fresh at 76%),which Vaughn also directed. Of course, there’s still the possibility that The King’s Man may be more popular with critics than Kingsman: The Golden Circle (Rotten at 51%), but we’re still left wondering how many franchises we’d actually be okay with seeing expanded to over 10 movies. Even Star Wars gets accused of having too many movies (11), and that’s S-T-A-R-W-A-R-S.On an Apple device?

On the other hand, there have been some small hints, including the re-introduction of J.K. Simmons as J. Jonah Jameson in Spider-Man: Far from Home (Certified Fresh at 90%)&nbsp;and, of course, the whole notion that&nbsp;Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse is about alternate reality Spider-heroes, that might have indicated otherwise. The latter movie might indeed be the best way to explain yesterday’s news that Jamie Foxx is set to return as Electro in the next solo Spider-Man movie starring Tom Holland. Foxx previously played Electro in The Amazing Spider-Man 2 (Rotten at 51%), which was the last film to feature the Andrew Garfield version of Peter Parker. For now, we’re left to wonder exactly how Foxx’s Electro fits into the new film, but the two most obvious explanations are either that his Electro will be introduced as a new character (as if The Amazing Spider-Man 2 never happened), or Electro will come from another alternate reality (such as the Andrew Garfield movies). Of course, the second option would be something of a fake-out, since much of the marketing of Spider-Man: Far from Home&nbsp;hinged upon the idea that the evil villain Mysterio (Jake Gyllenhaal) was actually a superhero from another dimension. The third Spider-Man movie starring Tom Holland doesn’t have a title yet, but it does have a release date of November 5, 2021 (COVID-19 delays notwithstanding).Other Top Headlines1.&nbsp;DISNEY RECRUITS BARRY JENKINS TO DIRECT A&nbsp;LION KING SEQUEL(Photo by Steven Ferdman/Everett Collection)Let’s start this story by specifically addressing some language, because you will see all sorts of answers online. The version of The Lion King (Rotten at 52%) that Walt Disney Pictures released last year is probably best described as being “photorealistic CGI,” and not “live action,” since all but a few seconds of the movie was computer animated. Although that Rotten score may have stung a little, the film was absolutely an astounding success for Walt Disney Pictures, ending 2019 as the year’s second-highest-grossing box office hit, behind only&nbsp;Avengers: Endgame (the highest-grossing movie ever). So it’s perhaps not at all surprising that Disney is moving forward with plans for a sequel. The studio, possibly hoping to earn a stronger critical reception this time around, is upping its game by hiring director Barry Jenkins, who is probably still best known for his 2016 film Moonlight (Certified Fresh at 98%), which won three Academy Awards, including Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Supporting Actor, and in a historic reveal, Best Picture. It’s not yet known if the Lion King sequel will serve as a remake in any way of the sequels that the original animated movie received, which included The Lion King II: Simba’s Pride (Fresh at 62%) and The Lion King 1 1/2 (Fresh at 78%). Early word seems to suggest that instead of adapting either of those sequels directly, at least some of the film will serve as a prequel depicting the early years of Mufasa, Simba’s father. The Lion King sequel is being&nbsp;written by screenwriter Jeff Nathanson, who also wrote last year’s film.2. RECENT EMMY WINNER ZENDAYA NABS LEAD IN RONETTES BIOPIC(Photo by Lev Radin/Everett Collection)Zendaya became the youngest person ever to win an Emmy for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series for HBO’s Euphoria on September 20th, and within nine days,&nbsp;she has already scored her next major lead role. Recent awards-friendly distributor A24 (Moonlight, Room, The Florida Project) is preparing an adaptation of the memoir Be My Baby by 1960s pop music icon Ronnie Spector of the singing group The Ronettes. As part of the deal, A24 has attached Zendaya to star as Spector, and for Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright Jackie Sibblies Drury (Fairview) to adapt the screenplay. Similarly to the way in which Aretha Franklin endorsed Jennifer Hudson to portray her in the upcoming biopic Respect, Ronnie Spector reportedly personally chose Zendaya to depict her in the film. The role of music producer Phil Spector will also be a major one in the film (possibily like that of Ike Turner in What’s Love Got to Do with It?), but&nbsp;it has not been cast yet. Zendaya will next be seen in Dune (12/18/2020), the drama Malcolm &amp; Marie (with Tenet star John David Washington), and as M.J. in the next Spider-Man movie (12/17/2021).3.&nbsp;IDRIS ELBA WILL TAKE ON A KILLER LION IN&nbsp;BEAST(Photo by Michael Gibson/STX Entertainment)It’s probably a coincidence, but the new Idris Elba movie announced this week bears some surface similarities to not just one, but two of Elba’s most famous films. Beast (not to be confused with Beasts of No Nation, Certified Fresh at 91%) will be a “survival thriller” about a killer lion (not to be confused with last year’s Cats). Although more specific details of the premise are being kept secret for now, Universal Pictures is comparing Beast to the shark thriller The Shallows, except that it’s set in the African savannah, and the threat is a killer lion instead of a killer shark. Beast will be directed by Baltasar Kormákur, who has plenty of prior experience with survival stories like&nbsp;Everest (Fresh at 73%) and Adrift (Fresh at 69%) — both true stories, by the way, presumably unlike&nbsp;Beast —&nbsp;and the screenplay was adapted by Ryan Engle (co-writer of the video game adaptation Rampage, Rotten at 51%). In related news, Idris Elba will also reunite with John Cena (one of his co-stars from next year’s The Suicide Squad) in an Amazon Studios action movie Heads of State.4.&nbsp;IT LOOKS LIKE WE’RE GETTING AN ANIMATED DR. SEUSS&nbsp;CINEMATIC UNIVERSE(Photo by ©Universal Pictures)During his career as a children’s author, Dr. Seuss (A.K.A. Theodor Geisel) wrote and illustrated dozens of books that might seem perfect for adaptation as feature films, but there have actually been only a handful of&nbsp;them: How the Grinch Stole Christmas, The Cat in the Hat, Horton Hears a Who!, The Lorax, and The Grinch. J.J. Abrams’ Bad Robot production company is teaming up with Warner Bros. to correct those omissions, starting with two animated features to be released in 2026 and 2027. The goal appears to be something like a “Dr. Seuss Cinematic Universe,” (also possibly to be called the “Seussiverse”) which will start with an animated adaptation of The Cat in the Hat in 2024 (separate from the Bad Robot productions), and then be followed by a spin-off of that book called Thing One and Thing Two in 2026. The third animated movie will be an adaptation of Oh, The Places You’ll Go!&nbsp;(also the last Dr. Seuss book to be published during his lifetime), which Warner Bros is targeting for release in 2027.5. OSCAR ISAAC AND JAKE GYLLENHAAL TO CO-STAR IN FRANCIS AND THE GODFATHER(Photo by Eli Winston, Jason Smith/Everett Collection)Although this year’s awards season has been shaken up COVID-19, some Oscar-friendly movies will still see release, and one of them that appears more pandemic-proof is David Fincher’s&nbsp;Mank, about the making of Citizen Kane, because it’s a Netflix film,&nbsp;so streaming is built into its model, pandemic or not. Time will tell if Mank will indeed be one of the year’s major awards contenders, or whether it will find its audience (which was always part of the problem with Citizen Kane, too), but Hollywood is already preparing for another movie about the making of one of&nbsp;its&nbsp;greatest epic dramas. Oscar Isaac and Jake Gyllenhaal are both attached to star in the drama Francis and the Godfather, which will tell the story of how young film director Francis Ford Coppola (Isaac) struggled with Paramount chief Robert Evans (Gyllenhaal) to get his vision of The Godfather (Certified Fresh at 98%)&nbsp;produced, including his fight to get the studio to back his casting of Marlon Brando in the title role. Francis and the Godfather will be directed by Barry Levinson, whose own classic films include Rain Man, Good Morning Vietnam, and Wag the Dog.6. BLACK ADAM&nbsp;FINDS ITS HAWKMAN IN ALDIS HODGE(Photo by Jess Miglio/©Paramount)One of the most enticing revelations about the upcoming Shazam! spinoff Black Adam (starring Dwayne Johnson) is that it will also serve as an introduction to the first live-action big-screen&nbsp;appearance&nbsp;of DC Comics’ original superhero team, the Justice Society of America. The first of the JSA members to be cast was Atom-Smasher, who will be played by Noah Centineo. That was a few months ago, but we now know that Centineo will also be joined by Aldis Hodge (The Invisible Man, Hidden Figures) as Hawkman, who, unlike Atom-Smasher, was one of the original JSA members back in the 1940s (Atom Smasher’s JSA membership is much more recent in the comics). Hawkman is one of DC Comics’ heroes with the longest and arguably most convoluted backstories, and because he has been depicted a number of ways&nbsp;over the last 80 years, and it’s unclear which version will appear in&nbsp;Black Adam. Black Adam is expected to start filming in either late 2020 or early 2021 for a release date of December 21, 2021. As this piece points out, the introduction of Hawkman and the Justice Society of America in Black Adam may eventually lead to the team (or some of its members) getting their own spin-off movies as well.7. BLACK-ISH STAR YARA SHAHIDI TO PLAY DISNEY’S LIVE-ACTION TINKER BELL(Photo by Priscilla Grant/Everett Collection)The two young actors who play Anthony Anderson’s sons on Black-ish (Marcus Scribner and Miles Brown) have mostly stuck with just doing the show, but the actresses who play their sisters have been much more active, as Marsai Martin starred in last year’s Little (Rotten at 46%), and Yara Shahidi starred in The Sun is Also a Star (Rotten at 51%), as well as getting her own spin-off series, Grown-ish. It’s also relevant to point out that ABC (the network behind Black-ish and Grown-ish) is owned by Disney, which may be relevant to the news that Walt Disney Pictures has cast Yara Shahidi to be the new Tinker Bell in their live-action remake Peter Pan &amp; Wendy. As suggested by the title, this new take on the classic Disney animated feature Peter Pan (Fresh at 81%)&nbsp;appears to place an extra emphasis on the friendship between Peter (Alexander Molony) and his friend Wendy Darling (Ever Anderson), in addition to the regular bits about the villainous Captain Hook (Jude Law). Peter Pan &amp; Wendy will be directed by David Lowery, who also previously worked with Disney on their 2016 remake of Pete’s Dragon (Certified Fresh at 88%).8. ZAC EFRON TO STAR IN REMAKE OF STEPHEN KING’S FIRESTARTER(Photo by Priscilla Grant/Everett Collection)Author Stephen King had such a flurry of successful novels in the 1970s and 1980s (and so many of them were adapted as films) that it’s easy for some of them to be forgotten over time, as more attention goes to titles like The Shining, Carrie, Pet Sematary, Creepshow, and The Dead Zone, and not so much to movies like Cujo, Silver Bullet, and Firestarter. Released in 1984, Firestarter (Rotten at 34%) was far from a critical darling, but its cast was relatively impressive, as the title character was played by a young, post-E.T. Drew Barrymore, her caretaker was played by George C. Scott, and in a smaller role, her father was played by David Keith (An Officer and a Gentleman). The first casting news for Blumhouse’s Firestarter remake seems to suggest that the father character may have more screen time, as Zac Efron has signed on to play that role. That character was also more central in Stephen King’s novel, but the 1984 movie relegated most of his story to flashbacks; the choice of Efron suggests that the remake may stick closer to Stephen King’s original narrative. Firestarter&nbsp;will be directed by Keith Thomas (The Vigil, Fresh at 91%)&nbsp;from a screenplay adaptation by Scott Teems, co-writer of the upcoming sequel Halloween Kills.9. 2020 IS NO TIME TO DIE FOR JAMES BOND AS HIS&nbsp;LATEST OUTING MOVES TO 2021(Photo by MGM)It might feel like a lifetime ago, but it was less than seven months ago that the James Bond movie No Time to Die was one of the first major films to delay its release several months because of the COVID-19 pandemic, as it was moved by MGM from April 10th to November 25, 2020. Following the disappointing box office of recent films like Tenet, MGM announced today&nbsp;that they will be delaying the release of No Time to Die until Easter weekend next year, April 2, 2021. That was the same weekend that the next Fast and Furious movie,&nbsp;F9, was set to release, before Universal quickly responded by also pushing back that film more than a month to May 28, which is about a year after the film’s original release date back on May 22, 2020.&nbsp;The delaying of No Time to Die also means that there will be no major Hollywood films between now and Pixar’s Soul&nbsp;on November 20, and then after Soul, there are only two major blockbuster-level films still scheduled for 2020: Dune (12/18/2020) and Wonder Woman 1984 (12/25/2020). Will those three films hold on to their release dates, or will they also be delayed? And if they are delayed, what impact will the loss of most of 2020 have on the theatrical exhibition industry? We’ll have to wait and see.On an Apple device?

Since then, it’s been confirmed that The Eternals will be the next film to start production after Black Widow, likely for a late 2020 release (November 6, 2020, specifically). Despite that, one could argue that&nbsp;the project&nbsp;hadn’t really been receiving much press or buzz, and the reason for that is sort of obvious: most non-comics fans don’t know what The Eternals is (Thanos is an Eternal from Titan, but there are different groups of Eternals). What The Eternals needed and was lacking until this week, then, was some genuine star power to raise the film’s profile. Marvel is getting it in the form of Angelina Jolie, who’s now in talks to star in The Eternals. Technically, Jolie’s role was not confirmed this week, but the leads are reportedly Ikaris (who’s male) and Sersi, so she’s probably Sersi. This might also mean Jolie could join a future version of The Avengers, as Sersi was a member of the team for over 60 issues from 1989 to 1994. The Eternals will be directed by Chloé Zhao (The Rider, Songs My Brothers Taught Me) when it starts filming this summer. In the meantime, you can check out this fan art that speculates what Angelina Jolie could look like as Sersi.Fresh Developments1. JOEL COEN GOING SOLO FOR SHAKESPEARE’S MACBETH STARRING DENZEL WASHINGTON(Photo by Wilson Webb/Focus Features)Director Joel Coen and his brother Ethan have collaborated on so many movies (dozens) that it’s become shorthand to just refer to them as the “Coen Brothers,” even if their precise duties on each film vary. This week, we learned of the first film that Joel Coen will be directing from his own screenplay, without Ethan writing or producing, and it&nbsp;will be an adaptation of William Shakespeare’s MacBeth (A.K.A. “The Scottish Play” for the superstitious). Denzel Washington will play the title character, and two-time Academy Award winner Frances McDormand (A.K.A. Mrs. Joel Coen) will co-star as Lady MacBeth. It is not yet known if the film&nbsp;will retain the play’s medieval Scotland setting or perhaps shift to a more contemporary setting. This MacBeth also comes just a few years after the 2015 adaptation (Certified Fresh at 79%) that starred&nbsp;Michael Fassbender and Marion Cotillard.2. NEW AVENGERS: ENDGAME POSTERS CONFIRM FATES OF SHURI, VALKYRIE, AND OTHERS(Photo by Marvel Studios)There was a lot going on in those final moments of Avengers: Infinity War, but Marvel wasn’t able to fit in every character. It’s also telling of the scope of these movies now that Marvel Studios was able to release 32 character posters for Avengers: Endgame, and still leave out several fan favorites. The posters were divided into two groups (16 of each): black-and-white posters for (some of) the characters who were “dusted” (or “ashed”) in Avengers: Infinity War, and color posters for characters who survived Thanos’ “snap.” The inclusion of a poster for Tessa Thompson’s Valkyrie character from Thor: Ragnarok confirms one of the lingering questions some had,&nbsp;since she wasn’t seen on the Asgardian spaceship in Avengers: Infinity War (or at all). Likewise, there’s also a black-and-white poster for Letitia Wright’s Shuri character from Black Panther, confirming that she shared the fate of her brother T’Challa&nbsp;(not that he’s likely to be gone permanently). Marvel Studios also confirmed this week that Avengers: Endgame will be “around” three hours long when it’s released on April 26.3.&nbsp;CUMBERBATCH, FIRTH, AND STRONG&nbsp;JOIN&nbsp;SAM MENDES’&nbsp;WORLD WAR I DRAMA(Photo by JA, Priscilla Grant, Elizabeth Goodenough/Everett Collection)We’ve known for a while that Sam Mendes (American Beauty, Skyfall) was planning on directing a drama called 1917 following his decision not to direct another James Bond film after 2015’s Spectre. Details about 1917 have remained sparse, but the title itself makes it pretty clear that it’s set during World War I (1917 was the year the United States joined the war, but the focus will be on the British). We now know that the story will&nbsp;center on a single day in the war for two young British soldiers played by George MacKay (Captain Fantastic) and Dean-Charles Chapman (Tommen from Game of Thrones). With filming of 1917 starting on location in England and Scotland on Monday, several more actors were confirmed this week. The cast will include&nbsp;Benedict Cumberbatch (Doctor Strange, TV’s Sherlock), Colin Firth (The King’s Speech), Richard Madden (Robb Stark from Game of Thrones), and Mark Strong (Shazam!). There are a few reunions going on here, including for Kingsman: The Secret Service (Colin Firth and Mark Strong), and The Imitation Game (Benedict Cumberbatch and Mark Strong), and&nbsp;Game of Thrones.4. MICHAEL B. JORDAN WON’T LOOK A DAY OVER 400 AS METHUSELAH(Photo by Marvel Studios)It was less than three years ago that we first heard about a biblical epic called Methuselah, in which Tom Cruise would play the long-lived figure from the Book of Genesis. The film is still in development at Warner Bros, but it’s now set up as a starring&nbsp;vehicle for Michael B. Jordan (Creed, Black Panther), who will also produce. One significant change to Methuselah is that it’s no longer described as a “biblical epic,” but is instead about a 400-year-old man who, over hundreds of years, “has accumulated vast intellectual knowledge, from multiple languages to the sciences, as well as survival skills.” Methuselah joins Jordan and his production company’s sizable slate of film projects along with Just Mercy (1/17/2020), Tom Clancy’s Without Remorse (9/18/2020), Journal for Jordan, The Liberators, Red Wolf, Silver Bear, and Wrong Answer.5. TOM HANKS JOINS ELVIS PRESLEY BIOPIC AS COLONEL TOM PARKER(Photo by Sony Pictures)Tom Hanks is on some sort of crazy streak of late playing iconic real-life figures of both the 20th and 21st centuries. In the last six years alone, he’s starred in Captain Phillips, Saving Mr. Banks (as Walt Disney), Bridge of Spies, Sully (as pilot “Sully” Sullenberger), The Post (as Ben Bradlee), and his Mister Rogers movie, A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood is due out later this year (11/22/2019). Hanks is now in talks for another film in which he will play a 20th century pop culture personality;&nbsp;if the deal goes through, he’ll take on a Southern accent again as “Colonel” Tom Parker, co-starring in the untitled Elvis Presley biopic that director Baz Luhrmann (Moulin Rouge!, Australia) has been developing for several years. Luhrmann reportedly moved on to Tom Hanks after previous talks with Leonardo DiCaprio (his Romeo + Juliet star) didn’t work out. Baz Luhrmann has not yet cast his actor to star as Elvis Presley.6. SEX PISTOLS BIOPIC TO PROCLAIM ONLY ANARCHISTS ARE PRETTYWith the Queen biopic Bohemian Rhapsody coming just shy of $900 million worldwide, we’re unsurprisingly going to continue to see classic rock bands getting their own movies. The 1970s punk band Sex Pistols have received movies before (both dramatically in Sid and Nancy and in documentaries like The Filth and the Fury), and now they’re getting another. Called Only Anarchists Are Pretty, the film will be an adaptation of a 2004 book&nbsp;about the band’s early days under the aegis of manager Malcolm McLaren. SEX was the name of the Chelsea, London boutique run by McLaren and his girlfriend Vivienne Westwood, and both will be the film’s focal characters. As the offiical Twitter account of John Lydon (AKA Johnny Rotten) clarified this week, “For the avoidance of doubt this film would be unauthorised, unofficial, and not endorsed by Sex Pistols.”7.&nbsp;WILLIAM SADLER TO&nbsp;PLAY DEATH AGAIN IN&nbsp;BILL &amp; TED FACE THE MUSIC(Photo by Orion courtesy Everett Collection)Just last week, Keanu Reeves and Alex Winter took to the Hollywood Bowl to officially announce that their long-planned sequel Bill &amp; Ted Face the Music is scheduled for next summer, August 21, 2020. The sequel made the news again this week, as if to confirm that this thing is definitely happening soon, and isn’t something we won’t hear about again for months (or years). William Sadler, who played Death (AKA the Grim Reaper) in Bill &amp; Ted’s Bogus Journey (Rotten at 54%), will reprise his role in the third film as well. It’s not yet clear how Death will fit into this movie, such as whether perhaps Bill &amp; Ted will challenge Death in any of the various games that have emerged since 1991. Think Death is any good at Guitar Hero or Settlers of Catan?Rotten Ideas2. ZAC EFRON AND AMANDA SEYFRIED ARE THE NEW FRED AND DAPHNE IN NEXT YEAR’S SCOOB(Photo by Dee Cercone/Everett Collection)There is an argument to be made that Scooby-Doo was just never a good fit for live-action movies, and that’s why the 2002 and 2004 adaptations received Rotten scores (30% and 22%, respectively). On the other hand, maybe those movies were just ahead of their time (superhero movies didn’t used to earn Fresh scores back then, either). Warner Bros. will find out summer when they release their animated feature film Scoob on May 15, 2020. Three weeks ago, we heard about the first batch of voice cast roles, including Gina Rodriguez (Velma), Will Forte (Shaggy), Frank Welker (Scooby), and Tracy Morgan (Captain Caveman, in his big screen debut). That left Fred and Daphne yet to be announced, and that news came this week, with Zac Efron and Amanda Seyfried both now signed on. Efron (High School Musical, The Greatest Showman) and Seyfried (Mamma Mia!, Les Miserables) both have musical backgrounds, but it’s not yet known if their Scoob characters will sing. The villain in Scoob will reportedly be Dick Dastardly (from Wacky Races), who has yet to be cast.1. IDRIS ELBA JOINS ANIMAL FANTASY MOUSE GUARD FOR MAZE RUNNER FRANCHISE DIRECTOR(Photo by Michael Gibson/STX Entertainment)Disney may have completed their purchase of Fox’s film and TV properties last week, but you’d be forgiven if the press coverage led you to think that Fox had actually shut down entirely. The merger will obviously have a huge impact, but many of their projects are moving ahead as planned, including the comic book adaptation Mouse Guard. Compared to Game of Thrones (but with animals like foxes, weasels, eagles, and the titular mice), Mouse Guard will be a CGI animated film using motion capture actors (including Andy Serkis). The latest star to join Mouse Guard this week was Idris Elba, who will play “Celanawe,” a legendary champion that’s compared to Obi-Wan Kenobi from Star Wars. Sonoya Mizuno, who played the bride in last year’s Crazy Rich Asians&nbsp;also joined the project this week. Mouse Guard will be directed by Wes Ball, whose filmography as director&nbsp;consists solely of the Maze Runner films, the last two of which&nbsp;were Rotten&nbsp;at 47% and 43%, respectively.Like this?

Most of this has revolved around the character of Redd, a female pirate who became a featured greeter at the Disney parks in 2018. In late breaking news this Friday, we now know that Margot Robbie is attached to star in a new Pirates of the Caribbean spinoff that will be written by Christina Hodson, who worked with Robbie on this year’s Birds of Prey. The new film&nbsp;hasn’t actually been&nbsp;confirmed to be a “Redd” movie quite yet, but that’s where the speculation is quickly turning. In a somewhat surprising twist, this new Margot Robbie Pirates of the Caribbean movie will also reportedly be separate from the&nbsp;Pirates of the Caribbean reboot by original Pirates of the Caribbean co-writer Ted Elliot and Chernobyl creator Craig Mazin — previously, many thought their movie would be the one to introduce Redd. It’s possible that Walt Disney Pictures is developing both of these projects to improve their chances that one of them will reach the greenlight stage (Paramount has been doing this for a while with their Transformers projects, including Bumblebee, also written by Hodson). There is no current release date for any new Pirates of the Caribbean project, but with everything going on in the world, it’s unlikely it could be before the summer of 2022.Other Top Headlines1. WANNA GET NUTS? MICHAEL KEATON WILL RETURN AS BATMAN IN THE FLASH(Photo by ©Warner Bros. courtesy Everett Collection)The longer big-budget movies take to get produced,&nbsp;the more likely it is that their storylines will twist and change, but at least at one point, the upcoming solo movie for The Flash was going to adapt the Flashpoint premise, which includes both time travel and “parallel world”-type adventures. Flashpoint eventually became a big part of the TV show The Flash as well, leading to a recent scene during the Crisis on Infinite Earths events when the Ezra Miller’s and Grant Gustin’s separate versions of the Flash actually met. Possibly confirming a similar story for The Flash (6/2/2022), Michael Keaton is now signed to reprise his role as Bruce Wayne A.K.A.&nbsp;Batman from his two movies with director Tim Burton (1989’s Batman, Fresh at 71%; and 1992’s Batman Returns, Certified Fresh at 79%). The inclusion of Keaton’s Batman in The Flash is reportedly meant to establish that there is not just “one” DC Universe, so that the characters like those in the Arrowverse, Stargirl, Joaquin Phoenix’s Joker, Robert Pattinson’s The Batman, and the DCEU occupied by Aquaman, The Flash, and Wonder Woman, all exist in separate realities. It’s a stark departure from the way Marvel Studios has kept the Marvel Cinematic Universe&nbsp;going in one consistent setting since the first Iron Man in 2008 (the Fox/Marvel movies like X-Men and Deadpool don’t count). Warner Bros. is also keeping the door open for other future appearances by Michael Keaton as the older Batman, which might include the long-in-development Batgirl solo movie.2. DISNEY AND LIN-MANUEL MIRANDA GOING TO COLOMBIA FOR ENCANTO(Photo by Lev Radin/Everett Collection)After attaining fame with the hit Broadway musical&nbsp;Hamilton (a filmed version of which is coming to Disney+ on July 3, 2020), Lin-Manuel Miranda expanded into film and animation, including work with Disney on Mary Poppins Returns (in which he co-starred) and Moana (for which he co-wrote the songs). We’ve also known for a while that Miranda has a project with Sony Animation called Vivo (6/4/2021), and this week, another new project with Disney Animation was revealed. Talking to Good Morning America on Monday, Lin-Manuel Miranda mentioned that he is spending his quarantine-at-home time working on an untitled Disney animation project set in Colombia. Reportedly, the project will be directed by Byron Howard and Jared Bush, who worked with Miranda as the directors of Moana (Certified Fresh at 95%). This news came just a few days after this Disney blog reported that Miranda, Howard, and Bush were working on a Disney musical called Encanto (Spanish for “charm”), about a young girl from a magical family who herself does not have any magical powers. Some sites are already listing Encanto with a possible release date of November 24, 2021, but release dates are obviously very fluid right now.3.&nbsp;HUGH JACKMAN TO REV HIS ENGINE IN MICHAEL MANN’S&nbsp;FERRARI BIOPIC(Photo by Wilson Webb/©Warner Bros.)One of the biggest box office surprises of late 2019 may have been the car race period piece Ford v Ferrari (Certified Fresh at 92%), which was able to earn over $117 million in the USA and over $225 million globally. It was not the only “Ferrari” project being developed at the time, though, as director Michael Mann (Heat, Collateral, Public Enemies) had also been trying to get his own biopic project going about the life of Italian automobile tycoon Enzo Ferrari, who also played a pivotal role in Ford v Ferrari. Michael Mann’s Ferrari project is now being sold at the Cannes Virtual Market with Hugh Jackman attached to star as Enzo Ferrari. The focus of Ferrari will be the summer of 1957 (nine years before the events of Ford v Ferrari) when both Ferrari’s personal and professional lives were in turmoil. Mann reportedly completed a new rewrite of the Ferrari screenplay, which is based on the Brock Yates book&nbsp;Enzo Ferrari – The Man and the Machine. Of course, it’s worth noting that Hugh Jackman is very specifically Australian, so it will be interesting to see if he attempts to appropriate any sort of Italian accent in the new film.4. CHRISTOPHER NOLAN’S TENET&nbsp;DELAYED AGAIN, SIGNALING BAD NEWS FOR THE SUMMER OF 2020(Photo by Warner Bros. Pictures)Not that long ago, many in Hollywood were hopeful that movie theaters could be “back in business” by July, but that was&nbsp;before recent reports of the COVID-19 pandemic numbers going up in many states and Governor Cuomo of New York postponing&nbsp;movie theater reopenings. Even as dozens of projects were delayed from this summer (or went Video-on-Demand), Warner Bros. and director Christopher Nolan have been adamant about Nolan’s action film Tenet remaining a summer 2020 movie (though they did delay Tenet earlier this month from July 17 to July 31). Well, Warner Bros. has moved Tenet again, this time back another two weeks to August 12, 2020 (two days before Bill &amp; Ted Face the Music and Greenland on 8/14/2020). With this move, the most anticipated movie still scheduled for July (for now) is Disney’s Mulan (7/24/2020), but speculation is high&nbsp;that Mulan will also be delayed. Other movies still scheduled for July include Unhinged (7/10/2020), The Broken Hearts Gallery, and Cut Throat City (both 7/17/2020). In related news, The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge on the Run, previously scheduled for a theatrical release on May 22, 2020, will now debut as a streaming title sometime in early 2021.5. TWISTER GETTING A REMAKE FROM TOP GUN: MAVERICK DIRECTOR(Photo by ©Warner Bros. courtesy Everett Collection)Although the genre is seemingly being kept alive singlehandedly by Gerard Butler (Geostorm, next month’s Greenland), the disaster movie is not as common in recent years as it was in the 1990s and 2000s, when titles like Independence Day, 2012, The Day After Tomorrow, Deep Impact, and Armageddon were major box office hits. 1996 in particular was a big year for the genre with the #1 film being Independence Day&nbsp;and #2 being Twister (Rotten at 57%). Perhaps seeing Twister as even more relevant now (thanks to climate change), Universal Pictures is actively developing a remake. Director Joseph Kosinski, who has worked with Tom Cruise twice (Oblivion and the upcoming Top Gun: Maverick) is now in talks for the Twister remake with screenwriters currently being sought. It’s currently unclear how closely the&nbsp;new film&nbsp;will stick to the storyline of the original, which focused on a team of storm chasers played by Helen Hunt, the late Bill Paxton, and the late Phillip Seymour Hoffman. Kosinski was also at one time developing a remake of The Black Hole for Disney, but that project appears to have been scrapped (or, at best, delayed indefinitely).6. JURASSIC WORLD: DOMINION WILL&nbsp;REINTRODUCE OBSCURE&nbsp;JURASSIC PARK CHARACTER(Photo by Universal Pictures)When we first started hearing about the upcoming third Jurassic World movie we now know as Jurassic World: Dominion (6/11/2021), one of the biggest stories was that it would feature the return of three of the original Jurassic Park stars: Laura Dern, Jeff Goldblum, and Sam Neill, all reprising the same characters. Characters from the first Jurassic Park have returned before, including the kids in The Lost World: Jurassic Park, and BD Wong in Jurassic World, but Jurassic World: Dominion will feature another surprising return. Campbell Scott has reportedly signed on to co-star in Jurassic World: Dominion as Dr. Lewis Dodgson, a character from Michael Crichton’s novels who appeared in Jurassic Park as the mysterious figure who gave Wayne Knight’s character the cannister in which to put the stolen dinosaur embyros. Scott is taking over the role — likely to be one of the film’s villains — because the actor who played Dodgson in Jurassic Park, Cameron Thor, is “no longer available.”7. ELIZABETH BANKS TO DRIVE THE LIVE-ACTION MAGIC SCHOOL BUS(Photo by Saeed Adyani/©Netflix)After a long history of animated TV shows based on their various characters, Scholastic Entertainment is now starting to develop more and more theatrical feature films, including Goosebumps (Certified Fresh at 78%), Goosebumps 2: Haunted Halloween (Rotten at 48%), the upcoming Clifford the Big Red Dog (11/13/2020), and announced just last week, the Animorphs movie. We will also soon be able to add a live-action adaptation of&nbsp;The Magic School Bus&nbsp;to that list, as Elizabeth Banks has signed on to produce and star as Ms. Frizzle, the teacher who drives the bus as it takes kids on adventures through time and space. In the animated TV series, Ms. Frizzle was originally voiced by Lily Tomlin, with Kate McKinnon coming on board later to voice her sister. The Magic School Bus will be distributed by Universal Pictures, which is also the studio that released the three Pitch Perfect movies in which Elizabeth Banks also co-starred (and she also directed Pitch Perfect 2).8. BILL MURRAY TO VOICE A DOG IN BUM’S RUSH &nbsp;(Photo by Fox Searchlight courtesy Everett Collection)After starring in both Garfield: The Movie (Rotten at 15%)&nbsp;and Garfield: A Tail of Two Kitties (Rotten at 11%) (and thankfully, not a Garfield 3 as seen in Zombieland: Double Tap), Bill Murray also voiced one of the talking dogs in frequent collaborator Wes Anderson’s&nbsp;Isle of Dogs (Certified Fresh at 90%). This week, Murray signed on for yet another voice role as a stray dog named Bum in Bum’s Rush, along with Anne Hathaway and Robert Duvall. Bum’s Rush will be directed by Aaron Schneider (Greyhound, Get Low) from a screenplay by C. Gaby Mitchell, who received a story credit on Blood Diamond&nbsp;and co-wrote Get Low. The independent drama will be filmed in Santa Barbara and New Mexico, though it’s unclear, as many film productions are forced to address, when exactly they might be able to get that done. Hathaway will play a custom boot maker&nbsp;who befriends Murray’s Bum&nbsp;as “these two independent souls find themselves at a serious crossroads, one that will change both their hearts and minds in ways they can hardly imagine.”9. SCI-FI COMEDY ALPHA GANG RECRUITS STAR-STUDDED ENSEMBLE CAST(Photo by Elizabeth Goodenough/Everett Collection)As movies are increasingly based more on concept or franchise than the star’s fame, we see fewer stories about the sort of star-driven projects that used to be the norm. That said, the Cannes Film Festival — or, as it’s been rebranded this year due to the coronavirus pandemic, the Cannes Virtual Market — remains one of the places where these sort of “retro” star-driven projects can still generate interest. One of the movies at the market this year is a sci-fi comedy called Alpha Gang, about a group of aliens who are sent on a mission to conquer Earth disguised as a gang of bikers. Alpha Gang will feature an ensemble cast that includes Sofia Boutella (Kingsman: The Secret Service), Mackenzie Davis (Terminator: Dark Fate), Charlotte Gainsbourg (Independence Day: Insurgence), Jon Hamm (Mad Men), Nicholas Hoult (X-Men: Days of Future Past), Andrea Riseborough (Oblivion), and Steven Yeun (The Walking Dead). Writer-director duo Nathan and David Zellner (Damsel, Fresh at 67%)&nbsp;will produce and helm the film, working from a script written by the latter, who calls the film “a genre mashup of sci-fi, action and comedy.”","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"Tomatazos, psycho, Travel, japanese, Day, Walking, thriller","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/26143252/Margot_Robbie-Ketchup_Rep.jpg","slug":"margot-robbie-joins-the-pirates-of-the-caribbean-and-more-movie-news"},{"id":"47509182686527","title":"Miles Teller, Nicholas Hoult on Shortlist to Play Goose’s Son in Top Gun: Maverick, and More Movie News","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Miles Teller, Nicholas Hoult on Shortlist to Play Goose's Son in Top Gun: Maverick, and More Movie NewsSpider-Man gets a title, Firestarter gets a remake, Indiana Jones gets pushed back, and Jared Leto doubles down on comic book roles.by Greg Dean Schmitz | June 29, 2018 |  CommentsToday’s Ketchup brings you ten headlines from the world of film development news, covering titles such as Firestarter, Top Gun: Maverick, and Marvel Comics’ Morbius and Silk.This WEEK’S TOP STORYWHO WILL PLAY GOOSE’S KID IN TOP GUN: MAVERICK?(Photo by Dee Cercone, Derek Storm, Elizabeth Goodenough/Everett Collection)For a movie that started filming almost a month ago, we’ve heard surprisingly little about casting for the sequel Top Gun: Maverick. The focus has been entirely on returning cast members from the original 1986 movie, and just two actors, at that (Tom Cruise and Val Kilmer). The reported premise hinges upon how “the navy is very different now than it was in 1986,” so ostensibly, the sequel has to have more cast than just those two guys. One of the new characters is going to be the son of Anthony Edwards’ “Goose” character, and we now know which three young actors Paramount Pictures is considering for the role. Miles Teller is probably best known for Whiplash, The Spectacular Now, or maybe that horrible Fantastic Four reboot. Nicholas Hoult&nbsp;has also made a name for himself with&nbsp;roles in About a Boy, Mad Max: Fury Road, and the recent X-Men movies, but he’s also British (“Goose,” not so much). Finally, there’s relative-unknown Glen Powell, who played John Glenn in Hidden Figures, and also co-starred in Everybody Wants Some!!, Ride Along 2, and The Expendables 3. Top Gun: Maverick is scheduled for July 12th, 2019 (the week after Spider-Man: Far From Home, and the week before Disney’s remake of The Lion King).Fresh Developments1. THE NEXT SPIDER-MAN&nbsp;REVEALS ITS TITLE, AND&nbsp;SILK MIGHT GET HER OWN MOVIE TOO(Photo by Chuck Zlotnick/Columbia Pictures)The tricky thing about reporting on certain upcoming Marvel movies is dealing with the potential to&nbsp;unveil various spoilery things spinning out of Avengers: Infinity War. And yet, these movies are coming, and Marvel Studios still wants to start promoting them (even though Avengers 4 remains 10 months away). Perhaps that’s why they let Tom Holland do it on his Instagram account, where he revealed this week that the next movie is called Spider-Man: Far From Home. That title has multiple connotations, related to both Avengers: Infinity War&nbsp;and the filming locations in London and Europe that we already know about. In other Spider-Man news, Sony Pictures revealed this week that they are now developing a Silk movie, based on the Marvel character introduced in 2014. Korean-American teenager Cindy Moon&nbsp;was the other student bitten by that radioactive spider who gained different superpowers and who went a different route, spending years in captivation (explaining why she showed up so relatively late in the comics). Silk joins Sony’s other Spider-Man-related movies, including this year’s Venom (10/5/18) and Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse (12/14/18), and Morbius (more on this below), Nightwatch, and Silver &amp; Black.2.&nbsp;MARVEL’S KEVIN FEIGE REVEALS AT LEAST TWO LGBTQ HEROES COMING TO THE MCU(Photo by Greg Doherty/Getty Images)Marvel Studios’ MCU (Marvel Cinematic Universe) is a box office juggernaut that shows no sign of stopping, and with that, it’s adding new characters pretty much every year. Black Panther was one of this year’s biggest hits, and also an example of diversity working as a box office model. That umbrella hasn’t yet spread to everyone, but one key group was addressed this week. Marvel Studios boss Kevin Feige was asked&nbsp;whether LGBTQ+ characters might join the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and&nbsp;Feige’s answer was a terse “Yes,” followed by a “Both” when asked if the character(s) would be “ones you’ve seen and ones you haven’t seen.” This led to much speculation, with Tessa Thompson’s Valkyrie being most often cited as a candidate (mostly because of a Thor: Ragnarok deleted scene). Possible new heroes&nbsp; include Wiccan (Scarlet Witch’s son… it’s a long story), his boyfriend Hulkling, and also America (Chavez), who would also be Marvel’s first Latina superhero. (This all presumes Kevin Feige wasn’t including the various LGBTQ X-Men characters he might someday be able to include.)3. THIS WEEK IN STEPHEN KING: FIRESTARTER REMAKE, DOCTOR SLEEP CASTING, IT: CHAPTER TWO IMAGESLast year’s The Dark Tower might have been a flop,&nbsp;but the $700+ million global box office of IT&nbsp;is all Hollywood remembers, so Stephen King adaptations are one of the hottest trends going in 2018. Mostly, the focus is on remakes (like Pet Sematary, 4/5/18) and sequels. One of the&nbsp;former is going to be Firestarter, which is also sort of timely in 2018 when one considers how much Netflix’s Stranger Things paid homage to it. The job of directing Universal Pictures’ Firestarter&nbsp;remake has gone to Turkish-German director Fatih Akin (Goodbye Berlin, Soul Kitchen), with Blumhouse also signing on as co-producers. Another upcoming Stephen King adaptation is Doctor Sleep, which is also a sequel to The Shining (with Ewan McGregor playing the adult Danny Torrance). Rebecca Ferguson (Mission Impossible: Fallout) has joined Ewan McGregor in the Doctor Sleep cast, in an unknown role. Finally, there’s IT: Chapter Two (9/6/19), and this week, we saw our first images from the set.4.&nbsp;SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE STAR PETE DAVIDSON GOING THROUGH BIG TIME ADOLESCENCE(Photo by Jason Smith/Everett Collection)It has little to do with his comedy, but the current Saturday Night Live star who’s arguably been in the news the most lately is Pete Davidson (AKA the future Mr. Ariana Grande). Davidson also became one of the SNL stars who will have another job this summer, as he’s joined the cast of the comedy Big Time Adolescence. He’ll also be joined by Sydney Sweeney (Eden from The Handmaid’s Tale), rapper Machine Gun Kelly, and Oona Laurence (A Bad Moms Christmas). Big Time Adolescence last made the news in 2014, when it was one of the projects on the Black List of Unproduced Screenplays.5.&nbsp;MARK WAHLBERG TO REVIVE SPENSER FOR HIRE FOR NETFLIX, PLUS A MILE 22 SEQUEL(Photo by Patti Perret/Paramount Pictures)With his run on Transformers apparently done, Mark Wahlberg is all about establishing new franchises now, it appears, as we heard about two such moves this week. First up, there’s Wonderland, a new project set up at Netflix&nbsp;that&nbsp;is an adaptation of the 2013 novel by Ace Atkins, which posthumously continued author Robert B. Parker’s Spenser for Hire series. Parker’s character, like Wahlberg himself, is famously from Boston, so it was perhaps inevitable that Wahlberg would someday play him. The other new franchise in Wahlberg’s potential filmography is a sequel to 22 Mile, even though that movie doesn’t come out for another six weeks (8/17/18). Regardless, STX has already hired a screenwriter for the 22 Mile sequel.ROTTEN IDEAS OF THE WEEK4. INDIANA JONES 5 HELD BACK AGAIN, PAST 2020(Photo by Paramount Pictures)Whether a story is Fresh or Rotten is, obviously, very often a matter of perspective. For example, even though 2008’s Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull was Certified Fresh at 77%, the audience score was only 53%. So, perhaps those people see any delay of&nbsp;Indiana Jones 5 as&nbsp;a Fresh story, even if&nbsp;it’s&nbsp;a Steven Spielberg action flick and, ostensibly, the movie with which he will be able to retire Harrison Ford’s take as the character. Yesterday, the news broke that Solo: A Star Wars Story co-writer Jonathan Kasdan has been hired by Paramount Pictures to replace David Koepp as the Indiana Jones 5 screenwriter. Within a few hours, that led to a clarification that Paramount was also holding back filming of the sequel, which was previously scheduled to start in April, 2019 to meet a July 10th, 2020 release date. With that delay, Harrison Ford is likely to be at least 77 years old when Indiana Jones 5 starts filming. This move also might mean that Steven Spielberg will be able to film his remake of West Side Story sooner than had previously been expected.3.&nbsp;JARED LETO ADDS MARVEL’S MORBIUS&nbsp;TO HIS COMIC BOOK CRED(Photo by Clay Enos/Warner Bros.)When Sony Pictures cast Tom Hardy as this year’s Venom (10/5/18), many people noticed that it meant a major DC Comics movie star (Bane from The Dark Knight Rises) had switched over to Marvel (albeit not Marvel Studios, specifically).&nbsp;Now we have another DC Comics villain making the same move, and this time, it’s their most recent Joker. Jared Leto remains attached to a solo movie as The Joker, but he’s&nbsp;also now signed with Sony Pictures to star in their adaptation of Marvel Comics’ Morbius (AKA Morbius the Living Vampire). Daniel Espinosa (Life, Child 44, Safe House) will direct Morbius, as adapted by the screenwriting team (Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless) behind Gods of Egypt (15% on the Tomatometer), The Last Witch Hunter (17%), and Dracula Untold (24%). In other words, the bar for “success” here&nbsp;might be&nbsp;set at 25%&nbsp;on the Tomatometer.&nbsp;Morbius the Living Vampire has been a Spider-Man supporting character since 1971, but he also was almost a villain in Wesley Snipes’ Blade franchise.2. REBEL WILSON’S COMIC BOOK MOVIE LOOKS CROWDED(Photo by Richard Cartwright/Universal Pictures)As evidenced by the&nbsp;dominance of superhero movies from Marvel Studios, Fox, and DC/Warner Bros., comic books are a consistently reliable source for adaptations. Not all of them are about superpowered beings in spandex, though; comic books have been used to tell a wide range of stories in a variety of genres. For instance, comedian/actress Rebel Wilson added a comic book-inspired film to her resume this week,&nbsp;as she is producing and will star in an adaptation of Image Comics’ Crowded. The story is set in “a future where the world’s economy is centered around job sharing and apps, and the latest trend is Reapr, a crowdfunding platform that funds assassinations,” and Wilson’s character will have just discovered she’s a target. We’re calling Crowded a Rotten Idea based on Rebel Wilson’s track record on the Tomatometer:&nbsp;Of&nbsp;her last 13 films, the only two that were Fresh were the first two Pitch Perfect movies. The other 11 were all Rotten.1.&nbsp;POLARIS FROM THE GIFTED LANDS LEAD IN COMIC BOOK MOVIE RAZOR(Photo by Ryan Green/Fox )If you’re a producer or director who wants to get in on the comic book craze, but you don’t have any&nbsp;pull with Marvel or DC,&nbsp;your best bet is probably the&nbsp;&nbsp;indie comics route. And there are literally thousands of indie comic book titles&nbsp;— so many, in fact, that there are titles that even avid comics readers may not be familiar with,&nbsp;like&nbsp;Razor&nbsp;from indie publisher London Night Studios. Recognizable or not, Razor is officially the latest comic book series picked up for the adaptation treatment, with Rob Cohen as director. The title character will be played by Emma Dumont, who costars in Fox’s The Gifted as Lorna Dane, a.k.a.&nbsp;X-Men member Polaris. The title&nbsp;Razor refers to the blades that cover the character’s bodysuit, so that&nbsp;her punches and kicks also rip&nbsp;her enemies apart,&nbsp;kind of like&nbsp;Wolverine. None of the films that Rob Cohen has directed in the last 19 years has scored above 53% on the Tomatometer, which is what&nbsp;The Fast and the Furious&nbsp;earned, and even that’s still Rotten. &nbsp;","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"ratings, halloween, Access","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/29175234/Top-Gun-Goose-Son-Ketchup.jpg","slug":"miles-teller-nicholas-hoult-on-shortlist-to-play-gooses-son-in-top-gun-maverick-and-more-movie-news"},{"id":"47509179217190","title":"Spider-Verse Sequel and Spinoff on the Way, and More Movie News","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Spider-Verse Sequel and Spinoff on the Way, and More Movie NewsNetflix wants to remake Jimmy Stewart classic Harvey, and new roles for Saoirse Ronan, Kate Winselt, Ben Affleck, Benicio Del Toro, and more.by Greg Dean Schmitz | December 21, 2018 |  CommentsToday’s Ketchup brings you another 10 headlines from the world of film development news, covering titles such as Silver Surfer, and Spider-Women, and new roles for John Boyega and Ansel Elgort.This WEEK’S TOP STORYINTO THE SPIDER-VERSE SUCCESS INSPIRES SPINOFF AND SEQUEL(Photo by Sony Pictures Animation)In its first weekend in domestic box office alone, Sony’s innovative animated film Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse has already earned back over half of its initial $90 million production budget. The film was always part of Sony’s ambitious plans for its Marvel properties, and this week, we leaned a lot more about possible future films. Development has reportedly begun on both a sequel and a spinoff of Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse, although there may also be others. The sequel is described as focusing on the romance between Miles Morales and Gwen Stacey, which will then lead into the spinoff Spider-Women, featuring Gwen, Silk, and the original Spider-Woman (in the comics), Jessica Drew. (Spider-Woman also had her own Saturday morning cartoon back in the late 1970s, which you can sample right here.) Former Saturday Night Live writer John Mulaney, who voiced Peter Porker A.K.A. Spider-Ham, is also teasing his ideas for a Spider-Ham movie, which he compares to Spotlight (but for kids). The post-credits sequence also teased a new character voiced by Oscar Isaac (who we won’t identify just yet to avoid second week spoilers). Another possibility is the MCU version played by Tom Holland, who is reportedly not off limits&nbsp;for a future animated film. Finally, there are still other hints and teases throughout the film as to where the Spider-Verse may someday go, as you can also see discussed at THR and here at RT.Fresh Developments1.&nbsp;SAOIRSE RONAN AND KATE WINSLET DIG UP AMMONITE FOSSILS(Photo by Kerry Brown/Fox Searchlight Pictures, Barry Wetcher/Warner Bros.)Kate Winslet is currently&nbsp;in the midst of a 10-out-of-11 Rotten streak, but perhaps this week’s new project will help&nbsp;her right that ship, as she is now signed to star&nbsp;alongside Saoirse Ronan in the historical drama Ammonite. Winslet will play 19th century paleontologist and fossil hunter Mary Anning, who begins a romantic relationship with “a London woman of means [Ronan] to whom she must unexpectedly play nursemaid.” Mary Anning is also considered the inspiration&nbsp;for the tongue twister, “she sells seashells by the seashore” (though it’s arguably an anti-science slur by 21st century standards). The film takes its title from ammonite fossils, which are generally spiral shells related to modern squids and cuttlefish. Ammonite will be the second film from British director Francis Lee, whose first film God’s Own Country (Certified Fresh at 97%) was also a gay romance.2. 2018 BLACK LIST SPOTLIGHTS BIOPICS ABOUT SNAPCHAT, GAWKER, AND THE DRUDGE REPORT(Photo by Lev Radin/Everett Collection)Ever since The Black List of Unproduced Screenplays survey began in 2005, the projects selected each year have regularly included several biopic (or otherwise historical) projects of note. Movies that have actually been produced after Black List success have included American Hustle, Argo, The Founder, I Tonya, The Imitation Game, The King’s Speech, and Spotlight. The 2018 Black List continues this trend, with a particular focus this year on true stories involving such online resources as Gawker (Just the Facts), The Drudge Report (Drudge), and&nbsp;Snapchat (in Frat Boy Genius, which was this year’s top selection). The #2 project, King Richard, is another fact-based drama, as it tells the story of Richard Williams, “the hard-nosed and uncompromising father of tennis prodigies turned superstars, Venus and Serena Williams.” Other historical adaptations towards the top of the results include The Seventh (about Colonel Custer and the Battle of Little Bighorn), Rub &amp; Tug (which Scarlett Johansson almost starred in), and Tillman (about NFL player Pat Tillman).3. THIS WEEK IN DEL TOROS, PART 1: GUILLERMO’S&nbsp;TERRIFIED AND&nbsp;SCARY MOVIES(Photo by Kerry Hayes/Universal Pictures)It was just three weeks ago that The Shape of Water director Guillermo del Toro revealed 15 produced screenplays that he has ready to go. This week, del Toro addressed the likelihood that he will make most of those films&nbsp;in an interview, sadly saying, “First of all I weigh more than 300 pounds and I’m 54 so no. I can’t. There are about 20 projects and I won’t live that long.” The good news is that GDT now has a production company based at Fox Searchlight, so he is in position to shepherd some of these projects for other directors. One new project in that vein is an English-language remake of the 2017 Argentinian horror/thriller film Terrified, to be directed by the same director, Demian Rugna. Terrified was “set in a neighborhood in Buenos Aires where a doctor specializing in the paranormal, her colleague, and an ex-police officer investigate horrifying events and attempt to stop the evil before it spreads.” Guillermo del Toro is also producing Scary Movies to Tell in the Dark, which is now scheduled for release on August 9, 2019 (up against Disney’s Artemis Fowl, also adapted from a children’s book series).4. THIS WEEK IN DEL TOROS, PART 2: BENICIO JOINS DORA THE EXPLORER(Photo by Jonathan Olley/Walt Disney Studios)Ever since we first heard about a live-action remake of Dora the Explorer (and especially when we first saw Isabella Moner as the character), the question has been about how much&nbsp;live action it would feature. Although Dora the Explorer had many “human” characters, her main sidekick was Boots the Monkey, and she had a talking backpack. This week, we learned that Academy Award winner Benicio Del Toro (Guardians of the Galaxy, Sicario) will be voicing Swiper the Fox. Filming of Dora the Explorer actually wrapped up two weeks ago, but Swiper will indeed be a CGI animated character, so Del Toro didn’t need to be on set. James Bobin (The Muppets, Muppets Most Wanted) is directing Dora the Explorer, which Paramount has scheduled for August 2, 2019 (up against Fox and Marvel’s The New Mutants and the Fast and Furious spinoff Hobbs &amp; Shaw).5. ANCHORMAN,&nbsp;VICE DIRECTOR’S DREAM MARVEL PROJECT IS SILVER SURFER(Photo by 20th Century Fox Film Corp.)The idea of a live action Silver Surfer movie has been bouncing around since at least 1994, when this student short film was produced. That was also why 20th Century Fox introduced the character in 2007’s Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer, but that film’s box office and critical reception most likely cooled any plans for a solo movie. With Disney preparing to assimilate various Fox projects (including Fantastic Four and X-Men) in the next few years, it appears that Silver Surfer may now have a chance at getting his own movie. That is, if writer/director Adam McKay gets any say in it, as the Vice director (and Ant-Man cowriter) revealed this week that it’s his one dream Marvel Comics project. McKay was quoted this week as saying, “I would do anything to do Silver Surfer because, visually, you could do what the Wachowskis did with Speed Racer with the Silver Surfer.” Setting aside the 40% Tomatometer score for Speed Racer, Adam McKay’s Tomatometer is the more relevant statistic here. Unfortunately for him, neither Fox nor Marvel currently has a Silver Surfer project in development.6. JOHN BOYEGA MAKES A LEGAL CASE FOR A NAKED SINGULARITYIt’s not yet known what will become of some of the characters who debuted in Star Wars: The Force Awakens after Star Wars: Episode IX, but some of the actors appear to be seeking other work. This week, John Boyega, who plays Finn, signed to star in a legal drama A Naked Singularity, based on a 2008 novel by Sergio De La Pava. Boyega will play a public defender who “begins to strain under the weight of his work and starts to question everything after he loses his first case.” The screenplay is being adapted by screenwriters David Matthews (of TV’s Narcos and HBO’s Vinyl) and Chase Palmer (cowriter of 2017’s IT).7. BABY DRIVER’S&nbsp;ANSEL ELGORT PRETENDS TO BE THE GREAT HIGH SCHOOL IMPOSTER(Photo by Wilson Webb/TriStar)Both of the 21 Jump Street movies starring Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum were relatively successful ($158 million and $212 million globally), and there has been talk about a possible third female-centric film&nbsp;with both Tiffany Haddish and Awkwafina reportedly in consideration to star. Those movies are obviously fictional, but this week, a true story with a halfway similar premise emerged as a new film project. Ansel Elgort (Baby Driver, The Fault in Our Stars) is now attached to star in The Great High School Imposter, a true story drama based upon the GQ article of the same name. It’s relevant to point out that Elgort is currently 24, as he will be playing a Ukrainian immigrant who pretends to be five years younger “so he could be adopted by a childless couple in a small Pennsylvania town, all to stay in the country after a short stint in a work exchange program.” Elgort also has the novel adaptation The Goldfinch (10/11/2019) and Steven Spielberg’s West Side Story (in which he will star as Tony) in the works.Rotten Ideas2.&nbsp;BEN AFFLECK DECIDES&nbsp;I AM STILL ALIVE(Photo by Universal Pictures)Ben Affleck has been associated with Warner Bros. for the past several years, as it was the studio for whom&nbsp;he directed his Best Picture-winner&nbsp;Argo,&nbsp;played&nbsp;Batman in two films (including Justice League), and also starred in The Accountant and Live by Night (which he also directed, wrote, and produced). That said, he’s taking his next project to Universal Pictures.&nbsp;Affleck will produce and star in an adaptation of I Am Still Alive, a book by Kate Alice Marshall, a&nbsp;wilderness survival drama about “a 16-year-old girl who is sent to live with her long-lost, and off-the-grid, father in the Canadian wilderness.” Meanwhile, Affleck is also currently filming (as actor and producer) a Warner Bros. sports drama about high school basketball called Torrance.1. NETFLIX REMAKING JIMMY STEWART COMEDY CLASSIC HARVEYNearly a decade before Steven Spielberg started active work on a remake of West Side Story, he had been reported back in 2009 to be&nbsp;working on a remake of the 1950 Jimmy Stewart comedy classic Harvey, about a man with a six foot tall imaginary rabbit friend. As it often happens, Spielberg eventually moved on from the Harvey remake, but this week, we learned that just such a film is still in development, now at Netflix. Netflix has hired screenwriter J. David Stem and David N. Weiss (The Smurfs 2, Shrek 2) to adapt the 1950 film (and the play it was adapted from) in collaboration with the Mexican production company behind Netflix’s and Martin Scorsese’s The Irishman.","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"The, Fox, boxing, Trek, Company, Summer, Video, bad, australia, dceu, TBS","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/21155258/Into_the_Spider-Verse_Gwen_Ketchup.jpg","slug":"spider-verse-sequel-and-spinoff-on-the-way-and-more-movie-news"},{"id":"47509184494925","title":"Indiana Jones 5 Will Start Filming Next Year for 2020 Release, and More Movie News","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Indiana Jones 5 Will Start Filming Next Year for 2020 Release, and More Movie NewsMichael B. Jordan takes on real-life \"Black Panthers\", Thor: Ragnarok stars reunite for MIB, Shia LaBeouf will play his own father, and Steven Spielberg pooh-poohs Netflix.by Greg Dean Schmitz | March 23, 2018 |  CommentsToday’s Ketchup brings you ten headlines from the world of film development news, covering new projects for Ben Affleck, Michael B. Jordan, Amy Poehler, and Jacob Tremblay.This WEEK’S TOP STORYINDIANA JONES 5 STARTS FILMING NEXT YEAR FOR 2020 RELEASE(Photo by Paramount Pictures courtesy Everett Collection)It seems like Steven Spielberg has been talking about a fifth Indiana Jones movie pretty much since the day after Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull&nbsp;came out on May 23, 2008. This week, however, we received news that seems to confirm that&nbsp;it’s&nbsp;finally happening. Speaking at an awards ceremony in London, Spielberg announced that he will start filming Indiana Jones 5 (or whatever its title will be) in April, 2019, while Walt Disney Pictures (which acquired the franchise when they acquired Lucasfilm) has scheduled&nbsp;the film&nbsp;for release on July 10th, 2020, which is a week after Minions 2 (7/3/20), and the week before the Bob’s Burgers movie (7/17/20). Harrison Ford, who will turn 77 next summer, is returning for Indiana Jones 5, but nothing else is known about the premise, though his age might suggest a setting in the late 1960s or 1970s.Fresh Developments1. MICHAEL B. JORDAN PRODUCING WWII “BLACK PANTHERS” TRUE STORY THE LIBERATORS(Photo by Marvel Studios)Within a few days of Frances McDormand’s call for inclusion riders at this year’s Academy Awards, Michael B. Jordan’s production company announced that they would indeed be adopting an inclusion rider policy. Inclusion riders are contract elements that require that “projects make a concerted effort to cast minorities, LGBTQ actors, and women in supporting and background roles.” That was only two weeks ago, and we’ve already heard about the first new project from Jordan’s production company that will presumably fall under that policy. Michael B. Jordan (Creed, Black Panther) is now producing the World War II true story The Liberators, about the 761st Tank Battalion, an all-African American unit&nbsp;also known as “The Black Panthers.” It is not yet known if Jordan will also be starring&nbsp;in The Liberators.2. BEN AFFLECK, OSCAR ISAAC, AND OTHERS TO DEFEND SOUTH AMERICA’S TRIPLE FRONTIER(Photo by Universal Pictures courtesy Everett Collection)One of the most tumultous projects of the last several years has been the South American adventure drama Triple Frontier, which started as a project for director Kathryn Bigelow (The Hurt Locker, Zero Dark Thirty) with a cast that potentially included Mahershala Ali, Johnny Depp, Leonardo DiCaprio, Tom Hanks, Tom Hardy, and Channing Tatum. Last year, Netflix took over the project from Paramount, and that appears to have been the spark&nbsp;it needed to get produced. Triple Frontier will now feature the acting talents of Ben Affleck, Oscar Isaac (Poe Dameron from Star Wars: The Last Jedi), Charlie Hunnam (Pacific Rim), Garrett Hedlund (Tron: Legacy,&nbsp;Mudbound), and Pedro Pascal (Oberyn Martell from S4 of TV’s Game of Thrones). Filming is now scheduled to start next week at locations in Hawaii, California, and Colombia under the direction of three-time Certified Fresh director J.C. Chandor (Margin Call, A Most Violent Year).3. MEN IN BLACK SPINOFF TO FEATURE THOR: RAGNAROK&nbsp;REUNION(Photo by Marvel Studios)Tessa Thompson’s performance as Valkyrie in Thor: Ragnarok was widely touted as one of the best things about the film, and now she and the star of that&nbsp;movie are set for a little reunion. Two weeks ago,&nbsp;Sony Pictures cast Chris Hemsworth in their Men in Black reboot/spinoff, and this week, they officially cast Thompson in an unknown role alongside him.&nbsp;F. Gary Gray (Straight Outta Compton, The Fate of the Furious) will direct the untitled film,&nbsp;which is being described as more of an ensemble project, from a screenplay by Matt Holloway and Art Marcum (Punisher: War Zone, Transformers: The Last Knight).&nbsp; Sony Pictures has scheduled the&nbsp;Men in Black spinoff for June 14th, 2019, up against John Wick: Chapter 3&nbsp;and the YA adaptation The Sun is Also a Star.4. AMY POEHLER AND OTHER SNL ALUMNI HEAD TO WINE COUNTRY(Photo by Glen Wilson/Warner Bros.)Former Saturday Night Live and Parks &amp; Recreation star Amy Poehler has written and directed for television before, is set to make her feature film debut with a comedy for Netflix&nbsp;called Wine Country, which will feature three other&nbsp;SNL&nbsp;alumni. Rachel Dratch (1999-2006), Ana Gasteyer (1996-2002), and Maya Rudolph (1999-2008) will be joined by former SNL writers Paula Pell&nbsp;and Emily Spivey in this comedy about “old friends who go to Napa for a weekend getaway to celebrate a 50th birthday.” Filming is scheduled to start in California’s Napa wine country and in Los Angeles next week with an eye towards a streaming debut sometime in 2019.5. DAKOTA JOHNSON AND ZAZIE BEETZ JOIN UNTITLED ARMIE HAMMER THRILLER(Photo by Dee Cercone, Steven Ferdman/Everett Collection)One of these days, a studio should just stick to their guns and actually release a movie&nbsp;called something like Untitled Armie Hammer Thriller. Until that&nbsp;happens,&nbsp;we’ll continue to expect that said thriller will have a different name when it’s released about a year from now on March 29th, 2019. In the meantime, we now know that Armie Hammer (Call Me By Your Name, The Social Network) will be joined by Dakota Johnson (Fifty Shades of Grey) and Zazie Beetz, who will star as Domino in this summer’s Deadpool 2. Hammer will&nbsp;play&nbsp; “a New Orleans bartender… whose life begins to unravel after a series of disturbing and inexplicable events transpire when he picks up a phone left behind at his bar.” The other movie currently scheduled for March 29th, 2019 is Disney’s live action remake of Dumbo, starring Colin Farrell, Eva Green, Michael Keaton, and Danny DeVito.6. SHIA LABEOUF TO STAR IN HIS OWN BIOPIC (AS HIS DAD)(Photo by DreamWorks courtesy Everett Collection)In something&nbsp;like a straight-faced thematic cousin to last year’s The Disaster Artist, Shia LaBeouf is now attached to star in his own biopic, but as his own father. Lucas Hedges (Manchester by the Sea) will star in Honey Boy as the young version of LaBeouf, who cowrote the screenplay under the pseudonym of Otis Lort (also the character’s name). The project bubbled up through independent development with very little attention until LaBeouf confirmed to Esquire this week that he is the film’s “Otis Lort.” When the screenplay appeared last year on The Black List of Unproduced Screenplays, the logline was described as “a child actor and his law-breaking, alcohol-abusing father attempt to mend their contentious relationship over the course of a decade.”ROTTEN IDEAS OF THE WEEK3. WONDER STAR JACOB TREMBLAY TO HEADLINE R-RATED KID COMEDY GOOD BOYS(Photo by Elizabeth Goodenough/Everett Collection)Jacob Tremblay first broke out in the award-winning drama 2015 drama&nbsp;Room, then warmed hearts last year in the family drama Wonder. Now 11 years old, Tremblay appears ready to tackle more adult fare, as he’s the first of four young actors to be cast as one of the Good Boys, an R-rated Universal Pictures comedy&nbsp;co-produced by Seth Rogen. Good Boys was written by the team of Lee Eisenberg and Gene Stupnitsky (Bad Teacher, 44%&nbsp;on the Tomatometer;&nbsp;&nbsp;Year One, 15%), who will also be making their feature film directorial debuts. Tremblay will play one of “four 12-year old boys who skip school to embark on a day-long adventure fraught with comedic peril” in a comedy that’s being&nbsp;described as “Stand By Me meets Superbad.”2. STEVEN SPIELBERG THINKS NETFLIX MOVIES SHOULDN’T BE ELIGIBLE FOR ACADEMY AWARDS(Photo by Derek Storm/Everett Collection)Streaming services like Netflix (Beasts of No Nation, Mudbound) and Amazon (Manchester by the Sea, The Big Sick) are just starting to get attention from the Academy Awards, but acclaimed director Steven Spielberg thinks that, well, they shouldn’t. Earlier this week, Spielberg was quoted specifically saying, “I don’t believe films that are just given token qualifications in a couple of theaters for less than a week should qualify for the Academy Award nomination.” In using this reasoning&nbsp; — against Netflix in particular,&nbsp;as Amazon’s films got longer releases — Spielberg is walking a dangerous line that could hurt many independent films. It’s a common approach for small boutique distributors to have “qualifying releases” each year for just one week in New York and Los Angeles, and then go wider in January or February if their film receives nominations. If one-week releases were disqualified, only the biggest companies might be able to compete for Academy Awards. In related news, Cannes is now banning Netflix films from the festival’s competition slate, which means they can still screen their films, but they won’t be eligible for any of the festival’s awards.1. CHRIS EVANS CONFIRMS (AGAIN) THAT HE’S DONE AS CAPTAIN AMERICA(Photo by Marvel Studios)Every once in a while, we like to use the “Rotten Idea” section to point out a problem not just with a specific movie or news story, but with a problematic trend in the news itself, generally. This week, Variety, The Wrap, and other publications are citing a recent New York Times interview&nbsp;in which Chris Evans&nbsp;says he’s likely done with playing Captain America after next year’s Avengers 4 (5/3/19).&nbsp; The statement is generating interest from various outlets as a big story, and it’s true, that was very big news… when Evans first said pretty much the same thing last summer… which we covered in the June 16th, 2017 edition of The Weekly Ketchup. In today’s super competitive website-eat-website environment, there appears to be a lot of interest in regurgitating old stories for the sake of getting multiple hits out of the same story. (And we admit, we’re doing the same thing&nbsp;right here, but at least we also acknowledge that this “news” is actually old news.)","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"Festival, shows","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/23184647/Indiana-Jones-Ketchup.jpg","slug":"indiana-jones-5-will-start-filming-next-year-for-2020-release-and-more-movie-news"},{"id":"47509187602804","title":"Michelle Rodriguez Threatens to Bail on Fast &amp; Furious 9, and More News","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Michelle Rodriguez Threatens to Bail on Fast &amp; Furious 9, and More NewsAnsel Elgort will play JFK, Fox announces a ton of release dates, and new roles for Tommy Lee Jones, Brad Pitt, Jake Gyllenhaal, Rene Russo, and Hugh Jackman.by Greg Dean Schmitz | June 30, 2017 |  CommentsThis week’s Ketchup brings you another ten headlines from the world of film development news (those stories about what movies Hollywood is working on for you next). Included in the mix this time around are stories about such titles as Fast &amp; Furious 9, Brad Pitt’s Ad Astra, and new biopic roles for Ansel Elgort and Hugh Jackman.This WEEK’S TOP STORYCOULD MICHELLE RODRIGUEZ BAIL ON FAST &amp; FURIOUS 9?(Photo by Giles Keyte/Universal Pictures)As Warner Bros.’ superhero movie&nbsp;Wonder Woman continues its marathon box office run, the narrative this summer&nbsp;has been that the film is succeeding partly because it offers something that many other movies this summer do not, namely a female lead in an action movie. Now, we don’t know for sure that this story came about because of that narrative… but maybe it did? Tuesday, to promote the digital premiere of Fate of the Furious, Michelle Rodriguez took to Instagram&nbsp;to address&nbsp;her future in the franchise, stating specifically, “I hope they decide to show some love to the women of the franchise on the next one. Or I just might have to say goodbye to a loved franchise.” Although previous installments did feature stronger roles for some of the female characters (including Gal Gadot’s), Rodriguez’s Letty didn’t have much to do in Fate of the Furious. Interviewed recently for Entertainment Weekly, Rodriguez also pointed out, “I’ve been making movies with Jordana, who plays the sister of Dom Toretto, for 16 years and I can count on one hand how many lines I’ve had to her…&nbsp; …I think that’s pathetic and it’s lack of creativity.” Although filming hasn’t started yet, Universal Pictures has already scheduled Fast &amp; Furious 9 for April 19, 2019.Fresh Developments1. TOMMY LEE JONES TO PLAY BRAD PITT’S ASTRONAUT DAD IN SCI-FI ADVENTURE AD ASTRA(Photo by Barry Wetcher/Columbia Pictures, Warner Bros. courtesy Everett Collection)There will always be some curiosity&nbsp;about a new film when Brad Pitt is involved, and one of his recent projects is now getting some attention. As his other films (like World War Z 2)&nbsp;continue to get pushed back, it looks like Pitts next one may be a science fiction drama set in deep space called Ad Astra (Latin for “to the stars”). That seems to be the suggestion, anyway, in an announcement this week that Tommy Lee Jones is now in final negotiations to join Pitt in Ad Astra, which will start filming in September, and centers on a “slightly autistic” man’s journey into space to discover what happened to his father, who embarked on a one-way&nbsp;mission to Neptune 20 years prior.&nbsp;Ad Astra will be directed by James Gray, whose most recent film was The Lost City of Z.2.&nbsp;BABY DRIVER STAR ANSEL ELGORT TO PLAY YOUNG JFK IN MAYDAY 109(Photo by Wilson Webb/TriStar)Although it’s largely forgotten now, the 1963 film P.T. 109 made history as the first dramatic feature film about a living U.S. president released during that president’s term. Cliff Robertson (AKA Uncle Ben in the Sam Raimi Spider-Man movies) starred in that film, but he was just the first of many actors to play John F. Kennedy. If you saw Baby Driver this week, then you actually saw the next, because Ansel Elgort is now signed to star&nbsp;in Mayday 109, a World War II drama that will tell the true story of the 1943 sinking of the PT boat commanded by a young John F. Kennedy in the South Pacific. The future 35th POTUS led 11 survivors to a deserted island, where they had to avoid capture by the Japanese forces surrounding them. The apparently quick development of Mayday 109 follows the critical success of another JFK-related drama, Jackie, and it arguably bears some similarities to next month’s WWII drama, Christopher Nolan’s&nbsp;Dunkirk. No director is yet signed to direct Mayday 109.&nbsp;3. COULD WE ACTUALLY GET AN ELSEWORLDS MOVIE IN THE FORM OF SUPERMAN: RED SON(Photo by Clay Enos/Warner Bros.)Both Marvel Comics and DC Comics have incorporated “alternate reality” storylines featuring their popular characters. Marvel’s most popular series is called What If?, which poses questions like, “What If Spider-Man‘s Uncle Ben Hadn’t Died?” or “What If Wolverine Killed The Incredible Hulk?” DC Comics’ signature response is Elseworlds, which often tells its stories more thematically, like Gotham by Gaslight (Victorian Era Batman), Thrillkiller (Robin and Batgirl in the 1960s), and Justice Riders (the JLA in the Wild West). One of the most popular Elseworlds was 2003’s Superman: Red Son, in which Kal-El’s rocket lands in the Soviet Union instead of Kansas. Surprisingly this week, Kong: Skull Island director Jordan Vogt-Roberts revealed via Twitter that he recently pitched Warner Bros on a Superman: Red Son movie. This led to further reporting about the possibility, and it sounds like Warner Bros is really considering lots of options for their future superhero movies. Who knows? Maybe we could get Kingdom Come or Crisis on Infinite Earths&nbsp;someday.4. JAKE GYLLENHAAL, RENE RUSSO, AND NIGHTCRAWLER DIRECTOR TO REUNITE FOR NETFLIX(Photo by Chuck Zlotnick/Open Road Films)This Wednesday saw the Netflix debut of the giant pig movie Okja, from Snowpiercer director Bong Joon-ho. In addition to Tilda Swinton, Paul Dano, Steven Yeun, and Giancarlo Esposito, Okja features a gonzo performance by Jake Gyllenhaal as a past-his-prime TV star. Considering that and the fact that Netflix has&nbsp;no problems attracting top tier talent&nbsp;these days (like Brad Pitt in War Machine), it’s not surprising that Gyllenhaal is now attached to another movie that will premiere on the streaming service. The movie doesn’t have a title yet, but it will also be a reunion project for Gyllenhaal, Rene Russo, and director Dan Gilroy, who all previously made 2014’s Nightcrawler together. Nothing else is known about the movie except that it will be a “drama set in the art world,” and that Gilroy will be directing from his own screenplay. Dan Gilroy’s credits as a screenwriter also include Real Steel, Kong: Skull Island, and his next film as director, Roman Israel, Esq., starring Denzel Washington.5. FOX RELEASE DATES PART 1: MYSTERY MARVEL MOVIES IN 2019-2021… BUT WHAT ARE THEY?(Photo by Brianna Hildebrand/20th Century Fox)Although last year’s X-Men: Apocalypse was a bit of a critical stumble, 20th Century Fox also recently had critical and box office successes with both Deadpool and Logan. With that in mind, Fox is tripling down on their plans for adaptations of the Marvel characters they have the rights to, with 2018 alone bringing us The New Mutants (4/13/18), Deadpool 2 (6/1/18), and X-Men: Dark Phoenix (11/16/18). This week, the studio confirmed that the three-Marvel-movies-a-year pattern will continue.&nbsp;Along with an already scheduled 2/15/18 film, there are now six more Fox/Marvel movies, specifically scheduled for: 6/7/19 (the week after Avengers 4), 11/22/19 (the week before Frozen 2), 3/13/20 (against a Pixar film), 6/26/20 (the week after another Pixar film), 10/2/20, and 3/5/21. So, what might these six mystery Marvel movies be? We already know Deadpool 3&nbsp;and&nbsp;X-Force&nbsp;are in development, and we can speculate that both The New Mutants and X-Men will get new installments in that date range. As for the other two slots, there are the rumors of an&nbsp;X-23 movie, a&nbsp;Fantastic Four reboot, and the long-in-development Gambit movie starring Channing Tatum (or not).6. FOX RELEASE DATES PART 2: ANIMATED NIMONA, DIRECTOR JAMES MANGOLD’S NYPD DRAMA THE FORCE(Photo by Derek Storm/Everett Collection)Those six Marvel movies aren’t, however, the only new release dates that 20th Century Fox announced this week; there are also other&nbsp;new development revelations about Fox’s upcoming slate of films. First up, there’s the thriller Bad Times at the El Royale (which may have horror or science fiction elements), directed by Drew Goddard (The Cabin in the Woods), which will be released on October 5, 2018 (against the Marvel adaptation Venom). On March 1st, 2019, Fox has scheduled The Force, an adaptation of a NYPD novel by author Don Winslow, to be directed by James Mangold (The Wolverine, Logan) and adapted by acclaimed screenwriter David Mamet, which&nbsp;will face off against How to Train Your Dragon 3, just a week before Marvel’s Captain Marvel&nbsp;starring Brie Larson. Finally, on February 14th (Valentine’s Day), 2020, Fox has scheduled an animated adaptation of the graphic novel&nbsp;Nimona.7.&nbsp;HUGH JACKMAN’S NEXT BIOPIC WILL BE AS GARY HART IN THE FRONTRUNNER(Photo by 20th Century Fox)This week, 20th Century Fox released the first trailer for this December’s musical extravaganza The Greatest Showman, starring Hugh Jackman as circus entrepeneur P.T. Barnum. Coincidentally (or not), Jackman also signed on this week for another biopic called The Frontrunner, about&nbsp;the&nbsp;1988 presidential campaign&nbsp;of&nbsp;disgraced politician Gary Hart. The Colorado Senator had been the Democratic Party primary frontrunner until an extramarital sex scandal with Donna Rice forced him to pull out of the race. Jason Reitman will direct&nbsp;The Frontrunner, returning to his political roots (Thank You for Smoking) after a run of films that included&nbsp;Juno, Young Adult, and his next film with Charlize Theron, Tully.&nbsp;Reitman also cowrote The Frontrunner with former HRC press secretary Jay Carson and Matt Bai, the author of the source nonfiction book&nbsp;All the Truth is Out: The Week Politics Went Tabloid.8. YET MORE X-MEN NEWS: DAZZLER TO DEBUT IN DARK PHOENIX, QUICKSILVER TO RETURN(Photo by 20th Century Fox)This was a relatively slow news week, especially if you take 20th Century Fox’s announcements out of the equation. So, we will (nearly) wrap up with a few more items from Fox’s various Marvel Comics adaptations this week. First, there’s X-Men: Dark Phoenix (11/16/18). Although we don’t know who will play her yet, we now know that mutant pop star Dazzler will make her debut in that film (after rumors that Taylor Swift would play her in last year’s X-Men: Apocalypse). Also, after initial reports to the contrary, Evan Peters is now confirmed to return as Quicksilver&nbsp;in his third X-Men movie (although Quicksilver wasn’t involved in the original Dark Phoenix storyline in the comics). As for The New Mutants (4/13/18), Rosario Dawson has dropped out of co-starring as Dr. Cecilia Reyes, and that character will now be played by Alice Braga (Elysium, I Am Legend). Lasly, filming of Deadpool 2 (6/1/18) started this week, and Josh Brolin gave us a glimpse of the preparation for his transformation into Cable.ROTTEN IDEA OF THE WEEK1. BEN AFFLECK TO RETURN FOR THE ACCOUNTANT SEQUEL(Photo by Warner Bros.)Ben Affleck is in the midst of a run of Rotten films, which started with Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice (27 percent) and continued with The Accountant (52 percent) and Live by Night (34 percent). Joss Whedon’s contributions to this November’s Justice League may help turn things around, but this week, Affleck started negotiations for a sequel&nbsp;to one of those aforementioned Rotten films. Warner Bros is hoping Affleck will sign on to star in a sequel to last year’s The Accountant, which was for him&nbsp;sort of what the Jason Bourne movies are for his pal, Matt Damon.&nbsp;The Accountant was made on a budget of just $45 million, so its $86 million domestic take is seen as a modest hit, even if the film’s 52 percent Tomatometer score indicates critics where less than enthusiastic about it.","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"20th, Plus, reviews, movies, 4/20, free, Comedy, psychological, live, Discovery, books, Marvel, Pop, Disney, Musical","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/30174926/Michelle-Rodriguez-FF-Ketchup.jpg","slug":"michelle-rodriguez-threatens-to-bail-on-fast-furious-9-and-more-news"},{"id":"47509188772225","title":"Joss Whedon Joins DC for a Batgirl Movie, and More News","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Joss Whedon Joins DC for a Batgirl Movie, and More NewsWB wants Jordan Peele for Akira, Disney wants Beyonce for The Lion King, Aaron Sorkin wants to write superhero stories, and Fox still wants to remake Escape from New York.by Greg Dean Schmitz | March 31, 2017 |  CommentsThis week’s Ketchup brings you another ten headlines from the world of film development news (those stories about what movies Hollywood is working on for you next). Included in the mix this time around are stories about such titles as Batgirl, The Lion King, and remakes of Akira and Escape from New York.This WEEK’S TOP STORYAVENGERS DIRECTOR JOSS WHEDON TO SWITCH TEAMS FOR DC’S BATGIRLEver since Man of Steel, fans and critics alike have opined that WB and DC would do well to emulate the lighter tone of&nbsp;Marvel’s MCU, which has benefited greatly from the influence of directors like Joss Whedon. Although Whedon’s&nbsp;Avengers was technically the sixth MCU film, the argument could be made that his&nbsp;influence was felt well before the film debuted&nbsp;in&nbsp;2012. Obviously, WB/DC shouldn’t outright copy anything Marvel Studios has done, but they’ve already taken a major step, as Warner Bros is nearing finalization of a deal with Joss Whedon to write, direct, and produce a solo Batgirl movie. It also sounds like WB might be looking to release&nbsp;Batgirl before the Harley Quinn spinoff Gotham City Sirens. There’s already a report that Whedon will be using the “New 52” version of Batgirl as the basis for his film, and that’s already somewhat controversial.&nbsp;There’s no word yet on who might star in Batgirl, but this poll might give you an idea of some of the possibilities. There’s also no release date yet, but there’s a chance it might be fast-tracked for release in 2018 or 2019 (this story about WB wanting to release a surprise movie in 2018 predates knowledge of any plans for a Batgirl movie).Fresh Developments1. DISNEY HOPES BEYONCE WILL VOICE NALA IN THE LION KINGJust last month, Walt Disney Pictures and director Jon Favreau (Iron Man, The Jungle Book) went big with their first casting news for the live-action Lion King remake, revealing both that Donald Glover (TV’s Community, and the new Lando Calrissian) would voice Simba, and that James Earl Jones would return to voice Simba’s father, Mufasa. There are, however, a lot of characters in The Lion King (just like The Jungle Book), and&nbsp;this week, we learned that the singer/actress that Disney hopes to recruit to voice Nala (aka Simba’s future wife) is pop superstar (and sometimes actress) Beyonce. It’s worth noting that Nala doesn’t have any solo songs in The Lion King, so it’s not unreasonable to speculate that — in addition to her being, you know, Beyonce — part of the allure for Disney is the possibility that she&nbsp;might contribute a new, original song for the film. There is no official release date yet, but June 15, 2019 will be the film’s 25th anniversary.2. SCREENWRITER AARON SORKIN WANTS TO DO A COMIC BOOK MOVIEWe now live in what many call a second golden age of television, but we should also remember the TV creators who excelled before all of this changed, like Aaron Sorkin, who won an Oscar for The Social Network&nbsp;but is probably best remembered&nbsp;for the (arguably prophetic) NBC drama The West Wing. Sorkin’s trademark writing style is characterized by mile-a-minute, rapid-fire dialogue, often with a large ensemble cast, and topical subjects like sports, politics, and social media. He’s probably not, in other words, the first person you’d call&nbsp;to write a comic book movie (and especially not a “superhero” movie). That’s all about to change, because the news broke this week (via a video interview at ComicBook.com) that Aaron Sorkin has upcoming meetings with Warner Bros (for their DC Comics properties) and with Marvel Studios about possible projects he can work on. That’s unfortunately all we know at this point, but the possibilities are definitely intriguing. Here’s Aaron Sorkin’s impressive Tomatometer record, which hasn’t produced a Rotten score since 1993’s Malice.3. NEW ANIMATED MOVIES FOR PHARRELL WILLIAMS&nbsp;AND ELTON JOHNPhotos: Kevork Djansezian, Frederick M. Brown / Getty ImagesThis week at CinemaCon in Las Vegas, Fox Animation and STX Entertainment both announced new musical movies that both involve famous figures from the world of pop music. First off, the Fox’s project, called Atlantis, will be&nbsp;based on Pharrell Williams’ childhood growing up in Virginia Beach, although what that means exactly is not known. Williams will be producing,&nbsp;but it’s not clear&nbsp;how much music (if any) he’ll contribute to the film.&nbsp;Atlantis is being written by screenwriter Martin Hynes, who is also working on Toy Story 4&nbsp;and Universal’s reboot of Curious George. The project that STX Entertainment announced is an animated adaptation of the Andrew Lloyd Webber musical Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat, based on the Biblical character. Elton John’s Rocket Pictures is producing this new movie, which will feature new songs written Tim Rice and Andrew Lloyd Webber, as well as songs from the original stage musical. Donny Osmond previously starred in a 1999 direct-to-video version of the musical.4. LIAM NEESON JOINS LIST OF FAMOUS ACTORS TO PLAY MARLOWE ON THE BIG SCREENIf you’re a fan of film noir, Raymond Chandler’s detective character Phillip Marlowe is something of a big deal, appearing&nbsp;in such classics as Murder, My Sweet, Humphrey Bogart’s The Big Sleep, and Robert Montgomery’s Lady in the Lake. Elliott Gould played the character in Robert Altman’s The Long Goodbye, and Robert Mitchum twice took on the role, in 1975’s Farewell My Lovely&nbsp;and in 1978’s The Big Sleep. Soon, we’ll be able to add Liam Neeson to that esteemed list of Marlowe actors, as Neeson is attached to star in a film called simply Marlowe, based on a screenplay by William Monahan, who won an Academy Award for Martin Scorsese’s The Departed.&nbsp;Marlowe will be an adaptation of the novel&nbsp;The Black-Eyed Blonde, which was actually written by Benjamin Black (and not Marlowe’s creator Raymond Chandler).5. MARK WAHLBERG TO START NEW ACTION FRANCHISE AT MILE 22In addition to the news about Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat, STX Entertainment had another big announcement at CinemaCon this week in Las Vegas. Mark Wahlberg and director Peter Berg (Patriots Day, Deepwater Horizon) are reuniting&nbsp;for a new action franchise that will start with a film called Mile 22., which was originally announced in 2015 with UFC fighter Ronda Rousey also attached to star alongside Wahlberg.&nbsp;Mile 22 is about “a CIA agent stationed in Indonesia who has to transport an informant from a city to a getaway plane at an airport 22 miles away.” Wahlberg is also now in talks with director Ridley Scott to costar in All the Money in the World, a fact-based movie about the 1970s kidnapping of millionaire heir John Paul Getty III. Kevin Spacey and Michelle Williams (stepping in to replace Natalie Portman) are also in talks for roles in that film.6. JOSEPH GORDON-LEVITT TO DIRECT CHANNING TATUM IN R-RATED MUSICAL WINGMENWe try not to repeat stories too often here in the Weekly Ketchup, but when enough “new news” comes out about a given film, it makes sense to revisit it. Last year, we reported on an R-rated Universal Pictures musical&nbsp;about a pair of pilots&nbsp;that Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Channing Tatum would be co-starring in together. Well, now we know&nbsp;the musical is called Wingmen, and Gordon-Levitt, who made his directorial debut with 2013’s Don Jon, is officially&nbsp;in talks to direct it&nbsp;as well. For the rest of what we know about Wingmen, here’s what we already knew&nbsp;last year: Wingmen&nbsp;will be produced by Marc Platt, whose credits also include Ricki and the Flash, the long-in-development Wicked movie, and La La Land. The premise is not yet known, except that it involves a pair of pilots who go off on an adventure, and it’s&nbsp;being written by screenwriter Michael Bacall, who previously worked with Tatum on the two 21 Jump Street movies (Bacall also cowrote Scott Pilgrim vs the World with Edgar Wright). We should also report that Channing Tatum was in the news this again week for producing a comic book adapation called Zombie Brother.ROTTEN IDEAS OF THE WEEK3. EVEN SNAKE PLISSKEN CAN’T ESCAPE FROM THE PLANS TO REMAKE ESCAPE FROM NEW YORKWhen you’ve been covering film development news for nearly 20 years like this writer has, there are just certain projects you get bone tired of writing about. It’s a combination&nbsp;of how long it takes some movies to get made, the persistence with which producers chase these projects, and, in many cases, the fact that some movies weren’t particularly interesting the first time you heard about them, much less the 10th or the 15th. One example&nbsp;is the remake (strike one!) of the 1981 John Carpenter classic (strike two!) of the Kurt Russell classic (strike three!), Escape from New York.&nbsp;20th Century Fox still wants to remake&nbsp;the cult favorite, and the studio has started negotiations with Robert Rodriguez (Spy Kids, Desperado, Sin City) to direct.&nbsp;There is no word yet about who might play&nbsp;Snake Plissken or any of the supporting roles in the original film (if Luther creator Neil Cross’ screenplay even includes them). Some fans have speculated that the remake could distinguish itself by gender-swapping its Snake Plissken. (Anyone care to see what Emily Blunt might look like wearing an eyepatch and black halter top?)2.&nbsp;WARNER BROS WANTS JORDAN PEELE TO DIRECT THEIR AKIRA REMAKE?&nbsp;GET OUT!Photo: Frazer Harrison / Getty ImagesIn the tradition of famous memorandum composers like David O. Selznick and Darryl F. Zanuck, we’d like to pen one of our own here, and we’ll make it short. Make it out to Warner Bros, with a cc to Paramount and a bcc to every other major Hollywood studio. “Please stop trying to make live-action adaptations&nbsp;of anime and manga classics. Sincerely, GDS, RT, and your audience in general, at large.” As this column goes live today, Paramount opens&nbsp;their live action remake of Ghost in the Shell, and it’s not doing so well., but Warner Bros also attracted headlines with their very-long-in-development adaptation of the anime and manga classic Akira. The beloved 1988 film&nbsp;turns 30 next year, and apparently Warner Bros is looking to capitalize on that. The studio has been through several potential directors already, including Albert Hughes (The Book of Eli, Dead Presidents), Daniel Espinosa (last week’s Life), Justin Lin (Star Trek Beyond), and others, but&nbsp;according to&nbsp;discussions heard (or overheard) at CinemaCon this week, WB is now “moving aggressively to lock on” director Jordan Peele, who is hot off the success of his directorial debut,&nbsp;the racially charged surprise hit horror/thriller Get Out. Get Out&nbsp;is currently the best-reviewed film of the year so far, so this isn’t a “Rotten Idea” for anything to do with Jordan Peele; rather, it&nbsp;has so much more to do with trying to make live-action manga or anime adaptations happen. Not everything needs to be a movie, and some, like Akira, already are great movies. (And heck, you can even watch it right now on Hulu!)1. NETFLIX SAYS, “CRITICS, SHMITICS! GIVE US MORE ADAM SANDLER!”According to a new report from&nbsp;Variety, Netflix’s latest Marvel series, Iron Fist, attracted more eyeballs during its premiere weekend than Luke Cage,&nbsp;Season 2 of&nbsp;Daredevil, and yes, even Stranger Things, despite the critical drubbing it received. It would&nbsp;appear, then, that the streaming site’s original series sometimes mirror the box office successes of big blockbuster movies&nbsp;that earn abysmal&nbsp;reviews&nbsp;but&nbsp;do very, very well with audiences. Adam Sandler, who is currently halfway through an (initial) four movie deal with Netflix, is similarly considered “critic-proof.” Last year, after his first Netflix film The Ridiculous 6&nbsp;was released, news broke that more people had watched the western comedy — which earned the rare 0 percent on RT —&nbsp;in its first 30 days than any other movie on Netflix ever. Accordingly, Netflix revealed late last week that they have signed the SNL alum for another four movies (for a total of eight). Within a few years, we will have more Adam Sandler movies made for Netflix than there are Peter Jackson movies based on J.R.R. Tolkien books. In closing, we leave you with Adam Sandler’s Tomatometer.&nbsp;His&nbsp;third film with Netflix, Sandy Wexler, premieres on April 14th.","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"Walt, TBS, Star, TV, Fox, Paramount, The, television","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/31191000/Joss-Whedon-Batgirl-Ketchup.jpg","slug":"joss-whedon-joins-dc-for-a-batgirl-movie-and-more-news"},{"id":"47509185853786","title":"The 12 Freshest Movie News Developments of 2017","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})The 12 Freshest Movie News Developments of 2017We look back at the most exciting news stories of the year, from January to December.by Greg Dean Schmitz | December 22, 2017 |  CommentsWhen we get to this time of the year, there’s really not much in the realm of “movie development news” to discuss. So, this week and next, we’re going to review 12 of the year’s top stories instead, presented to you in monthly chronology. The year-in-review begins with the “Fresh Developments” which here also serve (mostly) as the “Top Stories” of the year.&nbsp; Our retrospective begins with what may also be the biggest movie news story of&nbsp;the entire decade.TOP STORY OF THE YEARMARVEL CINEMATIC UNIVERSE TO UNITE WITH X-MEN, DEADPOOL, FANTASTIC FOUR, MORE(Photo by 20th Century Fox Film Corp.)Although there are definitely many reasons to argue about whether it was the “Freshest” news of the year, the confirmation this month that Walt Disney Pictures had acquired the 20th Century Fox’s TV and film properties was definitely the biggest story of the year. The Marvel Cinematic Universe as we now know it (The Avengers, Guardians of the Galaxy, etc.) only dates back to the 2008 release of Iron Man, but long before that, Marvel fans had been frustrated by the separation of Marvel movies between studios. X-Men, Daredevil, and Fantastic Four were at Fox; Spider-Man and Ghost Rider were at Sony; The Punisher was at Lionsgate; and Hulk was at Universal. Over time, most of those came back to Marvel Studios, but the Fox films were still separate. The newsfeed-dominating impact of Disney’s acquisition of Fox has been the seemingly final step in allowing for a true representation of the “Marvel Universe” in the movies (and presumably TV too).There&nbsp;had been speculation&nbsp;that the&nbsp;Fantastic Four&nbsp;rights might be held up by Constantin Film (the company behind Roger Corman’s&nbsp;original 1994&nbsp;Fantastic Four), but Disney CEO Bob Iger&nbsp;has confirmedthat the&nbsp;Fantastic Four&nbsp;indeed&nbsp;now belongs to Disney&nbsp;as well. Likewise,&nbsp;Iger has clarified&nbsp;that&nbsp;Deadpoolcan stay R-rated,&nbsp;even as a Disney property. And these points are just the tip of the iceberg about&nbsp;what this deal means for Marvel fans&nbsp;and&nbsp;movie fans in general.Other Fresh DevelopmentsJANUARY: DIRECTOR OF ARRIVAL AND BLADE RUNNER 2049 TO RETURN US TO DUNE(Photo by Universal courtesy Everett Collection)In October, director Denis Villeneuve (Sicario, Arrival) delivered his first film with a $100+ million budget, the sequel Blade Runner 2049 (Certified Fresh at 87%). Much like the first film, which didn’t break $32 million in 1982, the sequel was a domestic box office disappointment, earning just $91 million (and $258 million worldwide). For his next ambitious sci-fi movie, Denis Villeneuve will again be revisiting an early 1980s movie that made less than $33 million, except it will be a complete remake, not a sequel. The news broke in late December, 2016 (which we’re including here because of the Ketchup’s winter break) that Denis Villeneuve signed to direct a remake of Dune, based on the first in author Frank Herbert’s acclaimed series, originally directed by David Lynch in 1984. It’s a bit much to encapsulate in just one sentence, but the gist of Dune is that it’s a sprawling space opera revolving around the planet Arrakis, which is the source of a drug called the spice melange, which is integral in space travel (and also for tapping into cosmic awareness and such).FEBRUARY: BEYONCE, DONALD GLOVER, CHIWETEL EJIOFOR, AND MORE TO VOICE 2019’S THE LION KING(Photo by New Line Cinema)We may never get a full feature film of Dwayne Johnson playing the live-action Bambi, but in 2019, we will get a photorealistic CGI remake of The Lion King (7/19/19), directed directed by Jon Favreau (The Jungle Book, Iron Man). In February, a year’s worth of casting announcements began with the news that James Earl Jones will reprise his role as Lion King #1 (Mufasa), and Donald Glover will voice Lion King #2 (Simba).&nbsp;That was followed by Billy Eichner and Seth Rogen voicing Timon and Pumbaa, John Oliver&nbsp;as Zazu the bird, and Chiwetel Ejiofor (Doctor Strange) playing the villain Scar (originally voiced by Jeremy Irons).&nbsp; In August, we learned that Alfre Woodard would voice Sarabi the lion, Mufasa’s wife and Simba’s mother. Through all of that, there was talk that Beyonce was Disney’s first choice to play Nala, and in November,&nbsp;she was indeed confirmed, along with the rest of the voice cast.MARCH: POWER TRIO SPIELBERG, HANKS, AND STREEP UNITE FOR THE POST(Photo by Jaap Buitendijk/Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures, MGM)Some movies take years of development and production, but a rare few&nbsp;are announced, produced, and released all in the same calendar year. Steven Spielberg benefits from maintaining a constant development slate, so that he can switch gears at quick notice. Following the results of last year’s election, Spielberg and producer Amy Pascal moved fast to acquire the rights to the movie we now know as The Post, which incidentally opens in limited release today.&nbsp;The title (known for a while as&nbsp;The Papers) refers to the newspaper The Washington Post&nbsp;and its role in 1971 in exposing the public to “The Pentagon Papers,” the documents which revealed much about the U.S. government’s plans for involvement in the Vietnam War. Frequent Spielberg costar Tom Hanks signed on quickly, as did Meryl Streep, and they were then followed in June by Alison Brie (Community), David Cross (Arrested Development), Bob Odenkirk (Better Call Saul), Sarah Paulson (The People vs O.J. Simpson), Jesse Plemons (Breaking Bad), Michael Stuhlbarg (Boardwalk Empire), and Bradley Whitford (The West Wing).APRIL: THE LONG SEARCH FOR DEADPOOL‘S PARTNER CABLE ENDS: IT’S JOSH BROLIN(Photo by 20th Century Fox)The film development news cycle for much of 2016 and early 2017 was dominated by Fox’s search for an actor to play&nbsp;Deadpool‘s time-travelling partner Cable in next year’s sequel (6/1/18). Over that period, some of the names bandied about included Pierce Brosnan, Liam Neeson, Kyle Chandler (Friday Nights Light), Stephen Lang (Avatar), David Harbour (Stranger Things, before he was cast as the new Hellboy), and Michael Shannon (General Zod from Man of Steel). Well, all of that finally came to an end in April. As you probably know now, Cable will be played by Josh Brolin, who already has quite a career of starring in movies based on comic books, including playing Thanos for Marvel Studios (including next year’s Avengers: Infinity War), the young Tommy Lee Jones in Men in Black 3, DC Comics’ Jonah Hex, and appearing in the sequel Sin City: A Dame to Kill For. Brolin joins Ryan Reynolds as Deadpool (obviously), and the previously cast Zazie Beetz as fan favorite Domino.MAY: AVA DUVERNAY TO DIRECT RIHANNA/LUPITA NYONG’O FILM INSPIRED BY A TWITTER MEME(Photo by Pascal Le Segretain/Getty Images)There have obviously been movies and TV shows based on Internet pop culture before (The Emoji Movie, **** My Dad Says). In 2014, an image was posted to Tumblr of pop singer Rihanna and actress Lupita N’yongo at a Miu Miu fashion show. The Tumblr caption read, “They look like they’re in a heist movie with Rihanna as the tough-as-nails leader/master thief and Lupita as the genius computer hacker.”&nbsp; In May, that meme actually led to the news that&nbsp; director Ava DuVernay (Selma, A Wrinkle in Time) had signed a deal with Netflix to direct a film for the streaming service. As the original post speculated, Rihanna will play a master thief planning a heist, and Lupita Nyong’o will play a genius computer hacker. Nyong’o also made the news in September, along with Kristen Stewart, as possible choices for&nbsp;Sony’s reboot of the&nbsp;Charlie’s Angels franchise.JUNE: WONDER WOMAN QUICKLY LASSOS A SEQUEL FOR 2019(Photo by Warner Bros.)Following the surprising record breaking $103 million opening weekend of Wonder Woman, a series of stories hit the Internet about the sped-up plans for a sequel. Many of those early stories had to do with the negotiations and potential paycheck increases for Gal Gadot and her director Patty Jenkins. Later in the year, more Wonder Woman 2 stories continued, but they mostly involved the when instead of the&nbsp;who or what. In July, Warner Bros planted their Wonder Woman 2 flag on December 13, 2019, but that all changed after the release of Justice League (and its Rotten Tomatometer score). With Wonder Woman hailed as one of the latter film’s high points, Warner Bros. responded by bumping Wonder Woman 2 six weeks to November 1, 2019 (also moving farther away from Star Wars: Episode IX on 12/20/19). Hopefully, in 2018, we’ll learn more details, such as who the new villain in Wonder Woman 2 might be (Cheetah, perhaps?).JULY: QUENTIN TARANTINO’S AMBITIOUS PLANS FOR 1969 HOLLYWOOD AND… STAR TREK?(Photo by Weinstein Company)Director Quentin Tarantino (Pulp Fiction, Inglourious Basterds) has talked at length about his intentions to retire after just ten films. After talking in the past about his interest in possibly directing a “horror” film, the first thing we heard about #9 (working title) was that it would involve the 1969 Manson Family murders, scheduled for August 9, 2019 (the massacre’s 50th anniversary). (Though that was eventually clarified as just being the film’s background, as it will instead focus on a TV actor and his stuntman buddy trying to establish film careers). We still don’t know for sure who will costar in #9 (besides Samuel L. Jackson, of course), but Tarantino reportedly has talked to Brad Pitt, Leonardo DiCaprio and Tom Cruise, along with Margot Robbie (as Sharon Tate) and Jennifer Lawrence. You can track our coverage of the film from July 14, November 3, November 17, November 24, and December 1. And of course, there was also the crazy news just a week after that last report that Quentin Tarantino is also teaming up with producer J.J. Abrams about possibly directing a Star Trek movie.AUGUST: LUCASFILM OFFICIALLY DEVELOPING STAR WARS SPINOFF ABOUT OBI-WAN KENOBI(Photo by Lucasfilm)In early 2013, a few months after Disney acquired Lucasfilm, Disney CEO Bob Iger announced plans for Star Wars spinoff movies that eventually became last year’s Rogue One and next year’s Han Solo (5/25/18).&nbsp; In the years since, there have also been rumors about other spinoffs about characters like Boba Fett, Yoda, and Obi-Wan Kenobi. In August, reports came out that&nbsp; the Obi-Wan Kenobi spinoff&nbsp;was officially in development, with Academy Award nominated director Stephen Daldry (Billy Elliot, The Hours, and the upcoming Wicked movie)&nbsp;in talks for the job. Other details, like the premise, setting, or even casting, are still quite unknown. However, when asked in the past about the Obi-Wan spinoff, Ewan McGregor has said, “I’d very much like to do one too.”SEPTEMBER: J.J. ABRAMS TO RETURN TO DIRECT&nbsp;STAR WARS EPISODE IX(Photo by James Atoa/Everett Collection)In early September, Jurassic World director Colin Trevorrow departed the highly anticipated Star Wars Episode IX (12/20/19). This move quickly led to columns speculating about replacement directors from sources like indieWire, Observer, and Deadline. This could have gone on for months, but Lucasfilm quickly put an end to it all with the announcement that Star Wars: Episode IX (title likely to change) will be directed by J.J. Abrams, who directed Episode VII,&nbsp;The Force Awakens. With this move, Abrams became the first director other than George Lucas to direct more than one live action Star Wars movie. Of course, the editorials then shifted to whether J.J. Abrams directing Episode IX was the “right choice.”OCTOBER: THE WOLVERINE FRANCHISE TO BE CLONED BY LOGAN SPINOFF LAURA(Photo by Ben Rothstein/20th Century Fox Film Corp.)Marvel Comics&nbsp;has had pretty great success&nbsp;with the female Wolverine clone&nbsp;X-23, including two mini-series and two ongoing series. To movie fans, however, that same character, who debuted earlier this year in&nbsp;Logan, is known only as “Laura.”&nbsp;Logan&nbsp;was both a&nbsp;box office&nbsp;and a&nbsp;critical success, and its ending left room for a sequel focusing on Laura’s further adventures, so October’s news wasn’t really&nbsp;that&nbsp;surprising, especially given the&nbsp;warm reception&nbsp;fans and critics alike bestowed on Hugh Jackman’s 11-year-old co-star, Spanish-British actress Dafne Keen.&nbsp;Logan&nbsp;director James Mangold&nbsp;is now working&nbsp;with screenwriter Craig Kyle (who first created&nbsp;X-23&nbsp;for the&nbsp;X-Men: Evolution&nbsp;animated series) on a treatment for a spinoff movie that they’re calling&nbsp;Laura. 20th Century Fox is now planning on three&nbsp;X-Men&nbsp;movies a year, starting in 2018 with&nbsp;The New Mutants&nbsp;(4/13/18),&nbsp;Deadpool 2&nbsp;(6/1/18), and&nbsp;X-Men: Dark Phoenix&nbsp;(11/2/18).NOVEMBER: NEW STAR WARS TRILOGY COMING FROM STAR WARS: THE LAST JEDI DIRECTOR(Photo by Walt Disney Studios)It was just last week that Lucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy teased the post-Episode IX&nbsp;future of the&nbsp;Star Wars&nbsp;franchise&nbsp;(with spoilers). Possibly aware that these sorts of secrets stay secret only very briefly in today’s social media world,&nbsp;StarWars.com&nbsp;made a&nbsp;huge announcement this week. The revelation involves director&nbsp;Rian Johnson&nbsp;(Looper,&nbsp;Brick,&nbsp;The Brothers Bloom), whose first Star Wars movie was last week’s Star Wars: The Last Jedi (Certified Fresh at 92%). An emphasis should be put on&nbsp;first, because the big news is that Johnson is&nbsp;creating a new&nbsp;Star Wars&nbsp;trilogy&nbsp;which will launch after J.J. Abrams’&nbsp;Star Wars: Episode IX&nbsp;(12/20/19). Rian Johnson will write and produce this new trilogy and direct the first entry.&nbsp;The new trilogy is still mostly&nbsp;shrouded in mystery, except that, “separate from the episodic Skywalker saga, Johnson will introduce new characters from a corner of the galaxy that&nbsp;Star Wars&nbsp;lore has never before explored.”","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"IFC, Comedy, jurassic, Opinion, Countdown, Network, films, green, Television, song, Awards, live, Starz, 2018","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/22183506/Deadpool-Fox-Marvel-Ketchup.jpg","slug":"the-12-freshest-movie-news-developments-of-2017"},{"id":"47509190252943","title":"The 12 Freshest Hollywood Headlines of 2016","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})The 12 Freshest Hollywood Headlines of 2016We look back at the most exciting stories of the year, from January to December.by Greg Dean Schmitz | December 23, 2016 |  CommentsFew industries enjoy taking really, really, really long extended holiday vacations quite like Hollywood. So when we get to this time of the year, there’s really not much in the realm of “movie development news” to discuss. This is especially true in a weekly column which normally includes 10 different stories. So instead, this week and next, we’re going to review 12 of the year’s top stories, presented to you in monthly chronology. The year-in-review begins with the “Fresh Developments” which here also serve (mostly) as the “Top Stories” of the year. Our retrospective begins with (a few) of the year’s biggest stories, which were…Top Story Of the yearHAN AND LANDO IN THE MO-RNING: THE HAN SOLO PREQUEL GETS CASTWe’re only a week out from the opening of Rogue One: A Star Wars Story, and already we can look back and see that 2016 was dominated by news of the next such Star Wars&nbsp;anthology film. That movie will be a prequel about the young Han Solo, and it will be directed by the team of Phil Lord and Chris Miller, who are coming off a string of hits that included 21 Jump Street and The LEGO Movie. The film&nbsp;doesn’t have a title yet, but we’ll call it Han Solo: A Star Wars Story&nbsp;for the sake of consistency. Anyway, there were three major casting announcements for the movie this year. The most obvious one was Han Solo himself, and after much reportage about other candidates, we first heard in April that the frontrunner was Alden Ehrenreich, the breakout star from the Coen Bros’ Hail, Caesar!, and that rumor was confirmed two weeks later. The next major role to be cast also came to us in two stages, and it concerned “worst best friend” Lando Calrissian. We first heard in August&nbsp;that Community star Donald Glover was the top contender, and Glover was indeed officially confirmed two months later. The issue of the film’s female lead was also percolating during that time, when the character was speculated to be Sana Starros, the woman from recent Star Wars comics who claimed to be Han Solo’s first wife. In October, three actresses (among others) were reported to have tested for the role: Zoe Kravitz (X-Men: First Class), Naomi Scott (Power Rangers), and Tessa Thompson (Creed). A month later, we learned that the actress that actually landed what is presumably something of a big deal was Emilia Clarke, AKA Daenerys Targaryen from HBO’s Game of Thrones. Walt Disney Pictures and Lucasfilm have scheduled the Han Solo prequel for May 25, 2018, which also happens to be the 35th anniversary of the release of Return of the Jedi (5/25/83).JANUARY: CHRISTOPHER NOLAN TO NEXT DIRECT WORLD WAR II EPIC DUNKIRKIf you’re a fan of director Christopher Nolan, you’ve probably already seen one of the trailers&nbsp;for next summer’s Dunkirk, but just a year ago, we didn’t even know that movie existed yet. In early January, most of the news either involved Star Wars: The Force Awakens&nbsp;or the obligatory annual wrap-up pieces.&nbsp;That left a big hole for someone of an appropriate stature to make an announcement that would ensure people would be talking about it. This year, that acclaimed personage was director Christopher Nolan, whose future had been a big question mark following the late 2014 release of Interstellar. Warner Bros had already announced a July 21, 2017 release date for Nolan’s next film, but on December 28th of 2015, news of the project finally started to break. Christopher Nolan’s next film as director was to be called Dunkirk, and it would be a World War II action adventure movie about the 1940 Battle of Dunkirk, during which British, Belgian, and French forces attempted to rescue and evacuate over 300,000 troops who were surrounded by German forces in the French city of Dunkirk. We now know the cast includes&nbsp;Cillian Murphy, Tom Hardy (The Dark Knight Rises), Kenneth Branagh, Mark Rylance, and One Direction alumnus Harry Styles, with composer Hans Zimmer handling the soundtrack. Dunkirk&nbsp;is scheduled to hit theaters on July 21, 2017 (up against the comedy Girl Trip and Luc Besson’s Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets).FEBRUARY:&nbsp;SURPRISE SUCCESS OF DEADPOOL SPAWNS SEQUENTIAL SEQUEL STORIESOn February 12th, Deadpool had been in theatrical release for less than 24 hours, but box office reports were already coming in indicating that the R-rated superhero movie was breaking records.&nbsp;Deadpool was also a critical success, with a Certified Fresh score of 84 percent. All of that added up to validation for star Ryan Reynolds and screenwriters/producers Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick, who have been championing exactly this sort of Deadpool movie for over ten years now. To their credit, 20th Century Fox quickly set all three to work on a sequel, which would&nbsp;involve the character Cable (that is, if you stayed for the Ferris Bueller homage after the credits). Cable is also the frequent leader of the X-Force team, and Reynolds had already talked about his interest in seeing Deadpool being joined by X-Force on the big screen. Some of the other X-Force members who have yet to appear prominently in movies include Cannonball, Domino, Meltdown/Boom-Boom, Shatterstar, Wolfsbane, and X-23. And indeed, in October, we began hearing about possible actresses to play Domino in the Deadpool sequel, including Lizzy Caplan and Mary Elizabeth Winstead. Soon after, the surprising news broke that Deadpool director Tim Miller had dropped out of directing the sequel (Miller eventually signed on to direct the Sonic the Hedgehog movie instead). The Deadpool sequel will instead be directed by David Leitch, one half of the team behind John Wick. As for X-Force, we eventually learned that the full team will debut in the third Deadpool movie, not the second.MARCH:&nbsp;HARRISON FORD TO RETURN AS SPIELBERG’S INDIANA JONES IN 2019When the news broke in 2014 that Harrison Ford had broken his leg while filming his role as Han Solo in Star Wars: The Force Awakens, it seemed reasonable to assume he might choose not to commit to that sort of action role again. In March, however, we learned that the actor would indeed be returning as the iconic character who is arguably Ford’s most action-driven. Lucasfilm and Walt Disney Pictures announced a July 19, 2019 release date for the fifth Indiana Jones movie, to be directed once again by Steven Spielberg. This will likely be Spielberg’s third upcoming film, after Ready Player One (3/30/18) and The Kidnapping of Edgardo Mortara (date TBA). That release date also coincidentally happens to be just 6 days after what will be Harrison Ford’s 77th birthday, on July 13, 2019. We don’t know yet what form the fifth Indiana Jones movie will take, although based on Ford’s age and Indiana Jones’ fictional birth year (1899), the movie could be set during the “disco age” of the 1970s. We also learned in March that this fifth Indiana Jones will once again be written by David Koepp, who infamously gave the world the scene where Indy avoids a nuclear blast by hiding in a refrigerator (real life spoiler: that wouldn’t work). In the past, Indiana Jones has had adventures involving the Ark of the Covenant, a death cult, the Holy Grail, and aliens. What do you think is next for Indy?MAY: MARVEL IS NOW “COMMITTING” TO A SOLO BLACK WIDOW MOVIEIn the comics, Black Widow was actually the 15th member to join The Avengers (in between #14 Black Knight and #16 Mantis), but the Marvel Cinematic Universe is quite different&nbsp;from the comics. After a successful debut in Iron Man 2, Scarlett Johansson’s Black Widow was one of the original team members when The Avengers premiered in 2012, right up there with Captain America, Iron Man, Thor, and the Incredible Hulk. (In the comics, the female co-founder of the Avengers was the Wasp; indeed, she was the character who gave the team its name.) Johansson has now appeared in five Marvel movies as the character, but she had yet to receive&nbsp;her own solo movie. In May of this year, however, during the&nbsp;Captain America: Civil War&nbsp;press tour, there were two interesting quotes that suggested the Black Widow movie was finally closer to happening. Marvel Studios currently has nine movies scheduled from now until the end of 2019, but&nbsp;what’s in the works for 2020 and beyond? Presented with that question, Marvel Studios president Kevin Feige&nbsp;came right out and said what many fans have been asking for. Responding to a list that included Falcon, Hawkeye, and War Machine, Feige said, “Of the characters that you’ve just mentioned, I would say certainly the one creatively and emotionally that we are most committing to doing is Black Widow.” Feige also clarified that discussions were “ongoing,” so Marvel was not yet ready to confirm Black Widow, but… they’re working on it. (The other big female Marvel Studios news this year was the casting of Brie Larson as Captain Marvel in June.)JUNE:&nbsp;DANIEL DAY-LEWIS REUNITES WITH P.T. ANDERSON FOR 1950S FASHION MOVIEThe seven narrative feature films directed by Paul Thomas Anderson have given us several memorable scenes (including monologues from Boogie Nights and Magnolia), but the most iconic might be from his 2007 oil prospecting drama There Will Be Blood. Even those who haven’t seen the film might know “I drink your milkshake!” or remember this Saturday Night Live sketch. There Will Be Blood was also noteworthy because it was one of only three movies Daniel Day-Lewis has starred in over the last ten years (along with Nine and Lincoln). For his first film since Lincoln in 2012, Daniel Day-Lewis will be reuniting with director Paul Thomas Anderson, starring in a (currently still untitled) drama set in the fashion industry of New York City in the 1950s. There were a lot of changes in fashion during that time, but other than than the setting of New York City, no mention has been made about specific fashion trends.JULY:&nbsp;OSCAR ISAAC JOINS SPIELBERG’S THE KIDNAPPING OF EDGARDO MONTARAMost of the attention on future Steven Spielberg movies has this year been focused on his adaptation of Ready Player One. However, Spielberg rarely works on just one movie at any given time, and right now, in addition to the Indiana Jones sequel mentioned above, he’s got another adaptation in the works: the&nbsp;bestselling non-fiction book The Kidnapping of Edgardo Mortara by David Kertzer.&nbsp;That book relays the true story of Edgardo Mortara, a Jewish child born in Italy who, after being seized by the Catholic Church in the mid-19th century, converted to Catholicism and became a priest. The central figure on the church side of the controversy will be Pope Pius IX, who will be played by Mark Rylance, marking his fourth Spielberg film in a row (after Bridge of Spies, The BFG, and Ready Player One). Oscar Isaac (Star Wars: The Force Awakens, Inside Llewyn Davis, Ex Machina) joined the cast back in July, but it’s still unknown (for sure) what role he’ll be playing.&nbsp;However, since he’s referred to by some sources as “the lead,” the obvious answer would be Edgardo Mortara himself.&nbsp;The Kidnapping of Edgardo Mortara is expected to start filming in early 2017, while&nbsp;Ready Player One is scheduled for release on March 30, 2018, so the earliest possible release window for the former is probably late 2018, AKA “awards season.”AUGUST:&nbsp;THE WORLD WAR Z SEQUEL MIGHT BE A FIGHT CLUB REUNION PROJECTIf you follow film development news regularly, you’re probably used to this old familiar ditty: a troubled production gets dragged through the Internet wringer for months, and then it’s released, and it’s both ravaged by critics and ignored by audiences (Fantastic Four, for example). Every once in a (long) while, however, a movie will buck expectations and do&nbsp;well on both fronts. The 2013 zombie apocalypse thriller World War Z is a prime example, performing much better than pre-release predictions suggested.&nbsp;Paramount quickly started development on a sequel, but quite similar to the struggles of the first film, things have not gone smoothly. Paramount had penciled in a release date of June 9, 2017 (up against Tom Cruise’s reboot of The Mummy), but earlier this year, director J.A. Bayona (The Impossible, The Orphanage) dropped out of directing,&nbsp;and the June date was ditched in the process. In addition to starring in the World War Z movies, Brad Pitt also produces them, and in August, we learned that the director that Pitt wanted to recruit for the sequel was David Fincher, the acclaimed director of films like Zodiac, Gone Girl, and The Social Network who has previously worked with Pitt on three movies:&nbsp;Seven, Fight Club, and The Curious Case of Benjamin Button. Fincher is also currently looking for his next project, after failing&nbsp;to get a remake of Jules Verne’s 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea off the ground. As of now, we still have not heard for sure that Fincher will be directing the World War Z sequel, but we also haven’t heard of anyone else landing the job, so keep your fingers crossed.SEPTEMBER:&nbsp;DISNEY TO REMAKE THE LION KING&nbsp;Ever since it became pretty obvious that Walt Disney Pictures was dedicated to remaking most of their back catalog (before say, 1996), there have been a few very obvious “big titles” that remained unannounced or unconfirmed. We’re at the point now where it’s far easier to list films that Disney is not yet developing remakes of than to specifically list them all. The most popular such film (certainly in box office, being the highest-grossing hand-drawn animated film of all time) is 1994’s The Lion King. One obvious difficulty in developing a “live action” remake of The Lion King&nbsp;would be the question of whether a film entirely about animals could make that transition. Earlier this year, though, Disney’s remake of The Jungle Book seemed to answer that question, as it remains in the top 5 box office hits of the year to date. Jon Favreau (Iron Man) directed The Jungle Book for Disney, and in Septmeber we learned that the studio has enlisted Favreau to direct their remake of The Lion King as well. Many sources are using the phrase “live action” about this film, but as this article points out, that’s highly unlikely.&nbsp;Instead, as with The Jungle Book, the animal characters will be CGI characters (albeit, very well animated), especially considering&nbsp;The Lion King&nbsp;has no human characters (like Mowgli). Jon Favreau and Walt Disney Pictures are also working on a sequel to The Jungle Book, but there is not yet a release date for that film (or The Lion King, for that matter).OCTOBER:&nbsp;THE COEN BROTHERS WILL WRITE INTERNET TRUE STORY DARK WEBMost of us never see both, but there are actually two (or arguably, multiple) Internets: one is the widely public Internet, and then there are the networks known as “Darknets,” which are mostly used by criminals or other nefarious forces (terrorists, racist groups, hackers, etc). One such network was the&nbsp;Silk Road, a platform for the sale of illegal drugs. If all of this sounds like great material for an intriguing movie, you’re not alone:&nbsp;renowned screenwriters and directors Joel and Ethan Coen (Fargo, The Big Lebowski, Hail, Caesar!) have signed on with 20th Century Fox to adapt the true story of the Silk Road black market network. The film will be called&nbsp;Dark Web, and it will be based on the two part story in Wired which you can read right here. It’s not known at this point whether the Coens will also direct&nbsp;Dark Web (they don’t always, as they did not direct Bridge of Spies, Unbroken, or the upcoming Suburbicon).NOVEMBER:&nbsp;JOHNNY DEPP (ALSO) KNOWS WHERE TO FIND FANTASTIC BEASTSJohnny Depp is known for many types of films, but if there’s one general theme to Depp’s oeuvre, it’s that he specializes in playing wacky characters in movies with at least some separation from reality.&nbsp;In early November, with the release of Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them just two weeks away, we first discovered that Depp had a small role in that film, and would have a lead role in the next one as well (release date: 11/16/18). Although Johnny Depp will “star” in Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them 2 (or whatever it ends up being called), that doesn’t mean that he will be completely replacing Eddie Redmayne, who will be reprising his role as Newt Scamander. Director David Yates (who also directed the last four Harry Potter movies) will also be returning for the second movie (and possibly all four sequels, stretching out until 2022). Of course, everyone who saw the first movie now knows that Johnny Depp’s role is Gellert Grindlewald, who looks to have probably the second most significant role (so far) in this new spinoff franchise. On a related note, while&nbsp;the sexuality of Professor Albus Dumbledore was never explicitly addressed, anyone who was following the Harry Potter franchise while those movies were being made probably heard J.K. Rowling state in 2007, “Dumbledore is gay.” Specifically, Rowling said that Dumbledore fell in love with his rival wizard, Gellert Grindlewald (AKA Depp’s Fantastic Beasts&nbsp;character). We mention all of this because last month, J.K. Rowling seemed to hint that the younger Dumbledore might be more openly gay than any character we’ve seen in the Harry Potter movies. That statement came a few days after it was reported that casting is currently underway for the young Albus Dumbledore, to appear in the second Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, which will be released on November 16, 2018.DECEMBER: GOOSEBUMPS DIRECTOR TO HELP DETECTIVE PIKACHU INVESTIGATE… POKEMON GO‘S IMPLOSION?&nbsp;The funny thing about Hollywood studios basing their development decisions on pop culture phenomena is that sometimes, these events turn out to be relatively short-lived. In July of this year, it seemed like Pokemon Go would stand the test of time, but that was before Niantic and Nintendo failed to keep the momentum going (by, say, making the game about more than just catching Pokemon). But at San Diego Comic-Con in July, Pokemon Go was still very much the big, big thing. While DC and Marvel both had big panels this year, neither made any big announcements, and Legendary Entertainment — the company behind Christopher Nolan’s Dark Knight trilogy,&nbsp;Godzilla, and&nbsp;Warcraft —&nbsp;jumped at the opportunity to make one of their own. After&nbsp;Warcraft tanked,&nbsp;Legendary was on the hunt for another video game franchise, and they found it just as Pokemon Go&nbsp;was gripping the world. Legendary announced that they are partnering with The Pokémon Company to produce the first-ever live action Pokemon movie, an adaptation of the character Detective Pikachu. Rather than focusing on Ash, Team Rocket, or other Pokemon hunters, this movie will adapt the eponymous 2016 Nintendo 3DS game about a Pikachu who dons a Sherlock Holmes-style deerstalker cap, carries a magnifying glass, and solves mysteries, like a little yellow Encyclopedia Brown. Although they’re calling this movie “live action,” Detective Pikachu will almost certainly be a CGI character. Legendary Entertainment is putting Detective Pikachu on the fast track, aiming to start filming in 2017. To that end, earlier this month, Legendary hired director Rob Letterman to work on the film. Although he hit a speed bump with the Jack Black comedy Gulliver’s Travels in 2010, reteaming with Black again last year for Goosebumps led to something of a surprise success. The Detective Pikachu screenplay is being worked on by Alex Hirsch (TV’s Gravity Falls) and Nicole Perlman (Guardians of the Galaxy).","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"TBS, Amazon, space, story, movies, satire","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/23181420/Deadpool-Wants-Your-Love.jpg","slug":"the-12-freshest-hollywood-headlines-of-2016"},{"id":"47509194735040","title":"Disney Reschedules Star Wars to Rule the December Box Office Forever, and More Movie News","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Disney Reschedules Star Wars to Rule the December Box Office Forever, and More Movie NewsJennifer Lawrence scores another juicy role, QT may have his next project, Tyler Perry stays busy, and He-Man may live again.by Greg Dean Schmitz | January 22, 2016 |  CommentsThis week’s Ketchup brings you another ten headlines from the world of film development news (those stories about what movies Hollywood is working on for you next). Included in the mix this time around are stories about such titles as Boo! A Madea Halloween, Masters of the Universe, xXx: The Return of Xander Cage, and Star Wars Episode VIII (title pending).This Week’s Top StoryWILL STAR WARS NOW OWN THE DECEMBER BOX OFFICE IN PERPETUITY?One of the biggest stories in box office news this year, and in the past several years, has been about how Star Wars: The Force Awakens (12/18/15) was able to topple so many box office records despite leaving the May release date target that the franchise had previously called home. Until this week, it had been expected that Star Wars Episode VIII would return to that traditional target, on May 26, 2017. Instead, following this year’s release of Rogue One: A Star Wars Story (12/16/16), Star Wars Episode VIII has now been moved back seven months to December 15, 2017.&nbsp; The effect is that there are now Star Wars movies scheduled for three Decembers in a row, and if they all prove successful, Walt Disney Pictures and Lucasfilm will probably keep claiming December in perpetuity. This huge change on the release date calendar for 2017 has had several reactions (or reactions to other reactions, etc). For one thing, 20th Century Fox confirmed this week that James Cameron’s Avatar sequel, which had been loosely speculated to be aiming for late 2017, won’t make that year after all. This isn’t the first time Avatar 2 has been delayed from a loose target, as at one time there was talk of Avatar 2 coming out in late… 2014 (yes, over a year ago!). To take the place of Star Wars Episode VIII no longer being a May, 2017 film, the studio has now announced&nbsp;that Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales will instead be released on May 25, 2017. In other release date news, we also learned this week that Paramount Pictures has withdrawn the tentative sequel to Terminator: Genisys from their calendar altogether. Instead, the film that Paramount will release on May 19, 2017 will be their movie version of Baywatch, starring Dwayne Johnson and Zac Efron. Universal Pictures also made the news this week by confirming that their modern day remake of The Mummy (starring Tom Cruise and Kingsman: The Secret Service costar Sofia Boutella&nbsp;as the title monster) is now scheduled for June 9, 2017. As for Star Wars Episode VIII and its newly direct competition, the question is still out there as to whether Warner Bros will move Steven Spielberg’s Ready Player One away from its current release date of December 15, 2017.Fresh Developments This Week1. JENNIFER LAWRENCE TO SEDUCE FIDEL CASTRO AS MARITA(Photo by Frazer Harrison / Getty Images)&nbsp;As one of Hollywood’s most sought after actresses (or the most sought after, period), Jennifer Lawrence continues to develop a large number of films in development for production over the next few years. Lawrence’s most imminent films includes this summer’s X-Men: Apocalypse, the science fiction romance Passengers (opposite Chris Pratt), a drama with director Darren Aronofsky, and It’s What I Do, a war photographer biopic for director Steven Spielberg. Following the acclaim for her role in the Miracle Mop inventor biopic Joy, Lawrence has now lined up another true story film, as she is now attached to star in Sony Pictures’ Cold War romance/thriller&nbsp;Marita, based on the life of German-born Marita Lorenz.&nbsp;In 1959, Marita Lorenz became involved in a romantic relationship with Cuban leader Fidel Castro, which led to her being recruited by the CIA to assassinate Castro in 1960. This also led later to Lorenz being involved with the investigations of the assassination of JFK and the allegations that the Cubans were involved with Lee Harvey Oswald.&nbsp;Marita has a lot of the elements that could make for another awards-season run for Jennifer Lawrence.&nbsp;Marita was written by screenwriter Eric Warren Singer, who cowrote American Hustle (costarring Lawrence), adapted from Marita Lorenz’s 1993 autobiography, Marita: One Woman’s Extraordinary Tale of Love and Espionage from Castro to Kennedy.2.&nbsp;WILL QUENTIN TARANTINO TRAVEL DOWN UNDER FOR ONE OF HIS NEXT/LAST FILMS?Much has been made about Quentin Tarantino’s intended goal of directing just ten feature films and then retiring (The Hateful Eight being his eighth completed film as a solo director). With just two potential films remaining if QT really commits to that, the interest is high in finding out what those last two films will be. Tarantino has talked about a lot of possibilities, including Kill Bill Vol 3, which would feature the grown up daughter of Vivica A. Fox’s character coming after The Bride for vengeance. This week, in a blog interview, Tarantino mentioned another possibility. After previously working on films set in Japan (Kill Bill) and Europe (Inglourious Basterds), Quentin Tarantino may now be considering working in the land of another setting that provided him with many of his “grindhouse” favorites back when he&nbsp;was a video store clerk. Specifically, Quentin Tarantino is talking up the idea of writing and directing a Bonnie &amp; Clyde-style crime story set in Australia in the 1930s. Although there have been some crime films set in Australia (such as the 1880s-set Ned Kelly, starring Heath Ledger), for the most part, that setting is unfamiliar to most fans of Hollywood films. Might that be a great reason for Quentin Tarantino to turn his attention to Australia and the 1930s next?3.&nbsp;TINA FEY AND RONDA ROUSEY ARE GOING TO TAKE ON ALL THOSE DO NOTHING BITCHESFollowing the (relative) box office success of Sisters, Tina Fey is now looking to work with another female athlete/actress whose career is very much of the moment and on the upswing. Fey and MMA fighter Ronda Rousey are both attached to star in a Universal Pictures comedy called Do Nothing Bitches. (That title, of course, might be changed.) Rousey will play a “no-nonsense instructor” at a work out camp for “wealthy pampered wives.” The inspiration for this comedy reportedly comes from this 42-second YouTube video where Ronda Rousey takes on the concept of Do Nothing Bitches (some of which contains NSFW slang — watch out!).&nbsp; Ronda Rousey’s slate is currently very packed with films in development and production, so it might be a while before Do Nothing Bitches gets produced at Universal. Her&nbsp;production schedule in 2016 includes the Road House remake and her own biopic, My Fight/Your Fight, in which Rousey will play herself.4.&nbsp;JOHNNY DEPP MIGHT EXPLORE THE TRIPLE FRONTIER (THAT WILL SMITH WON’T)Triple Frontier is the title of a crime drama/thriller set in the dangerous area around the South American borders shared by Argentina, Brazil, and Paraguay. When we first heard about it&nbsp;a few years ago, it was soon after director Kathryn Bigelow’s success with The Hurt Locker. Bigelow eventually moved on to directing the Osama bin Laden drama Zero Dark Thirty instead, and has since left the film entirely. Around that time, the potential cast included both Tom Hanks and Will Smith, but Will Smith has passed on it (Tom Hanks may still sign on).&nbsp;Triple Frontier is still alive as an active project, however, as it will now be directed by J.C. Chandor. Chandor’s filmography to date is quite impressive, going 3-for-3 on Certified Fresh films&nbsp;with Margin Call, All is Lost, and A Most Violent Year. Now, Triple Frontier has attracted the interest of another major Hollywood star, as Johnny Depp is now in talks for a role.&nbsp;Triple Frontier has always been treated in publicity as a film for at least three major stars, so it’s not yet known if Depp would be taking the role that might have gone to Will Smith, or if that role might still be open to casting. In other related news, J.C. Chandor has also started development on an English-language remake called The Robber, based upon a German/Austrian film called Der Raüber.5. STEVE COOGAN AND&nbsp;JOHN C. REILLY TO COSTAR IN COMEDY TEAM BIOPIC, STAN &amp; OLLIEAmong the biggest stars of Hollywood’s Golden Age of Cinema, there still remain a few&nbsp;who have never really received their own proper modern biopics in the vein of films like Chaplin and The Aviator (which prominently featured both Ava Gardner and Katherine Hepburn). Two such stars that appear to be finally getting their chance are the comedy team of Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy, most frequently credited on posters as just, “Laurel &amp; Hardy.” Steve Coogan (Philomena) and&nbsp;John C. Reilly (Magnolia, Step Brothers)&nbsp;are now attached to star as&nbsp;Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy, respectively, in the British film Stan &amp; Ollie. As has become more common in recent years, the film will not be a full biopic about their entire lives, but will instead focus on a single chapter in the twilight of their careers.&nbsp;Stan &amp; Ollie will be set mostly around their 1953 comedy tour of England, which started off with low audience turnouts, but with time, eventually became a hit. However, health problems and “long buried ghosts” also challenge their comeback.&nbsp;Stan &amp; Ollie will be directed by British director Jon S. Baird (2013’s Filth).6. HAWKEYE AND SCARLET WITCH REUNITE, SANS AVENGERS, AT WIND RIVERJeremy Renner and Elizabeth Olsen, who last year costarred together as Hawkeye and Scarlet Witch in Avengers: Age of Ultron, are set to costar together again in a movie that has nothing to do with Marvel at all. That film will be called Wind River, and it will mark the feature film directorial debut of screenwriter Taylor Sheridan, who had success last year with the crime drama Sicario.&nbsp; Jeremy Renner will play a Fish and Game Department ranger who stumbles upon the body of a raped teenage girl, and he’s joined in the investigation by a rookie FBI agent played by Elizabeth Olsen. Filming of Wind River is scheduled to start in March, 2016 in Park City, Utah, the setting each year of the Sundance Film Festival.Rotten Ideas of The Week3.&nbsp;JET LI TO FIGHT VIN DIESEL IN XXX: THE RETURN OF XANDER CAGEOutside of his roles in the three Expendables movies, martial arts star Jet Li has worked more in Asian film over&nbsp;the last several years than he did earlier in his career. Li will be back&nbsp;in Hollywood soon, however, as he has closed a deal with Revolution Studios to costar with Vin Diesel in the sequel xXx 3: The Return of Xander Cage.&nbsp;After sitting out the second film, as Vin Diesel returns for this third entry, the formula seems to be changing a little bit to be more like Diesel’s Fast and Furious franchise. This time around,&nbsp;Xander Cage appears to be leading a team of agents, with Jet Li cast as the leader of another opposing team. Li’s team may also feature Thai star Tony Jaa, of the Ong-Bak franchise. Diesel, Li, and Jaa will be joined by other previously announced cast members like Samuel L. Jackson, Nina Dobrev, Deepika Padukone, and Ruby Rose.&nbsp;xXx 3: The Return of Xander Cage doesn’t have a release date yet, but it’s expected to possibly be sometime in 2017 (or maybe 2018). This story is one of the week’s Rotten Ideas, not because of Jet Li, but because of director D.J. Caruso’s Tomatometer.2. TYLER PERRY TO MAKE 2016 TRULY TERRIFYING: BOO! A MADEA HALLOWEENSome movies (especially animation and superheroes) need 2-3 years to get made, most movies get it done in about a year, and then there are others that manage to do it in “just” months. That latter group usually consists of comedies and dramas that don’t involve extensive post-production. One such franchise that seems to be able to announce production relatively close to release is Tyler Perry’s lucrative (relative to budget) comedy franchise featuring his Madea character. Madea has had a Diary (of a Mad Black Woman) and a Family Reunion, she’s gone to Jail&nbsp;and avoided it with Witness Protection, and most recently (in 2013), she celebrated Christmas. For his first Madea movie in three years, Tyler Perry has found inspiration from a joke in the Chris Rock movie, Top Five. That joke, called Boo! A Madea Halloween will become a real movie this year just in time for an October 21, 2016 release date. In the film, Madea will spend “a hilarious, haunted Halloween fending off killers, paranormal poltergeists, ghosts, ghouls and zombies while keeping a watchful eye on a group of misbehaving teens.” The Madea franchise generally hovers somewhere between the 18-to-38 percent range on the Tomatometer, so that’s why we’re calling this one of the week’s “Rotten Ideas.” Tyler Perry’s competition for appealing to Halloween horror fans this year will include the toy adaptation Monster High (10/7/16), The Bye Bye Man (10/14/16), A Monster Calls (10/14/17), Underworld: Next Generation (10/14/16), and Ouija 2 (10/21). (Although at least one of those is likely to be pushed back from October.)1.&nbsp;CHARLIE’S ANGELS DIRECTOR SUMMONS THE POWER OF GREYSKULL WITH MASTERS OF THE UNIVERSEAlthough He-Man and Skeletor did (technically) get their own Masters of the Universe movie back in 1987, by way of Cannon Films, the notion of a more contemporary big budget remake has been lingering around Hollywood for well over a decade now. One way to look at it is that yes, that movie was schmaltzy and sort of cheap-looking, but in the 1980s and early 1990s, the same could also be said of superhero movies like Superman IV: The Quest for Peace (also a Cannon film) and Captain America (produced by Menahem Golan soon after leaving… Cannon Films). The point here is that comic book and toy adaptations have really improved, on average, since those Cannon Films years. Thus, the notion of a new Masters of the Universe movie persists at Sony Pictures.&nbsp; The studio may have finally found a director for Masters of the Universe in the form of the man&nbsp;who calls himself McG. McG (AKA Joseph McGinty Nichol) is best known for directing the first two Charlie’s Angels movies,&nbsp;but his filmography also includes Ouija, We Are Marshall, and 2009’s Terminator: Salvation. Another distinction McG carries on his Tomatometer is that, of the seven movies he’s directed since making his debut with Charlie’s Angels, none of them has had a score above 49 percent (and that one was We Are Marshall). McG’s next film will be a horror movie called The Babysitter.","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"Sematary, canceled, IFC, revenge, Travel, Starz, Fall, rotten, Classic, franchise, Grammys, Family, Video, blockbuster, Fox","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/22133338/StarWarsDecembers.jpg","slug":"disney-reschedules-star-wars-to-rule-the-december-box-office-forever-and-more-movie-news"},{"id":"47509190254992","title":"Harley Quinn Will Lead the DCEU’s Gotham City Sirens, and More Movie News","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Harley Quinn Will Lead the DCEU's Gotham City Sirens, and More Movie NewsNew roles for Rachel Weisz, Jonah Hill, Rooney Mara, Will Ferrell, and Kristen Wiig, plus an Aquaman update and a look at this year's Hollywood black list.by Greg Dean Schmitz | December 16, 2016 |  CommentsThis week’s Ketchup brings you another ten headlines from the world of film development news (those stories about what movies Hollywood is working on for you next).&nbsp; Included in the mix this time around are stories about such titles as Aquaman, Gotham City Sirens, and new roles for Will Ferrell, Jonah Hill, and Rachel WeiszThis WEEK’S TOP STORYHARLEY QUINN, POISON IVY, &amp; CATWOMAN TO STAR IN GOTHAM CITY SIRENSWarner Bros and their DC Extended Universe (DCEU) movies are off to a much slower start than Marvel’s MCU (Doctor Strange was MCU #14, Suicide Squad was DC’s #3). DC Comics does have Marvel “beat” in one aspect, however, and that’s in representation of female leads, with their fourth film being next year’s Wonder Woman (6/2/17), while Marvel won’t have a solo female lead until their 21st movie,&nbsp;Captain Marvel (3/8/19) (#20 if you count Ant-Man and the Wasp on 7/6/18). That commitment to female lead characters was&nbsp;confirmed earlier this year when it was revealed that Margot Robbie was going to produce a spinoff movie for her Suicide Squadi character Harley Quinn. This week, we learned the title of that spinoff, and it’s more than just the expected “Harley Quinn solo movie.” That’s because it’s called Gotham City Sirens, which means there will be two other DC Comics villains in lead roles:&nbsp;Catwoman and Poison Ivy. Neither character has appeared in the new DCEU, but then, there have only been three movies thus far, and only one which had any Batman supervillains (Suicide Squad). Of course, Anne Hathaway did play Catwoman in The Dark Knight Rises, and that was only four years ago, and we’re already getting a new Catwoman in a few years (just like we “already” got a new Batman this year).&nbsp;Gotham City Sirens will be a reunion project&nbsp;for Margot Robbie and her Suicide Squad director David Ayer (which has led some blogs to question why a mostly-female supervillain movie has a male director). There’s also the question of whether Harley Quinn and Poison Ivy will be portrayed as a romantic couple, as they currently are in their DC Comics. As for who might join Margot Robbie in Gotham City Sirens, a rumor quickly sprouted online this week based on Megan Fox’s earlier statements that she wants to play the next Poison Ivy. It should be noted that Warner Bros is still developing a Suicide Squad sequel, and is considering a spinoff movie for Will Smith’s Deadshot. In other Margot Robbie news, filming of her Tonya Harding movie is getting closer to production, with the news this week that Sebastian Stan (Marvel’s “Winter Soldier”) has been cast as Harding’s ex-husband Jeff Gillolly (and the one who hired the knee-attacker). On top of that, Moms star Alison Janney has been cast as Harding’s own… mom.&nbsp; It’s not yet known who will be playing Nancy Kerrigan.Fresh Developments1. LIN-MANUEL MIRANDA’S MONKEY MUSICAL VIVO SWINGS INTO 2020Following the success of Hamilton on Broadway, Lin-Manuel Miranda is definitely making sure the accolades don’t go to waste. In addition to his role as one of the Moana songwriters, Miranda’s In the Heights is back in development as a movie, and he’s going to be the male lead in Disney’s Mary Poppins Returns (12/25/18). This week’s news sees Miranda signing on with a studio that’s not Disney, however, as he will now be writing songs for an animated movie for Sony as well. Sony Animation is now planning&nbsp;a 2020 release for an animated musical called Vivo, featuring 11 songs written by Lin-Manuel Miranda, which will tell the story of a singing monkey in Cuba who dreams of making his way across the Caribbean to Miami, Florida (like, unfortunately, a lot of non-monkey Cubans in the last 50 years). Sony Animation has scheduled Vivo for release on December 18, 2020.2.&nbsp;WATCHMEN HERO PATRICK WILSON JOINS AQUAMAN AS VILLAIN OCEAN MASTERWe still don’t have a really great idea of what an entire movie of underwater Aquaman adventures is going to look like (especially since you could tell Jason Momoa was holding his breath in his first appearance). Regardless, the Aquaman movie is now less than two years away (October 5, 2018), so we’re hearing more casting news, as filming starts relatively soon. We still don’t know who might play Black Manta (or indeed, if he will be in the movie for certain), but this week, we did hear who will play Orm, Aquaman’s brother, AKA the villain called Ocean Master. That role will go to Watchmen star Patrick Wilson, and if Wilson seems like an odd choice to play an underwater super villain, there is indeed a very good explanation. Patrick Wilson and director James Wan have&nbsp;worked on&nbsp;four movies together: The Conjuring, Insidious, and the two direct sequels to Insidious. (Add in&nbsp;Aquaman and of course, the inevitable The Conjuring 3, and pretty soon the duo might have made over half a dozens movies together.)3. INEVITABLE SPIDER-MAN: HOMECOMING SEQUEL GETS INEVITABLE 2019 RELEASE DATESome sequels are just sort of obviously going to happen,&nbsp;but even so, it’s still news when their development is confirmed by their respective studios. This week, we got the obligatory and completely unsurprising news that Marvel Studios and Sony Pictures have announced a release date for their second Spider-Man movie together, which is now scheduled for July 5, 2019 (effectively a four day holiday weekend). The only element that might be sort of funny/curious is that the movie is being called Spider-Man: Homecoming 2, but you can pretty much depend upon the eventual film&nbsp;to have a different title&nbsp;(something like Spider-Man: Graduation Day, maybe). Sony has also moved Bad Boys 4 from that weekend up two months to May 24, 2019. And if you’re wondering “What’s all this talk about Bad Boys 4 when there’s only two movies?”, well, Sony is also releasing Bad Boys For Life (the 3rd movie) just over a year from now, on January 12, 2018.&nbsp;Bad Boys 4 is now competing against Minecraft: The Movie on 5/24/19, and the Spider-Man sequel’s competition on the Fourth of July weekend is a mystery animated title from Illumination (which might be the sequel to this month’s Sing).4. WILL FERRELL AND KRISTEN WIIG TO STAR IN MUSICAL COMEDY EVERYTHING IS COMING UP PROFITSIn that now nostalgically remembered moment some call “mid-century,” America and pop culture in general tried lots of new concepts, some of which just didn’t stick (similarly, some of our contemporary “hot new ideas” won’t age that well, either). This week, we learned that Saturday Night Live alumni Will Ferrell and Kristen Wiig now have plans to collaborate on a movie musical celebrating one such 1950s trend. That movie will be based on the non-fiction book Everything is Coming Up Profits: The Golden Age of Industrial Musicals, and that book title tells you exactly what it’s about. Producer Marc Platt (La La Land) and the songwriting team of Marc Shaiman and Scott Wittman (Broadway’s Hairspray) are on board to produce and create the music. The subject and the period in general ranges from the 1950s to the 1980s, when various companies sought the help of often major Broadway talents to create musical presentations for sales people, factory workers, mid-level managers, — you-name-it — to drum up excitement about their otherwise “boring” subjects. If you still don’t quite get what we’re talking about, you can start here with 1969’s “My Bathroom“and follow the links from there. (It really is a very special room.)5. JONAH HILL AND ROONEY MARA JOIN DON’T WORRY, HE WON’T GET FAR ON FOOTIt happens pretty much every year. Around December, right when we’re getting a good idea of which movies are going to get all the awards season love, we start to hear about casting news for movies going into production just time to maybe get such attention in say, December, 2017. This week, one of the surprising Golden Globes nominations (behind the two for Deadpool) was Jonah Hill’s nomination for War Dogs, and to go along with it, he’s now in talks to join a possible “Oscar bait” movie (not that those&nbsp;are bad things;&nbsp;it’s just a shorthand term). Jonah Hill and Rooney Mara (The Social Network) are now both in talks to join Joaquin Phoenix in the true story drama Don’t Worry, He Won’t Get Far on Foot, to be directed by Gus Van Sant (Good Will Hunting, Drugstore Cowboy). As you might guess based on the tongue-in-cheek title, Don’t Worry, He Won’t Get Far on Foot will tell the life story of a man who became a famous comic strip artist after losing the use of his arms and legs in a horrible car accident (answer: the pen was held by his toes, which he guided with his mouth). (Hopefully, Joaquin Phoenix won’t put his own foot in his mouth while promoting this movie upon its eventual release.)6. RACHEL WEISZ TO STAR IN TRANS BIOPIC THE SECRET LIFE OF DR. JAMES MIRANDA BARRYGener issues have provided a wealth of material for films seeking awards consideration, ranging from matters of sexual discrimination to voting rights to transgender oppression. This week, we learned that the latest actress to sign on for a movie somewhere along that spectrum is Rachel Weisz (The Mummy franchise, this year’s Denial), who is now attached to star in an adaptation of the non-fiction book, The Secret Life of Dr. James Miranda Barry: Victorian England’s Most Eminent Surgeon.&nbsp;It tells the story of a a 19th century woman who took on a male identity so that she could study to become a medical physician during an era when that was pretty much impossible for a woman. As to whether a figure like Barry can or should be considered “trans” (in our modern sense), here’s an article&nbsp;that considers the subject.7. THIS YEAR’S “BLACK LIST” INCLUDES MOVIES ABOUT MADONNA, MONICA LEWINSKI, AND CARL SAGANNow that’s it’s been around several years, the annual ranking called “The Black List of Unproduced Screenplays” has had both critical hits (Juno, Spotlight, American Hustle, The Revenant) and some movies that were less so, but it’s still an interesting source of possible new movies anyway. This year’s list delivers to us yet another colorful class of interesting biopics and/or clever ideas. Some of the top-voted films (note: there is a difference between films being top-voted and just “being on the list”) this year include #1 choice Blond Ambition (about struggling musician Madonna Ciccone in the early 1980s), Voyagers (a love story about Carl Sagan, a la The Theory of Everything), and Linda and Monica (about the “friendship” between Linda Tripp and Monica Lewinsky). Finally, the movie you may have seen the most about on your social media this week (if you follow the right “entertainment feeds”) is Lax Mandis, which is an “inside Hollywood” comedy spoofing a certain famous/infamous screenwriter and “son of a famous director.”ROTTEN IDEAS OF THE WEEK2. ZACK SNYDER TO TAKE A BREAK FROM DC COMICS MOVIES WITH AFGHAN WAR THRILLER THE LAST PHOTOGRAPHAlthough there have thus been only three movies in the DC Extended Universe, two of them were directed by Zack Snyder, and he’s also directing the fifth film, Justice League. So, with 60 percent of the first five to either his credit or his fault, the future of the DCEU and possibly Snyder’s legacy are pretty much intertwined. It might be for that reason that Snyder confirmed this week that his next film after Justice League will not be Justice League 2 (or any other DCEU movie), but instead a smaller film called The Last Photograph. That movie has actually been in development for over 10 years, and it’s about a war photographer covering the Afghanistan War who is one of the only survivors of an attack on U.S. forces, who must team up with a soldier to escape alive (and to deliver the story of his career). We’re calling The Last Photograph one of the week’s “Rotten Ideas” because all six of the last movies that Zack Snyder has been credited on have earned Rotten Tomatometer scores, ranging from 23 percent (Sucker Punch) to 55 percent (Man of Steel). In other related news, Justice League 2 (or whatever it ends up being called) has been bumped back from 2018 to 2019, possibly to make room for Ben Affleck’s Batman in 2018 (although that hasn’t been officially confirmed as of yet).1. ROGUE ONE VILLAIN ACTOR CAST AS THE SHERIFF OF NOTTINGHAM IN ROBIN HOOD: ORIGINSUnfortunately, with some casting news, the nature of the movie in question means that we call a story a “Rotten Idea” even if we think the actor in question is otherwise, you know, sort of awesome. One example&nbsp;is Ben Mendelsohn, who can currently be seen&nbsp;as one of the villains in Rogue One: A Star Wars Story (and who will also be the main villain in Steven Spielberg’s Ready Player One). There’s just something about Mendelsohn which lends him to being a natural choice as a villain in big budget Hollywood movies, which sort of puts him in the distinguished company of actors like Gary Oldman, Javier Bardem, etc. The latest such film to do so is the “prequel” project Robin Hood: Origins, which inspires “eye rolls” from this writer just because if there’s one character in 2016 (besides Peter Pan) who doesn’t really need an origin story, it’s Robin Hood. Anyway, Ben Mendelsohn has been cast as the Sheriff of Nottingham, who will be working to defeat the Merry Men of Sherwood Forest, as led by Taron Egerton (Kingsman: The Secret Service, Eddie the Eagle). Lionsgate has scheduled Robin Hood: Origins for release on March 23, 2018, up against Sony Animation’s Peter Rabbit, featuring the voices of James Corden and Daisy Ridley.","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"History","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/16171626/Harley-Quinn-Ketchup.jpg","slug":"harley-quinn-will-lead-the-dceus-gotham-city-sirens-and-more-movie-news"},{"id":"47509201181167","title":"Weekly Ketchup: Steven Spielberg Wants to Direct Chris Pratt in Indiana Jones","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Weekly Ketchup: Steven Spielberg Wants to Direct Chris Pratt in Indiana JonesPlus, Oscar winners, sequel news for Blade Runner and Boyhood, and new roles for Will Ferrell, Jessica Chastain, and Rosamund Pike.by Greg Dean Schmitz | February 27, 2015 |  CommentsThis week’s Ketchup covers the week that (basically) started with the Academy Awards, and ended with the death of Leonard Nimoy. In between, there were film development stories about such films as Blade Runner 2, Boyhood 2, The Huntsman, The LEGO Movie Sequel, and Pee-Wee’s Big Holiday.&nbsp;This Week’s Top StorySTEVEN SPIELBERG WANTS TO DIRECT CHRIS PRATT AS INDIANA JONES?This was, as you will see below, a week in which a few of the biggest news stories in Hollywood were not strictly about things we normally cover in this column (ie, “film development”), and one of the biggest stories wasn’t even a story about something that is “for sure” happening. Specifically, we’re talking about the frequently repeated news this week that Steven Spielberg “hopes to direct” the revival of the Indiana Jones franchise that Walt Disney Pictures hopes to recruit Chris Pratt (Guardians of the Galaxy) to star in. This is a story chock full of ifs and maybes (but such is so often the case with film development stories). IF Chris Pratt agrees to star in a new Indiana Jones movie, and IF the script is good, then MAYBE Steven Spielberg will direct… etc. But, hey, people just hope for a return to greatness, right? That was just one of three different ways in which Chris Pratt made the news this week. One of the others was the Parks and Recreation finale, which isn’t strictly under this column’s focus, but Rotten Tomatoes has that covered right here. Finally, there’s Chris Pratt’s other big 2014 movie, which was The LEGO Movie (he voiced the film’s lead). We learned this week that the LEGO Movie sequel will have the creative title of The LEGO Movie Sequel, and it will be directed by TV director Rob Schrab, who directed several episodes of Community, and the “camping” episode of… Parks and Recreation.Fresh Developments This Week1 BIRDMAN WINS FOUR BIG PRIZES AT THE ACADEMY AWARDSSince this is Friday, and the Academy Awards were five nights ago, most of what’s going to be written and read about the honorees has already happened, but since it was technically in the past seven days, here’s our obligatory Academy Awards coverage, albeit in brief. First off, if you want to just quickly browse the winners, that list is right here. The night’s biggest winning film was Birdman (or The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance), which won Best Picture, Best Director, Best Cinematography, and Best Original Screenplay. Another film to receive four prizes was The Grand Budapest Hotel, which won many of the “technical” prizes, such as Production Design, Costume Design, Makeup and Hairstyling, and Original Score. The independent film Whiplash also scored multiple prizes for Best Supporting Actor (J.K. Simmons), Editing, and Sound Mixing (those two prizes were directly connected, since Whiplash was a movie about drumming). No other films won multiple awards, including such multiple nominees as The Imitation Game (8 nominations, one award for Adapted Screenplay), Boyhood (6 nominations, one award for Supporting Actress), and American Sniper (6 nominations, one award for Sound Editing).2 BLADE RUNNER 2 LANDS PRISONERS DIRECTOR DENIS VILLENEUVEAlthough his 2013 film Prisoners was a mid-ranged fall season hit with $61 million, and he has yet to earn a Rotten Tomatometer score, director Denis Villeneuve is not yet a household name, even among most film buffs. This week’s news may, however, be the start of changing that, as Villeneuve (Prisoners, Incendies) is now in talks to direct the Blade Runner sequel. Harrison Ford, who starred in the original 1982 film was also confirmed this week to be appearing “in a small but critical role with his character appearing in the third act of the film.” Ridley Scott, who directed the first film, is still attached to produce this sequel, which will start filming in the summer of 2016.3 RICHARD LINKLATER MAY SPEND ANOTHER TEN YEARS WORKING ON A BOYHOOD SEQUELIn 2014, when director Richard Linklater was asked about the possibility of a Boyhood sequel, he answered with a fairly direct “no.” Now that some more time has passed, however, Linklater is apparently reconsidering the possibility. Specifically, he spoke this week about the idea of continuing to follow his lead character’s life as he proceeds through college and his 20s. That doesn’t necessarily mean, however, that a Boyhood 2 would be filmed over 10 years (though it may be), as the stated reason for the 12 year span of Boyhood was to cover the progress from 1st grade to senior year of high school. Given the implied shorter amount of time it takes to earn a college degree, Boyhood 2 might only take four years (unless of course he becomes the sort of “professional student” that has been featured in such Linklater films as Slacker and Waking Life). In other Linklater news, the director is also now in talks to direct an adaptation of the 2012 novel Where’d You Go, Bernadette, about a 15 year old girl’s search for her missing mother.4 MISTER HERMAN WILL CELEBRATE PEE-WEE’S BIG HOLIDAY ON NETFLIXComedian Paul Reubens has been trying to get a third Pee-Wee Herman movie produced and distributed since the 1990s (unfortunately, an event in 2002 set his efforts back considerably). Something that works towards Pee-Wee Herman’s benefit is the inevitability of the passing of time, with the children that were his fans in the 1980s now being adults and parents themselves. Judd Apatow and Paul Reubens have reached a deal with Netflix for a new movie called Pee-Wee’s Big Holiday, which will start filming in three weeks. Reubens also cowrote the movie along with Arrested Development cowriter Paul Rust, and the film will mark the feature length debut of director John Lee, whose previous experience includes the shows Inside Amy Schumer and Adult Swim’s The Heart, She Holler. Netflix hasn’t revealed a premiere date yet for Pee-Wee’s Big Holiday, but online speculation has suggested a date in early 2016.5 WILL FERRELL PROMISES THAT THE HOUSE ALWAYS WINSWill Ferrell may not be a director himself, but as a producer, he perpetually keeps a full slate of potential movies in development for him to eventually star in. The latest such project to join his impending slate is called The House, and this week, the comedy project landed at New Line Cinema after a “heated auction.” The House was written by Brendan O’Brien and Andrew J. Cohen, the team responsible for writing last year’s comedy hit Neighbors. The House also has a premise that makes the Neighbors connection less surprising, as Will Ferrell will play a father who blows through his daughter’s college fund and turns his house in the suburbs into an illegal casino (hence the title). New Line Cinema has budgeted $40 million for The House, which the studio hopes to start filming this August to get it ready for release sometime in the summer of 2016.6 THE FAMILY OF BRUCE LEE RE-IGNITES LONG-PLANNED OFFICIAL BIOPICOver five years ago, this column reported that the family of martial arts legend Bruce Lee was developing an official biopic which would try to achieve what previous efforts (like 1993’s Dragon: The Bruce Lee Story, starring Jason Scott Lee, no relation) did not. That movie (produced by Lee’s siblings) did get made (Bruce Lee, My Brother), but as an intended start of a sequel, the movie about Bruce Lee as a teenager pretty much ended there. Now, five years later, Lee’s family is again trying to get the definitive Bruce Lee biopic produced, and this time, it’s his daughter Shannon Lee who is leading the effort. The production is now seeking “a world class filmmaker and writer” to take on the biopic film, which will join a media franchise that includes a series of novels (based on Lee’s writings), a mobile game, a reality TV show in China, and a TV series to be produced by Justin Lin of the Fast &amp; Furious franchise.7 SHAKING THE WEEKLY KETCHUP BOTTLE: NEW ROLES FOR CHASTAIN, PIKE, AND LIVELYNormally, the Weekly Ketchup covers ten stories from the world of film development, but this week, three big stories happened that sort of squeezed out some of the stories that would have otherwise received their own headline space. Actually, there were a lot more such stories than three, but three stories that we felt really bad about not focusing our attention on all share the distinction of being about three actresses whose stars are rising (and two of which were in films that received a lot of attention during this most recent “awards season”). First up, there’s Jessica Chastain (Interstellar, Miss Julie, A Most Violent Year) has landed one of the lead roles in the (Snow White-less) fantasy sequel The Huntsman, opposite Chris Hemsworth, which Universal Picturs has scheduled for April 22, 2016. Next up is Gone Girl star Rosamund Pike, who may not have won Best Actress, but has won the female lead in The Deep Blue Goodbye, opposite Christian Bale, who is already signed to play author John D. MacDonald’s most famous fictional character, Travis McGee. Finally, Blake Lively (Green Lantern, The Age of Adaline) and Jason Clarke have been cast by director Marc Forster (World War Z, Quantum of Solace) to star in his next film called All I See is You. Lively will play a blind woman (and Clarke, her husband) who regains her sight only to find that her newly gained vision includes “previously unseen and disturbing details about themselves.” (This writer’s best guess? He lied to his wife about stuff.)Rotten Ideas of the Week2 FORMER FOX CEO TOM ROTHMAN TO REPLACE AMY PASCAL AT SONYA few weeks ago, the Weekly Ketchup attracted some negative feedback in the Comments section for the way we covered the search for a replacement following Amy Pascal’s hacking-scandal-related departure from Sony Pictures. This week, we learned that one of those expected candidates has indeed landed the job, and the news sent something of a shockwave through Twitter and other social media, as former coworkers expressed their opinions. But, first, let’s actually say who it is: Tom Rothman may be a familiar name to those who have regularly followed film development news since the 1990s, as Rothman was the founder of Fox Searchlight, and also served for 12 years as the CEO of Fox Filmed Entertainment (which includes 20th Century Fox, Fox Searchlight, Blue Sky Animation, and FOX Television). Tom Rothman, in particular, was a (arguably, “the”) central figure in Fox’s handling of their Marvel license characters, which during his tenure included Daredevil, Elektra, both Fantastic Four movies, X-Men Origins: Wolverine, and all of the X-Men movies before X-Men: Days of Future Past. Deadpool creator Rob Liefeld, for example, remarked on Twitter, “Tom Rothman single handedly kept Deadpool from getting made at Fox. Not a fan. Scratches Sony off the list…” Of course, there were plenty of bright spots to Rothman’s tenure at Fox, including Titanic and Avatar with James Cameron, various Fox Searchlight films such as Black Swan, Juno, and The Descendants, and box office hits like Cast Away, the Ice Age franchise, the Night at the Museum franchise, the Alvin and the Chipmunks franchise, and Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World. Under Tom Rothman, 20th Century Fox also distributed two of the three Star Wars prequels (which were produced by Lucasfilm). The news of Rothman’s promotion comes just two weeks after the news that Sony and Marvel are partnering for future film depictions of Spider-Man, which will include an active participation by Marvel Studios, and Kevin Feige.1 R.I.P. LEONARD NIMOY (1931-2015)Since we first learned, a little over a year ago, that actor, writer, and director Leonard Nimoy had been diagnosed with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), many people familiar with the disease’s effects, especially on people in their 80s, sadly knew a day like today probably wasn’t too far off. Nimoy died today at the age of 83 due to his end-stage chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Nimoy obviously became famous first as an actor on television, but his career truly spanned multiple titles, genres, and media. On television, he wasn’t just Mr. Spock on Star Trek, but he was also the long-time host of both In Search Of… and Ancient Mysteries, and ended his television career with several episodes of Fringe. In film, again, Leonard Nimoy is best known for his appearances in multiple Star Trek films (including the 2009 reboot), but there’s plenty more that he achieved. He also directed two of the movies (III and IV, a favorite for many fans), and in 1987, he directed the year’s #1 box office hit, Three Men and a Baby. As an actor, Leonard Nimoy also transcended Spock, with a memorable costarring role in the 1978 remake of Invasion of the Body Snatchers, and frequent animation voice roles in movies like The Pagemaster, Atlantis: The Lost Empire, and Transformers: The Movie (Nimoy also voiced Sentinel Prime in Transfomers: Dark of the Moon). And all of that is without even mentioning his multiple albums as a “Golden Throats”-style musician, and his two autobiographies. Leonard Nimoy was one of those performers who left an indelible imprint on generations, and will cast a longer shadow.Read more Weekly KetchupFollow Greg Dean Schmitz on Facebook","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"Fantasy, CBS, Con","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"weekly-ketchup-steven-spielberg-wants-to-direct-chris-pratt-in-indiana-jones"},{"id":"47509196297671","title":"Jennifer Lawrence Announces Directorial Debut and More Hollywood Headlines","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Jennifer Lawrence Announces Directorial Debut and More Hollywood HeadlinesMarvel hires a comedy writer for Thor, Reese Witherspoon tackles two more projects, and Phil Hartman gets a biopic.by Greg Dean Schmitz | December 4, 2015 |  CommentsThis week’s Ketchup covers the last week from the realm of film development news, as Hollywood slowly wakes from its collective post-Thanksgiving lethargy just long enough to give us ten top stories. Included in the mix this time around are stories about such movies as biopics about Catherine the Great and Phil Hartman, and new films for directors Ron Howard, Barbra Streisand, and in her directorial debut, Jennifer Lawrence.This Week’s Top StoryWHAT JENNIFER LAWRENCE REALLY WANTS TO DO IS DIRECT: PROJECT DELIRIUMWhile out on the interview circuit this last week promoting The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 2, Jennifer Lawrence revealed one of the next steps that she would like to make with her career.&nbsp; Like many before her, Lawrence would like to add “director” to her filmography. The project that Lawrence is targeting as her directorial debut arguably falls far afield from where one might expect her to start (and more resembles the sort of movie George Clooney might produce/direct).&nbsp; That film (which Jennifer Lawrence doesn’t plan on costarring in) is called Project Delirium. The project is based on an article in the December 17, 2002 issue of The New Yorker, which told the true story of Colonel James S. Ketchum, who in the 1960s and 1970s was involved with a secret program “to fight enemies with clouds of psychochemicals that temporarily incapacitate the mind.” Specifically, the program included experiments with such chemicals and drugs as LSD and nerve gas. Lawrence is currently seeking a screenwriter to start adapting that article.Fresh Developments This Week1.&nbsp;BARBRA STREISAND TO RETURN TO DIRECTING WITH CATHERINE THE GREAT BIOPICSinger-turned-actress Barbra Streisand first made her directorial debut in 1983 with Yentl, followed by The Prince of Tides in 1991 and The Mirror Has Two Faces in 1996. Next year, then, will mark the 20th year since a Streisand-directed film was released. Formerly and recently, Streisand was known to have been working on a new Gypsy musical adaptation, but that film appears to no longer be in active development. Instead, Streisand is now attached to direct a dramatic biopic adapting the life of Russian ruler Catherine the Great. Catherine the Great ruled Russia from 1762 to 1796, but this film will focus instead on “a young, sensual Catherine trapped in an abusive marriage with the heir to the Russian throne. But, when her inept husband proves incapable of ruling, she utilizes her intelligence, fortitude and passion to rise to power.”&nbsp; The screenplay was written by newcomer Kristina Lauren Anderson, and had the distinction in 2014 of topping the “Black List of Unproduced Screenplays.”2.&nbsp;RON HOWARD TO DIRECT NOVEL ADAPTATION THE GIRL BEFOREThere is something of a mini-trend in Hollywood right now of adapting women-in-jeopardy novels with “Girl” in the title. The first was last year’s Gone Girl, and it will be followed next year with The Girl on the Train (10/7/16). Both of those movies were adapted from popular best selling novels, but this week, director Ron Howard is attempting to get ahead of the actual book sales. That’s because Howard (Rush, A Beautiful Mind, Apollo 13) is now producing and will direct an adaptation of the upcoming Fall, 2016 novel The Girl Before.&nbsp; “J.P. Delaney” is credited as the author on that book, but it’s believed to be a pen name for author Tony Strong.&nbsp;The Girl Before is described as being about a “traumatized” woman who discovers that the new house she loves so much was formerly the home a few years earlier of another woman recovering from a tragedy. Ron Howard’s next film is the whale attack movie In the Heart of the Sea, which comes out next week, 12/11/15.3.&nbsp;REESE WITHERSPOON MAY STAR AS A DOLL INVENTOR IN BARBIE AND RUTHWith the “Miracle Mop inventor” biopic Joy being one of this holiday movie season’s anticipated films, there is already interest in Hollywood in finding the next such film for another female star (not specifically Jennifer Lawrence again).&nbsp;One such candidate is called&nbsp;Barbie and Ruth, which promises to tell the true story of Ruth Handler, the inventor of the popular Barbie doll franchise.&nbsp;&nbsp; The producers are hoping to recruit Reese Witherspoon to play Ruth Handler, who was inspired by watching her daughter play with paper dolls. Sony Pictures is also developing a new film franchise with Mattel directly adapting the Barbie franchise, but this biopic is a separate project.4. MARVEL RECRUITS COMEDY WRITER FOR THOR: RAGNAROKThe last few major revelations about Marvel’s Thor: Ragnarok (11/3/17) have mostly supported the notion that the third Thor movie might be more comedic or lighthearted than the first two.&nbsp; We’re thinking here of the news that Thor: Ragnarok will be directed by Taika Waititi (codirector of the horror mockumentary What We Do in the Shadows), and the reports that it will be a “buddy movie” (with the Hulk). This week’s news continues this theme, as we now know that Marvel has hired screenwriter Stephany Folsom to work on Thor: Ragnarok&nbsp;as what may be her first produced feature film. Stephany Folsom’s scripts in development include the dramedy 1969: A Space Odyssey (or How Kubrick Learned to Stop Worrying and Land on the Moon), which is based on urban legends about the famous director working with NASA to fake the 1969 Moon landing.&nbsp; Filming on Thor: Ragnarok is expected to start by this coming summer, so we should be hearing more casting news within the next few months.5.&nbsp;SNL STAR PHIL HARTMAN TO GET HIS OWN BIOPIC… FROM JASON PRIESTLEY?Canadian actor Jason Priestley is best known in the United States as one of the stars of the original 1990s TV series Beverly Hills 90210. For the last ten or so years, however, Jason Priestley has also been developing a new career as a director. For his next film, Priestley is aligning with Canadian producers to deliver an independent biopic about another of Canada’s famous entertainment exports. the late Phil Hartman, whose prolific career included long runs on Saturday Night Live (1986-1994), NewsRadio (1995-1998), and as various characters on The Simpsons (1991-1998).&nbsp;&nbsp; Jason Priestley has already found his Phil Hartman star in the form of prolific voice actor Daran Norris, whose credits include The Fairley OddParents, Samurai Jack, Star Wars: Clone Wars, and the 2004 film Team America: World Police.6.&nbsp;PRISONERS SCREENWRITER CAMPING OUT FOR NEXT FRIDAY THE 13TH REBOOTTwo years ago in 2013, the thriller Prisoners was one of the year’s awards contenders. So, it shouldn’t be surprising that screenwriter Aaron Guzikowski (Prisoners, Contraband) is continuing to land new jobs after that film’s critical success. What wasn’t as easy to predict is what sort of films Guzikowski would be landing (though the Papillon remake is less surprising). Paramount Pictures is now in talks with Aaron Guzikowski to write the studio’s next reboot of their Friday the 13th horror franchise. This will be the second reboot for Friday the 13th&nbsp;after the one released on February 13, 2009, and Paramount has scheduled this one for January 13, 2017. Aaron Guzikowski is also joining Friday the 13th as a screenwriter just as the reboot is losing director David Bruckner, codirector of The Signal and V/H/S.7. SILICON VALLEY STAR KUMAIL NANJIANI CATCHES THE BIG SICK FOR JUDD APATOWJudd Apatow is best known for directing such comedy films as The 40-Year-Old Virgin, Knocked Up, and this year’s Trainwreck. However, Apatow is also quite prolific as a producer of other people’s films, especially those who might need the extra help the most. In Apatow’s near future, these includesPee-Wee’s Big Holiday (Netflix in March, 2016) and The Lonely Island’s first movie, Conner4Real (6/3/16).&nbsp; This week, Judd Apatow was also announced as a producer on&nbsp;a comedy called The Big Sick. That film was cowritten by Kumail Nanjiani (HBO’s Silicon Valley), along with his wife Emily V. Gordon. Nanjiani will also star in the comedy for director Michael Showalter (The Baxter, Hello My Name is Doris). The premise of The Big Sick hasn’t been revealed yet.Rotten Ideas of The Week2. THIS WEEK IN REESE WITHERSPOON PART 2: OPENING BELLEThis was admittedly a slow film development news week as much of Hollywood wasn’t quite back to work, post-Thanksgiving. That might explain why 20% of this week’s top stories involve the same actress/producer (ie, if her “people” were working when others weren’t). That actress is Reese Witherspoon, and the second news item for her this week involves an upcoming novel called Opening Belle (by Maurren Sherry).&nbsp; Reese Witherspoon is producing and may star in the movie about “a mother of three trying to balance home life with her Wall Street career during the year before the financial meltdown.”&nbsp;Opening Belle is being adapted by screenwriter Matthew Aldrich, who made his feature film debut in 2007 with Cleaner, which earned a Rotten Tomatometer score of just 17 percent.1. STUDIO LIONSGATE RESPONDS TO GODS OF EGYPT “WHITEWASHING” CONTROVERSYOne of the most controversial complaints that fans still have cause to be concerned with about new films is the strategy of casting actors of races and ethnicities that are arguably different from the source material the movie is based upon. Recent examples of such controversies include Fantastic Four (Michael B. Jordan as Johnny Storm), Pan (Rooney Mara as Tiger Lily), and you can find more examples here. One film that raised similar concerns recently was Lionsgate’s mythological fantasy action film Gods of Egypt, which features Egyptian Gods as played by Caucasian actors like Nikolaj Coster-Waldau (Horus), Gerard Butler (Set), and Geoffrey Rush (Ra). Filmmakers and studios are frequently silent (or effectively silent) on this issue, but Lionsgate took a different approach this past week.&nbsp; Speaking to Forbes, both director Alex Proyas and the studio itself released official comments responding to the “whitewashing” allegations. Both statements use the word “apologize,” such as this one from Lionsgate itself: “We recognize that it is our responsibility to help ensure that casting decisions reflect the diversity and culture of the time periods portrayed. In this instance we failed to live up to our own standards of sensitivity and diversity, for which we sincerely apologize. Lionsgate is deeply committed to making films that reflect the diversity of our audiences. We have, can and will continue to do better.” Although it’s arguably a step in the right direction that apologies are being made, we’re still going to call this entire story the week’s “Rotten Idea,” because frankly, in the year 2015, we as a film industry should be able to prevent something like this from happening before cameras even start rolling.","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"harry, stoner, Yoda, CBS","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/04173253/JenniferLawrenceKetchup.jpg","slug":"jennifer-lawrence-announces-directorial-debut-and-more-hollywood-headlines"},{"id":"47509193455018","title":"James Earl Jones to Voice Darth Vader in Rogue One, and More Movie News","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})James Earl Jones to Voice Darth Vader in Rogue One, and More Movie NewsNew roles go to Alicia Vikander, Emma Stone, Jason Statham, and Bryan Cranston, and Hollywood loses a young talent.by Greg Dean Schmitz | June 24, 2016 |  CommentsThis week’s Ketchup brings you another ten headlines from the world of film development news (those stories about what movies Hollywood is working on for you next). Included in the mix this time around are stories about such titles as Alien: Covenant, Power Rangers, Spy 2, and Spider-Man: Homecoming.This Week’s Top StoryDARTH VADER TO RETURN IN ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORYFirst off, let us apologize for the somewhat “spoilery” nature of this headline, but this is also a story (like most of what we cover here) which has been highly publicized this week, and it’s not something we initiated.&nbsp; (Spoiler complaints should be lobbed at the source — in this case, Entertainment Weekly, which didn’t exactly hide this news&nbsp;when&nbsp;they put it right on their cover this week.)&nbsp;That big reveal is, of course,&nbsp;that Darth Vader is returning to the Star Wars movies, and it’s not Hayden Christensen, but the original voice of Darth Vader, James Earl Jones, who turned 85 this year. What is currently unknown is who will actually be physically portraying Darth Vader in the helmet and cape, but so far, it doesn’t sound like 80-year-old David Prowse will be returning for Rogue One: A Star Wars Story. In related news, EW also confirmed this week that the character Forest Whitaker will play in Rogue One: A Star Wars Story is Saw Gerrera. That’s significant to “deep” Star Wars fans, as Saw Gerrera is a character from The Clone Wars animated series. Finally, in other casting news tangentially related to Star Wars, John Boyega (AKA Finn from the Star Wars episode movies) landed a hot new role this week&nbsp;as the first confirmed cast member to join director Kathryn Bigelow’s untitled movie about the 1967 Detroit Riot, which will be her first feature film since 2012’s Zero Dark Thirty. This film is expected to be an ensemble drama, so we can probably expect to see much more casting in the weeks to come.Fresh Developments This Week1.&nbsp;ALICIA VIKANDER AND EMMA STONE COMPETING TO STAR AS THE YOUNG AGATHA CHRISTIEThe idea of “dueling movies” is decades old (Volcano vs Dante’s Peak, Armageddon vs Deep Impact; heck, there were even two competing Truman Capote movies a while back), but it’s something that Hollywood keeps doing year after year. One of the latest concepts that two different studios are trying to beat each other at producing first is the notion of mystery author Agatha Christie‘s struggles as a young writer. Sony Pictures has an Agatha Christie movie that they hope Alicia Vikander (Ex Machina, The Danish Girl) will star in, while Paramount Pictures has a similar project, and their top choice is Emma Stone. (Vikander is Swedish, Stone is American, and Agatha Christie herself was English.) Sony’s project reportedly would portray the celebrated author&nbsp;as a “proto-feminist” whose early career “intersects” with the likes of Arthur Conan Doyle (Sherlock Holmes) and future PM Winston Churchill. A key element for either movie to be greenlit will be the approval of Agatha Christie’s estate, which is reportedly known in film development for their tight control of all things Christie-related. One such film project that utltimately did get approval (after seven years of negotiations) is Kenneth Branagh’s adaptation of Murder on the Orient Express, which is now scheduled for release by 20th Century Fox for release on November 22, 2017 (with an ensemble cast likely to include Angelina Jolie).2.&nbsp;PROMETHEUS STAR NOOMI RAPACE TO COSTAR IN ALIEN: COVENANT AFTER ALLFor the past several months, as news about Ridley Scott’s Alien: Covenant has emerged, one of the few things that we thought we knew “for sure” was that Noomi Rapace would not be returning after starring in Prometheus (to which Alien: Covenant is a sequel). That was despite confirmation months ago that Michael Fassbender would be reprising his android role from Prometheus. Well, this week, it was reported that you can scratch all that, because Noomi Rapace is indeed in Australia right now to film what is described as “weeks” of production on Alien: Covenant.&nbsp;The duration of her involvement there&nbsp;is important because it eliminates the likelihood that Rapace is just filming a cameo appearance.&nbsp;Rapace and Fassbender will be joined in Alien: Covenant by new cast members Demian Bichir, Billy Crudup, Danny McBride, and Katherine Waterston when 20th Century Fox releases the film next summer, on August 4, 2017.3. BAD BOX OFFICE FOR SEQUELS THIS SUMMER WON’T STOP THE HEAT 2 OR SPY 2If you follow box office at all (or socially follow sources that report on that stuff), you may have heard that this summer of 2016 has been especially rough on sequels, as long as you don’t count Finding Dory or Captain America: Civil War, that is. The thing is, and let’s be very pragmatic here, that Hollywood is — and long has been — built around the concept of franchises. Now, sometimes those franchises happen organically (such as Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter, where the multiple movies are clearly based on pre-existing multi-part properties), but if such sources aren’t available, then the most obvious road to “franchisedom” are sequels (or maybe prequels if they’re especially creative about it). There has been a lot of talk that maybe studios and producers should back off on sequels, but one director/producer who doesn’t seem to be fazed is Paul Feig, whose next film is the Ghostbusters remake (7/15/16). It was reported a while back that Feig was working on a sequel to his Melissa McCarthy (and Sandra Bullock) comedy hit The Heat, and this week, he talkd about&nbsp;a sequel to another Melissa McCarthy comedy hit. That movie is last year’s Spy, and Feig is already talking up his interest in reuniting with Jason Statham, the “dimbulb” secret agent that initially seems like the movie’s star. In other “spy-like” movie news (which actually happened late last week, but it missed our deadline), Paramount Pictures is also now reportedly working on reviving another&nbsp; franchise, namely&nbsp;The Saint, which in the 1960s was a Roger Moore TV show, and in 1997, was a movie starring Val Kilmer.4.&nbsp;THIS WEEK IN CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE: NEW PROJECTS FOR DWAYNE JOHNSON AND KEVIN HARTTheir new movie Central Intelligence may technically have been #2 last weekend, but when the competition is the $135 million opening of Finding Dory, there are very few movies that wouldn’t have been #2 (or lower). Reportedly produced on a budget of just $50, the action comedy is widely seen as a proportional hit that adds to the box office clout of both of its stars, Dwayne Johnson and Kevin Hart. So, in the way that Hollywood frequently operates, this was a week with new projects being announced for both of them. In both cases, however, these movies are currently only being produced by the stars, with the possibility of them starring in them implied, but not necessarily confirmed. Dwayne Johnson is now developing the graphic novel adaptation Son of Shaolin at Sony Pictures, which as the title suggests, is a “kung fu” action movie.&nbsp; Somewhat burying the lead arguably, one story about Son of Shaolin also casually mentioned that Universal Pictures apparently is hoping to recruit Johnson to star in their next adaptation of The Wolf Man. As for Kevin Hart, the movie he made news with this week is another action comedy called Run the Jewels, at Universal Pictures, about “a group of unsuccessful rappers trying to rob an eccentric hip-hop mogul” (which sort of sounds like a hip hop Tower Heist or Ocean’s Eleven?).5.&nbsp;SPIDER-MAN: HOMECOMING ENSEMBLE CAST EXPANDS EVEN FURTHER WITH FOUR MORE ACTORSIf Spider-Man: Homecoming had stopped adding new actors before this week, it still would have seemed like a superhero movie with an impressive ensemble cast, after such recent additions as Donald Glover (Community), Tony Revolori (The Grand Budapest Hotel), and Logan Marshall-Green (Prometheus). This week, however, is when Sony/Marvel’s ambitious casting really got sort of crazy, with the news of four more actors.&nbsp;For most of them, no details are known, so there’s not much to do but list them. But, let’s start with Fargo&nbsp;season two costar Bokeem Woodbine, because he is the third confirmed “villain” for the movie (though we don’t know who or what that means), in addition to Logan Marshall-Green and Michael Keaton (who may or may not be playing the Vulture). The other new Spider-Man: Homecoming cast members added this week were Michael Mando (Better Call Saul), Abraham Attah (Beasts of No Nation), and comedian Hannibal Buress (Broad City,&nbsp;Daddy’s Home). Sony Pictures and Marvel Studios have scheduled Spider-Man: Homecoming for release next summer, on July 7, 2017.6. SONY ANIMATION ANNOUNCES THE STAR, AN ANIMAL COMEDY ABOUT CHRISTMASThis week, as studios and production companies sometimes do, Sony Pictures Animation announced new release dates for some of their upcoming films.&nbsp; But this time, included in the mix was a newly revealed movie called The Star. That film (The Star is a working title) will be a Christmas tale about the animals involved in “The Nativity Story,” including “a small but brave donkey and his animal friends [who] become the unsung heroes of the greatest story ever told.” Sony Pictures has scheduled The Star for December 8, 2017.&nbsp; Sony Animation’s other newly dated films include (the fully animated) Smurfs: The Lost Village (4/7/17), Emojimovie: Express Yourself&nbsp; (August, 2017), Hotel Transylvania 3 (9/21/2018), and the animated Spider-Man (12/21/18).Rotten Ideas of The Week3. BRYAN CRANSTON TO RETURN TO POWER RANGERS (HE WAS IN THAT SHOW… WHO KNEW!)It might seem like a distant memory now, but there was a time, less than a decade ago, when Bryan Cranston was mostly known for playing the dad on the TV show Malcolm in the Middle. Or maybe, if you are a superfan of the 1990s kids TV show Mighty Morphin Power Rangers, you also knew that Cranston provided the voices of the characters “Twinman” and “Snizzard.” (This was certainly news to this writer.) The producers of that show probably had no way of imagining the sort of amazing career rebirth Cranston would have decades later, but their decisions in 1993 may have helped them land something of a casting coup in 2016. That’s because Bryan Cranston has agreed to join the cast of next year’s Power Rangers (3/24/17). Cranston will play Zordon, the floating head “creator and mentor” of the Power Rangers. In the original show, Zordon sort of looked like The Wizard of Oz, or maybe Marlon Brando as Jor-El in Superman. Anyway, despite the gravitas Bryan Cranston might bring to the film,&nbsp;this is still going to be a Power Rangers movie after all, which haven’t historically performed well with critics. So, we’re calling this one a borderline “Rotten Idea,” (but our fingers are crossed for the best, honest!).2. INDEPENDENCE DAY: RESURGENCE DIRECTOR TO DUMP THE MOON ON US WITH MOONFALLAs you may have noticed in the trailers, this weekend’s sequel Independence Day: Resurgence&nbsp;(35 percent on the Tomatometer) features a 3,000-mile wide alien ship that causes Earth’s gravity to reverse. Of course, that’s the sort of “disaster porn” moviegoers have come to expect from director Roland Emmerich, who has destroyed landmarks in such movies as White House Down, 2012, The Day After Tomorrow, and of course, the original Independence Day back in 1996. And if Emmerich’s latest deal eventually leads to a movie, there will be more Earthly disaster to come. That’s because Roland Emmerich sold a pitch to Universal Pictures this week called Moonfall, whose premise is exactly what you might&nbsp;predict from its title.&nbsp;The sci-fi film will be&nbsp;about “an unlikely band of misfits who must unite to save humanity when the moon falls out of orbit and hurtles towards earth,” because of course it is.&nbsp;Roland Emmerich has directed nine feature films since Independence Day, but only 2000’s The Patriot received a Fresh Tomatometer score, so Moonfall is very easy to name a “Rotten Idea.”1.&nbsp;R.I.P. STAR TREK STAR ANTON YELCHIN (1989-2016)For the most part, what we report in the Weekly Ketchup are the various development deals or casting announcements that lead to movies getting made someday, and abstractly, this is all just “fun” stuff. It’s the movies! Unfortunately, sometimes there is a tragedy with very real impact on everyone involved (as well as&nbsp;the movie industry). Such a tragedy happened on Sunday, when Russian-American actor Anton Yelchin died&nbsp;in a freak accident involving his vehicle at his home in Studio City, California. Yelchin was born in Leningrad but moved to the USA as an infant, and became a child actor at the age of 9, including appearances in TV shows such as ER, Curb Your Enthusiasm, Judging Amy, and The Practice. As an adult, he enjoyed&nbsp;an impressively prolific career as a film actor, appearing in over 30 films since 2008. The role that gave Yelchin his highest profile, however, was almost certainly his version of Pavel Chekov in Star Trek, Star Trek Into Darkness, and next month’s Star Trek Beyond. (This was also a bad week for Star Trek fans for another reason, which you can read about here, and here.) Anton Yelchin’s Certified Fresh films included Star Trek, Like Crazy, Only Lovers Left Alive, Experimenter, From Up on Poppy Hill, and the remake of Fright Night, and he&nbsp;leaves behind several completed&nbsp;films awaiting release, including Star Trek Beyond, Thoroughbred, Remertory, We Don’t Belong Here, Porto, and the Netflix series with Guillermo Del Toro called Trollhunters.&nbsp;Yelchin will be greatly missed by both fellow film collaborators and moviegoers in general.","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"Travel, It, twilight, DirecTV","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/24134130/Darth-Vader-Ketchup.jpg","slug":"james-earl-jones-to-voice-darth-vader-in-rogue-one-and-more-movie-news"},{"id":"47509206330913","title":"Weekly Ketchup: Pixar Confirms The Incredibles 2 and Cars 3","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Weekly Ketchup: Pixar Confirms The Incredibles 2 and Cars 3Plus, lots of other sequel news.by RT Staff | March 21, 2014 |  CommentsIn the same week when much of the online news buzz was about March Madness and missing Malaysians, movies mustered much attention as well. Included in this week’s Ketchup are news stories about upcoming sequels like Cars 3, The Fantastic Four 2, Ghostbusters 3, The Incredibles 2, Jurassic World, and The Wolverine 2.This Week’s Top StoryPIXAR CONFIRMS PLANS FOR THE INCREDIBLES 2 AND CARS 3This November marks the 10th anniversary of the release of the Pixar animated adventure The Incredibles (which was followed by Cars in 2006). This week, Disney CEO Robert Iger announced plans for new sequels to both. The news of The Incredibles 2 doesn’t immediately come with confirmation that writer/director Brad Bird will returning for the sequel (though previous reports have suggested he’s worked on a sequel script). Bird is currently working on his live action science fiction adventure Tomorrowland (with George Clooney), which Walt Disney Pictures has scheduled for release on May 22, 2015. As for Cars 3, it will actually be the fifth movie in a franchise that includes the spinoffs Planes and the upcoming Planes: Fire &amp; Rescue (7/18/14).Fresh Developments This Week#1 WINTER IS COMING, SURE… BUT WHAT ABOUT A GAME OF THRONES MOVIE?Every day, every week, and every month that goes by without George R.R. Martin finishing books 6 and 7 of the planned seven book series A Song of Fire and Ice means that the HBO series Game of Thrones is getting closer and closer to catching up with him. Well, you know what moves a lot slower than premium series production? Big screen movies, and that might end up being part of George R.R. Martin’s master plan, the author revealed this week. Specifically, Martin was quoted as saying, “Do we run for seven years? Do we run for eight? Do we run for 10? The books get bigger and bigger (in scope). It might need a feature to tie things up, something with a feature budget, like $100 million for two hours. Those dragons get real big, you know.” Martin also teased that his Westeros prequel novellas Tales of Dunk and Egg could also someday become movies. Of course, this is also a good point to note that nothing in the original story with Martin’s quotes actually says that anyone plans on making these hypothetical $100 million movies. In other related news, the Game of Thrones show runners re-upped with HBO this week for another two seasons.&nbsp;#2 CHRISTIAN BALE REVEALED AS DAVID FINCHER’S MUST-HAVE STEVE JOBSIt should be obvious, but many times when an actor or director is described as being “in negotiations,” those talks involve something other than money or scheduling; sometimes it’s people that they’d like to work with on the project. This week, we first heard of a new report that the crucial element in David Fincher’s decision to direct Sony Pictures’ Steve Jobs biopic is the actor to play Jobs. That actor is Christian Bale, who has not previously worked with David Fincher, but is apparently one of Fincher’s dream leads, especially to play Steve Jobs in the movie scripted by Aaron Sorkin. Aaron Sorkin and David Fincher previously worked together on the Facebook movie The Social Network, while Christian Bale recently wrapped filming of Ridley Scott’s Exodus, in which he plays Moses.&nbsp;#3 EVERYTHING IS AWESOME WHEN YOU’RE PART OF THE GHOSTBUSTERS TEAMIn the same week in which we learned that Ivan Reitman has dropped out of directing Ghostbusters 3 following the death of his friend Harold Ramis, we’ve already heard who Sony Pictures hopes will replace him as director. Or, we should say, as directorS, because the negotiations in question have begun with the team of Phil Lord and Chris Miller. Lord and Miller are on quite a roll, as their relatively short filmography includes such hit films as Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs, 21 Jump Street, and The LEGO Movie, all of which have each grossed at least $200 million in worldwide box office. Filming of Ghostbusters 3 is expected to start in New York City in early 2015, and the premise involves a new generation of Ghostbusters aided by cameo or supporting roles for actors and characters from the first two movies. In other Sony “big movie” news this week, director Marc Webb has confirmed that he won’t be returning to direct The Amazing Spider-Man 4, which Sony has scheduled for May 4, 2018.&nbsp;#4 SOFIA COPPOLA IN TALKS TO DIRECT LIVE ACTION THE LITTLE MERMAIDIn our modern social networking era, there are certain movie news stories that sort of burst online, inspiring lots of jokes and such that reveal most people don’t actually know what they’re talking about. Of course, that’s what columns like this are for. So, the Internet heard this week that Sofia Coppola (Lost in Translation) is in talks to direct a live action version of The Little Mermaid, and the posts started flying fast about who might play Sebastian or Ursula or Scuttle. The thing is, that the answer is probably “no one,” because this is not a live action remake of Disney’s animated film, but a direct adaptation of the original story by Hans Christian Anderson. In addition to being live action, it also won’t be a musical. This movie is being produced by Working Title for Universal Pictures, and formerly had Joe Wright (Atonement) in talks to direct. Caroline Thompson (Edward Scissorhands) is currently rewriting the script for Sofia Coppola.&nbsp;#5 WE NOW KNOW THE IDENTITY OF THE ONLY ORIGINAL CAST MEMBER RETURNING FOR JURASSIC WORLDEvery time a new cast member is announced for Jurassic World, commenters invariably talk about various cast members from the earlier films that they hope will be returning for movie #4. The one cast member who actually is returning is someone who you almost never see mentioned in such fancasting. B.D. Wong (who is also recognizable from OZ and Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit) will be returning to play genetic scientist Dr. Henry Wu, who was actually the genius who figured out how to bring dinosaurs back to life, but ended up spending “two decades living in Hammond’s shadow.” Wong joins a growing cast for Jurassic World that includes Chris Pratt, Bryce Dallas Howard, Idris Elba, Vincent D’Onofrio, Jake Johnson, Irrfan Khan, Ty Simpkins, Nick Robinson, and the recently announced Omar Sy (AKA “Bishop” from X-Men: Days of Future Past). Universal Pictures has scheduled Jurassic World for June 12, 2015.&nbsp;#6 HEY GIRL, RYAN GOSLING LOVED YOUR GREAT GRANDMA WHEN SHE DANCED FOR BUSBY BERKELEYThey just don’t make movie musicals like they used to, but even fifty years ago that was true, because by the mid-1950s, the era of Busby Berkeley choreography was pretty much done. If you’re not familiar with the films that Busby Berkeley was involved with, well, that’s what Wikipedia and YouTube are for (here’s a good place to start). Someone who apparently shares a love of Busby Berkeley is Ryan Gosling, who is producing, and may direct and star in, a Busby Berkeley film newly put into development this week at Warner Bros. The studio has acquired the Jeffrey Spivak book Buzz: The Life and Art of Busby Berkeley. Warner Bros is currently looking for a screenwriter to start work on adapting the book.&nbsp;#7 20TH CENTURY’S MARVEL PLANS FOR 2017 AND 2018: THE WOLVERINE 2, FANTASTIC FOUR 2, AND…20th Century Fox announced several release dates this week, which usually wouldn’t make enough of a wave to make the cut for the Weekly Ketchup. However, three of these movies are part of Fox’s adaptations of Marvel properties. First up, there will be The Wolverine 2 (3/3/17), which we also learned this week is scheduled to start filming after Bryan Singer wraps filming of X-Men: Apocalypse. We still don’t know if Hugh Jackman will be playing Wolverine still at that point, but we can possibly read between the lines that The Wolverine 2 might have to wait until after X-Men: Apocalypse because some of the same actors will be in both movies. That leads us directly to this story about Bryan Singer possibly wanting to include Gambit and a younger version of Nightcrawler in X-Men: Apocalypse, which we know will be set in the 1980s just like X-Men: First Class was set mostly in the 1960s, and much of X-Men: Days of Future Past is set in the 1970s. That raises the question about the X-Men of the 1990s, which we will get to, very shortly, in this piece. Although their reboot of The Fantastic Four doesn’t come out until June 19, 2015, Fox has already announced The Fantastic Four 2 for July 14, 2017. Finally, there is a “Mystery Marvel” title for Fox on July 18, 2018. And that brings us to the question of the 1990s. There are three movies this could be, and all of them could potentially be set in the 1990s: Deadpool, X-Force, or… a total reboot of X-Men. When Bryan Singer’s first movie came out in 2000, it made drastic changes to continuity. Might 2018 be the year Fox’s mutants start over from scratch completely? Or if not that, perhaps that movie will be set in the 1990s as a direct prequel to X-Men.Rotten Ideas of the Week#2 ARE YOU READY FOR A REBOOT OF THE REMAKE OF THE GRUDGE?This October marks the tenth anniversary of the release of the horror film The Grudge, which was a remake of the Japanese horror film Ju-On: The Grudge (directed by the same director). That remake also was the first production for Sam Raimi’s then-new horror production company Ghost House Pictures, which this week announced plans to reboot The Grudge as a new franchise. There’s a whole new generation that hasn’t seen a spooky little girl lurking in the background, all out of focus and spooky-like. Jeff Buhler, who wrote the 2008 horror film The Midngiht Meat Train, is currently working on the reboot script. This is one of the week’s Rotten Ideas because… really? Reboots of 2004 movies? But besides that, look at all the green splotches on this RT Tomatometer search results page.&nbsp;#1 THE 1980S CARTOON NOSTALGIA BOOM FINALLY GETS AROUND TO… JEM AND THE HOLOGRAMSThere’s only so many hours in the day, and in the mid 1980s, this writer just didn’t have enough of those to spend much time watching (or even being aware of) a cartoon series like Jem and the Holograms, so you’re not going to be seeing any nostalgia here. Not everyone, however, apparently agrees, because at least three people got together to announce that they’re working on a live action Jem and the Holograms movie. Those three would be director Jon M. Chu (Justin Bieber’s Believe, G.I. Joe: Retaliation) and his producing partners Scooter Braun (a record producer) and Jason Blum (of Blumhouse, the horror production company behind the Paranormal Activity franchise). The new movie about a pop singer aided by a “holographic computer” is looking for help from fans, and you can watch their video pitch at the newly launched website. Besides other, possibly more obvious reasons, this is one of the week’s Rotten Ideas, because Justin Bieber: Never Say Never is the only Fresh movie on Jon M. Chu’s resume.For more Weekly Ketchup columns by Greg Dean Schmitz, check out the WK archive, and you can contact GDS via Facebook.","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"2020, blaxploitation, Lucasfilm, TV, Fox, thriller, fresh, cinemax, adventure, comiccon, History, TV, Games, Amazon, Nominations","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/incredibles-2.jpg","slug":"weekly-ketchup-pixar-confirms-the-incredibles-2-and-cars-3"},{"id":"47509222165193","title":"Annual Ketchup: The Most Rotten Developments of 2010","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Annual Ketchup: The Most Rotten Developments of 2010A wrap-up of the worst news about new movies this year.by Greg Dean Schmitz | December 30, 2010 |  CommentsLast week, we brought you the freshest film developments for each month of 2010.

In addition to also starring in some silly emo vampire/werewolf franchise, Lautner’s name was attached in the last year (and the last part of 2009) to titles like Northern Lights (a Top Gun-ish action movie), Cancun (a hostage thriller) and Abduction (about a young man who discovers he’s a “missing person”). The most Rotten Idea however had to be the casting of Sharkboy in Hasbro and Universal’s superhero/toy movie Stretch Armstrong. That movie is based upon a toy popular in the 1970s and 1980s that had arms and legs that kids could play tug of war over, basically. Stretch Armstrong will also be a return to 3D for the former Sharkboy star, no doubt with plenty of scenes where his limbs will look like they’re right in your face. Lautner had been attached to star in the action figure movie Max Steel, but he eventually dropped out of the project to allow time in his upcoming schedule for Stretch Armstrong, which is scheduled for 2012.MARCH 5: WHO MADE STEVE GUTTENBERG A STAR? POLICE ACADEMY DID.This was a big year for Rotten Ideas involving former 1980s movie star Steve Guttenberg. In June, it was revealed that there are plans at Disney for Three Men and a Bride, a third movie in the franchise reuniting Guttenberg with Ted Danson and Tom Selleck. The slightly more Rotten Idea came in March, however, when we learned that New Line Cinema is developing a reboot of the Police Academy franchise. This reboot is Rotten on two levels, as the original movie was actually one of the funniest comedies of the 1980s (making it a bad idea for a remake). And then, Police Academy went on to have five sequels, which were progressively more and more awful. Despite a great start, the franchise is associated today with the trend of over-sequelizing what was great in one movie, until people are just tired of seeing any more. The Police Academy reboot also has the challenge of finding another black comedian who can make “funny” noises with his mouth.MARCH 12: ALVIN AND THE CHIPMUNKS 3DOne of the biggest stories of 2010 was the inundation of 3D movies, which cost more to attend, but didn’t always deliver enough cinematic dazzle to match the higher ticket price. Dozens of movies were announced as 3D projects, and this particularly applied to any franchise that was preparing for its third movie, such as Alvin and the Chipmunks 3D. The initial announcement by 20th Century Fox for the sequel included a release date of December 16, 2011. However, in October, when more information came out, the title had been changed to Alvin and the Chipmunks: Chip-Wrecked, and it’s no longer necessarily going to be in 3D. However, the sequel, to be directed by Mike Mitchell (Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo, Shrek Forever After), is still an Alvin and the Chipmunks movie, which for many movie fans is Rotten enough.APRIL 2: HEIDI MONTAG IN 3DJames Cameron may have been able to use 3D in Avatar as something other than a gimmick, but many people behind the 3D projects announced this year appear to be quite comfortable with the trend being just that; a gimmick. Take Heidi Montag, for example (seriously, someone just take her away so I don’t have to write about her anymore!). After starring for six seasons in MTV’s “reality” show The Hills, Heidi Montag spent much of 2010 talking about her numerous plastic surgery procedures (including a day in November, 2009 where she reportedly had ten procedures at once). One (or rather, two) of the physical alterations that Montag appears to be most ready to exploit however are the volleyballs she now has attached to her torso. Heidi Montag is developing a 3D shark attack beach movie in which she would costar with Dolly Parton (as the town’s mayor). Possibly inspired by the release this year of Piranha 3-D, Montag’s movie is not the only 3D shark attack movie, however. Just a week after her movie was announced, director David R. Ellis (Snakes on a Plane) revealed his own plans for Shark Night 3D.JULY 2: BLOODTHIRSTY ZOMBIE KIDS GO TO SCHOOL AND FALL IN LOVE AT VAMPIRE ACADEMYThe publishing and cinematic successes of Stephenie Meyer’s Twilight franchise has inspired many similar series (just go check your local bookstore’s massive “Young Adult” section). Hollywood is quick to follow, sometimes snapping up the rights to these properties before the first book in a series is even published. There were many of these deals in 2010, but the one I will single out in this year-end Rotten Idea wrap up is Vampire Academy. Richelle Mead’s series of books is one of the most popular to follow Twilight, but it’s a Rotten Idea because the premise is also one of the silliest and trades upon the elements of Twilight that most get non-Twilight fans all riled up. Vampire Academy is about a school in Montana attended by bloodthirsty zombies who also fall in love with each other and get very angsty about the whole situation.AUGUST 6: JUSTIN BIEBER AND THE MOST ROTTEN IDEA OF THE YEARThe week of August 6, 2010 was particularly rotten. What would have otherwise been the most Rotten Idea (also possibly of the year, see the next entry) was overshadowed by a story that sent the commenters into overdrive, resulting in one of the most read and discussed columns of the year. Initially announced as a biopic, the movie that we now know as Justin Bieber: Never Say Never (scheduled for February 11, 2011) now appears to mostly be more of a concert movie starring Bieber and his hair. There really isn’t much for me to say here that I didn’t already write back in August, or that wasn’t already said by you, the fans (or rather, the non-fans), at the time.AUGUST 6: THE MOST UNNECESSARY REMAKE OF THE YEAR: AN AMERICAN WEREWOLF IN LONDONThe Rotten Idea that was extremely overshadowed by Justin Bieber was Dimension Films’ decision to move forward with their plans to remake John Landis’ classic horror comedy An American Werewolf in London. The incoming new year will mark the 30th anniversary of the movie which arguably paved the way for every movie or TV show that handled a horror concept with a post-modern, tongue-in-cheek approach (like say, Fright Night and Buffy the Vampire Slayer). Screenwriter Fernley Phillips (The Number 23) was hired by Dimension Films to give Landis’ original script a “modern spin.” I’m just going to quote myself on this one: “I guess that means that when the werewolf terrorizes London this time around, there will be people standing around with phones recording it for YouTube. Great. How modern.”OCTOBER 15: THE WAY TOO LATE SEQUEL AWARD GOES TO… TOP GUN 2There is a certain optimal window of opportunity for sequels to be made (if they have to be made at all), but sometimes sequels get made way, way after their due date anyway. Basic Instinct 2 and this year’s Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps are two examples. The planned sequel to the 1986 blockbuster hit Top Gun is another. Top Gun is a relic of its age, depicting the type of aerial dogfight training that pilots don’t really use these days. Nowadays many pilots sit in a trailer in the USA controlling drone planes on the other side of the planet in scenarios that look to the outside like they’re playing a video game. Cinematically, it’s not quite the same. The reason for the Top Gun sequel being started at this late point may have to do with the recent downwards spiralling of the careers of both producer Jerry Bruckheimer and its star Tom Cruise. If Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time, The Sorcerer’s Apprentice and Knight and Day had all been huge hits, this story probably wouldn’t have needed to be written.OCTOBER 22: HOW ABOUT WE NOT DO THE TIME WARP AGAIN?In the days leading up to the airing of The Rocky Horror Glee Show episode of FOX’s Glee, the show’s creator started talks with 20th Century Fox about remaking The Rocky Horror Picture Show. The original 1975 rock &amp; roll musical is the holder of many distinctions, from how long it has been playing in theaters around the world, to how its audience transcends generations. The success of The Rocky Horror Picture Show was not immediate, and couldn’t have been predicted 35 years ago. Likewise, the chances of a new production recapturing the magic of the first movie and duplicating its success seems unlikely and an obvious Rotten Idea.NOVEMBER 19: THE YEAR HOLLYWOOD WENT OZ CRAZYAfter Disney’s Alice in Wonderland brought in over a billion dollars worldwide, Hollywood producers went on a search for similar classic titles that could be “modernized.” To match Alice in Wonderland, the obvious factors they searched for were: a classic story, family friendliness and a female heroine. This new trend has led to upcoming movies like Red Riding Hood and a few different Snow White projects. However, the one title that is seeing the most remakes, sequels and “reimaginings” is L. Frank Baum’s The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, or more specifically, the original 1939 movie starring Judy Garland as Dorothy Gale. These projects include (but are not limited to) Disney’s Oz: The Great and Powerful (directed by Sam Raimi and starring Robert Downey Jr), Universal’s adaptation of the stage musical Wicked, the violent stop motion/CGI project Oz Wars and director John Boorman’s own animated version. The trend hopefully hit its nadir with the November news that Warner Bros was considering a remake of The Wizard of Oz using the original 1939 script. Although the story was not entirely denied or debunked, Robert Zemeckis was quick to shoot down the idea of him directing the Wizard of Oz remake. Even if the remake never happens (which hopefully, it won’t), that it was even (apparently) considered still marks it as one of the year’s Most Rotten Ideas.NOVEMBER 24: BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER WITHOUT JOSS WHEDONIt’s been known since 2009 that Fran and Kaz Kazui, the other producers of the original Buffy the Vampire Slayer movie, wanted to reboot the franchise without the assistance of Joss Whedon, the writer/creator most credited with the TV show’s success. However, those plans needed a studio to step up and actually help the reboot move along, or otherwise, it would never have a chance of actually happening (thankfully). Warner Bros and Atlas Entertainment (Get Smart, Scooby Doo) did exactly that this year, which led Whedon to come out with his own statement about the idea of Buffy the Vampire Slayer being restarted without his input.DECEMBER 17: THE WEINSTEINS ARE MINING THE MIRAMAX CATALOG FOR SEQUELSProducers Harvey and Bob Weinstein established Miramax Films as a “mini major” company that had a reputation for both Academy Awards and helping young “independent” filmmakers get their start. In the following years, Miramax was sold to Disney, the Weinsteins left to start The Weinstein Company, and more recently, Disney sold Miramax to a private holding company. The Weinsteins were not able to recover ownership of Miramax, but they still have plans to work with the Miramax brand, or at least the many famous movies that were released by Miramax during its best days. Specifically, The Weinstein Company and Miramax Films are partnering on an ambitious series of sequels to movies like Bad Santa, Bridget Jones’s Diary, Rounders, and Shakespeare in Love. It’s possible some of these planned sequels might end up being great movies (especially if the original filmmakers are involved, and/or a sequel makes sense for the story in question). However, the larger story here sounds like movies being “sequelized” more as a way of making extra dough off familiar and beloved titles than because the storytelling process actually demands them. As with Joss Whedon and Buffy, Kevin Smith had his own comments about the idea of Clerks being included in this list of movies to potentially get sequels. Remakes and 3D may have recently come to dominate the “Rotten Idea” field, but needless sequelizing, that’s just plain classic. Classically rotten, that is.And those were the twelve most rotten developments of 2010. Check back next week as the regular Weekly Ketchup returns, hopefully with more fresh than rotten news.For more Weekly Ketchup columns by Greg Dean Schmitz, check out the WK archive, and you can contact GDS via a RT forum message.","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"review, language, TV, rotten, TV, comic, AMC, Columbia, Election, game-of-thrones","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Annual-Ketchup-The-Most-Rotten-Developments-of-2010"},{"id":"47509222169291","title":"Weekly Ketchup: Sequels for Bad Santa and Shakespeare in Love?","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Weekly Ketchup: Sequels for Bad Santa and Shakespeare in Love?Plus casting news for George Clooney and Neve Campbellby Greg Dean Schmitz | December 17, 2010 |  CommentsAs Christmas approaches, you would think Hollywood would be taking a break from big announcements, but that hunch would only be half right. Although there are few huge new movies in this week’s rundown, there was an unusually high amount of news about “little movies.” Included in the mix are sequels for potentially dozens of acclaimed Miramax movies, remakes of Firestarter and Gambit, and new roles for George Clooney, Sacha Baron Cohen and Colin Firth.THIS WEEK’S TOP STORYTHE WEINSTEIN COMPANY PLANNING A NEW WAVE OF MIRAMAX SEQUELSEarlier this year, Harvey and Bob Weinstein, founders or Miramax Films, attempted to buy back the company that they had founded from Walt Disney Pictures. Last week, that effort lost out as the rights were instead sold to a company called Filmyard Holdings. The relationship between the Weinsteins and Miramax is not over, however. This week, The Weinstein Company announced plans to partner with the new Miramax Films on theatrical sequels, direct-to-video sequels and TV shows based upon many Miramax movies. At the top of the list are planned sequels for Bad Santa, the poker drama Rounders and the Oscar-winning Shakespeare in Love. Other titles that were also mentioned in the initial announcement were: The Amityville Horror (itself a remake), Bridget Jones’s Diary (which already had a sequel), Kevin Smith’s Clerks (which had a sequel and an animated TV show), Copland (starring Sylvester Stallone), Robert Rodriguez’s From Dusk Till Dawn (which already had a direct-to-video sequel and prequel), Shall We Dance? (also a remake) and Doug Liman’s Swingers (which launched the careers of Jon Favreau and Vince Vaughn). Miramax and The Weinstein Company are already working together on Scream 4, Spy Kids 4: All the Time in the World (both due in 2011) and Scary Movie 5. This latest announcement suggests a much larger focus on “franchising” movies that previously seemed like stand-alone films. One person for whom this was very big news is director Kevin Smith, who was quick to comment about the suggestion that there will be a Clerks 3. Smith said, “Nice to know there’s a home for ‘Clerks III‘ if I ever wanted to make it, but hope it doesn’t become a home for a Clerks-anything if I’m not involved.” Smith also clarified that although Miramax owns the rights to several of his movies, they do not own the characters of Jay and Silent Bob (Wlliam Shakespeare could not be reached for comment about the idea of a Shakespeare in Love Part Deux). The notion of so many beloved Miramax movies getting sequels apparently inspired only by potential box office would have normally made this the week’s Most Rotten Idea, if it wasn’t also the week’s Top Story.”FRESH DEVELOPMENTS THIS WEEK#1 THE WRITING TEAM OF BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN ADAPTING TWO NOVELS ABOUT THE COMANCHESLarry McMurtry is both a novelist and a screenwriter, and he has been responsible for three movie/TV titles that will assuredly be in his obituary someday: The Last Picture Show, Lonesome Dove and Brokeback Mountain. Larry McMurtry adapted Brokeback Mountain from a short story by Annie Proulx with his screenwriting partner Diana Ossana. McMurtry and Ossana have now announced that they are working together again on adapting two different novels set in the time of the American Wild West. First, there is The Color of Lightning by Paulette Jiles, which 20th Century Fox is producing for Ridley Scott (Alien, Gladiator) to direct someday (Scott is attached to many, many projects, including the upcoming Alien prequel). The Color of Lightning is loosely based on a true story (which was reportedly also the basis for The Searchers) and tells the story of a freed slave who settles in Texas with his family with dreams of starting a freight business. However, Comanche raiders kill his oldest son and kidnap the rest of his family, inspiring the former slave to plot revenge against the Comanches. The other project is at Warner Bros (though also produced by Scott Free) and is an adaptation of Empire of the Summer Moon by S.C. Gwynne. This book also involves the Comanche tribe, but is instead more of a heroic “Braveheart-style epic” biopic. Empire of the Summer Moon tells the true story of Quanah, the last leader of his people, who was the son of a white woman and led his tribe in their final battles against the white man.#2 CHARMING GEORGE CLOONEY REPLACES CHARMING ROBERT DOWNEY, JR IN GRAVITYThe casting of Gravity, the Warner Bros science fiction movie, has been rocky. The female lead was first Angelina Jolie, and then Natalie Portman, and now finally, it is Sandra Bullock. Likewise, the role of the male astronaut who also survives a space station disaster was initially to be played by Robert Downey, Jr and then he also dropped out. Now, that role has gone to George Clooney, who has a long history of working with Warner Bros, including the Ocean’s Eleven movies and Batman &amp; Robin. Gravity will be the next movie for director Alfonso Cuaron (Children of Men, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban), who also cowrote the script with his son Jonas Cuaron. Cuaron expects to start filming soon, and Gravity will be filmed in 3D.#3 COOL DOWN, FANBOYS, GAMBIT ISN’T WHAT YOU THINKThe Coen Brothers’ remake of True Grit is still a week away from release, but there is already another remake that the acclaimed directors have written (although they won’t be directing). Gambit was a twisty-turny 1966 crime comedy starring Michael Caine as a cat burglar and Shirley MacLaine as a waitress who looks just like the dead wife of a millionaire who owns a priceless statue they are trying to steal. Colin Firth is currently in talks to take on the lead role previously played by Michael Caine. Instead of the Coen Brothers, the Gambit remake will be directed by Michael Hoffman (One Fine Day, The Last Station, Soapdish). Production is expected to start in the summer of 2011 in London and Texas.#4 JOSH HARTNETT AND NEVE CAMPBELL TO SHARE A SINGULARITYJosh Hartnett is attached, and Neve Campbell is in negotiations to star in the drama Singularity about intertwining souls set in two stories hundreds of years apart. Hartnett will play both a 1778 British officer in colonial India and a 2015 archaeologist who falls into a coma, with Neve Campbell playing his 2015 wife, who gets stuck in a sunken ship while trying to retrieve a ring (from 1778, it’s easy to guess). Singularity is the latest movie from director Roland Joffe, whose impressive resume includes The Mission, The Scarlet Letter, The Killing Fields and the not-as-impressive Super Mario Bros. Filming of Singularity is scheduled to start in January at locations in India and Australia.ROTTEN IDEAS OF THE WEEK#5 SACHA BARON COHEN MAY GET RACIST IN THE TORRENTE REMAKESacha Baron Cohen’s next “crazy foreigner loose in America” movie after Borat and Brüno will be The Dictator, which starts filming in early 2011. However, the actor/comedian is already considering another project, in the form of an English language remake of the Spanish film franchise Torrente. Torrente is about a lazy, selfish, rude, drunk, sexist, racist ultra-right-wing cop who “traffics in all manner of shady outrageousness in pursuit of his own brand of justice.” There are already three Spanish Torrente movies, and a fourth will be released soon. Sacha Baron Cohen has reportedly already met several times with New Line Cinema about the remake. The writing team of Alec Berg, Jeff Schaffer and David Mandel are currently working on the script. Those three writers are all former Seinfeld writers, and also worked together on EuroTrip, The Cat in the Hat and Cohen’s next movie, The Dictator. This is one of the week’s Rotten Ideas based mostly on the Tomatometer scores for The Cat in the Hat and EuroTrip (although Seinfeld was certainly a very good show).#4 JON FAVREAU DITCHES IRON MAN 3 FOR THE MAGIC KINGDOMJon Favreau announced this week that he has decided to drop out of directing Iron Man 3 so that he may instead focus on Disney’s The Magic Kingdom, which is expected to do for their theme park what Night at the Museum did for… museums. Favreau’s recent quotes about the future of the Iron Man movies can now be seen as hint-dropping that he was leaving the franchise, as he appeared to no longer really know the answers to the questions. There is no word yet as to who might replace Jon Favreau on Iron Man 3, but gives fans plenty of opportunity to discuss who they think should next take on Tony Stark. Although there’s as much of a chance that the next Iron Man director could be fantastic, this is one of the week’s Rotten Ideas because Marvel Studios is losing the one director who has thus far delivered the best superhero movies for them.#3 OZ WARS ALSO HEADING DOWN THE YELLOW BRICK ROADHollywood is engaged in a major multi-project obsession with movies that will revisit the classic fantasy of L. Frank Baum’s The Wonderful Wizard of Oz. These projects include (but are not limited to) Universal’s plans to adapt the musical Wicked, Disney’s Oz: The Great and Powerful, to be directed by Sam Raimi and star Robert Downey Jr. and director John Boorman’s plans for an animated version of The Wizard of Oz. That last project now has competition in the form of a stop-motion/CGI hybrid animated movie called Oz Wars. Oz Wars will be directed by Mike Johnson, who was Tim Burton’s codirector on Corpse Bride (which was also stop-motion animation). The company behind Oz Wars is Vanguard Films, which previously has produced movies like Valiant, Happily N’Ever After and Space Chimps. Oz Wars will not be “just for kids,” as it “transforms the Oz narrative into a contemporary, freaky action-packed PG-13 audience pleaser, with Dorothy caught up in a whirlwind of warrior witches, black magic, martial arts and monsters.” Oz Wars was written by Rob Moreland (cowriter of Space Chimps and Happily N’Ever After) and Athena Gam (who is also writing Vanguard’s upcoming Alien Rock Band). Oz Wars may end up being a good movie, but for now it is one of this week’s Rotten Ideas both because of the number of Oz movies and the screenwriters’ credits have low Tomatometer scores.#2 DISNEY NOW MAKING MOVIES ABOUT THEME PARK ATTRACTIONS THAT WERE NEVER EVEN BUILTAs Walt Disney Pictures continues development on several movies based on popular (and not so popular) Disney theme park attractions, the studio is now considering a movie based on one that was never built. Back in the 1960s, Walt Disney (the man, not the company) had an idea called “The Museum of the Weird” which would have been next to the Haunted Mansion, and would have included “ghostly organists, magic carts, talking chairs and other surreal exhibits” (as well as a restaurant). However, the Museum of the Weird was never actually built, and some of the ideas were instead incorporated into the the Haunted Mansion itself. Now, actor-turned-budding-screenwriter Ahmet Zappa (who is also working on a Disney script based on the Enchanted Tiki Room) is talking with the studio about adapting The Museum of the Weird into a movie of its own. Zappa’s idea is to adapt the museum first as a movie, and then for Disney to introduce a theme park attraction later on based on the movie. This is one of this week’s Rotten Ideas simply because Disney is starting to sound like they are literally running out of theme park attractions to turn into movies.#1 HOLLYWOOD REMEMBERS A 1980S SCI-FI MOVIE THEY HAVEN’T REMADE YET: FIRESTARTERAlthough many of them are still in development, it’s getting harder and harder to think of a 1980s science fiction movie that hasn’t either already been remade, or is in some stage of development as a remake. This week, that list got even shorter as Universal Pictures and Dino De Laurentiis (he may have died recently, but his company continues on) announced plans for a remake of 1984’s Firestarter. That original movie was an adaptation of a 1980 novel by Stephen King and told the story of a little girl (played by a then 8-year-old Drew Barrymore) with pyrokinesis (starting fires with your mind) who is kept hostage at a secret government facility. Drew Barrymore was also joined by an impressive cast of grown ups on Firestarter which included George C. Scott, Art Carney, Louise Fletcher, Martin Sheen, and as her parents, David Keith and Heather Locklear. Firestarter is a great overlooked sci-fi drama exactly because Drew Barrymore was credible as a little girl with a terrible and destructive “gift” who was also scared and extremely vulnerable. Universal is developing this remake to take advantage of “recent visual effects advances” and so that the “the main character [will] be reinvented with a little more edge.” Right, because an 8-year-old with the ability to start massive explosions is not “edgy” enough. Actually, the very reason Firestarter worked was that Barrymore’s “Charlie” was not “edgy.” The studio also hopes that the Firestarter remake will lead to a new franchise that “can be extended in a new and exciting direction.” The idea of a Firestarter remake is easily this week’s Most Rotten Idea mainly because Firestarter is perfect exactly the way it is. The movie is not at all dated, and is highly recommended to any fans of the genre. Basically, Firestarter was the first X-Men movie some 15 years before an actual Marvel adaptation got made.For more Weekly Ketchup columns by Greg Dean Schmitz, check out the WK archive, and you can contact GDS via a RT forum message.","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"book, cancelled, Emmy, visit, Fresh, doctor, 2016, archives, hidden","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Weekly-Ketchup-Sequels-for-Bad-Santa-and-Shakespeare-in-Love"},{"id":"47509220719291","title":"Weekly Ketchup: Will and Jaden Smith to Work with M.

Night Shyamalanby Greg Dean Schmitz | April 8, 2011 |  CommentsThis Week’s Ketchup includes new roles for Steve Carell, Keira Knightley, Robert Redford, Keanu Reeves, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Hailee Steinfeld, Will Smith and Jaden Smith, as well as news about a possible Time Bandits remake and Peter Jackson’s upcoming Adventures of Tintin movie.This Week’s Top StoryWILL AND JADEN SMITH LEND THEIR BOX OFFICE APPEAL TO M. NIGHT SHYAMALAN’S AMBITIOUS SCI-FI MOVIEDirector M. Night Shyamalan has been something of a fanboy punching bag for quite some time (since before The Happening, even). However, Hollywood loves box office math, and The Last Airbender actually took in $319 million worldwide, despite being perceived as a box office bomb here in the USA. M. Night’s chances of repeating that success increased substantially this week with news that both Will Smith and his son Jaden Smith have signed to star in Shyamalan’s untitled science fiction project (formerly titled One Thousand A.E., which stood for “After Earth”). Set 1,000 years in the future, the movie will be about a young boy who has to navigate the “abandoned and sometimes scary Earth to save himself and his estranged father after their ship crashes.” This will be the second time that Will and Jaden have played father and son, after 2006’s The Pursuit of Happyness. Will Smith also produced the remake of The Karate Kid, which was of course, was also a surprise box office success of Will Smith-style proportions. The script was cowritten by M. Night Shyamalan (who wrote or cowrote most of his previous movies) and Gary Whitta (The Book of Eli). This science fiction epic will be produced and distributed by Columbia Pictures, which has a long history with both Will and Jaden Smith, which includes the Bad Boys and Men in Black franchises, as well as Hancock, The Karate Kid and The Pursuit of Happyness. Although this story might arguably be a “Rotten Idea” (depending upon what you think of M. Night Shyamalan), the obvious box office potential of Will and Jaden Smith is what lands it as this week’s Top Story.Fresh Developments This Week#1 ROBERT REDFORD RETURNS TO BASEBALL IN A MOVIE ABOUT JACKIE ROBINSONProfessional sports has so long been a (mostly) integrated field (we’ll just ignore hockey), that it is difficult to imagine that it was just 64 years ago that Jackie Robinson broke the color barrier by becoming the first African American Major League Baseball player. Now, in a move that brings to mind one of the greatest baseball movies ever made (The Natural), Robert Redford has signed to star in an untitled movie about Jackie Robinson and Brooklyn Dodgers executive Branch Rickey (who Redford will play). The untitled drama will be produced by Legendary Pictures, the Warner Bros-based company better known for big special effects movies like 300, Christopher Nolan’s Batman movies and Watchmen. The script was originally written by Kirk Ellis, who is best known for the HBO miniseries John Adams and TV biopics about Anne Frank, The Beach Boys and The Three Stooges. Ellis’ script was then rewritten by Brian Helgeland (Mystic River; cowriter of L.A. Confidential), who will also direct (A Knight’s Tale, Payback). Rather than solely being about how Jackie Robinson broke the color barrier, the movie is expected to also focus on Robinson’s partnership with Branch Rickey, and both the personal ideological and business reasons why Rickey signed Robinson to the Brooklyn Dodgers. This untitled movie is expected to be the first time Robert Redford has starred in a movie since 2007’s Lions for Lambs, and the first time he’s starred in a movie he didn’t direct since 2005’s An Unfinished Life.#2 WHAT LIGHT THROUGH YONDER WINDOW BREAKS? AND JULIET IS… HAILEE STEINFELDSince the remake of True Grit proved to be both a box office and critical success, young newcomer Hailee Steinfeld has been the focus of much casting attention. In addition to being a front runner to star in The Hunger Games (which eventually went to Jennifer Lawrence instead), Paramount is developing a teen thriller called Forgotten for Steinfeld, and she is also attached to a possible new Sleeping Beauty movie as well (as reported here last week). The movie that is closest to actually happening, however, was announced this week: Hailee Steinfeld is in talks to star as Juliet in a $15 million, independent adaptation of William Shakespeare’s Romeo and Juliet, which is likely to be the highest profile adaptation of the classic romance since Baz Luhrmann’s modernized Romeo + Juliet in 1996. At 14, Hailee Steinfeld will have the distinction of being the youngest actress to ever star in a Romeo and Juliet movie, which is after all, supposed to be a story of ill-fated teen lovers. Olivia Hussey, star of the 1968 version directed by Franco Zefferelli was just a year older than Steinfeld, at age 15. This latest version is likely to be a more faithful adaptation, as filming is scheduled to start in Italy later this spring, helmed by Italian director Carlo Carlie (Fluke, The Flight of the Innocent). Academy Award winning screenwriter Julian Fellowes (Gosford Park, The Young Victoria) adapted the original Shakespeare play.#3 DETAILS OF PETER JACKSON’S ADVENTURES OF TINTIN REVEALEDThe world is still several months away from seeing whether Steven Spielberg’s CGI motion capture adaptation of Herge’s The Adventures of Tintin: The Secret of the Unicorn works as a movie or not. The Adventures of Tintin was a series of 24 graphic novels about the globetrotting adventures of a young Belgian reporter that was one of the most recognizable children’s book series of the 20th century (but was never quite as popular in the USA). The plan was always for Steven Spielberg to direct the first movie (which he has), and for his coproducer Peter Jackson to then direct the second movie. Along the way, Peter Jackson ended up spending years working on more J.R.R. Tolkien movies (the two parts of The Hobbit, due out in late 2012 and late 2013). That has undoubtedly slowed down Jackson’s ability to actually make the second Tintin movie, but this week, we at least found out exactly what that movie will be about. British author Anthony Horowitz, creator of Alex Ryder: Operation Stormbreaker (he also adapted his book for that movie) revealed this week that he is working on adapting the next Tintin, which will be based upon Prisoners of the Sun, the 14th book in the series. Prisoners of the Sun was actually the second part of a two book adventure set in the Peruvian Andes, involving a newly-discovered group of modern day Incans, so it is likely that the 13th book, The Seven Crystal Balls, will also be adapted as part of the movie. It would be strange for the movie to just start in the middle of the story. There’s no word yet on when Peter Jackson will be available to start filming The Adventures of Tintin: Prisoners of the Sun. Most of the voice/motion capture cast of the first movie, including Jamie Bell, Andy Serkis, Simon Pegg and Nick Frost are expected to return for this second movie.#4 BRITISH CULT TV SERIES THE SWEENEY GETTING A MOVIE REBOOTAdapting old American TV shows into big screen movies is a decades old tradition (remember The Mod Squad and Dragnet?) with varying results. What is less common is the same being done with classic old British TV shows. The Sweeney was a cool and action-filled 1975-1978 British cop show that has been acknowledged as an inspiration for both Hot Fuzz and the original British TV show Life on Mars. Now, The Sweeney is also getting a movie adaptation makeover of its own, with a modern setting and Ray Winstone (Sexy Beast, The Departed) and relative newcomer Ben Drew (Harry Brown) as members of London’s “Flying Squad” branch of specialist detectives. The remake of The Sweeney promises to be “packed full of fast cars, action and wisecracks,” and will be directed by Nick Love (Outlaw, The Football Factory) from a script by frequent Danny Boyle collaborator John Hodge (Trainspotting, The Beach, Shallow Grave).#5 STEVE CARELL AND KEIRA KNIGHTLEY TO BE AN UNLIKELY ROMANTIC DUO AT THE END OF THE WORLDIt is inevitable that a certain number of romantic comedies are going to be made each year. The genre may be mostly shallow and predictable, but “movie dates” are unlikely to be going away any time soon. So, if we’re going to have to have them anyway, it’s refreshing when a project is announced that seems to at least be trying something new. Steve Carell (age 48) and Keira Knightley (age 26) are in talks to costar in Seeking a Friend for the End of the World. With the world ending, Carell’s character goes off on a road trip to find his high school sweetheart, and he is accompanied by his neighbor, to be played by Keira Knightley. So, the age gap between Carell and Knightley is not necessarily significant, and is probably a big part of the comedy. Seeking a Friend for the End of the World will be the directorial debut of (and was written by) Lorene Scafaria, who made her debut adapting Nick and Norah’s Infinite Playlist. Filming is expected to start in May, 2011, as Steve Carell’s first movie after leaving his run on NBC’s The Office.#6 KEANU REEVES SAYS, “WHOA, I KNOW… TAI CHI.”Is it really now 12 years since Keanu Reeves and Laurence Fishburne had their big kung fu training session in The Matrix? That film fundamentally changed action movies and elevated Keanu Reeves to being a true A-list star. Now, Keanu Reeves has his eye on making his directorial debut with Man of Tai Chi. Reeves would also costar as the film’s villain, which will be set in the modern day, but pay homage to older kung fu movies. Man of Tai Chi doesn’t yet have financing, but is expected to be an international collaboration, filmed in both Chinese and English, and filmed in China as well. No other details are known about Man of Tai Chi yet, but there is a script (by an unknown writer). Man of Tai Chi almost landed in the Rotten Idea category, but as an unknown property, this writer is giving Keanu Reeves the benefit of the doubt. It sounds at least more promising than 47 Ronin, which the star is currently filming in 3D for a November 21, 2012 release. Also looming on the horizon is the possibility of a third Bill &amp; Ted movie.Rotten Ideas of the Week#3 THE CAST OF THE THREE STOOGES MAKES IT LOOK LIKE A TV SHOW PILOTOnce upon a time, the expected cast of the Peter and Bobby Farrelly’s ambitious Three Stooges movie included such big name movie stars as Jim Carrey, Sean Penn and Benicio Del Toro. Oh, how times have changed. The actors that the Farrellys have actually been able to cast as two of the stooges were announced in the last several days. Sean Hayes, who is best known for being flamboyant in the long-running TV show Will &amp; Grace will star as Larry and Will Sasso (from MadTV) will play Curly. Sasso does bear a resemblance to Curly Howard, but the choice of Sean Hayes is arguably bewildering and difficult to imagine. One possibility is that the Farrelly Brothers may be reimagining Larry as being gay (not that Sean Hayes can’t play straight, but his sexuality is almost what he’s known for). Moe remains uncast, although Johnny Knoxville is frequently mentioned. In addition to his TV work, Sean Hayes has mostly done just movie voice work (Igor and Cats &amp; Dogs: The Revenge of Kitty Galore), with his last live action appearance being a small role in 2007’s The Bucket List. The TV show connections don’t end with Will Sasso and Sean Hayes, as Sofia Vergara (ABC’s Modern Family) is also in talks to play an unspecified female lead. Another actress that the Farrelly Brothers have mentioned as hoping to cast is Cher, who would play the Mother Superior that the Stooges “terrorize” early in the film. Rather than being a biopic, or even one feature length story, The Three Stooges will be an anthology of three half hour segments, each using a different classic Three Stooges score, and filmed in a different style from the original Stooges’ lengthy career of comedic short films.#2 ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER’S PLANS TO “BE BACK” IN MOVIES INCLUDE THE GOVERNATORLast week, Arnold Schwarzenegger launched a pretty big publicity push for the upcoming 52 episode animated TV series The Governator. The obviously self-aware and over-the-top cartoon (produced by Stan Lee) depicts a retired Arnold Schwarzenegger as a superhero who fights such threats as “robots rampaging through San Francisco” (no, seriously!), set against the music of the Black Eyed Peas’ “Pump It,” and includes a sight gag borrowed from Three Kings. Well, The Governator won’t be limited to just TV screens, as this week Arnold Schwarzenegger revealed that the plan is for the TV show to lead to a 3D feature film in early 2013. What was unclear about the announcement is whether the 3D movie will also be animated, or if it will feature Schwarzenegger as a live action version of his new superhero alter ego. As for what Schwarzenegger’s first live action post-gubernatorial role will be, he’s reportedly narrowed the list down to two choices: The Last Stand or The Tomb. The Last Stand would be directed by Korean filmmaker Kim Jee-woon (A Tale of Two Sisters; The Good, the Bad, the Weird; I Saw the Devil), and is about an American sheriff fighting a Mexican drug cartel threatening his small town. The Tomb would be directed by Antoine Fuqua (Training Day, King Arthur), and is about an architect who must escape from the super prison that helped design (sort of like a cross between The Rock and Flightplan). Whether you think any of this belongs in the “Rotten Idea” category probably depends upon what you think of Arnold Schwarzenegger as a movie star, and possibly upon whether you think The Governator is either inherently “stupid” (in a bad way), or “so stupid it’s AWESOME.”#1 TIME BANDITS PROVES THAT NO CHERISHED RELIC OF YOUR CHILDHOOD IS SAFE FROM BEING REMADEDue to the timing of April Fool’s Day, last week’s column was written a day early, and so this story is technically from last week, but it was too Rotten to be forgotten. Producers Guy Collins and Michael Ryan, the guys behind the CGI animated Planet 51 and the Sci-Fi TV movie Highlander: The Source, are in talks with “an unnamed Hollywood co-producer” to reboot the classic 1980s fantasy adventure Time Bandits directed by Terry Gilliam. Last year, Terry Gilliam had talked about an idea of a 3D version of Time Bandits, but it’s unclear if he was talking about remaking it or just applying 3D to the original film. It’s also unclear whether what Terry Gilliam was talking about has anything at all to do with this latest news. Time Bandits was the story of a young British boy who accidentally joins up with a band of time-travelling, mischievous “little people” engaged in a crime spree that takes them to a series of significant historical eras, including encounters with Napoleon, Robin Hood and King Agamemnon. If this remake moves forward, the plan is to remake Time Bandits as a “big-screen, kid’s action franchise.” This is the week’s Most Rotten idea because some movies should just be left alone. Please. I should note that if Terry Gilliam was actually confirmed as directing the remake, this story would probably be a Fresh Development. But he isn’t (yet), so here we are.For more Weekly Ketchup columns by Greg Dean Schmitz, check out the WK archive, and you can contact GDS via Facebook or a RT forum message.","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"actors","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Weekly-Ketchup-Will-and-Jaden-Smith-to-Work-with-M-Night-Shyamalan"},{"id":"47509220713143","title":"Weekly Ketchup: Kathryn Bigelow Takes On A Bin Laden Movie","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Weekly Ketchup: Kathryn Bigelow Takes On A Bin Laden MoviePlus, details on Tarantino's western and an epic cast for Spielberg's Lincoln biopic.by Greg Dean Schmitz | May 6, 2011 |  CommentsAs the film industry prepares for the start of the Cannes Film Festival on May 11, enough announcements were made this week to fill two editions of the Weekly Ketchup. Among the stories that made the cut are new projects for directors Kathryn Bigelow and Quentin Tarantino, the casting of supporting roles in Steven Spielberg’s Lincoln biopic, remakes of Tomb Raider and Seven Samurai, and a Glee movie.This Week’s Top StoryKATHRYN BIGELOW WASTES NO TIME ON HER OSAMA BIN LADEN MOVIEDirector Kathryn Bigelow (The Hurt Locker) found herself in the headlines this week as details emerged about a planned project called Kill Bin Laden, which is obviously now in search of a new title. The untitled independent drama about the hunt for Osama bin Laden had actually already been in the casting process, and so now is surprisingly close to incorporating the news of the last week to start filming. The original basis for Bigelow’s film was to be an earlier unsuccessful attempt to kill Osama bin Laden on the Afghanistan/Pakistan border. Screenwriter Mark Boal, who also wrote The Hurt Locker, is also now working on adapting to this week’s news. If any proof was needed to confirm how far along this project really was, even before May 2nd, this week also saw the announcement of the film’s first cast member. Australian actor Joel Edgerton, who is probably still best known for playing the young Uncle Owen in the Star Wars prequels, has been cast as a special operative who will be part of an ensemble cast of “commandos.” The plan is for casting to continue, and for filming to begin as early as this summer.Fresh Developments This Week#1 DETAILS OF QUENTIN TARANTINO’S DJANGO UNCHAINED REVEALEDThe next logical question the day after the release of the latest film by a fan favorite director like Quentin Tarantino is what he will be doing next. Tarantino belongs to that school of writer-directors who talk about many different ideas, and sometimes take many years to see each of them actually filmed. For over a decade, Tarantino has been talking about doing a western — or as he called it more recently, “a Southern” — that would deal with the issue of slavery. The Internet was much abuzz this week with the revelation that QT has finished his latest script, with the cover page image of Django Unleashed appearing online. This led to some confusion, initially, as many people interpreted the title as meaning it was a new movie starring Franco Nero featuring the character that first appeared in the 1966 Italian spaghetti western of the same title. Complicating matters a bit is the fact that Franco Nero has indeed talked about possibly appearing in Tarantino’s next film. However, we now know that this movie’s “Django” will actually be a freed slave who is taught by a German bounty hunter (Christoph Waltz of Inglourious Basterds) the tricks of the trade, and then sets out to liberate his wife from an evil plantation owner. Other names that have been rumored include Keith Carradine, Treat Williams and Nicky Katt, but at this point, no official casting has been done yet. There’s also not yet a firm date as to when Django Unchained will start filming, but at least we now have a better idea of what Quentin Tarantino has in mind. That will have to do for now. — And here is some breaking news (late Friday afternoon). Will Smith is the frontrunner to star as Django the slave. Samuel L. Jackson is also in talks to play the house slave to the “bad guy.” Quentin Tarantino hopes to start filming in the fall of 2011 in the South, possibly Louisiana.#2 FROM CORALINE TO THE ZOMBIE ADVENTURES OF PARANORMANCoraline was a 2009 stop motion animated adaptation of the Neil Gaiman novel about a young girl who discovers a strange alternate reality, and was both a critical and a (modest) box office hit. This week, the two companies behind Coraline (animation studio Laika and distributor Focus Feature) announced the details of their next stop motion animation project. ParaNorman, which will be released in 3D on August 17, 2012, will tell the story of a small town in the middle of a zombie invasion, and the young boy named Norman who can speak to the dead, and may be the key to resolving the centuries-old curse behind it all. Norman will be voiced by Kodi Smit-McPhee (Let Me In) and the rest of the voice cast includes Casey Affleck, Tempestt Bledsoe, Jeff Garlin, John Goodman, Bernard Hill, Anna Kendrick, Leslie Mann, Christopher Mintz-Plasse and Elaine Stritch. Although ParaNorman is not being produced by Tim Burton (unlike Coraline), the first image shows that the movie is still going for a similar visual style. ParaNorman is being directed by Sam Fell (Flushed Away, The Tale of Despereaux) and Chris Butler, who also wrote the script. Chris Butler is making his debut as codirector and screenwriter, but has previously worked as a storyboard artist on Coraline and Tim Burton’s Corpse Bride.#3 THE SCREENWRITERS OF THE TOMB RAIDER REBOOT ARE… NOT ROTTEN?The Tomb Raider film franchise has been making the news for about a year due to efforts to reboot the video game adaptation series with a younger actress (than Angelina Jolie). The Tomb Raider reboot started off at Warner Bros, but the studio then put the project into turnaround, where it was picked up by GK Films, the independent production company behind The Town, Rango and the upcoming films Hugo Cabret, The Rum Diary and Dark Shadows. Now, GK Films has hired the screenwriting team of Mark Fergus and Hawk Ostby to work on this rebooting of the tomb raiding adventures of archaeologist Lara Croft. Fergus and Ostby were among the screenwriters of Iron Man, Children of Men, and the upcoming Cowboys &amp; Aliens, but one caveat about their credits is that in all three cases, they shared credits with at least two other screenwriters. GK Films acquired the rights two months ago to Tomb Raider from the Square Enix game publisher, with a stated goal of getting the reboot in theaters in 2013. In addition to casting a younger actress, GK Films has stated that it plans to present an “origin story for Lara Croft that solidifies her place alongside Ellen Ripley and Sarah Connor in the pantheon of great female action heroes.”#4 STEVEN SPIELBERG’S LINCOLN BIOPIC TO HAVE AN EPIC ENSEMBLE CASTSteven Spielberg’s long-planned Lincoln biopic about our 16th presidency doesn’t start filming until this fall. However, this week, several actors were announced as being in talks to join Daniel Day-Lewis and Sally Field as Abraham Lincoln and Mary Todd Lincoln. The exact roles for most of the actors is not yet known, but two of them are. Tommy Lee Jones will play Thaddeus Stevens, a Republican congressman from Pennsylvania and a supporter of the abolition of slavery. Joseph Gordon-Levitt will play Robert Todd Lincoln, the president’s oldest son and the only one to survive into his 20s. The list of actors whose (in talks) roles are currently unknown include John Hawkes, Hal Holbrook, Bruce McGill, Tim Blake Nelson, Gloria Reuben and James Spader. Filming of Lincoln is scheduled to start in the fall of 2011 in Virginia, most likely at many of the actual settings of Lincoln’s presidency and important Civil War events.#5 ROBERT ZEMECKIS GOING BACK TO TIME TRAVEL?Following the box office failure of the Robert Zemeckis-produced Mars Needs Moms and the shelving of Zemeckis’ motion-capture remake of The Beatles’ Yellow Submarine, the director of such movies as Cast Away and the Back to the Future trilogy is continuing to search for his next movie as director. Two weeks ago, there was news that Zemeckis was in talks to direct Flight, in which Denzel Washington would play an alcoholic pilot hailed as a hero after preventing an airplane crash. Now, Zemeckis is also in talks with Warner Bros to take on an adaptation of the 1987 novel Replay by Ken Grimwood. Replay tells the story of a radio journalist in his 40s who suffers a heart attack, and finds himself back in his 18 year old body, as he gets the chance to live the next 25 years over. Basically, the premise is a bit like Groundhog Day but for almost the man’s entire life, as he tries to either prevent his early death again, or the death of his daughter. There’s also possible connections to Back to the Future, since the premise takes the character back a few decades, and appears to be all about trying to fix a life and a family, ala Marty McFly. The latest version of the Replay script was adapted by Jason Smilovic (Lucky Number Slevin), who is also a TV producer who worked on Kidnapped, Bionic Woman and My Own Worst Enemy. It appears at this point that Zemeckis is still more likely to direct Flight first, while continuing to develop Replay.Rotten Ideas of the Week#4 GLEE: THE MOVIE (SORT OF)20th Century Fox has announced a release date of August 12, 2011 for Glee Live! 3D!, based upon the popular FOX TV show about a group of very good looking teenagers who enjoy singing covers of popular songs (and some original songs). Glee Live! 3D! is not, however, a direct movie adaptation of the TV show, but will instead basically be a concert movie. Fourteen of the show’s cast members will be going on tour this summer, performing memorable songs from the TV show, and this movie will bring that experience to movie theaters. Glee Live! 3D! will be directed by Kevin Tancharoen, who also helmed the similarly-themed remake of Fame in 2009, Britney Spears’ 2004 Live from Miami special and the 2007 reality show The Pussycat Dolls Present: The Search for the Next Doll. Among the songs that will be performed in Glee Live! 3D! are covers of Britney Spears’ “I’m a Slave 4 U,” Katy Perry’s “Teenage Dream” and Pink’s “Raise Your Glass.” Glee Live! 3D! is a borderline Rotten Idea, but the factor that lands it in this category is the 25% RT Tomatometer score for Tancharoen’s previous movie about musically talented teenagers, Fame.#3 PLEASE ALLOW BRADLEY COOPER TO INTRODUCE HIMSELFLast year, director Alex Proyas (I, Robot, Knowing, Dark City) signed on with Legendary Pictures to take on their adaptation of John Milton’s epic 17th century poem Paradise Lost. Milton’s poem depicts the events of Adam and Eve’s exile from the Garden of Eden, and the war between the archangels Michael and Lucifer. This week, Bradley Cooper (The Hangover, The A-Team) started negotitations to portray Lucifer, who you may also know as Satan, Beelzebub, or the Prince of Darkness. This follows the recent news that Bradley Cooper is also in talks to star in the remake of The Crow, the original film adaptation of which was also directed by Alex Proyas. The emphasis of this film version of Paradise Lost appears to be more on the angelic war, and less on Adam and Eve, as it is described as being “crafted as an action vehicle that will include aerial warfare, possibly shot in 3D.” The adaptation script for Paradise Lost has already been worked on four other screenwriters, but the latest script is by newcomer Ryan Condal. Although it hasn’t been officially announced yet, Paradise Lost is likely to be distributed by Warner Bros, the studio that handles most Legendary Pictures productions (300, Watchmen, The Dark Knight). In other Bradley Cooper news, the actor is also in talks to costar with Ryan Gosling in the independent drama The Place Beyond the Pines about a motorcycle riding bank robber (Gosling) and the cop (Cooper) who is trying to stop him.#2 THE LAVA FLOWING THROUGH THE HOUSES OF POMPEII WILL BE A RESIDENT EVILDirector Paul W.S. Anderson is best known for the Resident Evil series (and being married to Milla Jovovich), but his latest film is a 3D remake of The Three Musketeers. At the Cannes Film Festival this week, Anderson announced his plans to adapt another story set in the distant past: the volcanic disaster of Mount Vesuvius and the destruction of the Roman city of Pompeii. The premise of Anderson’s Pompeii is very much of the Titanic model, combining romance and a terrible catastrophe. Set in the late summer of 79 A.D., the central character will be the slave of a shipping tycoon who dreams of winning his freedom and marrying his master’s daughter. And then Mount Vesuvius happens. Pompeii was adapted by the husband-wife screenwriting team of Lee Batchler and Janet Scott Batchler, who are best known as the writers who teamed up with Akiva Goldsman on Batman Forever. Anderson hopes to start filming in the spring of 2012. Summit Entertainment has already picked up the U.S. rights to the international production. There’s no word yet as to who Milla Jovovich will be playing.#1 AKIRA KUROSAWA’S SEVEN SAMURAI GETS ANOTHER REMAKEWhile Japanese director Akira Kurosawa was still alive, a few of his films were remade in America. Most notably, Yojimbo became A Fistfull of Dollars (and later, Last Man Standing) and Seven Samurai became The Magnificent Seven. Now, the Weinstein Company are getting closer to realizing their long-talked about plans for another remake of Seven Samurai. First made in 1954, Seven Samurai was the story of a small village in the 16th century that hires seven masterless samurai as protection against a gang of bandits. The Weinstein Company remake will change the setting from 16th century Japan to modern Thailand, with the samurai now being paramilitary contractors. Director Scott Mann (2009’s The Tournament) will direct the remake from a script adapted by John Fusco (Hidalgo, Young Guns, The Forbidden Kingdom) on a budget of $60 million.For more Weekly Ketchup columns by Greg Dean Schmitz, check out the WK archive, and you can contact GDS via Facebook or a RT forum message.","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"streaming, of, VICE, Lionsgate, awards, Arrangement, 45, HBO, show, Film, tv, 72","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Weekly-Ketchup-Kathryn-Bigelow-Takes-On-A-Bin-Laden-Movie"},{"id":"47509223241435","title":"Weekly Ketchup: Piranha 3-D Sequel Planned","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Weekly Ketchup: Piranha 3-D Sequel PlannedPlus new roles for Jeremy Renner, Tom Hanks, Dolly Parton and Jessica Alba.by Greg Dean Schmitz | August 27, 2010 |  CommentsThis week’s Ketchup includes sequel news for Piranha 3D and Hayao Miyazaki’s Porco Rosso, the announcement of another Marvel Studios superhero movie and new roles for Jessica Alba, Sandra Bullock, Steve Carell, John Cusack, Tom Hanks, Angelina Jolie, Queen Latifah, Dolly Parton and Jeremy Renner.THIS WEEK’S TOP STORYCRITICS COULDN’T SEE PIRANHA 3D BUT THEY’LL PAVE THE WAY FOR A SEQUELIt’s a fairly standard age-old practice for studios to either limit or completely skip press screenings for movies that the executives expect will get hammered by the critics. That happened with the Weinstein Company and Piranha 3D and then a funny (and very rare) thing happened: the critics generally loved it, giving Piranha 3D a 75% on the Tomatometer. The sexy horror movie about swarming fishies devouring beach partying youngsters opened to $10 million, which doesn’t seem like much, but Piranha 3D was also not particularly expensive to make, either (budget: $24 million). That means The Weinstein Company’s Dimension Films, producer Mark Canton and director Alexandre Aja are already talking about plans for a fourth movie in the Piranha franchise (my suggested title: Piranha 3DD… because this movie had boobies). The really ironic part is that producer Mark Canton is citing critics as part of the reason for the sequel talk: “And it’s fantastic that so many critics are really getting the movie and recommending it. We can’t wait to get to work on the sequel.” Yes, the critics that they (mostly) couldn’t bother to screen the movie for are now the reason they are making a sequel; most of the critics who did get screenings saw the movie almost right before it opened in theaters (making it too late to publish reviews the day of release). As for what Piranha 3D 2 (or whatever it’s called) might be about, there’s no official word yet, but a few weeks ago, director Alexandre Aja said, “We had many ideas — like the full moon party in Thailand, a huge event with like 200,000 young people from around the world taking mushrooms and partying on the beach.” It is possible that Aja’s involvement on the sequel may just be as a producer, as he is not yet officially signed to return to direct the sequel.FRESH DEVELOPMENTS THIS WEEK#1 HAWKEYE SETS HIS SIGHTS ON MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE IVJeremy Renner finally emerged from years of obscurity last year with Oscar-nominated role in The Hurt Locker, and one of the results was his casting as the archer superhero Hawkeye in Marvel’s The Avengers. Shortly after news broke that Paramount was looking for a younger star to join Tom Cruise in Mission: Impossible IV, Renner was confirmed as landing the role. An important factor in finding the right actor was that Paramount wanted someone who could take over the Mission: Impossible franchise if Tom Cruise ever leaves. Tom Cruise is expected to star in a potential Mission: Impossible V, but Paramount also wants to add some new blood, you know, “just in case.” Other actors that were considered include Chris Pine (Star Trek) and Tom Hardy (Inception), but their schedules were already booked during the time that Paramount plans on filming Mission: Impossible IV. But Renner’s work on The Avengers does not conflict. Renner’s Hurt Locker costar Anthony Mackie was also considered. The slight irony about Renner landing the part of the “young” spy is that at 39, Renner is actually only 9 years younger than the 48-year-old Tom Cruise. The M:I IV script was written by the Knight and Day team of Josh Appelbaum and Andre Nemec. Brad Bird (Ratatouille, The Incredibles) will be making his live-action debut with Mission: Impossible IV, which film on location around the world in the USA, Vancouver, Prague and Dubai. The next step in the casting process will now be to find an actress to play a young female operative to costar with Cruise and Renner.#2 AMERICA’S SWEETHEART SANDRA BULLOCK AND TOM HANKS TEAM UP FOR THE FIRST TIMEAlthough Tom Hanks and Sandra Bullock have both built their strong careers on similar types of movies, the two have never costarred together. The stars however are now both attached to star in Extremely Loud &amp; Incredibly Close, a project that Warner Bros and Paramount Pictures are partnering on in, which Hanks and Bullock will play the parents of a nine year old boy who is the movie’s actual lead character. Based upon a novel by Safran Foer (Everything is Illuminated), Extremely Loud &amp; Incredibly Close tells the story of a child prodigy (an inventor, actor, musician, jeweler, pacifist and pen pal with Stephen Hawking) who goes on a quest through New York City’s five burroughs seeking to find the lock that matches the key left behind by his father, who died in the World Trade Center on 9/11. That last part is not really a spoiler since it sort of drives the entire story, and is likely to be revealed in the trailer. The script was adapted by Academy Award winner Eric Roth (Forrest Gump), who also was nominated for The Curious Case of Benjamin Button and for cowriting Munich and The Insider. Filming of Extremely Loud &amp; Incredibly Close is expected to start in mid-January on location in New York City. As Oscar-friendly as the film already is with the involvement of Hanks, Bullock and Roth, director Stephen Daldry’s streak is just as impressive. Daldry has directed only three films, and all three (Billy Elliot, The Hours and The Reader) earned him Academy Award nominations for Best Director. Basically, movies don’t get much more Oscar Bait-ish than Extremely Loud &amp; Incredibly Close. And that’s without even mentioning the connection to 9/11.#3 HAYAO MIYAZAKI ANNOUNCES PLANS FOR HIS FIRST EVER SEQUEL: PORCO ROSSO: THE LAST SORTIEAcclaimed anime director Hayao Miyazaki (The Princess Mononoke, Spirited Away) is now 69, and is moving towards his Studio Ghibli producing more movies directed by younger members of his staff. However, the master has not totally given up on directing more movies himself, and what may be his next project should be exciting for fans of one of his earliest films, Porco Rosso. That 1992 film detailed the flying exploits of an Italian pilot during World War I, who had also been magically transformed into a walking, talking pig (hence the title). So yes, Porco Rosso was about a pig shooting down biplanes. This marks the first sequel Miyazaki would tackle, and it’s titled Porco Rosso: The Last Sortie. Miyazaki revealed include that the hero would be a boy (instead of a girl like most of his films), and that it would be set during the Spanish Civil War, 20 years after World War I. And now, here’s the bad news. Miyazaki’s ability to make Porco Rosso: The Last Sortie will depend upon the success of Studio Ghibli’s next two movies (neither of which he directed.) I think he means The Borrower Arrietty (which was released last month in Japan) and the upcoming The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter (unless he’s not counting The Borrower Arietty and there’s another upcoming film I don’t know about). If the films Miyazaki is talking about perform poorly, Studio Ghibli may be shut down and become just a skeleton crew company to control the rights to existing properties. So, I guess that’s the cue for Hayao Miyazaki to go out and support the U.S. release of Tales of Earthsea (currently in release here) and those next two movies, so that we can get to see a pig flying around shooting fascists out of the sky over Spain.#4 JOHN CUSACK TAKES ON THE RAVENLate breaking news came in this afternoon just as I was finishing up the Weekly Ketchup from a very 2010 source: John Cusack’s Twitter account. The actor has announced that he has signed to play the lead role of poet/novelist Edgar Allan Poe in The Raven. Jeremy Renner and Ewan McGregor had previously been mentioned as starring, but what was unclear was which was going to play Poe. With Jeremy Renner busy with Mission: Impossible IV and The Avengers (and Ewan McGregor being totally Scottish), it appears most likely that John Cusack is replacing Jeremy Renner, and perhaps McGregor will still be involved. The Raven is not a direct adaptation of Poe’s poem, but is rather a serial killer thriller. In this story, Poe is tasked with solving a series of murders inspired by his many famous stories in his hometown of Baltimore in the 1840s. The Raven was cowritten by newcomer Ben Livingston and Hannah Shakespeare, who adapted the 2005 film Loverboy and served as story editor on the recent NBC reboot of The Bionic Woman. The Raven will be the third movie from director James McTeigue, following V for Vendetta and last year’s Ninja Assassin (and he was also the first AD on big movies like The Matrix trilogy and Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones). One final thing I noticed about the casting of John Cusack as Edgar Allan Poe is that Cusack (6′ 3″) is considerably taller than the author (5′ 8″) was. Or perhaps McTeigue will just surround Cusack with giants (or figure that no one really knows or cares how tall Poe was).#5 ANGELINA JOLIE TURNING THE CAMERA AROUND IN BOSNIAAngelina Jolie’s name came up associated with two very different projects this week. First, while visiting Sarajevo last Saturday as a Goodwill Ambassador for the United Nations, Angelina Jolie announced her plans to soon start working on a love story set during the 1992-1995 Bosnian war. However, these plans do not include Jolie adopting an Eastern European accent and dressing down to play a refugee, as she’s actually planning on personally directing and producing the script she’s written herself. Jolie plans on casting local actors of Bosnian, Croatian and Serbian descent. Of the project, Angelina Jolie said, “The film is a love story, not a political statement… I would like to involve as many local people as possible and learn as much as I can.” Angelina Jolie has a bit of a reputation of being frequently associated with movies, and then dropping out (often because of script issues), but in this case, if that happens, at least some poor screenwriter isn’t at risk of losing a potential gig because of it. As for movies that Angelina Jolie is not writing, the latest potential project is a film adaptation of the 2009 British television miniseries Unforgiven. The tricky thing there of course is that there is sort of already a very popular and highly acclaimed film of that title from a few years back. Unless they do something like just throw a The on the title (and figure few people remember the 1960 western starring Burt Lancaster and Audrey Hepburn). The Unforgiven series told the story of a woman recently released from prison for the murder of two policeman, and whose attempt to settle back into her life is interrupted by two revenge-seeking sons of one of the officers that she killed. The Unforgiven adaptation is being produced by the same British company that backed Jolie’s upcoming thriller The Tourist. Unforgiven is being adapted as a much shorter movie by Christopher McQuarrie (The Usual Suspects; cowriter of Valkyrie), who also cowrote The Tourist and is currently working on X-Men Origins: Wolverine 2.ROTTEN IDEAS OF THE WEEK#4 MARVEL HIRES THE AIRHEADS WRITER FOR IRON FISTIn June, Marvel Studios started development on Dr. Strange, likely making it the first major new project that will be distributed by Marvel’s new owner Disney. That news followed over a decade of development of a Dr. Strange movie, and this week, another character that has been in development since the 20th century got a new start. Iron Fist (AKA Daniel Rand) was first introduced in 1974 to appeal to fans of the kung fu/martial arts movies that were popular in that decade. Iron Fist went on to become best known as the filling in the superhero Oreo that was Heroes for Hire, along with Luke Cage (who has also had a movie in development for a very long time). The Iron Fist origin story borrows heavily from the classic novel Lost Horizon, as Daniel Rand is the young son of wealthy westerners that discovered the legendary lost city of K’un L’un in Asia, and who is raised there and taught the secrets of martial arts. Daniel eventually defeats a magical dragon, and when his fists plunge into the dragon’s heart, they become “iron fists.” Daniel gains the ability to focus his chi and become a superhuman martial arts fighting machine. Iron Fist also wore a bright green and yellow outfit that looked great in the comics but might need some work for a live-action movie (especially that ten inch tall popped collar that stands straight up over his shoulders). Anyway, now that you know who Iron Fist was, the actual movie news is that Marvel has hired Rich Wilkes (xXx, Airheads) to start work on a screenplay draft adapting Iron Fist for the big screen. And that’s the part that lands Iron Fist in the Rotten Idea section this week. The idea of an Iron Fist movie has always been “fresh” (even ten years ago, when Artisan wanted Ray Park, AKA The Toad and Darth Maul to star). However, Rich Wilkes’ filmography (which also includes cowriting The Stöned Age and The Jerky Boys) is not exactly promising. Consider this a borderline “rotten idea” with the awesomeness of Iron Fist conflicting with who Marvel chose to actually write it.#3 DOLLY PARTON AND QUEEN LATIFAH TEAMING UP TO BRING YOU THEIR JOYFUL NOISEA comprehensive study of the movies during 1980s really wouldn’t be complete without considering Dolly Parton. She made her film debut in 1980 with Nine to Five, followed that with The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas and Rhinestone, and ended the decade with Steel Magnolias. Only Nine to Five is particularly great, but Rhinestone is so ridiculous (Stallone sings country!) that, like I say, we really can’t forget how Parton impacted the movies. After that period, Dolly Parton made fewer movies, choosing to focus on her music, touring and her Dollywood theme park. Except for a cameo appearance as herself in Miss Congeniality 2, Dolly Parton’s last appearance in a movie was in 2002’s Frank McKlusky, C.I., but now Dolly is coming back to the big screen. Dolly Parton, Queen Latifah and their four best friends are teaming up for a musical movie called Joyful Noise. The film will be about two women from different backgrounds who join forces to prevent a small town’s gospel choir from shutting down. The Warner Bros musical was written by and will be directed by Todd Graff (Camp, Bandslam). Todd Graff was also one of the regular kids in the 1970s PBS show The Electric Company. Queen Latifah will play the mother of two teens, who is put in charge of the gospel choir after the death of the former director, and Dolly Parton will play his widow who also wants the job. Joyful Noise is one of this week’s Rotten Ideas only marginally, but the reason I ultimately pegged it here is because gospel movies have a history of being, you know, a little bit maudlin and cheesy. However, Todd Graff’s Camp was indeed a fun movie (that did the Glee thing way earlier), so maybe it will turn out to be awesome. If Sylvester Stallone takes the role of Dolly’s ex-husband and we get to hear him sing “Amazing Grace,” then I will totally change my tune.#2 STEVE CARELL IS LOOKING FOR A BOYFRIEND FOR MY WIFESteve Carell’s box office track record of late is pretty great (Dinner for Schmucks is the low point of his last five movies, and even that is likely to top $70 million). Of course, that’s presuming you include the animated movies Horton Hears a Who! and Despicable Me. With Carell leaving The Office after this season, the comedian will definitely be a lot more available for movie roles and Warner Bros (where he has his production deal) continues to add projects to his development slate. The latest Steve Carell project at Warner Bros’ is the studio’s English-language remake of the 2008 Argentinian romantic comedy A Boyfriend for My Wife. It’s the story of a man who tries to get out of his marriage by setting his wife up with a “legendary yet unlikely Lothario.” If this American version stars Steve Carell as the husband, one has to imagine someone like Jack Black, Seth Rogen or Will Ferrell as the “unlikely Lothario” (or maybe even Rainn Wilson). Steve Carell is also producing A Boyfriend for My Wife, which is currently being adapted by the writing team of Mark Gibson and Phil Halprin (cowriters of The Wild, Snow Dogs). And that right there is the part that lands A Boyfriend for My Wife in the Rotten Idea category; those movies are awful.#1 NEWS TO MAKE YOU FEEL OLD: JESSICA ALBA WILL PLAY A MOM IN A SPY KIDS MOVIEJessica Alba is in talks to star as a mom to the new espionage enthusiast preteens in Robert Rodriguez’s Spy Kids 4: All the Time in the World. Alba’s role will be as the mother of a baby and the stepmother of the two children who will be the newest Spy Kids. The new spies are replacing Alexa Vega (now 23, engaged, and totally not looking like a kid) and Daryl Sabara (now 18 and looking a lot like Rob Schneider). Vega, Sabara and Antonio Banderas are expected to return in supporting roles, but there’s no word yet about Carla Gugino returning (which is disappointing). Alba’s character will also be a retired spy who has recently been reactivated, and the search is on for her husband, a “slightly nerdy investigative reporter.” Spy Kids 4 will mark the third time Jessica Alba has worked with Robert Rodriguez (who is writing and directing, as he did with the first three movies), after Sin City and the upcoming Machete. Rodriguez is expecting to start filming in September in Austin, Texas on a budget of less than $30 million. This news is this week’s most Rotten Idea for two reasons. First, although the first two movies were definitely Fresh here at RT (93% for Spy Kids, 75% for Spy Kids 2), the franchise continues a downward slide with the 45% given to Spy Kids 3-D: Game Over. More than that, however, Spy Kids 4 news in general is rotten because of the ticking of time (ironic because the villain is “The Time Keeper”). Any time Robert Rodriguez spends making his kids movies like the Spy Kids franchise, The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl in 3-D and last year’s Shorts is time he is not devoting to making movies more of us probably want to see, like Sin City 2 and his possibly never-going-to-happen plans for Red Sonja and the adaptation of Mike Allred’s crazy comic book series Madman.For more Weekly Ketchup columns by Greg Dean Schmitz, check out the WK archive, and you can contact GDS via a RT forum message.","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"Amazon, Central, jones, hard, mockumentary, Summer, poppins, American, The","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Weekly-Ketchup-Piranha-3D-Sequel-Planned"},{"id":"47509223243484","title":"Weekly Ketchup: Spider-Man Is Looking for a Girlfriend","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Weekly Ketchup: Spider-Man Is Looking for a GirlfriendPlus, Black Dynamite 2, a Bob Marley biopic, and more Ninja Turtlesby Greg Dean Schmitz | August 20, 2010 |  CommentsThis week’s Ketchup includes casting news and possibilities for both the Spider-Man reboot and X-Men: First Class, as well as talk about Black Dynamite 2, the next Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles movie, a Bob Marley biopic and a new animated movie starring Seth Rogen.THIS WEEK’S TOP STORYSPIDER-MAN LOOKING FOR HIS GIRLFRIEND (AND SHE’S NOT MARY JANE)Columbia Pictures and director Marc Webb ((500) Days of Summer) are meeting with several actresses this weekend in the search to cast Peter Parker’s romantic interest. The identity of the character is not yet known, but who it isn’t is Mary Jane Parker, played by Kristen Dunst in the first three movies. The likeliest candidate is Gwen Stacy (played by Bryce Dallas Howard in Spider-Man 3), but it could also be Betty Brandt (previously played by Elizabeth Banks), Felicia Hardy (The Black Cat), or perhaps an entirely different character. The full list of actresses hasn’t been revealed, but the partial list includes three young British actresses: Lily Collins (The Blind Side, the upcoming Priest), Ophelia Lovibond (the upcoming Nowhere Boy and London Boulevard) and Imogen Poots (28 Weeks Later, the upcoming Fright Night remake). The emphasis on British actresses is especially interesting considering that the new Peter Parker will be played by Andrew Garfield, who is himself British-American. Australian Teresa Palmer (The Sorcerer’s Apprentice, the upcoming I Am Number Four) and American (and Julia’s niece) Emma Roberts (Valentine’s Day, the upcoming Scream 4) are also in the running for the role. Someone who is already out of the running is Mary Elizabeth Winstead, hopefully not because of the disappointing opening numbers for Scott Pilgrim Vs the World. If none of these actresses work out, Columbia will continue with another round of casting interviews, similar to the long process the studio went through to find Andrew Garfield to play Peter Parker.FRESH DEVELOPMENTS THIS WEEK#1 MOVIE FANS NEED BLACK DYNAMITE 2 NOW MORE THAN EVERPromoting Black Dynamite in the UK (where it’s just now being released), Michael Jai White revealed that he is already working on ideas for Black Dynamite 2. Released in 2009, Black Dynamite was an action comedy spoof of the blaxploitation and kung fu films of the 1970s. Black Dynamite was a former CIA agent who hit the streets looking for vengeance when his brother was killed as part of a scheme to spread heroin use among the city’s orphanages. Unlike many of the films it spoofed, Black Dynamite was a critical success, earning an 85% on the Tomatometer. Michael Jai White also cowrote Black Dynamite, and is likely to be writing Black Dynamite 2 also. White said of the sequel, “You know how Black Dynamite just grows in ridiculousness? Well, this will be a fitting sequel.”#2 BOB MARLEY NO LONGER WAITING IN VAIN FOR HIS BIOPIC?There are certain musicians that have been the focus of attempted biopic projects for a very long time, very often because of music rights: Janis Joplin, Jimi Hendrix and Frank Sinatra, for example. Reggae singer Bob Marley is also definitely in that group. In 2008, his widow Rita Marley signed a deal with The Weinstein Company to adapt her book No Woman, No Cry, but after two different directors bailed, that project is now on hold. Martin Scorsese also announced plans for a Bob Marley documentary to be released on Bob’s 65th birthday (2/6/10), but obviously that film didn’t happen either. Now, British TV director Jenny Ash (America: The Story of Us) is developing a Bob Marley biopic that will focus on the year that Marley spent living in London in 1977. Marley had fled to London after an attempt on his life in Jamaica, hung out with the Sex Pistols, started an affair with Jamaican beauty queen Cindy Breakspeare and was first diagnosed with the cancer that would eventually kill him in 1981 at the age of 36. However, one big obstacle for this biopic is the issue of rights to Bob Marley’s music, which may be especially difficult to procure given Rita Marley’s attitude towards Cindy Breakspeare. Biopics without the musical rights are rare, but they have happened: Backbeat (The Beatles), and Dreamgirls was basically the Supremes story by another name. One can also of course not forget Jenna Maroney’s Sing Them Blues, White Girl: The Jackie Jormp-Jomp Story.#3 ANOTHER BIOPIC ABOUT COLLEGE GUYS IN FRONT OF COMPUTERS: GOOGLEDDavid Fincher’s Facebook drama The Social Network isn’t even out yet, but its anticipated critical and/or box office success appears to already be having an impact. Groundswell Productions (Milk, Appaloosa) and producer John Morris (the Showtime biopic Spinning Boris) have acquired the film rights to Ken Auletta’s book Googled: The End of the World As We Know It. Googled tells the story of Stanford Ph.D. students Sergey Brin and Larry Page and their attempt to build a better search engine using such business principles as “you can make money without doing evil” and “you can be serious without a suit.” There is not yet a writer or director attached to the project. Here’s what Groundswell’s Michael London said about Googled, “The heart of the movie is their wonderful edict, don’t be evil. At a certain point in the evolution of a company so big and powerful, there are a million challenges to that mandate. Can you stay true to principles like that as you become as rich and powerful as that company has become? The intention is to be sympathetic to Sergey and Larry, and hopefully the film will be as interesting as the company they created.” Twitter, MySpace, YouTube, Yahoo! and AintitCoolNews movies can’t be far behind. (Representatives of Upcomingmovies.com and Rotten Tomatoes declined comment.)#4 J.J. Abrams likes 7 Minutes in HeavenIn the last few years, Hollywood has started developing a plethora of movie projects based on board games like Battleship, Monopoly, Candyland and Ouija. Now, J.J. Abrams and his Bad Robot production company have set their sights on a game that has no pesky big companies to acquire the rights from. 7 Minutes in Heaven is a kissing game in which kids take turns going in a closet to make out (see also: Spin the Bottle). Seven Minutes in Heaven was also a 1985 movie starring a very young Jennifer Connelly (but there’s no connection to this Bad Robot project). The idea for the 7 Minutes in Heaven movie came from LOST director Jack Bender. The premise of 7 Minutes in Heaven is that two teenagers come back out of the closet to find that all of their friends are now dead. 7 Minutes in Heaven is likely to be a Paramount Pictures project, the studio where Bad Robot has its deal. Bad Robot is currently looking for a writer to take Bender’s idea and expand it into a full script. While 7 Minutes in Heaven is being developed, Jack Bender is currently in talks with Paramount to direct Moscow, the next movie in the Jack Ryan franchise, starring Chris Pine.#5 PIRANHA 3D DIRECTOR SINKS HIS TEETH INTO COBRA: THE SPACE PIRATEWith Piranha 3D hitting theaters today, director Alexandre Aja (Mirrors, High Tension) announced plans for a new adaptation that will take him out of the horror and remake field: Cobra: The Space Pirate. Cobra: The Space Pirate started as a 1978-1984 space opera manga that was then adapted as an anime series and film that Aja says was very popular in Europe (but not so much in the USA, though footage was used in Matthew Sweet’s memorable “Girlfriend” video. Cobra is a futuristic space pirate who refuses to align with the United Galaxies Federation or the Pirates Guild, resulting in a bounty being placed on his head. Cobra teams up with a beautiful bounty hunter named Jane as they try to locate her sisters in a quest to find a lost treasure on Mars. Aja has hopes to turn Cobra: The Space Pirate into a tentpole-sized science fiction epic. Alexandre Aja is cowriting Cobra: The Space Pirate with his frequent writing partner Gregory Lavasseur, and is also producing. A few weeks ago, Aja also revealed that he hopes to someday remake the 1980 slasher movie Maniac.ROTTEN IDEAS OF THE WEEK#4 SETH ROGEN TO ATTEND BOO U.In addition to his live action performances, Seth Rogen also has a growing resume of voice work, including roles in Horton Hears a Who!, Kung Fu Panda (and the upcoming sequel), Monsters vs Aliens and the title role in (the mostly live action) Paul. Now, Seth Rogen has also signed on with DreamWorks Animation to voice the lead character in Boo U, which may be released in 2013. Boo U. is a 3D (of course) CGI animated comedy about a ghost who is forced to return to ghost school to learn how to better perform his ghostly duties (because he’s a ghost!). Boo U. is being directed by Tony Leondis (Igor) from a script by the writing team of John Mann and Jon Gunn. Mann and Gunn’s only released film credit right now is the 2000 Eric Roberts movie Mercy Streets, but they are also working on the Magic 8 Ball movie for Paramount. This is one of this week’s Rotten Ideas not so much because of Seth Rogen, but because of the other people involved with Boo U., specifically the Magic 8 Ball guys. That’s a project so rotten its rottenness spreads and makes other movies rotten.#3 THIS WEEK IN X-MEN: FIRST CLASS CASTING: NIGHTCRAWLER’S DAD AND NOT THE ANGEL WE WERE EXPECTINGThe X-Men: First Class comic book was mostly about the original 5 members of the team (Cyclops, Jean Grey, Beast, Angel and Iceman), but the X-Men: First Class movie appears to have a much larger student body. Among those to join the cast this week were January Jones (Betty Draper from Mad Men), replacing Alice Eve as Emma Frost. Similarly, although there had been earlier reports of Rosamund Pike playing Dr. Moira MacTaggert, that role is now to be played by Rose Byrne (Get Him to the Greek). There had been rumors that not all of the roles that are being announced are necessarily what the roles really are, so that might be part of the confusion here. The role of Angel has also been cast, but instead of Warren Worthington, this Angel is actually Angel Salvadore, whose mutant abilities replicate those of a house fly (insectoid wings, the ability to spit acid). Jason Flemyng (Calibos from Clash of the Titans) joined the cast as Azazel, who in the comics belongs to an ancient race of mutants who looked like demons (complete with red skin and a tail) and is the father of Nightcrawler. Oliver Platt (Lake Placid) has also joined the cast as a non-mutant character called “The Man in Black” who doesn’t appear to have a known parallel in the comic books (unless he’s really someone we actually do know). In other mutant movie news, 20th Century Fox is reportedly now considering two different directors for X-Men Origins: Wolverine 2 (or whatever it ends up being called). The two candidates are David Slade (30 Days of Night, The Twilight Saga: Eclipse) and Robert Schwentke (The Time Traveler’s Wife and the upcoming Red). Because Schwentke is already considering several movies as his next project (including R.I.P.D. as reported last week, Slade is perceived as being the likely director Fox will end up hiring. I am collectively putting all of this news in the “Rotten Idea” column this week because X-Men: First Class is sounding increasingly more like X-Men: The Last Stand, a movie with such a huge ensemble cast that there is no time for any individual characters to properly develop. The news about Wolverine 2 may not itself be rotten, but it gets lumped in here because Wolvie’s an part of the team, whether he likes it or not.#2 IRON MAN WRITERS TO REIMAGINE TEENAGE MUTANT NINJA TURTLESIn May, Michael Bay and his Platinum Dunes production company announced plans to develop a new live action Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles movie for Paramount Pictures. Now, the studio has moved forward by reportedly paying close to $1 million to the writing team of Art Marcum and Matt Holloway (cowriters of Iron Man, Punisher: War Zone). Marcum and Holloway also wrote the reboot of Highlander which is expected to start filming in 2011. Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles got its start as a black-and-white indie comic book in 1984 that spoofed “grim and gritty” comics by artists like Frank Miller. Most people however know the Turtles for their much more kid-friendly depictions in a popular long-running animated TV series and the four feature films (the last of which was CGI and more true to the source material). Paramount is said to be seeing TMNT as “its next huge franchise, like Transformers,” and the studio is looking for that to happen sooner rather than later. Paramount is expecting the first draft of the script by October, with hopes to find a director and get the movie in theaters by 2012. This is one of this week’s Rotten Ideas because this writer has seen the two Transformers movies and G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra. Those films might give us an idea of what to expect from Paramount’s (and Michael Bay’s) rushed plans for a “huge franchise.”#1 SAW SEQUELS DIRECTOR LOOKS AT THE CALENDARIt doesn’t happen a lot, but occasionally, movies have nicely-themed release dates, such as when 20th Century Fox released their remake of The Omen on June 6, 2006. This week’s most Rotten Idea, however, is for a movie that got its start by producer Wayne Rice (Valentine’s Day, Dude, Where’s My Car?) looking at a calendar and realizing that November 11th, 2011 is a Friday. Yes, seriously. Of course, that’s probably also how the idea for Valentine’s Day came together. Darren Lynn Bousman (Saw II-IV, Repo! The Genetic Opera) is in the process of writing 11:11:11, obviously hoping to get the movie together quickly enough to meet that release date. 11:11:11 will be a “horror-tinged thriller” based on “the idea of the 11 gates of Heaven and how on 11:11 on the 11th day of the 11th month, the 11th gate will open up and something from another world will enter the earthly realm for 49 minutes.” I should note that I was unable to find many references to eleven gates of Heaven online that weren’t related to, well, this movie. One has to guess that Rice and Bousman have already checked the calendar and also saw that December 12th, 2012 is a Wednesday, which is also a day movies are sometimes released on. Good luck with explaining 13:13:13 though, guys. 11:11:11 is this week’s most rotten idea for a variety of reasons: not just the “making a movie to fit a release date” mentality, but also because Bousman’s Tomatometer history is less than impressive.For more Weekly Ketchup columns by Greg Dean Schmitz, check out the WK archive, and you can contact GDS via a RT forum message.","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"Video, vampires, Captain, doctor, christmas, History, OWN, dark, potter, Winter, Adult, El, streaming, Skip","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Weekly-Ketchup-SpiderMan-Is-Looking-for-a-Girlfriend"},{"id":"47509217674900","title":"Weekly Ketchup: Tim Burton to Film Pinocchio Adaptation Minus Johnny Depp?","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Weekly Ketchup: Tim Burton to Film Pinocchio Adaptation Minus Johnny Depp?Also, adaptations of two Broadway musicals, more found footage, and new roles for Kate Winslet and James Franco.by Greg Dean Schmitz | January 13, 2012 |  CommentsThis week’s Ketchup includes news of a new live action Pinocchio, adaptations of the musicals Jersey Boys and Into the Woods, and new movies for George Clooney, Robert Downey Jr, James Franco and Kate Winslet.This Week’s Top StoryTIM BURTON MAY REMAKE PINOCCHIO WITHOUT JOHNNY DEPPWith this year’s Dark Shadows being the fifth film in a row that director Tim Burton has made with his frequent star Johnny Depp, it might seem impossible to remember a time when most of Burton’s films didn’t feature Depp at all. Perhaps Burton is getting nostalgic, because the director is now considering an actor for one of his future movies, and his name doesn’t rhyme with schlepp. Burton is currently negotiating with Warner Bros to direct their planned adaptation of the Italian children’s book Pinocchio by Carlo Collodi. It is Robert Downey Jr. that Tim Burton hopes the studio can sign to star as the woodcarver Geppetto. This newest adaptation of the classic tale about the wooden puppet who wanted to be a real boy was written by Bryan Fuller, the creator of the TV show Pushing Daisies. Tim Burton is also eyeing other projects as his next, such as Miss Peregrine’s Home for Peculiar Children (at 20th Century Fox), but Pinocchio has a good chance of becoming his next if Robert Downey Jr. signs on. One fairy tale adaptation that Tim Burton is no longer going to be directing is Walt Disney Pictures’ Maleficent, a reimagining of Sleeping Beauty that focuses on the villain from Disney’s animated version, to be played by Angelina Jolie. With Tim Burton now out, Disney has instead offered the job to two time Academy Award winning art director Robert Stromberg (for Avatar and Alice in Wonderland), for whom Maleficent would be his directorial debut.Fresh Developments This Week#1 GEORGE CLOONEY RETURNS TO WORLD WAR II WITH THE MONUMENTS MENIt was revealed last month that George Clooney is developing a Smothers Brothers biopic called Dangerously Funny that he plans on producing and directing. However, it was learned this week that there’s another project based on a non-fiction book that Clooney and producing partner Grant Heslov plan on producing next. The Monuments Men was the name of a 2009 book by Robert Edsel about the 11 civilian art experts that landed at Normandy during World War II on a secret mission to find the great works of art that Adolph Hitler had the Nazis hide throughout Europe. In addition to the war adventure aspects of this true story, The Monuments Men will also have a romance subplot involving Rose Valland, a member of the French Resistance who helped find (and hide) some of the stolen art. Sony Pictures will be distributing The Monuments Men, which George Clooney will be costarring in, and which will be Clooney’s fifth film as director (after Confessions of a Dangerous Mind, Good Night and Good Luck, Leatherheads and The Ides of March). The Monuments Men will be George Clooney’s second movie set during World War II, after the 1998 drama The Thin Red Line, in which Clooney had a small supporting role (The Good German was technically set while WWII was still going on in the Pacific, but after the war was over in Germany).#2 HOLLYWOOD CAN’T TAKE THEIR EYES OFF OF JERSEY BOYSGK Films (Edge of Darkness, The Town) has hired screenwriter John Logan, whose recent films included Hugo and Rango (also produced by GK Films), to adapt the Tony winning musical play Jersey Boys: The Story of Frankie Valli &amp; The Four Seasons. Based on the true story of how four young working class guys became pop stars in the 1950s, Jersey Boys has been eyed as the basis for a potential feature film pretty much since the musical debuted in 2005. Columbia Pictures is also expected to sign onto the adaptation, handling worldwide distribution for the GK Films project. Just like the Broadway musical, this adaptation of Jersey Boys is expected to use several of the quartet’s most famous songs, such as “Big Girls Don’t Cry,” “Can’t Take My Eyes Off of You,” “Oh, What a Night,” “Rag Doll,” and “Sherry.”#3 KATE WINSLET TO INVESTIGATE THE GUERNSEY LITERARY AND POTATO PEEL PIE SOCIETYKate Winslet has signed to star in Kenneth Branagh’s adaptation of the best selling novel The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society. That novel was the first and last written by Mary Ann Shaffer, as it was published posthumously in 2008. Kate Winslet will play British writer Juliet Ashton who, in the months after World War II, receives strange letters from the island of Guernsey describing the events that took place there during German occupation. This will be the second movie that Kate Winslet and Kenneth Branagh make together, following Branagh’s 1996 adaptation of Shakespeare’s Hamlet, in which Winslet played Ophelia. Comic book fans will also know this project as the movie that Kenneth Branagh is making instead of directing Thor 2. Filming of The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society is scheduled to start in March in the United Kingdom.#4 JAMES FRANCO IS A MYSTERY IN THE GAMEThere’s something mildly ironic about the efforts to adapt the 2005 Neil Strauss book The Game: Penetrating the Secret Society of Pickup Artists into a movie. That book about men obsessed with the “art” of picking up women has itself been passed along all over town, starting with Columbia Pictures, then Spyglass, then Lionsgate, then Fox Searchlight, and now MGM is the studio to finally move forward with the adaptation. James Franco is now in negotiations to star in The Game as “Mystery,” one of the “sargers” who all lived together in a mansion on the Sunset Strip (as seen in the VH1 reality show The Pickup Artist). The Game was written and will be directed by the team of Brian Koppelman and David Levien, whose previous two films as directors were Knockaround Knockaround Guys and 2009’s Solitary Man. Guys and 2009’s Solitary Man. Coincidentally, that second film starred Michael Douglas, who also was the star of the David Fincher film called… The Game. This is one of the week’s Fresh Developments mostly because of the impressive RT Tomatometer scores for the previous films written by Koppelman and Levien.#5 PARTY DOWN HEADS UP TO THE BIG SCREENParty Down was a comedy TV series about a Hollywood catering company that aired on the Starz channel for 20 episodes from 2009 to 2010. Low ratings, as well as the departure of costars Jane Lynch and Adam Scott to star in Glee and Parks and Recreation, respectively, were all partially credited with the series’ end. Party Down was created by Rob Thomas, who also created Veronica Mars, and just like that show (though those plans eventually fell apart), there is now talk of a Party Down movie. This week, actress Megan Mullally confirmed that a Party Down movie is indeed being written, with plans for most of the show’s cast to reunite later this year. What is unclear is whether or not this Party Down movie will indeed get a theatrical release, or whether it will just premiere on Starz or go otherwise drect-to-video.Rotten Ideas of the Week#4 DISNEY GOES INTO THE WOODSConsidering Hollywood’s current love affair with fairy tales (and the TV success of Once Upon a Time on ABC, owned by Disney), this story shouldn’t really surprise anyone. Walt Disney Pictures has hired director Rob Marshall (Nine, Memoirs of a Geisha) to adapt the 1987 Stephen Sondheim Broadway musical Into the Woods for the big screen. That play was very much ahead of its time, as its plot combined characters from various fairy tales such as Cinderella, Jack and the Beanstalk, Little Red Riding Hood and Rapunzel. It also makes a lot of sense that it would be Disney that adapts that musical into a movie. However, Into the Woods is one of the week’s Rotten Ideas not for any of those reasons, but because of the RT Tomatometer scores for the last three movies directed by Rob Marshall, all three of which were Rotten, with only his first film, Chicago, receiving a Fresh score.#3 THE CHRONICLES OF STARBUCK: KATEE SACKHOFF JOINS RIDDICKAfter years in development hell, Vin Diesel’s third movie starring his science fiction persona, Riddick, is finally filming in Montreal, and so this week, two of Diesel’s costars were announced. First up was Katee Sackhoff, who most fans will know as Starbuck from the 2000s reboot of Battlestar Galactica (she was the blonde with the really big… cigars). And then there is Spanish actor Jordi Molla (who was also recently mentioned as being up for the villain role in the Star Trek sequel, before it went to Benedict Cumberbatch). Both Katee Sackhoff and Jordi Molla will be playing mercenaries, with Sackhoff described as “Nordic” and Molla’s character Santa being described as the leader of a group of mercenaries, but it is unclear if that means that Sackhoff is with Molla’s group or not. In Riddick, Vin Diesel’s character will find himself left for dead on a dangerous planet where he is soon found by bounty hunters, but what they don’t know is that something has happened on the planet that makes Riddick more dangerous than ever. Riddick is being directed by David Twohy, who in addition to the first two movies (Pitch Black and The Chronicles of Riddick) also directed Timescape, The Arrival, Below and A Perfect Getaway. The casting of Riddick is one of the week’s Rotten Ideas because of the “Rotten” scores that the two previous movies received on the RT Tomatometer (55% for Pitch Black and 29% for The Chronicles of Riddick).#2 HANSEL &amp; GRETEL: WITCH HUNTERS GETS LOST IN THE WOODS FOR 10 MONTHSNormally, the Weekly Ketchup focuses on movie development news, which mostly involves movies before they start filming. That’s because most news involving films before they come out actually happens before cameras roll. Every once in a while, though, that’s not the case, such as with this story. Paramount Pictures has decided to yank Hansel &amp; Gretel: Witch Hunters from its former release date of March 2, 2012 and shift the film back, way back, all the way until January 11, 2013. As the title suggests, this 3D supernatural action thriller depicts the Brothers Grimm characters as adults who survived the incident at the Gingerbread House, and now travel around Europe, hunting down evil witches. Tommy Wirkola (Dead Snow) directed Hansel &amp; Gretel: Witch Hunters, and Jeremy Renner and Gemma Arterton played the title characters. And that right there might just be why Paramount decided to wait another 10 months before releasing the film (besides the obvious notion that January is often when troubled movies are released). Someone at Paramount may have made the decision that a movie starring Jeremy Renner might do better at the box office after the release of The Avengers and The Bourne Legacy this year than it would if Hansel &amp; Gretel: Witch Hunters was released a couple of months before those movies. Or maybe it really just is an awful movie. Either way, this move feels like a Rotten Idea.#1 THIS WEEK IN FOUND FOOTAGE MOVIES: TWO MORE FROM THE DIRECTOR OF THE DEVIL INSIDEAlthough Hollywood’s love affair with remakes and fairy tales gets more press, a continuing emerging trend is the recent success of cheaply made “found footage” horror films like Paranormal Activity 3 and this past weekend’s The Devil Inside, all produced and distributed by Paramount Pictures. William Brent Bell, the cowriter and director of The Devil Inside, is not resting on whatever laurels a $33.7 million opening weekend might be perceived as. In April, Bell is going to Romania to film an untitled found footage horror film that references “another classic horror mythology.” Given that Romania is also where Transylvania is, one has to wonder if Bell is planning on doing a vampire story. That project does not yet have a distributor. Meanwhile, over at Warner Bros, William Brent Bell has sold his pitch for The Vatican, a found footage horror movie that presumably has something to do with the Catholic Church. Finally, the director of The Devil Inside wasn’t the only one making “found footage” deals this week. Steven Quale, who made his fiction debut this year with Final Destination has made a deal with New Line Cinema for Category Six, about a group of high schoolers “documenting” a hurricane superstorm (the current scale only goes to Category Five). The two William Brent Bell found footage movies are this week’s Most Rotten Ideas based mostly on the truly abysmal 6% that The Devil Inside scored on the RT Tomatometer.For more Weekly Ketchup columns by Greg Dean Schmitz, check out the WK archive, and you can contact GDS via Facebook or a RT forum message.","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"Dead, killer","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Weekly-Ketchup-Tim-Burton-to-Film-Pinocchio-Adaptation-Minus-Johnny-Depp"},{"id":"47509230564116","title":"Weekly Ketchup: Sam Raimi Enters the World of Warcraft","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Weekly Ketchup: Sam Raimi Enters the World of WarcraftPlus a free Avatar sneak peek and lots of news on DC Comics films, Saw films, and blockbuster sequelsby Greg Dean Schmitz | July 24, 2009 |  CommentsThis is the week of Comic-Con International 2009 in San Diego, and so the world of movie news, and in particular, big fan-friendly projects, is quite active. Weekly Ketchup writer Greg Dean Schmitz unfortunately didn’t get the opportunity to visit the mega convention this year, but he was still able to combine some of its biggest and juiciest news items with others that actually happened in Hollywood, a hop, skip, and a jump away from San Diego. Since this column has been written midway through the convention, it’s possible some hot items might get missed this week, but as of publication, here’s how the week stands.#1 SAM RAIMI WILL TAKE US TO THE WORLD OF WARCRAFTDirector Sam Raimi (the Spider-Man and Evil Dead franchises) has signed on with Warner Bros and Legendary Pictures (The Dark Knight, 300, Watchmen) to be the man who brings Blizzard Entertainment’s Warcraft video game fantasy franchise to the big screen. Sam Raimi will be overseeing the development of the movie over the next several months with expectations that he will move on to film Warcraft after he wraps Spider-Man 4 next year for Columbia Pictures. Warcraft got its start as a series of real-time strategy games for the PC, before being adapted as the immensely popular World of Warcraft MMORPG (which, it’s worth noting, is not the title of this movie). Warcraft is set in the fantasy world of Azeroth, in which two powerful factions, the Alliance and the Horde, are pitted against each other, sometimes in all out war (the RTS games) and more recently in a sort of cold war stalemate (World of Warcraft). What exactly the story will be about is unknown, especially since, with Raimi’s involvement, it appears that the previous scripts might be thrown out as screenwriter Gary Whitta is now off the project. All of the Warcraft games are very dependent upon story, and have created a dense lore and mythology which offers enough material for several epic movies.#2 DC COMICS RAMPS UP MOVIE PLANS: THE FLASH, GREEN ARROW, AQUAMAN, ADAM STRANGE, AND… BIZARRO SUPERMAN?Apparently as a sort of a lead up article to Comic-Con, The Hollywood Reporter this week published a summary of DC Comics’ various comic book adaptation plans, with an emphasis on the company’s renewed focus on increasing their efforts. The next three movies will be Jonah Hex, The Losers and of course, Green Lantern. Other projects that DC and Warner Bros are actively developing at the moment include The Flash, Aquaman, Green Arrow (as well as Super Max, in which Green Arrow is also the central hero), Shazam, a Constantine sequel, a movie about space adventurer Adam Strange, and perhaps most surprisingly, a movie about one of Superman’s most famous villains, Bizarro, which the trade refers to as Bizarro Superman. These movies, based on what some might call DC’s “second string” heroes, seem able to get produced with less drama than the three characters that are noticeably absent from the list: Batman, Superman and Wonder Woman, all three of which the studio still has interest in adapting but admits are each perhaps years from happening.#3 BIG MOVIES TO FILM SOON: G.I. JOE 2, POTC 4, DARK SHADOWS, BATMAN 3This week’s Comic-Con has brought talk of several big movies that might start filming soon (mostly next year). First up, however, separate from Comic-Con, was director Steven Sommers’ revelation in Australia that G.I. Joe 2 is expected to start filming next summer, with apparently both Sommers and the full cast already signed on. Next up is the fourth Pirates of the Carribean movie from Disney, which an executive revealed they expect to start filming in April or May of 2010. The early word is that the movie will indeed still feature Johnny Depp as Captain Jack Sparrow, but that some of the other actors (namely Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley) may not continue on in what is being described as the start of a second trilogy for the franchise. In other Johnny Depp news, also at Comic-Con, Tim Burton revealed that, of the many projects to which he is attached, his next film after Alice in Wonderland will be his adaptation of the horror soap opera Dark Shadows, which will star Depp as the vampire Barnabas Collins. Finally, in the take-this-one-with-a-grain-of-salt category, Gary Oldman revealed at the Book of Eli conference that he is signed to start filming the third Batman movie next year, despite reports that seem to suggest that WB’s plans for the movie might not be done by that time.#4 (SOME OF) JAMES CAMERON’S AVATAR COMING TO THEATERS FOUR MONTHS EARLY (AND FOR FREE!)Yesterday at Comic-Con, after screening 20+ minutes of his upcoming CGI-heavy science fiction epic Avatar, James Cameron also announced that August 21, 2009 will be Avatar Day, when 20th Century Fox will premiere a 15 minute preview on as many IMAX and IMAX 3D screens as they can. The icing on the cake is that this 15 minute preview will be free. The concept is that Cameron wants to give the general public the same sort of preview experience that the Comic-Con audience received. That day will also see the premiere of the first full Avatar trailer in general theaters. You can read about what Cameron revealed of Avatar over at IGN Movies.#5 LEONARDO DICAPRIO JUST CROSSED OVER INTO… THE TWILIGHT ZONELeonardo DiCaprio’s Appian Way and Warner Bros are moving forward with plans to revive The Twilight Zone as a new feature film, to be written by Rand Ravich, writer/director of 1999’s The Astronaut’s Wife and creator of the NBC detective show Life. The Twilight Zone got its start, of course, as a classic science fiction anthology TV show in 1959, produced and hosted by Rod Serling, which was followed by two more TV series in 1985 and 2002. In 1983, four of Hollywood’s hottest directors (Steven Spielberg, John Landis, Joe Dante and George Miller) got together to make an anthology feature film (also a WB release), which is now perhaps most famous for a helicopter accident which caused the death of actor Vic Morrow. What DiCaprio’s Twilight Zone movie will be is not yet known, but the two most likely choices seem to be either another set of stories, or perhaps one single story adapting one of the many classic episodes from the original series. It’s not yet known if DiCaprio’s involvement as producer might also mean that he would star in the movie.#6 SONY’S TALKING TO THE MAN IN THE MIRROR: THE MICHAEL JACKSON CONCERT MOVIESony Pictures is close to finalizing a $50 million deal to produce a theatrical Michael Jackson concert movie using the 80 hours of rehearsal footage shot in the days just before the pop star’s June 25th, 2009 death. Although several studios, including Paramount, Fox, and Universal negotiated for the rights to this concert movie, Sony was always perceived as having the inside advantage since most of Michael Jackson’s music is also published by Sony’s music division. Kenny Ortega (Newsies, the High School Musical franchise), who filmed the rehearsal footage, is expected to direct this movie version and is reportedly already at work on compiling the footage into something Sony could release by the end of 2009. Ortega has the time this year to work on this Michael Jackson project, as his next film, the remake of Footloose, doesn’t start filming until March of 2010. The feature is expected to include three new music videos, including an alternative version of “Thriller,” which were intended to play in 3D at the concerts, although it is unclear if 3D will be used in the theatrical release of the movie.#7 ENTER THE DRAGON AGAIN, AND AGAIN, AND AGAINThe family of legendary martial artist and actor Bruce Lee have announced plans to bring his life to film not as just one film, but as a trilogy of biopics. The first film, Bruce Lee, will start filming in China in October, on a budget of $7 million, with Tony Leung Ka-Fai already cast as Lee’s father, although a director and all other cast (including Lee) have yet to be hired. Bruce Lee is scheduled for release on November 27, 2010, which will be the 70th anniversary of Lee’s birth; that date, however, may not necessarily apply to the United States, since the movie does not yet have a distributor here. There have been a few Bruce Lee biopics already, including 1993’s Dragon: The Bruce Lee Story, starring Jason Scott Lee (no relation). Acclaimed Chinese director Zhang Yimou (who is currently filming the Chinese remake of Blood Simple) has also expressed interest in making a Bruce Lee biopic (perhaps the family will recruit him?).#8 DAVID CRONENBERG TO TAKE US ON A BIZARRE JOURNEY TO COSMOPOLISAcclaimed Canadian director David Cronenberg (Scanners, Videodrome, Eastern Promises) has signed on to helm an adaptation of Don DeLillo’s 2003 novel, Cosmopolis. The premise of Cosmopolis sounds bizarre, and it promises potentially to be a return to the style of some of Cronenberg’s earlier films, albeit perhaps without some of the grosser elements. Cosmopolis is the story of a 28-year-old billionaire’s journey across Manhattan in his tech-heavy limousine as he attempts to get a new haircut, but spends the day in a series of entanglements, including traffic jams caused by a presidential visit, a funeral procession for a rap star, and a full scale riot. Meanwhile, the billionaire is also stalked by two men, has a series of chance encounters with his wife, and sees his fortune dwindling after he bet against the yen in the foreign markets. Cosmopolis, which has not yet been cast, will be a French-Canadian coproduction and will film in New York City and Toronto in 2010.#9 THIS WEEK IN SAW-RELATED NEWSThis week saw an unusual flurry of news items that all have ties to the Saw horror franchise. First up is Saw VII, which is gearing up for production even as Saw VI awaits its expected annual release this coming October. David Hackl, the production designer of II, III and IV, and the director of Saw V, will return to direct VII as well, from a script by Marcus Dunstan and Patrick Melton, the writers of IV, V and VI, the three Feast movies and next weekend’s The Collector. Plot details are unknown, but I’m guessing it will probably involve torture. Filming of Saw VII starts in January, 2010. Darren Lynn Bousman, who directed Saw II, Saw III, Saw IV and Repo! The Genetic Opera, has signed to write and direct a horror film called Abattoir, which will also be adapted as a graphic novel. Abattoir (French for “slaughterhouse”) is the story of a real estate agent who must clean up a mansion following a bloody massacre there; he encounters a strange old man who draws him into a dangerous “web of shadows, murders and massacres.” Finally, there is James Wan, who directed the first Saw and 2007’s Death Sentence. Wan has signed on to cowrite and direct the long-awaited adaptation of the Castlevania video game series, about a vampire hunter’s attempts to bring down Dracula and his undead hordes. That, in a nutshell, is a lot of Saw news for one week.#10 BLACK SABBATH GETS THEIR OWN HORROR FRANCHISE?Producer Mike Fleiss (Hostel, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre remake, Poseidon) has set up a new production company called Next Films, and the first announced project is a new horror movie franchise called Black Sabbath. At first glance, one might suspect this to be a remake of the 1963 Italian horror film, but Black Sabbath will actually be a new concept inspired by the groundbreaking heavy metal band of the same name; the movie itself, however, will have no relation to the bad outside of its title. In addition to approving the use of the band’s name, Black Sabbath guitarist Tony Iommi is also scoring the movie. While Iommi currently owns the trademark of the Black Sabbath name, lead singer Ozzy Osbourne recently filed suit for 50% of the rights. Anyway, no other details are known about Black Sabbath, and apparently the project does not yet have a writer. So, what do you think a Black Sabbath horror movie should be about?ROTTEN IDEA OF THE WEEK: NICOLAS CAGE TO PLAY THE GREEN HORNET VILLAINThis week’s rotten idea does not go to a newly announced movie, this column’s specialty, but to a bit of casting news: Nicolas Cage is in talks to play the “gangster villain” in next summer’s comedic adaptation of The Green Hornet, starring Seth Rogan, with Cameron Diaz in talks to play his reporter romantic interest. Now, I should note that this particular “rotten idea” is not entirely about the movie, for which I hold out some promise since it’s being directed by Michel Gondry (Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, Be Kind Rewind). Nope, I’m particularly just concerned with the career of Nicolas Cage, who once showed a lot of promise, but in recent years has mostly shown an interest in making a series of bizarre acting choices in flawed movies like Ghost Rider and The Wicker Man. In other words, he’s one or two movies away from becoming John Travolta. The two movies Cage currently has in the can and heading towards release are Season of the Witch, where he plays a medieval knight, and Disney’s The Sorcerer’s Apprentice, where he plays a wizard. Now, it’s possible that his Green Hornet villain role will be awesome, but I just have this sneaking suspicion that it won’t be. And since Nicolas Cage was once one of my favorite actors (back in the Leaving Las Vegas days), that makes this casting choice the Rotten Idea of the Week.For more Weekly Ketchup columns by Greg Dean Schmitz, check out the WK archive, and you can contact GDS through his MySpace page or via a RT forum message.","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"Epix, 93rd, The, obituary, Television, ABC, disaster, Ovation, 71st, TV","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Weekly-Ketchup-Sam-Raimi-Enters-the-World-of-Warcraft"},{"id":"47509232178972","title":"Weekly Ketchup: Reboots for Buffy and Alien","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Weekly Ketchup: Reboots for Buffy and AlienPlus new projects for Seth Rogen, Danny McBride, and Steve Cooganby Greg Dean Schmitz | May 29, 2009 |  CommentsIt’s been a slow post-Memorial Day news week, but our top 11 stories still have some doozies, including four remakes, two movie projects based on British television shows and the news of what DreamWorks Animation plans to be releasing for the next few years.#1 BUFFY THE TWILIGHT SLAYERIn 1997, writer and producer Joss Whedon took the idea of a TV show version of the 1992 Buffy the Vampire Slayer movie and turned it into a cultural and generational sensation, making Sarah Michelle Gellar a star and launching a rabid fanbase that is still among the largest and most dedicated that television has ever seen. The show, however, ended six years ago. Meanwhile, Twilight has come along and given today’s young girls a new franchise of human-vampire canoodling to fantasize about. To some tween fans of Twilight who barely remember the show, Sarah Michelle Gellar might just seem like an actress in her 30s who is single digits away from being old enough to be a gramma. So, if you are the producers of the original Buffy the Vampire Slayer, what do you do? Take advantage of the concept of there being a “slayer for every generation” and, that’s right, reboot Buffy the Vampire Slayer, all Star Trek-like. Oh, if only Star Trek had been both awful and a bomb so that it couldn’t be used as an excuse now for even more remakes than we already had (I’m not serious, I wanted Star Trek to be good, and it was, but you know what I mean, right?). To make the concept even more egregious to Buffy fans, there are currently no plans to involve Joss Whedon in the reboot, although they don’t “rule it out.” Also, since the producers only have the rights to the original movie, that means you won’t be seeing any of Buffy‘s friends, like Spike, Angel or Willow. So, Buffy fans, where do you stand? Do you embrace the concept as a way of continuining the Buffy franchise for generations to come, or does it sound about as cool as, you know, the original movie starring Kristy Swanson?#2 IF KATEE SACKHOFF IS TYPHOID MARY, SHE SHOULD REALLY HAVE THAT CHECKED OUTOkay, admittedly, this is a slow news week. Last week there was the Cannes Film Festival, where a lot of news happened, and then this week had Memorial Day and a four day week as well. So, a rumor from a Los Angeles comic book shop that I would normally never have room for, this week ends up in the #2 spot. Katee Sackhoff, who played Starbuck on Battlestar Galactica, paid a visit to Golden Apple last week, where she reportedly bought out every comic the store had that features the Marvel villain Typhoid Mary, possibly in hopes of landing a role in an upcoming Marvel movie. Typhoid Mary, a schizophrenic assassin with mutant powers of telepathy and telekinesis, is a character that is not particularly well known to the audience at large, but has maintained a bit of a fan base over the years among comics fans, since being first introduced as a romantic interest for Daredevil. Typhoid Mary also had a small role in the Elektra movie. So, the question we can ask next is which movie might Sackhoff be auditioning for? The three options seem to be the reboot of Daredevil, the Deadpool movie (Mary has also appeared in his comics) or, and this is probably less likely, a stand alone Typhoid Mary movie.#3 DISNEY ON BOARD FOR YET ANOTHER FLIGHT OF THE NAVIGATORWalt Disney Pictures is developing a remake of their 1986 sci-fi kids adventure (and flop), Flight of the Navigator. Flight of the Navigator was about a twelve year old boy who reappears mysteriously after his disappearance eight years earlier, without having aged a day, just as NASA discovers an abandoned alien spacecraft. Brad Copeland, the writer of Disney’s 2007 hit comedy Wild Hogs has been hired to update Flight of the Navigator. There’s no director attached yet. Disney had a hit earlier this year with Race to Witch Mountain, a remake of another of their old live-action science fiction movies, so it seems likely that is the model being used for pitching this remake as well. Perhaps Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson can play the NASA official who befriends the young boy?#4 THE TAKING OUT OF PIRATES 1 2 3Columbia Pictures has secured the film rights to the life story and upcoming memoir of Captain Richard Phillips of the Maersk Alabama, the cargo ship famously highjacked by Somalian pirates last month, culminating in the expert sniping by Navy SEALS of three of the pirates holding Phillips at gunpoint. When the Maersk Alabama was taken, Phillips surrendered himself to the pirates so that his crew could lock themselves away, and later attempted an escape. Kevin Spacey is one of the producers of the project, but there’s no word yet as to whether the actor is considering playing Phillips, to whom he bares absolutely no resemblance.#5 DOCTOR WHO AND THE CASE OF THE RECURRING MOVIE RUMORAh spring, it’s an annual event as reliable as the recurring rumor of plans for a Doctor Who theatrical movie. Since Star Trek proved an old sci-fi show that got started in the 1960s can be turned into a successful movie 40 years later, why not Doctor Who, right? The revived show continues to be a success both in England and here in America on the Sci Fi network, with fans awaiting the arrival of the eleventh incarnation of The Doctor, to be played by Matt Smith starting in 2010. In the meantime, however, the most recent Doctor was played by Andy Tennant, who will be playing The Doctor in two upcoming episodes of The Sarah Jane Adventures. In an article about that appearance, a BBC Films representative confirmed that a “script is in development” for the long-awaited Doctor Who movie. There are no details other than that, except that the movie is “a long time away,” which means that by the time it’s ever made, the star will probably be Matt Smith, or maybe even whoever plays the 12th incarnation.#6 HE’S ALAN PARTRIDGE AND YOU’RE NOTSteve Coogan appears intent to prove that Sacha Baron Cohen isn’t the only British comedian who can turn fictional TV characters into movie stars, as he has revealed that plans for an Alan Partridge movie are still alive, based upon the fictional telly presenter that has starred in the shows The Day Today, Knowing Me, Knowing You… with Alan Partridge and I’m Alan Partridge. The idea of an Alan Partridge movie were first announced in 2005, but this is the first news we’ve heard in years that the project is still quite alive. Unlike Cohen’s Borat and Bruno, which were featured in the HBO series Da Ali G Show, Coogan’s Alan Partridge character is largely unknown in the United States. According to Wikipedia, Partridge’s personality traits include homophobia (despite possibly himself being gay), misogyny, political conservatism and an obsession with being on television as much as possible.#7 WHEN THE WORKING DAY IS DONE, GIRLS JUST WANNA GET REMADEAs we get closer to the saturation point at which there are no more 1980s movies that aren’t being remade, 20th Century Fox has announced plans to remake Girls Just Want to Have Fun, the 1985 comedy starring Helen Hunt and Sarah Jessica Parker that borrowed its title from the Cyndi Lauper hit. Fox has hired Michelle Morgan, who also wrote a romantic comedy called Is He the One for the studio, to work on the script. In the original, Hunt and Parker played two friends who audition to be on a show called Dance TV. The remake seems to be trading upon the popularity of modern reality shows like Dancing with the Stars and Fox’s American Idol, as well as the success of 2007’s Hairspray, which had a very similar premise.#8 DANNY MCBRIDE TO BE SOME LUCKY VILLAIN’S BEST HENCH, MANDanny McBride is not quite yet a household name, but the commercials for Land of the Lost are certainly getting him face time. The week before that movie opens up, McBride has landed a starring and writing role in Hench, a Warner Bros. adaptation of an obscure 2004 graphic novel ( http://ait-planetlar.com/hench.shtml ) about an injured football player who takes a job as a henchman for a successful super villain. Danny McBride’s cowriter on Hench will be Shawn Harwell, who cowrote three episodes of McBride’s HBO series Eastbound &amp; Down. Danny McBride’s other writing credits include cowriting The Foot Fist Way and the upcoming fantasy spoof Your Highness, in which he will costar with James Franco.#9 PEGG AND FROST’S PAUL CASTS UP BY GOING SUPERBAD IN ADVENTURELANDThe third movie to costar British comedians Nick Frost and Simon Pegg (stars of Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz) will be Paul, a road trip comedy from Universal and Working Title about two sci fi fanboys who find an actual alien outside Area 51. That bit of news has actually been known for a while, as well as that it will be directed by Greg Mottola (Adventureland, Superbad), and was written by Frost and Pegg. What is news this week, however, is who the rest of the cast will be. As the voice of Paul, the title character alien, is Seth Rogen, who costarred in Mottola’s Superbad. From Mottola’s Adventureland (and Saturday Night Live), Bill Hader and Kristen Wiig have also been cast. The other two actors announced this week are Jason Bateman (Arrested Development) and Jane Lynch, the older actress/comedienne who is probably best known for playing Andy’s boss in The 40 Year Old Virgin. Although Paul doesn’t seem to be quite the same sort of “genre spoof” as Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz were (unless you consider it a take on the “road trip” comedy), those two guys have a great natural comedic chemistry, and so any chance to see them reunite is highly anticipated.#10 DREAMWORKS ANIMATION ANNOUNCES THEIR PLANS TO BE ALMOST AS GOOD AS PIXAR FOR THE NEXT THREE YEARSDreamWorks Animation has bumped up its production schedule from two CGI animated movies a year to five movies every two years, and in doing so, has revealed a couple of projects that may have been announced as being developed, but were as yet unconfirmed as being within three years of release. First off, it’s worth noting that this newly ambitious schedule follows 2009, in which the animation studio only released Monsters vs Aliens. In 2010, there will be How to Train Your Dragon (3/26/10), Shrek Forever After (AKA Shrek 4) (5/21/10) and Oobermind (AKA Master Mind) (11/5/10). In 2011, there will be Kung Fu Panda: The Kaboom of Doom (6/3/11) and The Guardians (11/4/11), which is one of the first newer projects in this announcement. The Guardians is about a sort of super hero team made up of holiday representatives and other fairytale creatures: North (Santa Claus), Bunnymund (Easter Bunny), Tooth (The Tooth Fairy), Sand (The Sandman) and Jack Frost. In 2012, there will be the Shrek spin-off Puss in Boots (3/12/12), Madagascar 3 (5/25/12) and on November 2, 2012, one of three possible projects, with the other two presumably being released in 2013. The Croods is about a family of cavemen who encounter a “modern caveman” whose search for tomorrow is at odds with their reliance on the tools of yesterday. Truckers is based upon Terry Pratchett’s Bromeliad Trilogy, and is about tiny creatures that live in a department store. Finally, there is Super Secret Ghost Project, which promises to give us ghosts as we’ve never seen them before.ROTTEN IDEA OF THE WEEK: IN HOLLYWOOD, NO ONE CAN APPARENTLY HEAR YOU SCREAM ABOUT THE ALIEN REBOOTOkay, Hollywood, now you’re starting to make me angry. Yes, Star Trek was awesome. Yes, it is the biggest hit of the year. That, however, does not give you a greenlight to think collectively that every great franchise out there now needs to get a “reboot.” And you especially don’t go anywhere near my precious: Ridley Scott’s 1978 horror masterpiece of Alien. That, however, is apparently what 20th Century Fox is thinking of doing, which we know about thanks to a tip to Bloody Disgusting from the same source that told them about the plans to reboot Predator. If the story holds out, the rumor is that Ridley Scott himself is producing the remake, which will be directed by one Carl Rinsch, who directs TV commercials for Scott Free Productions. The premise of the movie will be the same as Alien: a spaceship has a single alien on board, and it’s causing havok. Can a remake of Alien hope to possibly deliver the same sort of horror and suspense, however? Alien is one of the most frightening and disturbing movies ever made, and from start to finish is just about perfect. If Ridley Scott wants to make more Alien movies, great. There’s a whole wide universe out there in which the xenomorphs could have landed, and caused problems, but why revisit the Nostromo? Why, why, why?For more Weekly Ketchup columns by Greg Dean Schmitz, check out the WK archive, and you can contact GDS through his MySpace page or via a RT forum message.

First, Ryan Phillippe (Cruel Intentions) was added to the list of actors up to play Steve Rogers, and he is particularly of interest because at age 35, he is the oldest actor in the running (by several years). Then, Channing Tatum (G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra) was also added to the mix, with the word also being that Tatum is not just in the running, but the top contender. Yet another name that emerged this week is Sebastian Stan, from Gossip Girl, but he shouldn’t be confused with Chace Crawford, another double initialed youth from that show (who is now out of contention for the Captain America job). However, even as three new names are added to the list, two names were dropped this week, as Garrett Hedlund (Tron: Legacy) and Wilson Bethel (The Young and the Restless) are now out. That brings the list of possible Captain Americas to five: Phillippe, Tatum, Stan, Mike Vogel (Cloverfield) and Chris Evans (Fantastic Four). However, there is a lot of news about Chris Evans that makes him seem unlikely, as last week, he signed on for an Anna Faris comedy, and this week, Evans signed on for the lead role in a health care legal drama called Puncture. With The First Avenger: Captain America scheduled to begin filming next month, these deals seem to indicate that Chris Evans would be unavailable. Someone else you can rule out from appearing in the movie is Edward Norton, who this week said he will not be making any Bruce Banner cameos in Thor or The First Avenger: Captain America. There was also casting news this week for the film’s female lead, who will be the character of Betsy Ross (not to be confused with the creator of the American flag or Betty Ross, the Hulk’s girlfriend). Betsy Ross went on to become a sidekick to Captain America under the name of Golden Girl, but in the 60 years since the Golden Age of comics ended, Golden Girl has become an extremely obscure character. So, it’s a little ironic that such an unknown character will probably have an action figure in 2011, while much more popular characters have never appeared in a movie at all. The first actress mentioned as being in talks to play Golden Girl was Keira Knightley, and she was soon joined by Alice Eve (She’s Out of My League) and Emily Blunt (The Wolfman, The Young Victoria). Whoever ends up starring in it, The First Avenger: Captain America is scheduled to be released by Paramount on July 22, 2011.#2 THE MOVIE MOST PEOPLE THINK WAS DIRECTED BY TIM BURTON TO ACTUALLY BE DIRECTED BY TIM BURTONWhen your new movie makes over $150 million in its first two weekends, it’s time to get your agent busy making deals on dream projects. For Tim Burton, that appears to have been the opportunity to direct a stop-motion animated 3D adaptation of Charles Addams’ original comic strip characters The Addams Family. Gomez, Morticia, Uncle Fester, Lurch, Pugsley, Wednesday and Cousin It are probably best known for starring in a 1960s TV show and two live action movies directed by Barry Sonnenfeld. However, for this stop-motion movie, Tim Burton will be drawing direct inspiration for the artistic style from Charles Addams’ original artwork. Something that’s particularly interesting about this detail is that, originally, Addams never gave any of the characters names, and only came up with them when the 1964 TV show was in development. Burton’s Addams Family project is being produced by Illumination Entertainment, the Universal-based company that is also producing this summer’s Despicable Me and next year’s I Hop, the Easter Bunny movie starring Russell Brand. Other Illusion projects in development include Ricky Gervais’ Flanimals, Where’s Waldo? and Dr. Seuss’ The Lorax. There’s no writer yet for The Addams Family, and Tim Burton is expected to be closely involved in the visual design of the movie and the characters.#3 GREEN LANTERN: JANGO FETT WILL PLAY ABIN SURThe casting for Green Lantern continued this week with the news that Temuera Morrison will play Abin Sur. Abin Sur is the bald red-skinned alien who recruits Hal Jordan to replace him as the Green Lantern of Sector 2814 when he dies. Temuera Morrison is probably best known for playing Jango Fett in Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones, and also for starring in 1994’s Once Were Warriors. Morrison isn’t the only Maori New Zealander cast, however, as actor/director Taika Waititi will also be costarring as Hal Jordan’s best friend, engineer Thomas Kalmaku (AKA Pieface in the un-PC Silver Age comics). Morrison and Waititi join a cast that includes Ryan Reynolds (Hal Jordan), Mark Strong (Sinestro), Peter Sarsgaard (Hector Hammond), Blake Lively (Carol Ferris) and Tim Robbins. Director Martin Campbell (Casino Royale, The Legend of Zorro) started filming Green Lantern in 3D this week in New Orleans, and the film will be released on June 17, 2011.#4 ROBERT DOWNEY, JR. IN TALKS TO STAR IN ONE OF ANGELINA JOLIE’S CAST OFFSRobert Downey, Jr. is in talks to star in Gravity, a movie in which Angelina Jolie was first reported to star, before she dropped out of the project a week later. At the time, Gravity was described as being mostly about Jolie’s character, but the Downey news clarifies the story a bit to say that there are actually two central characters. Downey would play the leader of a remote space station who is stranded with a female coworker when a satellite explodes and kills the rest of their team. Gravity will be filmed in 3D by director Alfonso Cuaron (Children of Men, Y Tu Mama Tambien) from a script he wrote with his son Jonas. If Downey signs on, he will film Gravity in London this summer before moving on to also film Sherlock Holmes 2 there this fall.#5 JAMIE FOXX FOLLOWS TRACY MORGAN AS BRUCE WILLIS’ LATEST PARTNERBruce Willis has long been attached to star in the video game adaptation Kane &amp; Lynch: Dead Men, but there was still a question as to who would play Lynch. In the game, Lynch is portrayed as a white guy with long hair and a beard, but the film version will be played by Jamie Foxx. Kane &amp; Lynch is the story of two inmates who team up when Kane’s daughter is kidnapped as leverage to force them to recover a doomsday device (in the game, it’s just stolen money they’re after). Kane &amp; Lynch is a Lionsgate production that will mark the directorial debut of Simon Crane, a stunt coordinator and second unit director whose recent work includes Jumper, Hancock, Stardust and this summer’s Salt. The news of Jamie Foxx’s casting came from a Tweet by screenwriter Kyle Ward, for whom Kane &amp; Lynch will be his feature debut (he’s also writing another video game adaptation, Hitman 2). Filming of Kane &amp; Lynch is scheduled to start in August.#6 MARTIN SCORSESE TO ALLOW WACKY BORAT GUY AROUND HIS CHILD STARSEveryone was surprised when Martin Scorsese announced plans to direct an adaptation of a kids book called The Invention of Hugo Cabret. What’s even more surprising is that the movie is actually casting up, which makes it stand out considerably from all of the other movie projects Scorsese is attached to that either never get made or take a decade to realize. The first wave of Hugo Cabret casting this week featured two Brits, and they were then followed by two kids. Sacha Baron Cohen (Borat, Bruno) will play a Paris train station inspector and Sir Ben Kingsley will play filmmaker Georges Melies. Melies is probably most famous for the 1902 silent film La Voyage dans la Lune (A Trip to the Moon), which was way, way, way ahead of its time in the realm of visual special effects. Georges Melies was also a collector of wind up dolls called automata, and served as an inspiration to novelist Brian Selznick when he wrote The Invention of Hugo Cabret (which is why he’s a character in the novel and movie). Starring as 12-year-old orphan Hugo Cabret will be Asa Butterfield, who starred in The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas, and recently wrapped up filming of Nanny McPhee and the Big Bang. Chloe Moretz, the young star of Kick-Ass (as well as the vampire in the upcoming American remake of Let the Right One In), has also signed on to play a character named Isabelle. The Invention of Hugo Cabret is Martin Scorsese’s second collaboration with screenwriter John Logan (The Aviator), who also cowrote Gladiator, Any Given Sunday and The Last Samurai. The Invention of Hugo Cabret is now a Sony project after being put in turnaround by Warner Bros, and filming is scheduled to start in May, 2010 in London and Paris.#7 DAVID FINCHER SEARCHING FOR A BOBBY FISCHER BIOPICDirector David Fincher (Fight Club, Zodiac) recently wrapped up filming The Social Network, the movie about the founding of Facebook. Searching for his next project, Fincher has signed on with Columbia Pictures to direct Pawn Sacrifice, a biopic about Bobby Fischer, the chess genius who repeatedly made international news in the 1960s and 1970s for his winning record, including defeats against Soviet players considered unbeatable. Fischer eventually retired from playing chess, and in the years before his death in 2008, her became infamous for his anti-semitic beliefs and statements. Pawn Sacrifice was written by Steven Knight, screenwriter of Dirty Pretty Things and Eastern Promises, who is also adapting Dan Brown’s The Lost Symbol. Pawn Sacrifice will focus on Fischer’s early life and climax with his 1972 match against Soviet player Boris Spassky, so it may not spend a lot of time on Fischer’s later years. David Fincher is also attached to an English language remake of the 2009 Swedish drama The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, but there is no deal in place for the film with any production company.#8 OWEN WILSON AND WOODY HARRELSON PROVE THEY’RE JUST A COUPLE OF TURKEYSA new production company called Bedrock Studios has announced its first projects, the first of which will be a CGI animated comedy called Turkeys. Owen Wilson and Woody Harrelson will star in Turkeys as two of the titular birds who find a time machine and travel back in time for the first Thanksgiving to prevent the Pilgrims from ever making turkey dinners a holiday tradition. Luke Wilson will also be voicing a character. Turkeys will be directed by Ash Brannon (codirector of Surf’s Up, Toy Story 2) from a script by John J. Strauss (cowriter of The Santa Clause 2, The Lizzie McGuire Movie) and David I. Stern, the writer of the direct-to-video release Open Season 2. Peter Farrelly is executive producing Turkeys, and the movie is aiming for a 2011 release. Three other movies on Bedrock Studios’ slate are Dinosaur Bob (about a dinosaur family), Rats of NIMH and A Wrinkle in Time. Rats of NIMH is an adaptation of Robert C. O’Brien’s Mrs. Frisby and the Rats of NIMH, which was previously adapted as the 1982 film The Secret of NIMH. A Wrinkle in Time is an adaptation of a young adult science fiction novel by Madeleine L’Engle, and the first of four novels about the same characters who have interdimensional adventures. A Wrinkle in Time also made the news this week when Bedrock hired screenwriter Jeff Stockwell (cowriter of Bridge to Terabithia, The Dangerous Lives of Altar Boys), who is also working on a live-action adaptation of Hayao Miyazaki’s Kiki’s Delivery Service.ROTTEN IDEAS OF THE WEEK#2 HOLLYWOOD CONTINUES REGURGITATING KURT RUSSELL’S CAREER: OVERBOARD TO BE REMADEEscape from New York is being remade, The Thing is getting a prequel, and there’s a whole TV empire based around Stargate. The movie career of Kurt Russell is one that Hollywood appears to love revisiting. And now, another Kurt Russell movie is getting remade. Jennifer Lopez is in talks with Columbia Pictures to star in a remake of Overboard, the 1987 romantic comedy starring Kurt Russell and his domestic partner Goldie Hawn. Overboard was the story of a spoiled rich lady who falls off her yacht, contracts amnesia and is then conned by a local guy into believing that she is his wife so that he can have someone take care of his house and his four sons. The Overboard remake script has apparently already been through some rewrites, with the credited writers including Adam Cooper and Bill Collage (cowriters of Accepted, New York Minute) and Leslie Dixon (Mrs. Doubtfire), who also wrote the original 1987 movie. On April 23, Jennifer Lopez will star in The Back-Up Plan, her first movie since 2006’s El Cantante. This is one of this week’s Rotten Ideas because it’s yet another remake, although the fact that Overboard is not exactly considered a classic by many people (50% RT Score) might mean it’s one of those cases where the remake has a chance to be a better movie. But then again, the latest writers to tackle it cowrote New York Minute.#1 THE FINAL DESTINATION WASN’T THE FINAL FINAL DESTINATIONWarner Bros executive Alan Horn announced at ShoWest this week that the studio has plans for a fifth movie in the Final Destination horror franchise. Last August, the title of The Final Destination seemed to suggest that it was the last film. However, the movie also made $150 million worldwide, and so that is apparently enough of a reason for Warner Bros to find a way to keep making Final Destination movies. There are no other details currently known about who will write or direct the fifth film. As for what it will be about, it’s not too hard to guess that it will probably be about a bunch of young people who narrowly avoid death but then start getting killed off in other convoluted ways. This is this week’s #1 Rotten Idea because it’s a reminder that though fans collectively complain about remake fever, sequelitis will continue as long as studios see money to be made. It’s different when a franchise like Harry Potter has books with actual stories to be told. With horror franchises like Final Destination and Saw, however, entire movies are written and produced around the same old gimmick, and then repeated ad nauseum until they stop making money (and sometimes, not even then). Also, the RT score for The Final Destination was a fairly dismal 27%. What are the chances Final Destination 5 will turn out any better?For more Weekly Ketchup columns by Greg Dean Schmitz, check out the WK archive, and you can contact GDS through his MySpace page or via a RT forum message.","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"obituary, based","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Weekly-Ketchup-More-Captain-America-and-Tim-Burtons-latest"},{"id":"47509240386407","title":"The Weekly Ketchup: I Am Legend Trailer; Dark Knight Coming; Jet Li In Mummy 3","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})The Weekly Ketchup: I Am Legend Trailer; Dark Knight Coming; Jet Li In Mummy 3Also, Rowling outs Dumbledore, and Naomi Watts joins The Birds.by Nick Hershey | October 26, 2007 |  CommentsIn this week’s Ketchup, the first official trailer of I Am Legend appears, there’s a good reason to see Legend on the IMAX, and Jet Li in a Mummy 3 screen shot.

That project is Sucker Punch, starring Amanda Seyfried (Mamma Mia) as Babydoll, a young woman in the 1950s sent by her stepfather to a mental institution to receive a lobotomy. When there, Babydoll retreats into a dream world, “like Alice in Wonderland with machine guns,” where she sets off adventures in her mind with four other girls to be played by Evan Rachel Wood, Vanessa Hudgens, Abbie Cornish and Emma Stone. The goal is to acquire five objects that will allow Babydoll to escape before she is “deflowered by a vile man.” IGN put the finishing touches on their description of the project by saying that it includes “everything from dragons to B-52s to brothels.” Having seen what Snyder was able to accomplish with Watchmen, it’s exciting to hear that he is following it up with what sounds like a total mind trip movie.#2 MAD MAX 4… AS ANIME?Talking to MTV, Australian director George Miller, whose career includes both creating the Mad Max franchise and family friendly movies like Babe and Happy Feet, revealed where he is expecting to take Mad Max next. Instead of adapting the long-in-development fourth Mad Max movie as a live-action feature starring Mel Gibson, the apocalyptic adventure will be an R-rated 3-D anime theatrical release. Saying that he hopes to adapt the Mad Max anime to have a more western (non-Japanese) feel, Miller intimated that the plot would be lifted from the 2003 Mad Max 4 project (which would have starred Mel Gibson) that was eventually shelved.#3 MARMADUKE, YET ANOTHER LOVABLE POOCH HEADED TO THEATERS20th Century Fox has signed director Tom Dey (Shanghai Noon, Failure to Launch) to develop a movie based upon the comic strip character, Marmaduke, a Great Dane whose comedic hijinks have been gracing newspapers since 1954. That, however, is where the information about this project pretty much ends, as it is not known if the movie will be live action, CGI animated, or a combination of both. Fox did have success with the CGI-live-action family friendly hybrids of Alvin and the Chipmunks and Garfield, so it won’t be surprise if that’s how we end up seeing Marmaduke.#4 MATT DAMON TO JOIN PHILIP K. DICK’S ADJUSTMENT BUREAUUniversal has picked up a package movie deal, The Adjustment Bureau (based on The Adjustment Team by Philip K. Dick), that was being shopped around Hollywood last week, with Matt Damon attached to star and screenwriter George Nolfi (Ocean’s Twelve, The Sentinel) expected to make his directorial debut from his own script. The Adjustment Bureau is described as a sci-fi romance about a congressman in love with a ballet dancer who discovers that Earth is one big soundstage controlled by strange outside forces, and Nolfi hopes to start filming by late summer 2009. Here’s hoping that Matt Damon has better luck with starring in a movie based upon a Philip K. Dick story than his buddy Ben Affleck had with Paycheck. The concept of The Adjustment Bureau also brings to mind a mix perhaps of Dark City and The Truman Show. Filming is scheduled to start in September 2009.#5 KEVIN SMITH GOES HOLLYWOOD WITH A COUPLE OF COPSKevin Smith has signed with Warner Bros to make his second movie with a big Hollywood studio (after Mallrats with Universal) called A Couple of Cops. Curiously, the project has already had a compromise, with the title being changed from A Couple of Dicks (it’s about detectives). On his latest spoken word DVD, Kevin Smith talked about Bruce Willis’ interest in working with him as director after Smith had a supporting role as an actor in Live Free or Die Hard, but opined that he had no idea how anything he would ever write would appeal to Willis as something he would want to star in. A Couple of Cops, which Smith did not write, is apparently the project they agreed upon, with Tracy Morgan co-starring as well. Before it came to Warner Bros, James Gandolfini and Robin Williams were at one point attached to star. A Couple of Cops is about two detectives who track down a stolen baseball card, rescue a beautiful Mexican woman and have encounters with gangsters and laundered money. Warner Bros has scheduled A Couple of Cops for a release in January, 2010.#6 DOWNSIZING ISN’T ENTIRELY WHAT YOU THINK IT’S ABOUTReese Witherspoon, Paul Giamatti and Sacha Baron Cohen (Borat) are committed (but not yet signed) to star in Downsizing, the latest comedy from director Alexander Payne, who both Witherspoon (Election) and Giamatti (Sideways) have worked with before. The term “downsizing” usually refers to what companies call laying off employees, and the movie is indeed about people experiencing economic hard times, but the twist to the title is that Giamatti plays a man whose solution to his money problems is to actually seek out some means of having themselves miniaturized so that their cost of living is more affordable. Cohen will play a tiny person from overseas. Payne is still working on the script with frequent collaborator Jim Taylor. Although Payne has a first look deal at Fox Searchlight, because of the special effects required for Downsizing, the budget may force the movie to end up at a different studio.#7 STEVE CARELL TO STAR IN DINNER FOR SCHMUCKS AND HI-TSteve Carell lined up two new movies this week. First up is Dinner for Schmucks, a long-in-development comedy that will be Austin Powers director Jay Roach’s first project since 2004’s Meet the Fockers (with news of that series’ third movie, Little Fockers is now no longer on his slate). Sacha Baron Cohen had long been attached to star, but now Steve Carell and Paul Rudd will be starring instead. Co-produced by Paramount, DreamWorks and Spyglass, Dinner for Schmucks (a remake of the French comedy, Les Diner des Cons, AKA The Dinner Game) is about a weekly dinner in which a group of friends are challenged to bring people they consider “idiots” as guests. Carell’s other new comedy this week is Hi-T, a Warner Bros comedy written by Kim Barker (co-writer of License to Wed) about a man who experiences unpredictable mood swings after an injury forces him to get testosterone injections.#8 KEIRA KNIGHTLEY GETS CLONED IN NEVER LET ME GOKeira Knightley, Andrew Garfield and Carey Mulligan have signed with Fox Searchlight to star in Never Let Me Go, a sci-fi story based upon a novel by Kazuo Ishiguro (The Remains of the Day) about three childhood friends living in a dystopian future England who discover that they were cloned for “cold, tragic reasons” (i.e. organ donors). Time magazine named Never Let Me Go as one of the top 100 English language novels from 1923 to 2005. Mark Romanek (One Hour Photo) is directing from a script by frequent Danny Boyle collaborator Alex Garland (28 Days Later, Sunshine). Filming starts in April in London and Norfolk, England.#9 WITNESS MICKEY ROURKE’S RETURN TO EROTICVILLEBack in Mickey Rourke’s 1980s glory days, two of his higher profile movies were the sexy Body Heat and 9 1/2 Weeks, and one of his new post-Wrestler movies appears to be returning him to similar territory. 11 Minutes, which also stars Alice Braga and Vincent Cassel, is an adaptation of a novel by Paulo Coehlo about a young stripper at a high-end club, who discovers the exciting world of S&amp;M. Rourke will play the club’s owner, which is a considerable step up from the cheap strip club-loving guy he played in The Wrestler. Hany Abu-Assad (2005’s Paradise Now) is directing, and filming is scheduled to start on June 1st in Brazil and Geneva, Switzerland.#10 HARD TO MAKE A JOKE HEADLINE OUT OF RAPE: A LOVE STORYMaria Bello, Samuel L. Jackson and Abigail Breslin (Little Miss Sunshine) have signed to star in an independent drama with a most provocative title: Rape: A Love Story. Rape is about a woman (Bello) who is brutally gang raped in front of her daughter (Breslin), is then stalked by her rapists, and seeks protection from a cop (Jackson). Harold Becker (Sea of Love, Domestic Disturbance) is directing from a script by TV writer John Mankiewicz (House), based upon a novella by Joyce Carol Oates. Filming is scheduled to start in June 2009.For more Weekly Ketchup columns by Greg Dean Schmitz, check out the WK archive, and you can contact GDS through his MySpace page or via a RT forum message and Greg also blogs about the TV show Lost, at TwoLosties.Blogspot.com.

Salinger in animated Netflix comedy BoJack Horseman, the Academy Award–winner returns to streaming on Friday with The Kominsky Method, latest show for the service from The Big Bang Theory creator Chuck Lorre. Arkin plays Norman, a man who loses his wife and is forced to lean on his best friend,&nbsp;acting teacher Sandy Kominsky (fellow Oscar-winner&nbsp;Michael Douglas), to process his grief.The duo are an odd&nbsp;couple who disagree on everything from funeral arrangements to casket shopping, along with the proper way to handle Norman’s daughter Phoebe (Lisa Edelstein), who shows up out of the blue.The former&nbsp;St. Elsewhere and Chicago Hope star seemed to have no no qualms admitting to Rotten Tomatoes that he watches one series only&nbsp;— and that he keeps it in the family. Below, Arkin confesses his TV habits and shares some intel on his next project,&nbsp;Tim Burton’s live-action Dumbo.WHAT IS APPOINTMENT VIEWING FOR YOU?(Photo by Netflix)Well, there’s about 40 assumptions right there. We don’t watch television in the daytime ever. At night, we check and see what’s on Netflix.WHAT IS IN YOUR STREAMING QUEUE?(Photo by Epix)The only series we watch consistently is Get Shorty, which is, I’m afraid, not on Netflix. [Editor’s note: The series airs on Epix, but Netflix has streaming rights to the series.] My son [Adam Arkin] produces and directs it, and we like the show a lot. So that’s the only one we feel any allegiance to. When I say Netflix, I mean we get screeners from them, and we watch films on Netflix.WHAT SHOWS ARE ON YOUR DVR? GET SHORTY?No, no, we don’t record anything.WHAT’S COMING SOON THAT YOU CAN’T WAIT FOR?(Photo by Epix)Get Shorty.Fred Topel for Rotten Tomatoes: Is there any sort of acting method you follow yourself?Alan Arkin: It diverged into several things. I started very classical method training and then it got coupled with a lot of training in improvisation, so it’s something in between method and improv.RT: Does Kominsky remind you of any teachers you had?Arkin: The show doesn’t specifically, but I had two great, great acting teachers who I revered. I learned an enormous amount in different directions from both of them. The first guy, who had himself studied with Stanislavski, was named Benjamin Zemach. I studied with him out here in Los Angeles. The second guy was my professor at Bennington. His name was Larry Arrick.(Photo by Netflix)RT: Had you and Michael encountered each other through business circles over the years?Arkin: No, we had never met until about a month before we signed on for the show. I felt if you’re going to be working with somebody for five years it’d be a good idea to sit next to them for half an hour and find out if you happen to like each other, so we had a lunch and it was fine and I signed on. It feels enormously comfortable, flexible, and playful.RT: Was the chemistry immediate from that lunch?Arkin: Yeah, it seemed to be. A little bit tentative for an hour or two, and then slowly loosened up, and it continued to loosen up as the series went on. I feel incredibly trusted by him, and I trust him tremendously.RT: Did you and Michael ever discuss his remake of The In-Laws?Arkin: [Laughs] We have mercifully kept off that subject.RT: Well, I’m glad that question made you laugh. Your character has an emotional breakdown at the dry cleaners in episode three. Was it difficult to perform? How did you get there?Arkin: Oh my God, it was a nightmare, that day. I knew what was coming, and I just had to rev myself and use every ounce of acting training I had to get myself into that place. That and also the speech I gave at the funeral was similar — wrenchingly painful days on what is supposed to be a comedic show. I’m not criticizing it. It goes in a lot of directions, which is one of my favorite things about it. I just hope it doesn’t go in those specific directions very often.RT: In Dumbo you’re playing a brand new character. Tell us about J. Griffin Remington.Arkin: I’m trying to buy the circus. I’m a magnate. I’m interested in this new act and kind of a plutocrat, trying to run everything.RT: Were you able to see any of the Dumbo footage?Arkin: Not a frame. Not a frame, not a photograph.RT: Was that a new experience with visual effects?Arkin: Looking at things that aren’t there? Yeah, pretty much.

One of his most celebrated roles was that of&nbsp;endearing Bad Ape in 2017’s&nbsp;War for the Planet of the Apes.Now he takes on&nbsp;the character of&nbsp;dot-com founder Michael Fenne for&nbsp;National Geographic’s newest series, Valley of the Boom, a documentary-scripted hybrid comedy series unlike anything that’s ever been on television before.After experimenting with documentary-scripted hybrid drama Mars, which finished airing its second season in December, the network is trying its hand at comedy with a series chronicling the 1990s tech bubble in Silicon Valley, as told through scripted drama as well as documentary interviews with some of the real-life founders.Zahn has definitely never seen anything like it — he rarely watches television, in fact, choosing instead to immerse himself in news and politics while at home with his family on his Kentucky farm.He does have a soft spot for documentaries, which he discussed with Rotten Tomatoes when we talked to him about what he’s watching on TV, why he should be credited for Game of Thrones’ success, and breaking the fourth wall in the innovative Valley of the Boom.What’s appointment viewing for you?(Photo by Comedy Central)I am the worst person that you would want to feature on a “What to Watch” list in the history of history. I have literally become my dad where my kids make fun of me about how much news I watch. That’s what I watch, but I can’t help it. It’s so f–king crazy right now. I feel like I’m going to miss out.I just envy my kids when they can just sit and turn everything off and watch. I’ll literally sit there and watch with my son — he watches South Park religiously, he’s 18 — and that’s kind of the only time I actually pause and laugh. We stand there for like a half hour eating Frosted Mini Wheats, laughing, and then I go back to being neurotic about the end of times.Well, what’s in your son’s streaming queue?[Calls to son] Henry, what are you watching? [To Rotten Tomatoes] Eh, he said, “Shut up.” You know what we’re watching right now? We have screeners. I have to watch screeners, so we’re in screenerland.What shows are on your DVR? Do you watch Game of Thrones or anything?(Photo by Netflix)Well, I’m not in to the fantasy stuff. I’m a documentary guy. I’ll watch, you know, [they’re] coming out with a new one. Remember the murderer? What’s it called? The big one, the guy in Wisconsin. Making a Murderer.&nbsp;I was working at the time and had to get up at 5:30 in the morning, and I remember watching that ‘til like 3:00 in the morning going, “F–k it. I’ll get two and a half hours sleep and I’ll go to work.’ I was obsessed. I get obsessed with stuff like that.[As for Game of Thrones], I was working with Pete Dinklage. I was doing a movie with him up in Spokane, Washington, and I knew Peter from theater in New York, and we were hanging out during that movie — like, inseparable. He was offered that while we were doing this movie. He was like, “I don’t know, should I do it? It’s in Ireland.” I’m like, “Yeah, man. You have to do it. What, are you kidding me? It’s going to be great.” So I want to take credit for it. [Laughs]What’s coming soon that you can’t wait for?(Photo by Warner Bros. Pictures)I haven’t seen that BBC World War I documentary [They Shall Not Grow Old] that Peter Jackson did.(Photo by National Geographic/Bettina Strauss)Jean Bentley for Rotten Tomatoes: As a news junkie who likes documentaries, what do you think of the documentary-scripted hybrid of Valley of the Boom?Zahn: Obviously, I’m totally into documentaries and I thought, Oh, this would be challenging and different. When you read it, it’s great because with this format you’re able to take a lot of fat out of a script and just get to the good stuff. That’s what’s really intriguing about it. I think if you did just a drama about the birth of the internet, I don’t know how fascinating that would be, or at least for how long, I don’t know. But six hours? I doubt it.It really frees us up. There were really no rules, and [creator] Matthew Carnahan was just brilliant with that. He really let us play. It turned in to one of my favorite jobs by far, aside from my putting on a fat suit and a wig. It was like doing a play. It was insane. I was on board at page 10 when it said he does an interpretive dance in the sanctuary of the church. I was like, “Wow, what? This is insane.”Your character is definitely an interesting guy. How did you channel him?I was so intrigued and so excited to be offered it, number one, but then the fear sets in. Then you go, “Wow, how am I going to do this?” It’s not like a play where you get four weeks of rehearsal. It sucked. You have to just do it. Matthew was so encouraging and so great. He just said, “Man, you’ve just got to dive in” — which is literally like doing a film. You do any character, it’s, like, the beauty of it: You jump off a cliff into the fog and hope that there’s water below. That’s what you do. Day one of filming has got to be as consistent, as good, as the last day.It’s frightening, especially with somebody so broad as this guy. So I was constantly trying to find ways of making him less broad, basically, and more accessible to people and vulnerable and all those things that makes characters great, nutty. This guy was so smart. He’s so intelligent, he’s so assertive, and his faith is everything. There were a lot of qualities I felt were admirable.Some of your costars’ real-life counterparts were interviewed for the documentary parts of the show, but not your character. Did you approach playing him differently because of that?It gave me a little more room, actually. I was happy about that. They tried to get him, but it didn’t work out. But in the end I was happy that was the case because then you’re not reminded of the real guy. It’s really odd that my character is somewhat kind of a fictional guy and yet he’s not just because of that. All I saw was one interview that he did with Chris Cuomo like in ’98. It was just a very strange short interview, like 15 minutes, but that’s really all I needed. I was really intrigued and blown away by this guy that I assumed was this kind of boisterous dude, larger than life, and then I saw this interview and he was this really kind of meek, soft-spoken, high-pitched guy. Very intelligent. I was like, “Wow. This is the guy?”(Photo by National Geographic/Bettina Strauss)Going back to the interpretive dance, you frequently break the fourth wall on this show. What was that like?That was really fun. It was so theatrical, you know? If you just in two sentences explain this to somebody without explaining how we did it, it sounds boring. I mean, a six-hour show about the birth of the Internet is not really that exciting unless you’re, like, an IT guy. When we addressed the camera, it was just quick and it wasn’t like we were just breaking the rules to break the rules, so it was appropriate to the story.And I don’t know, I haven’t seen anything like this. I guess American Animals is a similar kind of storytelling, which I love, and yet it’s totally different from that in a way. That was more of a film to me than it was a documentary. This is truly kind of split in two, a documentary and a film.I’m trying to think of other things — like Touching the Void. Have you ever seen Touching the Void? About the climbers. Damn, that’s a good movie. You’ve got to watch that. And that’s a drama. That’s explaining a mountain-climbing expedition that goes awry and it’s phenomenal, but it’s done in the same kind of way where they are basically reenactments of what they’re saying — they’re done with high-quality and good people. It’s not like the History Channel&nbsp;— no offense to the History Channel, but some of those Civil War documentaries [where] you have overweight guys from Ohio reenacting Pickett’s Charge, and it just doesn’t work.Speaking of documentaries and climbing, have you seen Free Solo?Dude. It was phenomenal. I’m a big Alex Honnold fan. I’ve been a fan of his for a long time, and I’d go on his website and find out where he was climbing and stuff. I actually went to a screening of Free Solo in New York and met him and I’m so blown away by that guy. That documentary is insane.I’m pushing that to everybody, by the way. I’m like, “You have to see this. It’s insane.” And Won’t You Be My Neighbor. What a great documentary.Valley of the Boom airs Sundays at 9 p.m. on Nat Geo.","section":"What to Watch","tags":"TV, BAFTA, Star, rotten, camera, singing, Moore, Podcast, hist, Films, TV, News, curtis, zero, Guide","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/10161639/steve-zahn-valley-of-the-boom-600x314.jpg","slug":"what-to-watch-with-steve-zahn"},{"id":"47509245192082","title":"Highlander 2: The Quickening Is an Incomprehensible Mess That Deserves Its Bad Reputation","content":"The Zerosvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Highlander 2: The Quickening Is an Incomprehensible Mess That Deserves Its Bad ReputationIn a cult franchise of dubious quality, this bizarrely plotted detour is the worst entry.by Nathan Rabin | October 23, 2018 |  CommentsBehind the Zero(Photo by Republic Pictures courtesy Everett Collection)The unfathomably awful 1991 flop Highlander 2: The Quickening&nbsp;holds a place high in the pantheon of embarrassingly misguided, wildly opportunistic sequels. It&nbsp;is reviled with an uncommon fury by critics and audiences alike, but&nbsp;director Russell Mulcahy and the cast have spoken out extensively against it as well.Roger Ebert eloquently captured the essence of the horror and mortification with which the film was received when he wrote in his half-star review, “Highlander II: The Quickening is the most hilariously incomprehensible movie I’ve seen in many a long day — a movie almost awesome in its badness. Wherever science fiction fans gather, in decades and generations to come, this film will be remembered in hushed tones as one of the immortal low points of the genre.”Ebert’s words proved prophetic. The movie has become a cult and camp classic of the “so bad it’s good” and “can you believe this?” variety, and while plenty of movies get middling to negative reviews, few turkeys have earned the simultaneously impressive and damning “zero” rating on Rotten Tomatoes quite as flamboyantly or deservedly as Highlander 2: The Quickening did.According to legend, Mulcahy walked out in disgust just 15 minutes into the movie’s premiere. He reportedly wanted to take his name off the film and have it replaced with the industry-mandated pseudonym “Alan Smithee” but was contractually forbidden to do so. Stars Michael Ironside, Christopher Lambert, and Sean Connery also added to the worldwide chorus of jeers that greeted the movie by publicly criticizing it and what appeared to be a surreal and deeply unpleasant experience filming it in a corruption-plagued Argentina.(Photo by Republic Pictures Courtesy Everett Collection.)Years later, Mulcahy released his own edit of the film on home video as “The Renegade Version.” The Renegade Version falls somewhere between a corrective for the original and a public apology for being associated with a motion picture so staggeringly incomprehensible.&nbsp;It has to make more sense than the theatrical cut, if only because it would seem impossible for it to make any less sense.Though also a flop upon its theatrical release, the original 1986&nbsp;Highlander attracted a sizable, loyal cult enamored with its fantastical mythology regarding Connor McLeod (Lambert) — a 16th century Scottish Highlander who discovers that he belongs to a race of immortals who can only be killed by decapitation — and his adventures throughout the centuries, ending with an epic, high-stakes battle in mid-1980s New York against villain Kurgan (Clancy Brown).The screenwriters of Highlander 2&nbsp;puzzlingly decided to discard much of the mythology that made&nbsp;the first film&nbsp;such a cult favorite by making the Immortals aliens from the planet Zeist who battle on a dystopian Earth of 2024, perpetually shrouded in darkness thanks to a series of environmental disasters. The narrative shift&nbsp;was tantamount to making a&nbsp;Star Wars sequel in which all the characters are 1950s California teens,&nbsp;except for Luke Skywalker, who is a World War I pilot for some reason, and then expecting audiences who adored George Lucas’ original to simply roll with the changes.Highlander 2: The Quickening is so perversely, masochistically intent on ruining everything fans&nbsp;loved about the first movie that it’s surprising that they didn’t alter the beloved catchphrase from “There can be only one” to “There can be anywhere from seven to the low thousands, depending on the month and the location,” or that they didn’t re-cast Sean Connery’s pivotal role as fan favorite Ramirez with Frank Stallone.The Zero(Photo by Republic Pictures Courtesy Everett Collection.)Highlander 2: The Quickening wastes no time establishing that it will be a much different, much more convoluted, and infinitely worse movie than its predecessor with an opening crawl (what is it about terrible movies and opening crawls?) asserting that, unlike&nbsp;Highlander, this&nbsp;sequel takes place in a grim, dystopian 2024.Ah, but The Quickening doesn’t just unexpectedly take place in the future. It also takes place in outer space, as we learn when a decrepit, doddering old Connor flashes back to his time on his home planet of Zeist, where his friend and mentor Ramirez (Connery reportedly made $3.5 million for just nine days of work) taps him for a dangerous mission against evil space tyrant General Katana (Ironside).To punish Connor and Ramirez for the attempted insurrection, they’re sent to Earth, where Connor, having helped save Earth from further destruction by building an artificial ozone layer that protects the planet at the cost of perpetual darkness, drunkenly waits to die a lonely natural death.&nbsp;The film’s&nbsp;heavy-handed environmental message has aged about as well Captain Planet’s blue mullet.Once Highlander 2&nbsp;makes a bad decision, though, it sticks with it. Lambert isn’t imprisoned in comically unconvincing “old man” make up for just a scene or two; he spends&nbsp;upwards of a half hour Mr. Magoo-ing it up as a ridiculous caricature of an old codger.&nbsp;He&nbsp;isn’t like the title character in Logan, a proud warrior at the bleary end of a hard and complicated life. He’s more like Hans Moleman from The Simpsons, a ridiculous cartoon with a feeble croak of a voice that suggests his lungs and vocal chords consist primarily of lint and dust.(Photo by Interstar courtesy Everett Collection)General Katana nevertheless dispatches a pair of henchmen, Corda and Reno — who look like steam-punk porcupine men whose mutant DNA was crossed with that of character actor Bud Cort — to Earth to kill Connor, but the comically unthreatening old man gets his groove back. When he destroys the two goons, he not only brings back his radiant youth and luscious mane of Fabio-worthy hair via the titular Quickening; he brings Ramirez back from the dead as well.Once Ramirez returns, the film becomes a wacky fish-out-of-water comedy, with Sean Connery mugging up a storm as a Scottish, space alien Crocodile Dundee amazed at the wonders of the 21st century. Michael Ironside’s space tyrant&nbsp;becomes the world’s most murderous tourist, most notably in a notorious set piece in which he thrill-kills future New Yorkers by hijacking a subway train and taking it on a high-speed joyride through a wall. Connor, meanwhile, romances sexy terrorist Louise Marcus (Virginia Madsen), who is fighting a righteous crusade against The Shield, a sinister corporation led by David Blake (John C. McGinley) that has come to hold power over the artificial electromagnetic field Connor helped create to protect the earth from the sun.Acting as an audience surrogate, Louise tries to make sense of the incomprehensible gobbledygook that constitutes the film’s plot and impenetrable, needlessly complicated mythology. At one point, she says to Connor, “Okay, now let me just see if I can get this straight. You’re mortal there, but you’re immortal here until you kill all the guys from there who’ve come here, and then you’re mortal here, unless you go back there, or some guys from there come here, in which case you become immortal here… again.”(Photo by Interstar courtesy Everett Collection)Connor chuckles and replies that she’s right, but the film&nbsp;is somehow even less coherent and more confusing than Madsen’s words suggest. Even the movie’s own characters don’t seem to know what’s going on from scene to scene or moment to moment.Highlander 2: The Quickening’s jarring shifts in tone, genre, and style are epitomized by its choice to make its two main villains a demented general from outer space who looks and acts like a psychotic Renaissance Faire Ozzy Osborne and the aforementioned David Blake, an oily executive in an expensive suit who’s essentially a junior league Gordon Gekko with questionable judgment.This partnership of convenience ends, inevitably, when one partner grabs the other by their genitalia, crushes them&nbsp;in&nbsp;his hand, and hurls him by&nbsp;his crotch out of a window to a violent death. It’s almost as if you can’t trust warlords from outer space, and should be wary of forming alliances with them, no matter how evil or ambitious you might be yourself.It’s easy to see why Ebert predicted perverse cult glory for Highlander 2: The Quickening&nbsp;even as he eviscerated it in his review. Like the similarly reviled Star Wars Holiday Special, The Quickening takes a beloved franchise in such a bizarre, off-brand direction that it’s hard to believe it exists, let alone that it’s an official — albeit deeply regretted — part of a venerable pop-culture institution’s checkered legacy.Final Verdict(Photo by Interstar courtesy Everett Collection)What do you do next when you make a mistake as egregious as Highlander 2: The Quickening? If you’re the folks behind the Highlander franchise, you pretend the movie never happened, erase it from the mythology, and move on. It’s a testament to how much people loved the characters and&nbsp;story of the original film that Highlander became a big multi-media franchise despite Highlander 2.The story of the Immortals would continue not just in theatrically released sequels like 1993’s Highlander III: The Sorcerer and 2000’s Highlander: Endgame, but also in novels, comic books, multiple television adaptations, card games, and a 2007 Japanese anime film. A remake, perhaps unsurprisingly, has been in development hell for much of this decade, attracting, at various points, talent like Ryan Reynolds and Dave Bautista and filmmakers like Justin Lin, John Wick’s Chad Stahelski, and 28 Weeks Later’s Juan Carlos Fresnadillo.Mulcahy, meanwhile, did his part to offer the world a variant of this story that made at least a tiny bit of sense with the film’s Renegade Version, which did away with the exceedingly fan-unfriendly conceit that the Immortals were aliens.If a film series can survive a boondoggle on the order of Highlander 2: The Quickening to produce more movies, TV shows, a possible big-budget reboot, and other ancillary projects, then perhaps it truly is immortal and cannot be destroyed.Nathan Rabin is the author of six books and the proprietor of&nbsp;Nathan Rabin’s Happy Place.Follow Nathan on Twitter: @NathanRabin","section":"The Zeros","tags":"History, travel, Rey, toronto, Superheroe, show, video, Cartoon, halloween, curtis, bad","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/23163015/Highlander2-Zeros-Rep.jpg","slug":"highlander-2-the-quickening-is-an-incomprehensible-mess-that-deserves-its-bad-reputation"},{"id":"47508649700896","title":"24 Frames: Super Soldiers","content":"Critics Consensusvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Incredibles 2 Is Certified FreshPlus, Tag is mildly entertaining and Superfly is more style than substance.by Jeff Giles | June 14, 2018 |  CommentsThis weekend at the movies,&nbsp;we have a belated sequel to a Pixar classic (Incredibles 2, featuring the voices of&nbsp;Holly Hunter&nbsp;and&nbsp;Craig T. Nelson), some of Hollywood’s funniest fellows trying to touch one another without permission (Tag, starring&nbsp;Ed Helms,&nbsp;Jeremy Renner, and Jon Hamm), and a remade blast from the blaxploitation past (Superfly, starring Trevor Jackson&nbsp;and Jason Mitchell).&nbsp;What are the critics saying?Incredibles 2 (2018)  93%If you’re going to try and follow up an acclaimed blockbuster, you might as well take your time getting the sequel right — and in animation, where time can stand still forever, you have the added benefit of not needing to rush your cast back in front of the camera. Still, after waiting nearly 15 years for a second installment of The Incredibles, fans can be forgiven a certain amount of impatience; while the creative teams at formerly franchise-averse Pixar dreamed up new stories for the characters in Toy Story, Cars, Finding Nemo, and Monsters Inc., the ability to return to theaters continued to elude the superpowered Parr family. All that waiting has finally paid off with Incredibles 2, which reunites the original voice cast for a new adventure serving up more of the domestic turmoil, superhero satire, and brilliantly animated action that made the first one such a hit. It’d be tough to improve on the original Incredibles, and critics say that while this sequel doesn’t quite pull off that feat, it comes impressively close, adding yet another acclaimed entry to Pixar’s already estimable filmography. If you were a kid when The Incredibles&nbsp;came out, you might have kids of your own now — and like all the best stuff the studio has put out, the whole family can look forward to enjoying Incredibles 2.Tag (2018)  56%On one hand, it’s easy to believe Hollywood has long since exhausted most of the reasonable possibilities for comedy that exist in movies about grown men acting like boys. On the other, when you’ve got the Wall Street Journal writing about a real-life group of guys who take a month off every year to continue the game of tag they’ve been playing since they were kids, well, it’s awfully hard to resist the temptation to turn that into a film. Enter the descriptively titled Tag, starring Hannibal Buress, Jon Hamm, Ed Helms, Jake Johnson, and Jeremy Renner as the fellows in question — a talented bunch whose commitment to the story was reflected in the set injury Renner sustained, breaking both of his arms and necessitating some last-minute CGI limb replacements in post-production. It would be wonderful to report that Renner’s suffering came in service of one of the year’s best-reviewed action comedies; alas, the truth is that critics are kinda meh on Tag, which reviews describe as funny and engaging in fits and starts, but ultimately not consistent or committed enough to fully deliver on its premise. Still, this is one talented cast, and even the critical pans say the movie isn’t without its moments, so if you’re in the mood for some arrested development laughs, you may want to check your local listings.Superfly (2018)  51%Released in 1972, the original Superfly&nbsp;helped lead the blaxploitation wave with a thoughtful Harlem-set drama about a drug dealer looking for one last big score; the movie’s trappings may look somewhat dated today, but thanks to Ron O’Neal‘s performance as main character Youngblood Priest — not to mention a killer Curtis Mayfield soundtrack — it still feels fresh. It’s easy to understand why music video veteran Director X wanted to take a shot at updating the story, and its themes are just as relevant as they were more than 45 years ago; unfortunately, critics say those themes have mostly been lost in this new version, which is far more focused on style than substance. Starring Trevor Jackson as Priest, the 2018 edition moves the action to Atlanta, but the basic contours of the story remain the same — which is part of why a number of reviews have outlined pundits’ disappointment with the lost social subtext. This Superfly&nbsp;will make its fortune by and by, thanks to Director X’s way with an artfully arranged scene or set piece, but as is so often the case with remakes, the original still reigns supreme.What’s New on TVThe Bold Type: Season 2 (2018)  100%The Bold Type presents an aspirational yet refreshingly realistic portrait of young women’s careers, friendships and love lives in a big city.Strange Angel: Season 1 (2018)  71%A beautiful slow burn, Strange Angel shoots for the stars, but gets a little lost in its own orbit.Also&nbsp;Opening This Week In Limited Release Eating Animals (2018) , a documentary about the commercial factory farming industry and its various impacts, is at 100%.

Nelson), some of Hollywood’s funniest fellows trying to touch one another without permission (Tag, starring&nbsp;Ed Helms,&nbsp;Jeremy Renner, and Jon Hamm), and a remade blast from the blaxploitation past (Superfly, starring Trevor Jackson&nbsp;and Jason Mitchell).&nbsp;What are the critics saying?Incredibles 2 (2018)  93%If you’re going to try and follow up an acclaimed blockbuster, you might as well take your time getting the sequel right — and in animation, where time can stand still forever, you have the added benefit of not needing to rush your cast back in front of the camera. Still, after waiting nearly 15 years for a second installment of The Incredibles, fans can be forgiven a certain amount of impatience; while the creative teams at formerly franchise-averse Pixar dreamed up new stories for the characters in Toy Story, Cars, Finding Nemo, and Monsters Inc., the ability to return to theaters continued to elude the superpowered Parr family. All that waiting has finally paid off with Incredibles 2, which reunites the original voice cast for a new adventure serving up more of the domestic turmoil, superhero satire, and brilliantly animated action that made the first one such a hit. It’d be tough to improve on the original Incredibles, and critics say that while this sequel doesn’t quite pull off that feat, it comes impressively close, adding yet another acclaimed entry to Pixar’s already estimable filmography. If you were a kid when The Incredibles&nbsp;came out, you might have kids of your own now — and like all the best stuff the studio has put out, the whole family can look forward to enjoying Incredibles 2.Tag (2018)  56%On one hand, it’s easy to believe Hollywood has long since exhausted most of the reasonable possibilities for comedy that exist in movies about grown men acting like boys. On the other, when you’ve got the Wall Street Journal writing about a real-life group of guys who take a month off every year to continue the game of tag they’ve been playing since they were kids, well, it’s awfully hard to resist the temptation to turn that into a film. Enter the descriptively titled Tag, starring Hannibal Buress, Jon Hamm, Ed Helms, Jake Johnson, and Jeremy Renner as the fellows in question — a talented bunch whose commitment to the story was reflected in the set injury Renner sustained, breaking both of his arms and necessitating some last-minute CGI limb replacements in post-production. It would be wonderful to report that Renner’s suffering came in service of one of the year’s best-reviewed action comedies; alas, the truth is that critics are kinda meh on Tag, which reviews describe as funny and engaging in fits and starts, but ultimately not consistent or committed enough to fully deliver on its premise. Still, this is one talented cast, and even the critical pans say the movie isn’t without its moments, so if you’re in the mood for some arrested development laughs, you may want to check your local listings.Superfly (2018)  51%Released in 1972, the original Superfly&nbsp;helped lead the blaxploitation wave with a thoughtful Harlem-set drama about a drug dealer looking for one last big score; the movie’s trappings may look somewhat dated today, but thanks to Ron O’Neal‘s performance as main character Youngblood Priest — not to mention a killer Curtis Mayfield soundtrack — it still feels fresh. It’s easy to understand why music video veteran Director X wanted to take a shot at updating the story, and its themes are just as relevant as they were more than 45 years ago; unfortunately, critics say those themes have mostly been lost in this new version, which is far more focused on style than substance. Starring Trevor Jackson as Priest, the 2018 edition moves the action to Atlanta, but the basic contours of the story remain the same — which is part of why a number of reviews have outlined pundits’ disappointment with the lost social subtext. This Superfly&nbsp;will make its fortune by and by, thanks to Director X’s way with an artfully arranged scene or set piece, but as is so often the case with remakes, the original still reigns supreme.What’s New on TVThe Bold Type: Season 2 (2018)  100%The Bold Type presents an aspirational yet refreshingly realistic portrait of young women’s careers, friendships and love lives in a big city.Strange Angel: Season 1 (2018)  71%A beautiful slow burn, Strange Angel shoots for the stars, but gets a little lost in its own orbit.Also&nbsp;Opening This Week In Limited Release Eating Animals (2018) , a documentary about the commercial factory farming industry and its various impacts, is at 100%.

It’s hard to say. For some, a thrilling fight sequence or a series of Michael Bay-style explosions brings joy; for others, a jump scare does it. For others still, a satisfying mystery; for others romance is key. When putting together the below epic list of “feel-good” movies – a list we think will do movie lovers some good right now – we didn’t overthink it. As a staff, we at Rotten Tomatoes asked ourselves a basic question: What are the movies that, without fail, leave us feeling better than we did before we pushed play.\nA sort of criteria emerged from our responses. Below you’ll find movies that lean heavily into nostalgia – titles that evoke that comfy feeling of going to the&nbsp;cinema as a youngster to see films you’ll later watch dozens of times on cable (Hook,&nbsp;The Sandlot,&nbsp;Mrs. Doubtfire). You’ll also notice a preponderance of hilarious, and often goofy, comedies (Step Brothers,&nbsp;Friday,&nbsp;Spy), and a bit of romance, too (Crazy Rich Asians,&nbsp;When Harry Met Sally). You’ll find&nbsp;big names whose decades spent atop marquees&nbsp;have been a kind of comfort over the years to moviegoers (Toms Hanks and Cruise, Whoopi Goldberg, Eddie Murphy). And you’ll find the work of newer filmmaking voices that make us thrilled for the future of the medium (Taika Waititi, Olivia Wilde, and the team behind&nbsp;Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse).\nThe 150&nbsp;titles&nbsp;featured in our guide to Great Feel-Good Movies are filled with laughs and heart, and characters&nbsp;you root for and relate to. In times&nbsp;like these, we think they’ll make good company.\nWhat’s your favorite feel-good movie?

Nelson), some of Hollywood’s funniest fellows trying to touch one another without permission (Tag, starring&nbsp;Ed Helms,&nbsp;Jeremy Renner, and Jon Hamm), and a remade blast from the blaxploitation past (Superfly, starring Trevor Jackson&nbsp;and Jason Mitchell).&nbsp;What are the critics saying?Incredibles 2 (2018)  93%If you’re going to try and follow up an acclaimed blockbuster, you might as well take your time getting the sequel right — and in animation, where time can stand still forever, you have the added benefit of not needing to rush your cast back in front of the camera. Still, after waiting nearly 15 years for a second installment of The Incredibles, fans can be forgiven a certain amount of impatience; while the creative teams at formerly franchise-averse Pixar dreamed up new stories for the characters in Toy Story, Cars, Finding Nemo, and Monsters Inc., the ability to return to theaters continued to elude the superpowered Parr family. All that waiting has finally paid off with Incredibles 2, which reunites the original voice cast for a new adventure serving up more of the domestic turmoil, superhero satire, and brilliantly animated action that made the first one such a hit. It’d be tough to improve on the original Incredibles, and critics say that while this sequel doesn’t quite pull off that feat, it comes impressively close, adding yet another acclaimed entry to Pixar’s already estimable filmography. If you were a kid when The Incredibles&nbsp;came out, you might have kids of your own now — and like all the best stuff the studio has put out, the whole family can look forward to enjoying Incredibles 2.Tag (2018)  56%On one hand, it’s easy to believe Hollywood has long since exhausted most of the reasonable possibilities for comedy that exist in movies about grown men acting like boys. On the other, when you’ve got the Wall Street Journal writing about a real-life group of guys who take a month off every year to continue the game of tag they’ve been playing since they were kids, well, it’s awfully hard to resist the temptation to turn that into a film. Enter the descriptively titled Tag, starring Hannibal Buress, Jon Hamm, Ed Helms, Jake Johnson, and Jeremy Renner as the fellows in question — a talented bunch whose commitment to the story was reflected in the set injury Renner sustained, breaking both of his arms and necessitating some last-minute CGI limb replacements in post-production. It would be wonderful to report that Renner’s suffering came in service of one of the year’s best-reviewed action comedies; alas, the truth is that critics are kinda meh on Tag, which reviews describe as funny and engaging in fits and starts, but ultimately not consistent or committed enough to fully deliver on its premise. Still, this is one talented cast, and even the critical pans say the movie isn’t without its moments, so if you’re in the mood for some arrested development laughs, you may want to check your local listings.Superfly (2018)  51%Released in 1972, the original Superfly&nbsp;helped lead the blaxploitation wave with a thoughtful Harlem-set drama about a drug dealer looking for one last big score; the movie’s trappings may look somewhat dated today, but thanks to Ron O’Neal‘s performance as main character Youngblood Priest — not to mention a killer Curtis Mayfield soundtrack — it still feels fresh. It’s easy to understand why music video veteran Director X wanted to take a shot at updating the story, and its themes are just as relevant as they were more than 45 years ago; unfortunately, critics say those themes have mostly been lost in this new version, which is far more focused on style than substance. Starring Trevor Jackson as Priest, the 2018 edition moves the action to Atlanta, but the basic contours of the story remain the same — which is part of why a number of reviews have outlined pundits’ disappointment with the lost social subtext. This Superfly&nbsp;will make its fortune by and by, thanks to Director X’s way with an artfully arranged scene or set piece, but as is so often the case with remakes, the original still reigns supreme.What’s New on TVThe Bold Type: Season 2 (2018)  100%The Bold Type presents an aspirational yet refreshingly realistic portrait of young women’s careers, friendships and love lives in a big city.Strange Angel: Season 1 (2018)  71%A beautiful slow burn, Strange Angel shoots for the stars, but gets a little lost in its own orbit.Also&nbsp;Opening This Week In Limited Release Eating Animals (2018) , a documentary about the commercial factory farming industry and its various impacts, is at 100%.

It’s easy to understand why music video veteran Director X wanted to take a shot at updating the story, and its themes are just as relevant as they were more than 45 years ago; unfortunately, critics say those themes have mostly been lost in this new version, which is far more focused on style than substance. Starring Trevor Jackson as Priest, the 2018 edition moves the action to Atlanta, but the basic contours of the story remain the same — which is part of why a number of reviews have outlined pundits’ disappointment with the lost social subtext.

Included in the mix are news stories about Arnold Schwarzengger’s return to Conan the Barbarian, James Bond movies #24 and #25, and three different Marvel superhero movies (The Wolverine, X-Men: Days of Future Past, and Captain America: The Winter Soldier).  James Cameron, Johnny Depp, Jeremy Renner, and Adam Sandler get name checked in this article too.\n\n\n\nThis Week’s Top Story\n\t\nARNOLD SCHWARZEGGER TO HEAR THE LAMENTATIONS OF THE GRANDMAS IN THE LEGEND OF CONAN\n\nHollywood sometimes operates in years and decades the way other people think in weeks and months.  Even as late as 2012, some of the movies that are finally getting made first started with trade announcements as far back as the 1990s.  However, by the time these movies actually get made, they’re not exactly the films that people were led to expect back in the day.  One such example would be a project formerly known as King Conan: Crown of Iron, which was written by Conan the Barbarian director and writer John Milius, and was always described as a direct sequel that would cover Robert E. Howard’s creation’s later years as the ruler of Aquilonia.   That same basic concept was announced this week by Universal Pictures as a new film (except for the John Milius part) as The Legend of Conan, with 65 year old Arnold Schwarzenegger already attached to return to the role that made him a star back in 1982.  Much of the online press about The Legend of Conan is describing it as a “reboot,” though that word actually never appears in any of the quotes directly from Universal.  Instead, The Legend of Conan can be solidly described as a sequel to the original 1982 Conan the Barbarian, ignoring the first sequel Conan the Destroyer, and the 2011 Conan the Barbarian (which actually was a reboot) starring Jason Momoa.  Universal Pictures wants to get The Legend of Conan made much quicker than Milius’ previous attempt, and is already aiming for a release sometime in the summer of 2014.  To that end, the studio has recruited producer and writer Chris Morgan, whose previous work for Universal Pictures has included Wanted, the last three Fast and the Furious movies, and next year’s Fast and Furious 6 and 47 Ronin.   Right now, Morgan is only specifically attached as producer, with his possible writing duties on The Legend of Conan depending upon whether he’s done writing the seventh Fast and the Furious movie in time for Universal to meet that Summer 2014 release target.  Universal also needs to find a director for The Legend of Conan.\n\n\n\nFresh Developments This Week\n\t\n#1 THE JAMES BOND JUGGERNAUT PROCEEDS WITH PLANS FOR FILMS 24 AND 25\n\nThere was a longer than usual four-year gap between James Bond films #22 (Quantum of Solace in 2008) and #23 (Skyfall, opening next month) due to MGM’s financial problems.  However, the franchise is now back to committing to a 2 year rotation, with word this week that screenwriter John Logan has been hired to work on the 24th and 25th official entries in the James Bond film series.  Logan cowrote Skyfall, and his previous credits include working with Martin Scorsese on Hugo and The Aviator, with Johnny Depp on Rango and Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street, and with Russell Crowe on Gladiator and Darren Aronofsky’s upcoming Noah.  Logan is attached to both #24 and #25 because the idea that he pitched to Barbara Broccoli involves a two film story arc (even more so than the arc that spanned Casino Royale and Quantum of Solace).  The plan is for #24 to be filmed at Pinewood Studios in England in 2013, aiming for a release date in the fall of 2014 (most likely November).   As for what might come after James Bond #25 (which Daniel Craig is signed to star in already), the Internet was also all aflutter this week about the promise of the post-Daniel-Craig era.  What we specifically learned is that James Bond producer Barbara Broccoli has met in the recent past with British actor Idris Elba (Prometheus, Thor, The Wire) about the possibility of him someday taking over the franchise.   There are lots of factors here, such as whether Idris Elba would actually want to do it, and also his age, as he would likely be pushing 50 by the time Daniel Craig retires as James Bond.   Craig was the first blonde James Bond; is the world now ready for the first Bond who was on an HBO series?  Who costarred in a Marvel superhero movie?  Who has a beard?  I know there’s another “first” I’m forgetting…\n\n\n\t\n#2 JAMES CAMERON TO FOLLOW THE AVATAR SEQUEL WITH A VISIT TO THE INFORMATIONIST\n\nWith James Cameron directing two Avatar sequels back-to-back in a plan that is likely to keep him busy for much of the rest of this decade, there is high online curiosity concerning what the director of Aliens and Titanic will do next.  If this week’s James Cameron news comes to pass, the immediate answer might not be what you’re expecting (especially if you’re expecting the long-in-development adaptation of Battle Angel Alita).  Instead, Cameron is now attached to produce and direct an adaptation of the 2011 Taylor Stevens novel The Informationist.  Unlike most of Cameron’s previous films, The Informationist is a story devoid of any elements requiring flashy special effects or CGI work.  Instead, The Informationist is the story of a woman who grew up in Africa who is “hired by a Texas oil billionaire to find his daughter who vanished in Africa four years ago” where she finds herself “betrayed, cut off from civilization, and left for dead.”  Of course, a lot can change in the next five years (we’re probably talking about at least that long until Avatar 3 is completely finished), and by 2017, James Cameron may direct Battle Angel Alita next instead, or a completely different movie we’ve not even heard of yet.\n\n\n\t\n#3 IMAGINE AL PACINO’S KID IS JEREMY RENNER; IT’S EASY IF YOU TRY (WAIT… IS IT?)\n\nImagine is the name of an independent drama about an aging 1970s rock and roll musician whose discovery of a long lost letter from John Lennon leads him to connecting with his adult son he’s never actually known.  Imagine is also the title of a movie that now officially has some of the biggest names in Hollywood attached to star in it.  Al Pacino and Jeremy Renner will be playing the father and son, respectively (and obviously), and Julianne Moore will play the owner of a New Jersey hotel where the rock star moves to while trying to get to know his son.  Imagine will also mark the directorial debut of screenwriter Dan Fogelman (Crazy Stupid Love, Tangled; cowriter of Cars, Bolt).\n\n\n\t\n#4 JOHNNY DEPP MEDITATES ON TRANSCENDENCE\n\nIt’s far too rare that we hear about a Johnny Depp movie that doesn’t involve Tim Burton or isn’t an expensive Walt Disney event film (or both, as in the case of Alice in Wonderland).  This week’s news is an entirely new concept that isn’t based upon anything pre-existing, but Depp’s price tag is still quite high (at least $20 million or 15% of the box office gross, whichever is higher).  The new movie in question is called Transcendence, and it’s the story of a man who finds himself inside an evil computer.  Curiously, the references for Transcendence are 2001: A Space Odyssey and Inception, and not, say, either of the two TRON movies.  Transcendence will be the directorial debut of cinematographer Wally Pfister, whose films have included pretty much everything Christopher Nolan has done, dating all the way back to Memento, as well as The Italian Job and Moneyball.  Wally Pfister is currently casting other roles, with possibilities (none of which are locked down yet) including Noomi Rapace (Prometheus) as the female lead, Christoph Waltz in a supporting role, and either James McAvoy or Tobey Maguire as the other male lead (possibly the inventor of the evil computer).   Transcendence was written by newcomer screenwriter Jack Paglen, and filming is expected to start in early 2013. Warner Bros is handling distribution for production company Alcon Entertainment, with which they have a first look deal.   The Transcendence announcement came in the same week that began with Wally Pfister making online news for criticizing the camera work on Joss Whedon’s The Avengers as “appalling.”   You can read what Whedon thought of that remark at this link here.\n\n\n\t\n#5 DAVID OYELOWO TO STAR IN THE SUGAR RAY ROBINSON BIOPIC SWEET THUNDER\n\nDavid Oyelowo is an English actor who has attracted a lot of positive critical attention for roles in movies like Rise of the Planet of the Apes, The Last King of Scotland, and The Help (he’s also in Lincoln and Jack Reacher), but there hasn’t yet been that one big role that makes Oyelowo a household name.  The movie that does exactly that could be Sweet Thunder, an independently produced biopic about the life of boxer Sugar Ray Robinson, based on a biography of the same title by Wil Haygood (who also adapted his own screenplay). The idea for all of this started on the set of The Butler (the movie about the White House butler who served under eight different U.S. presidents), in which Oyelowo also costars, and was also based upon an article by Wil Haygood.   As for Sugar Ray Robinson, he is of course still considered one of the greatest boxers ever, predating Muhammed Ali as one of the first African American pugilists to achieve international fame and success.  Robinson’s career also included several fights against Jake LaMotta (as portrayed in Raging Bull).\n\n\n\t\n#6 PATRICK WILSON AND LIV TYLER LAUNCH OFF FOR SPACE STATION 76\n\nAlmost every movie covered each week in the Ketchup is at least a few months, if not several years, from even starting filming.  What’s far rarer is that a movie manages to escape press coverage all the way to and through filming, and is only covered online after filming has already wrapped.  Such subterfuge is typically only possible for an independent movie like Space Station 76, the science fiction dramedy that marks the directorial debut of prolific character actor Jack Plotnick.  Patrick Wilson (Watchmen), Liv Tyler (The Lord of the Rings), Matt Bomer, Marisa Coughlan, and Jerry O’Connell star in this story of a space station set in a 1970s version of the future.  The title makes this writer think of the Martin Landau TV series Space 1999, which was also set in a space station, so that show might be the reference point Plotnick is aiming for.  Space Station 76 is being described as “a metaphor for [Plotnick’s] life growing up in 1970s suburbia,” which might also give you a notion of what kind of “science fiction comedy/drama” the film will be.  Or… people can just speculate about what Liv Tyler looks like in a 1970s-style spacesuit.  Or both.  Anyway, considering the timing of the film’s announcement, one has to wonder if Space Station 76 might have been produced in time to make its premiere at the Sundance Film Festival in January.\n\n\n\t\n#7 THIS WEEK IN MARVEL MOVIE NEWS:  THE WOLVERINE, X-MEN: DAYS OF FUTURE PAST, CAPTAIN AMERICA: THE WINTER SOLDIER\n\nLet’s start with The Wolverine, the fifth (credited, non cameo) movie in which Hugh Jackman will play X-Men member Logan.  What every fan thought he knew about The Wolverine, dating back to when it was going to be directed by Darren Aronofsky, was that it was another prequel, covering the time when Logan was in Japan, and fell in love, as originally depicted in the very first Wolverine comic book mini-series written by Chris Claremont with art by Frank Miller.  Although some of the images we’ve seen thus far do seem to suggest scenes that will be flashbacks, this week, we learned that the bulk of the movie will not be a prequel at all.  Instead, The Wolverine will be predominantly set at some point after all the previous movies, including X-Men: The Last Stand, and the deaths of three of the major characters (as for that being a spoiler, let’s be honest here: if you haven’t seen a 2006 X-Men movie yet six years later, you probably were never going to).   20th Century Fox has scheduled The Wolverine for July 26, 2013.   Something else we thought we knew was that X-Men: First Class director Matthew Vaughn would be returning for the sequel/prequel (it’s both, because of time travel) X-Men: Days of Future Past.  Well, that’s no longer true, and so Fox is in a hurry to find a replacement, who might just end up being Bryan Singer, the director of the first two X-Men movies, and the guy who arguably got this whole resurgence of super hero movies started again back in 2000.  Newly appointed 20th Century Fox X-Men/Fantastic Four overseer Mark Millar also let slip this week that the movie will feature “robots,” by which he probably means the Sentinels.  A Days of Future Past adaptation without the Sentinels would have been a little strange, so that’s good to know; let’s just hope they’re still huge and purple.   Finally, going back to actual Marvel Studios productions, casting continued this week for Captain America: The Winter Soldier.  One of the actors who read for a role is Frank Grillo (The Grey, Warrior).  Although he may not have even landed a role, from Grillo, we may have found out that one of the villains in the sequel may be Crossbones, who was indeed involved with one of the most famous stories featuring Captain America, the Falcon, and the Winter Soldier (whoever he is, wink).  Or… the whole Crossbones thing might be a clever fake out (it’s been known to happen).\n\n\n\nRotten Ideas of the Week\n\t\n#2 SOME ANIMAL FARM ADAPTATIONS ARE MORE ANIMAL FARM-Y THAN OTHERS\n\nOne might think that the directorial debut of “Gollum” actor Andy Serkis (after a year of working as second unit director for Peter Jackson on The Hobbit) would be a shoe-in for “Fresh Development” status.  His work on the Tolkien movies, King Kong, and Rise of the Planet of the Apes has basically made Andy Serkis sort of a favorite son among movie fan types.  But it’s also wise to read the actual text of movie announcements, and not just, say, the headlines that show up on Twitter and Facebook.  Serkis will be making his directorial debut with a motion capture adaptation of George Orwell’s Animal Farm, to be produced by his production company The Imaginarium.   Animal Farm was of course the 1945 allegorical novel (published before 1984) that used the pigs and other animals of a British farm to make very specific political points of particular interest to readers in the 1940s.  And that brings us to the “Rotten Idea” part, as Andy Serkis says that, “We?re keeping it fable-istic and [aimed at] a family audience. We are not going to handle the politics in a heavy-handed fashion.”  And right there is the problem.  If you tone down the politics of Animal Farm, which is basically what makes it Animal Farm, the resulting movie will resemble what… Babe or Charlotte’s Web?\n\n\n\t\n#1 ADAM SANDLER LASSOES WESTERN SPOOF RIDICULOUS SIX\n\nAdam Sandler is one of the most studio-loyal movie stars working today, with next summer’s Grown Ups 2 being Sandler’s 16th film for Sony Pictures or one of its subsidiaries.  This week, Sandler signed up for the first non-Sony Sandler-starring movie since 2008’s Bedtime Stories (which was distributed by Walt Disney Pictures).  Paramount Pictures has committed to an April, 2013 filming start date for Ridiculous 6, a Western spoof with a title that references The Magnificent Seven, a remake of which Tom Cruise is also attached to star in at some point.  Ridiculous 6 is a Happy Madison production, and ended up at Paramount Pictures after Sony put the comedy into turnaround.  Although these films weren’t specifically mentioned, one has to wonder if the recent box office failures of Jack and Jill and That’s My Boy might have to had an influence on Sony’s decision not to greenlight Ridiculous 6.  Sandler cowrote Ridiculous 6 with his frequent 1990s screenwriting partner Tim Herlihy (The Waterboy, Happy Gilmore, Billy Madison).  There’s not a director yet, but Paramount Pictures has already scheduled Ridiculous 6 for Spring Break weekend in 2014.   As for why Ridiculous 6 is the week’s Most Rotten Idea, check out all the green splotches over on Adam Sandler’s RT Tomatometer page.\n\n\nFor more Weekly Ketchup columns by Greg Dean Schmitz, check out the WK archive, and you can contact GDS via ","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"Kimmy, Awards, Best, cancelled, movie, Masterpiece, RT, cartoon, Syfy, BET, Studios, versus, GIFs, Nat","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Weekly-Ketchup-Arnold-Schwarzenegger-to-Reprise-Role-as-Conan"},{"id":"47509204467214","title":"Weekly Ketchup (Post-Comic-Con Edition): Wonder Woman Revealed, and More","content":"\n\n                                            Weekly Ketchup\n                                        \n                        \n                        \n                            var mps=mps||{}; mps._queue=mps._queue||{}; mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[];\n                            mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function() {\n                                mps.rt.insertlogo('#article_sponsorship_ad', 'ploc=articlesponsorship');\n                            });\n                        \n                    \n                    \n                        Weekly Ketchup (Post-Comic-Con Edition): Wonder Woman Revealed, and More\n                        Plus, lots of Marvel news, a Universal bait-and-switch, and new roles for Maisie Williams and Dwayne Johnson.\n                        by Greg Dean Schmitz | July 28, 2014                          | \n                          \n                              Comments\n                          \n                     \n\n                     \n\n                     \n                       \n                         \n                           \n                         \n                           \n                         \n                           \n                         \n                           \n                       \n                     \n\n                    \n                                                \nHere’s a special edition of the Weekly Ketchup, looking back at the biggest stories to come out of San Diego Comic-Con this year.  Alphabetically, the movies covered include Ant-Man, Avengers: Age of Ultron, Dark Universe, Deadpool, Doctor Strange, Guardians of the Galaxy 2, a possible Iron Man 4, The Last of Us, Shazam, The Sinister Six, Skull Island, and Wonder Woman.\n\n\n\nThis Week’s Top Story\n\t\nWONDER WOMAN REVEALED AT SAN DIEGO COMIC-CON\n\nThis year’s San Diego Comic-Con will not be one remembered for startling new announcements. Instead, this was a year for giving us our first glimpses at things we’ve known about for a while. It was also one of those years where most of the news actually happened before the Comic-Con doors even opened. One thing that did happen, however, which much of the world saw simultaneously, thanks to Facebook and Twitter, was our first glimpse of Gal Gadot as Wonder Woman in 2016’s Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice. The reactions varied, as reactions will, but common reactions concerned Gal Gadot’s new physique, the sword, the wedges, and the replacement of chocolate brown over the more traditional colors of red, gold, and blue. There was also this new look at Batman’s cowl, and a teaser trailer in which an armored Batman is confronted by Superman in Gotham City, which isn’t officially online yet (keyword: yet). We also learned this week that screenwriter Chris Terrio, who wrote Argo and cowrote Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, has started work on Justice League. And finally, Guillermo del Toro talked at SDCC about how his Dark Universe project fits in with Warner Bros’ superhero movies, which is that it doesn’t at all, but is instead like the Arrow TV show, in that it is a separate world and continuity. When (and if) it eventually happens, GDT’s Dark Universe will feature John Constantine, Deadman, The Demon, Swamp Thing, and Zatanna.\n\n\n\nFresh Developments This Week\n\t\n#1 MARVEL AT SDCC PART 1: RELEASE DATES FOR 2016 TO 2019, INCLUDING GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY 2\n\nIf the 2014 edition of San Diego Comic-Con had a whiff of disappointment surrounding it, it’s because so many of the big events didn’t really contain that many new announcements. Marvel really only announced one new project at SDCC, and that was Guardians of the Galaxy 2, the existence of which, even 5 days before the first movie is released, has already become something of a presumption. Marvel Studios will release Guardians of the Galaxy 2 on July 28, 2017. That announcement was the cap of a week of release date talk. First, we heard of six new release dates for mystery movies on July 8, 2016 (probably Doctor Strange), May 5, 2017 (probably another new film), July 28, 2017 (Guardians of the Galaxy 2), November 3, 2017, May 4, 2018, July 6, 2018, November 2, 2018, and May 3, 2019. That gives us a pattern of two Marvel movies a year up through 2016, and then in 2017 and 2018, three movies a year. Marvel’s Kevin Feige talked this week about the plan of doing one sequel, and one new film, each year, but what he didn’t say is what that will be like when there’s three movies a year instead of just two.\n\n\n\t\n#2 MARVEL AT SDCC PART 2: AVENGERS: AGE OF ULTRON REVELATIONS\n\nAt the actual Marvel event on Saturday at SDCC, about 70% of the attention was on next year’s Avengers: Age of Ultron. Leading up to the event, Marvel released a series of eight concept art posters depicting each of the team members fighting a horde of Ultron robots.  Black Widow, Captain America, Hawkeye, Hulk, Iron Man, and Thor were joined by new members Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch, and in the background of Quicksilver’s poster, we can see a yellow cloaked figure floating in the sky, who is almost certainly the android Vision (also a member of the Avengers in the comics). At the panel itself, the audience was treated to a teaser which showed the Avengers being attacked by Ultron (and his army of Ultrons). Marvel also brought along props, which included this, which we won’t spoil by saying what it is, except to say that this plot development might lead to the introduction of Black Panther, and his nation of Wakanda, in a later film. Speaking of later films, Robert Downey Jr. teased this week that he remains open to the idea of returning for a fourth Iron Man solo movie.\n\n\n\t\n#3 MARVEL AT SDCC PART 4: ALL THINGS ANT-MAN\n\nThe Marvel panel also spent a good bit of time on Ant-Man, which was obviously for many fans a time for damage control, following the loss of fan favorite director Edgar Wright. There was an Ant-Man concept art poster, and a preview of footage that showed Paul Rudd as Scott Lang, guided by Michael Douglas as Hank Pym, in an action scene on a roof. It was also confirmed that Evangeline Lilly is playing “a” Ms Van Dyne, but not Janet Van Dyne (AKA The Wasp in the comics), but instead, will be “Hope Van Dyne,” Hank Pym’s daughter (which doesn’t mean she couldn’t also be the movie’s version of the Wasp, of course). Corey Stoll was also confirmed to be playing the villain, the Yellowjacket (again, this was something we basically already knew). Scheduling conflicts (following Wright’s departure) also are forcing Patrick Wilson to leave the film. Two other actors (Matt Gerald and Kevin Weisman) have also departed Ant-Man, but in their cases, it’s because of the script rewrites. As for Edgar Wright, we also learned this week how he’s filling his time post-Ant-Man. First, Wright will proceed with directing Baby Driver, which has been described as a “collision of crime, action, music and sound,” which he originally signed to direct for Focus Features back in 2008. Farther down the road, Edgar Wright has also signed with Sony Pictures to direct their giant insect movie Grasshopper Jungle. Yes, that’s right, Edgar Wright has gone from a movie about an ant-sized-man to a movie about a man-sized praying mantis.  Go figure.\n\n\n\t\n#4 MARVEL (NOT) AT SDCC PART 3: JOAQUIN PHOENIX JOINS THE DOCTOR STRANGE RUMOR MILL\n\nGoing into San Diego Comic-Con this year, the leading guesses were that Marvel would reveal who has been cast as Doctor Strange, which might be the movie coming in 2016 after Captain America 3. As it turned out, we didn’t get that news after all, but just before, a story broke online that the new top contender for the role is now Joaquin Phoenix, who is at a career high following last year’s Her, and remains one of the most acclaimed actors who hasn’t yet ever dabbled with the superhero genre.  Doctor Strange will be directed by Scott Derrickson of Sinister, and the sequel to that movie (without Derrickson’s direction) was announced this week for August 21, 2015.\n\n\n\t\n#5 ARYA STARK FROM GAME OF THRONES MIGHT BE ONE OF THE LAST OF US\n\nIn the midst of all of the big, Big, BIG superhero events and such at San Diego Comic-Con, one of the less high profile events this year was the Screen Gems panel. Their revelation this year was all about the movie adaptation of the post-apocalyptic hit video game The Last of Us. Although nothing is signed yet, the current front runner to play the female lead is Maisie Williams, who audiences know best, surely, for playing Arya Stark on HBO’s Game of Thrones. The Last of Us is being produced by Sam Raimi, and frequent collaborator Bruce Campbell is also expected to take a role in the film.\n\n\n\t\n#6 DWAYNE JOHNSON NEARLY COMES RIGHT OUT AND SAYS, SHAZAM!\n\nMarvel Studios wasn’t the only superhero factory that didn’t deliver some of the announcements that people were expecting. Particularly, for DC and WB, fans were primed to expect something about Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson by Johnson himself, while doing various promotions for this weekend’s Hercules (which got trounced at the box office, by the way, by Black Widow, sort of, and Lucy). Basically, Dwayne Johnson teased that there would be an announcement very soon from him and DC Comics, and his use of the phrase “just say the word” seemed to suggest he was talking about the character called Captain Marvel, who in movie titles, has to be called Shazam (because Marvel own the rights to the title Captain Marvel). So, all that happened, and we still didn’t get the big Shazam announcement we expected (but it’s still not quite a “Rotten Idea” to cast Dwayne Johnson as Captain Marvel; just disappointing not to actually get that announcement).\n\n\n\nRotten Ideas of the Week\n\t\n#3 AUDIENCE PRIMED FOR JURASSIC WORLD GET KING KONG ORIGIN STORY INSTEAD\n\nOne sure way to set your hot new property up for a disappointing revelation at San Diego Comic-Con is for the displayed teaser to at first be confused for another project that fans are much more (currently) excited about. Let’s put  some pieces together, for example. Universal Pictures + Tropical Jungle Island + Monsters + Upcoming Movie = Jurassic World, right? That’s at least what many SDCC attendees seemed to be thinking. What they got instead was the world’s first glimpse at the King Kong origin story Skull Island, which is scheduled for November 4, 2016. A side story to all of this that seemed to go unnoticed by many SDCC journalists is that we now know that the “new franchise entry” for November, 2016 that we’ve previously been teased about turned out to be Skull Island, and not, as some guessed, Universal’s long-in-development Namor: The Sub-Mariner movie. Along with Fantastic Four, X-Men, and The Amazing Spider-Man, Sub-Mariner remains one of those properties that Marvel itself doesn’t currently control. If Universal is releasing Skull Island in 2016 instead, Marvel might now be close to getting one of their original superstars (two years before Aquaman) back within their cinematic universe. In other monster movie news, it was also confirmed at Comic-Con that Warner Bros now has the rights to include Rodan, Mothra, and King Ghidorah in future movies, including possibly (but not necessarily) in Godzilla 2.\n\n\n\t\n#2 THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN 3 PUSHED BACK TWO YEARS TO 2018\n\nUp until this week, the presumption was that The Amazing Spider-Man 3 was going to come out in 2016, introducing the super villain sextet The Sinister Six, who would then get their own spinoff movie. This week, we learned that The Amazing Spider-Man 3 now won’t be released until the summer of 2018 and that instead, it’s The Sinister Six that Sony Pictures is releasing on June 10, 2016. The summer of 2018 had been when Sony Pictures was going to release The Amazing Spider-Man 4, but that movie is also pushed back. And we still don’t know when the other super villain spinoff, Venom, might be released. We’re calling these pushbacks a “Rotten Idea” because we (well, this writer) were/was just starting to really like the reboot Spidey.\n\n\n\t\n#1 THE NON-PRESENCE OF FOX SUPERHEROES IS HIGHLIGHTED BY DEADPOOL AND FANTASTIC FOUR SNEAKS\n\n20th Century Fox, and their various superhero properties, were a no-show at San Diego Comic-Con this year. What we instead got online were two different sneak glimpses at Fox projects, and the resulting impact is decidedly Rotten for both, but for very different reasons. First off, let’s talk about The Fantastic Four. Well, someone should, because the studio certainly isn’t, following months of continued bad buzz (most recently, it was Kate Mara talking about how the movie’s not based on comic books, and Michael B. Jordan saying they’re just kids who had an accident). Well, anyway, here’s a very unofficial first glimpse at The Thing in The Fantastic Four, and he sort of looks like a clinically depressed rock monster from The NeverEnding Story.  Now, onto better glimpses, which are “Rotten” because it’s something we probably will never ever actually get to see as a real movie. We speak, of course, about the previously-in-development Deadpool solo movie starring Ryan Reynolds. 20th Century Fox keeps taking down the video, so we’ll just link to a YouTube search page for you to find one that still works. That footage was computer animated in 2011, so it’s three years old, but it pretty much nails the chatterbox “Merc with a Mouth” that is Deadpool. That video sort of plays like a cross between The Matrix Reloaded and The Mask, but still… it’s Deadpool. And that might be all we ever see of it until Deadpool eventually gets a spinoff movie following a reintroduction in X-Force, and that means it’ll happen, when? In 2020 (or later)?\n\n\nFor more Weekly Ketchup columns by Greg Dean Schmitz, check out the WK archive, and you can contact GDS via ","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"Lifetime, on, adaptation, Syfy, Crackle, 2019, Competition","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Weekly-Ketchup-PostComicCon-Edition-Wonder-Woman-Revealed-and-More"},{"id":"47509212328540","title":"Weekly Ketchup: Star Wars Spinoff Films Confirmed","content":"\n\n                                            Weekly Ketchup\n                                        \n                        \n                        \n                            var mps=mps||{}; mps._queue=mps._queue||{}; mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[];\n                            mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function() {\n                                mps.rt.insertlogo('#article_sponsorship_ad', 'ploc=articlesponsorship');\n                            });\n                        \n                    \n                    \n                        Weekly Ketchup: Star Wars Spinoff Films Confirmed\n                        Plus, new movies for the Hulk, the Grinch, and Johnny Depp.\n                        by Greg Dean Schmitz | February 8, 2013                          | \n                          \n                              Comments\n                          \n                     \n\n                     \n\n                     \n                       \n                         \n                           \n                         \n                           \n                         \n                           \n                         \n                           \n                       \n                     \n\n                    \n                                                \nThis week saw the movie development scene rewarded with a plague of blessings.  The start of the Berlinale, one of the major film markets, provided lots of smaller announcements that would have normally made the “top ten” cut.  However, they were mostly drowned out by bigger franchise stories, many of them thanks to Disney’s various fanboy-friendly subsidiaries.   Like the Hulk (or really, superheroes in general), animated movies, and Star Wars?  This was the week for you.\n\n\n\nThis Week’s Top Story\n\t\nDISNEY CONFIRMS STAR WARS SPIN OFF MOVIES, AND THE RUMORS START FLYING FASTER THAN HAN MADE THE KESSEL RUN \n\nThis was a big week for Star Wars news, and there’s a lot of angles to address, but it all starts (logically, if not chronologically) with a statement by Disney CEO Bob Iger.  Explaining how the plan for the next Star Wars trilogy is spread out across the next six years (with estimated release dates in 2015, 2017, and 2019), Iger addressed how Disney is going to fill the gaps between those films, namely with spin off movies involving “great Star Wars characters that are not part of the overall saga.”  The first rumor (and this story actually predated Iger’s announcement) involved Yoda, and included a very brief reference to a Jabba the Hutt project.  Then, after Iger’s announcement, two completely different characters were rumored as subjects of scripts by Lawrence Kasdan and Simon Kinberg: as reported by Entertainment Weekly, two of the spin off movies will tell flashback stories for Han Solo (how he became a smuggler, probably) and Boba Fett (not necessarily an origin, but set in the most wretched hives of bounty hunting scum and villainy).  In particular, the idea of a “young Han Solo” movie can easily be seen by fans with some skepticism, as the challenge will be in finding a young actor who can take on the role of one of cinema’s most classic characters.  There’s also the issue of whether Han Solo needs an origin story at all.  As for Boba Fett… how one feels about him getting a movie probably depends upon whether you’ve drank the long-standing proverbial Kool-Aid that is the cult of Boba.\n\n\n\nFresh Developments This Week\n\t\n#1 THE HULK’S CROWD PLEASING PERFORMANCE IN THE AVENGERS RUMORED TO LEAD TO GALACTIC-SIZED FUTURE FILMS\n\nThere were obviously a lot of winners following the $1+ billion box office success of The Avengers.  One character that many audience members probably found surprisingly endearing was the Hulk, who in The Avengers was realized in a way that previous attempts had failed.  As movie plans for Marvel’s Phase 2 and Phase 3 have continued to be announced (most recently, Doctor Strange as part of Phase 3), this has left fans wondering, “Yeah, but what about the Hulk?”  Now, it should be noted that some of the following info inherently contains “spoilers” for at least The Avengers 2, and possibly the hypothetical next Hulk movie (which hasn’t actually been announced yet).  Okay, so the gist here is that Latino Review is reporting that the plan might include adaptations of the Marvel events “Planet Hulk” and “World War Hulk” in Phase 3.  The movie blog site Collider also sums up the details of this rumored plan here.  Now, I’m going to attempt to briefly describe what all of this means without too many spoilers (ie, I know and have read the actual comic events, so details I’m leaving out are on purpose).  If these plans actually go through, in The Avengers 2, the Hulk would “somehow” end up on an alien planet.  In a future Hulk movie which might be called Planet Hulk, the Hulk would have a John Carter of Mars meets Gladiator type adventure where he becomes a gladiator, and makes friends with various other alien warriors (called the Warbound).  Then, “something happens,” and the Hulk and some of his new friends come back to Earth, in what may be The Avengers 3, as an adaptation of “World War Hulk.”  Of course, that title alone sort of gives away what “World War Hulk” may (or may not) be about.\n\n\n\t\n#2 THE RE-ANIMATION OF LIVE ACTION DR. SEUSS MOVIES INCLUDES HOW THE GRINCH STOLE CHRISTMAS\n\nHow one perceives movies is very often a generational experience.  As this writer was browsing online this week in preparation for this particular story, I was surprised to find a lot of people (of a certain age) who consider the 53% RT rated live action version of How the Grinch Stole Christmas to be a holiday classic that they enjoy every year without fail.  As someone who actually had a gig at the time as a professional critic, yeah, that’s not what I would have expected.  Anyway, the news this week is that Universal Pictures and Illumination Entertainment (Despicable Me, The Lorax) have started development on a 3D CGI animated adaptation of Dr. Seuss’ How the Grinch Stole Christmas!   Universal and Illumination are in deep in the Dr. Seuss business, with another live-action-to-animation adaptation (The Cat in the Hat) already announced, as well as a live action/CGI hybrid Dr. Seuss biopic also in development.  It’s surprising, therefore, to discover that despite being the most recent project announced, How the Grinch Stole Christmas is expected to be the next Dr. Seuss project for Illumination to be released.  There’s no writers announced yet, but How the Grinch Stole Christmas will mark the directorial debut for animator Peter Candeland, who has previously worked on Balto and the 1990s Aladdin TV cartoon.\n\n\n\t\n#3 SHADOW KING AND THE BOXTROLLS: MORE STOP MOTION GOODNESS, BOTH FROM THE MAKERS OF CORALINE\n\nThis week saw two completely different news stories emerge about stop motion animation projects, and they both share a common departure point in the 2009 film Coraline.  First, let’s talk about that film’s director Henry Selick (who also directed The Nightmare Before Christmas, James and the Giant Peach, and Monkeybone).  After Coraline, Selick made a deal with Disney and Pixar on a project that was eventually revealed to have the code name ShadeMaker.  In 2012, however, it was reported that Disney had shelved the project, allowing Selick to pursue it elsewhere.  Well, he’s done exactly that, and the movie is now called Shadow King.   Selick’s new savior is Beasts of the Southern Wild producer Josh Penn.  Shadow King will tell the magical tale of a young orphan with very long fingers whose ability to cast pretty awesome shadow puppets allows him to become a participant in a shadow war with an evil monster intent on killing the orphan’s brother and ultimately destroying New York City.   And this is where we ask collectively what in the world Disney was thinking when they let such an awesome sounding story go.  Anyway, Shadow King has been saved, and the voice cast will include Brendan Gleeson, Catherine O’Hara, Jeffrey Tambor, and Jaden Betts as the young orphan Hap.  And now, let’s return to the company that Selick worked on Coraline with, which is Laika, which most recently produced ParaNorman.  Their next film was revealed this week to be a fantasy called The Boxtrolls, which will be released on October 17, 2014 by Focus Features.   The extensive voice cast includes Sir Ben Kingsley, Richard Ayoade, Toni Collette, Elle Fanning, Jared Harris, Isaac Hempstead-Wright, Tracy Morgan, and frequent costars Nick Frost and Simon Pegg.  Anthony Stacchi, who was one of the codirectors of 2006’s Open Season will make his solo directing quasi-debut with The Boxtrolls.   Set in (and beneath) the Victorian Era British town of Cheesebridge, The Boxtrolls is about a quirky and loveable group of misfits who sneak out of their underground lairs at night to steal the two things the townspeople most cherish:  their children and their cheese (not necessarily in that order for either parties).\n\n\n\t\n#4 JOHNNY DEPP TO BEAT AFFLECK/DAMON TO THE PUNCH WITH THE WHITEY BULGER BIOPIC BLACK MASS\n\nIn the months since the 2011 Santa Monica arrest of Boston mobster Whitey Bulger, the big movie news has mostly been about the biopic that Massachusetts’ own Ben Affleck and Matt Damon were expected to be collaborating together on.  Affleck was going to direct, and Damon was going to play Whitey Bulger himself. The likelihood of that ever happening took a serious nosedive this week with the news that Johnny Depp signed on to star in a completely different Whitey Bulger biopic called Black Mass.   This movie will be an adaptation of the 2001 book Black Mass: The True Story of an Unholy Alliance Between the FBI and the Irish Mob, written by Boston Globe reporters Dick Lehr and Gerald O’Neill, with a new ending by newcomer screenwriter Mark Mallouk to cover Bulger’s arrest in 2011.  Black Mass also has an impressive director in Barry Levinson, who won an Oscar for directing Rain Man, and was also nominated for directing Bugsy.  Universal Pictures will be distributing Black Mass, and filming is scheduled to begin in May, 2013.\n\n\n\t\n#5 REVENGE STAR EMILY VANCAMP LANDS MUCH SOUGHT AFTER FEMALE LEAD ROLE IN MARVEL’S CAPTAIN AMERICA: THE WINTER SOLDIER\n\nIt’s an old symptom of the movie news blogosphere:  for certain high profile projects, sites will report every slightest development, and that includes every stage of the casting process.  And so it is with Captain America: The Winter Soldier, which has officially cast Sharon Carter, the female lead in the sequel.  Sharon Carter is the niece (originally the sister in the comics) of Peggy Carter from the first movie, and is also a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent known as Agent 13. Sharon Carter is also the character in the comics closest to being the love of Steve Rogers’ life.  Among those who were rumored for the role of Sharon Carter were Alison Brie, Emilia Clarke, Felicity Jones, Anna Kendrick, Imogen Poots, and Mary Elizabeth Winstead.  That’s all academic now, however, as the actress to actually land the role is Revenge star Emily VanCamp.  Ms. VanCamp will join an extensive cast that already (reportedly in some cases) includes returning roles for Chris Evans, Sebastian Stan, Samuel L. Jackson, Scarlett Johansson, Toby Jones, and Cobie Smulders, as well as new roles for Anthony Mackie (The Falcon) and Frank Grillo (Crossbones).    Filming of Captain America: The Winter Soldier is expected to begin in April, and Marvel Studios has scheduled a release date of April 4, 2014.\n\n\n\t\n#6 PARKS AND RECREATION COSTAR CHRIS PRATT LANDS MUCH SOUGHT AFTER MALE LEAD ROLE IN MARVEL’S GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY\n\nSo much of what you just read in that Captain America: The Winter Soldier story could (and nearly will be) just replaced for this story, Mad Libs style; there’s just so many parallels. This time, the movie is the cosmic super team project Guardians of the Galaxy, and the extended casting process was for the lead role of Peter Quill, the human/alien hybrid also known as Star-Lord.  Among those who were rumored or reportedly up for the role were Joel Edgerton, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Jack Huston, Zachary Levi, Lee Pace, Eddie Redmayne, and Jim Sturgess.  That’s all academic now, however, as the actor to actually land the role is Parks and Recreation costar Chris Pratt.  There’s no other cast announced yet for Guardians of the Galaxy.  However, there have been recent rumors that the movie may include supporting roles for Robert Downey, Jr. as Iron Man, and possibly the introduction of the galactic super cop Nova (yes, Nova’s back story is a lot like Green Lantern).  Now that Star-Lord is accounted for, there’s still at least two more humanoid (Drax and Gamora) and two CGI voice roles (Groot and Rocket Raccoon) to be cast.  Marvel Studios has scheduled Guardians of the Galaxy for a release date of August 1, 2014.\n\n\n\n#7 840,002 FACEBOOK FANS OF VAMPIRE ACADEMY SHOULD FINALLY BE HAPPY NOW\n\nBack in 2010, this column became the focus of a minor social networking firestorm when I made some dismissive “Rotten Idea” remarks about the popular YA series Vampire Academy, and the movie plans for an adaptation of such.  Almost three years later, the movie appears actually to be happening, and hey, there’s even reasons to call it a “Fresh Development” now.   The first movie in the potential franchise will be called Vampire Academy: Blood Sisters, and will also be the result of a brotherly collaboration.  Screenwriter Daniel Waters is known for writing Heathers and Batman Returns, and his brother Mark Waters directed Mean Girls, the Freaky Friday remake, and The Spiderwick Chronicles.   Both Waters brothers have therefore obviously worked before on teen-female-centric stories, as well as movies that have more gothic/fantastic elements.  There’s also already some casting news to report.  Zoey Deutch (from the upcoming Beautiful Creatures), Australian newcomer Lucy Fry, and Russian actor Danila Kozlovski have been cast as lead characters Rose, Lissa, and Dimitri.  Here’s a link to the Vampire Academy Wikia to help you get started figuring out who any of those characters actually are.\n\n\n\nRotten Ideas of the Week\n\t\n#2 THE ZOOLANDER SEQUEL WILL HAVE TO WAIT, BECAUSE, YOU KNOW… NIGHT AT THE MUSEUM 3\n\nBen Stiller has been in some great movies, and some very funny movies (sometimes even at the same time).  And then there’s the two Night at the Museum movies, which are his #2 and #6 biggest box office hits to date.  So, just like the inevitability that there would be (at least) three Madagascar movies, this week we received confirmation that Night at the Museum 3 has been scheduled by 20th Century Fox for a December 25, 2014 release date.  Director Shawn Levy (Just Married, Cheaper by the Dozen), who directed the first two movies, has also been confirmed for the third.  Previous screenwriters Robert Ben Garant and Thomas Lennon are also expected (but not actually confirmed, confirmed) to pen this third movie’s script.   The setting hasn’t been revealed yet, but famous museums that seem like possible choices include The Louvre (probably the most obvious and likely choice), the Field Museum in Chicago, and well, more of the Smithsonian not covered in the first movie.\n\n\n\t\n#1 THIS WEEK’S OBLIGATORY OBSCURE TV REFERENCE: “I JUST DON’T REALLY WANT TO BE AGENT 47, NOT EVEN FOR ONE DAY!”\n\nUp above, we had news about Agent 13, well, oddly enough, here’s a news story about Agent 47.  Agent 47 is the title of a new movie that is going to essentially reboot the Hitman video game adaptation concept under a new title, with a new lead actor.  The first Hitman movie came out in 2007, with Timothy Olyphant as the folicle-deprived lead character.  That movie was a critical bomb (14% on the RT Tomatometer) , but it did pretty decent business at the box office ($99 million globally on a budget of $24 million).  Anyway, for this reboot, Fox International Productions and Square Enix have cast Paul Walker to replace Timothy Olyphant.  Walker will shave his head for the role, which will start filming in Berlin and Singapore this summer after he finishes promoting Fast &amp; Furious 6.   Commercials director Aleksander Bach will make his feature film debut working from a script by Skip Woods (Swordfish; cowrite of X-Men Origins: Wolverine), who also adapted the original Hitman screenplay.\n\n\nFor more Weekly Ketchup columns by Greg Dean Schmitz, check out the WK archive, and you can contact GDS via ","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"Walt, Trivia","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Weekly-Ketchup-Star-Wars-Spinoff-Films-Confirmed"},{"id":"47509025330069","title":"Video: Conversations with 2017 Golden Globes Nominees","content":"\n\n                                            Video Interviews\n                                        \n                        \n                        \n                            var mps=mps||{}; mps._queue=mps._queue||{}; mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[];\n                            mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function() {\n                                mps.rt.insertlogo('#article_sponsorship_ad', 'ploc=articlesponsorship');\n                            });\n                        \n                    \n                    \n                        Video: Conversations with 2017 Golden Globes Nominees\n                        \n                        by RT Staff | January 6, 2017                          | \n                          \n                              Comments\n                          \n                     \n\n                     \n\n                     \n                       \n                         \n                           \n                         \n                           \n                         \n                           \n                         \n                           \n                       \n                     \n\n                    \n                                                In anticipation of the fast approaching 74th Golden Globe Awards, we collected all of our interviews with nominated filmmakers and actors, so you can watch them again (or for the first time) and get ready to root for your favorites on January 8th.

Their world is about to get a lot bigger and a whole lot louder.

We do however now know who will be the title villain in the May 1, 2015 sequel The Avengers: Age of Ultron.  And who would have guessed this, but the movie’s going to be a (partial) Less Than Zero reunion, because James Spader has been cast as Ultron. These days, Spader mostly focuses on TV work, but in his 1980s-1990s film career included roles in Mannequin, Wall Street, Stargate, and sex, lies and videotape.  Now that James Spader has been introduced, who exactly is this Ultron character?  From what we’ve heard, even if one knows who/what Ultron is in the comic books (an evil metal robot with a fiery anthropomorphic grin), that might not necessarily be what he/it will be in The Avengers: Age of Ultron.  We do, however, have a few hints: First off, there’s the possibility that Ultron will be a disembodied voice, ala the Iron Man version of “Jarvis” (he’s a portly British butler in the comics).  There was also a reference to LMDs in The Avengers, so there’s a chance that this evil robot version of Ultron will look like… James Spader.  Those human-looking robots prefer being called “androids,” but come on, everyone will still call them robots.  It’s sort of like the Trekkie/Trekker… thing.  Voice in a can, flesh covered metal skeleton, or a full on metal robot just like the comics, we don’t know, but whatever form he takes, he will be played by Steff from Pretty in Pink.  That’s really going to happen.\n\n\n\nFresh Developments This Week\n\t\n#1 AFTER SUCCESSES OF 42 AND THE BUTLER, UNIVERSAL FAST TRACKS THE JAMES BROWN BIOPIC\n\nThere is talk in Hollywood of a “new Universal Pictures,” one that’s energized by the recent addition of Legendary Pictures (more about that later).  That image was certainly supported this week by the speed with which Universal Pictures announced the long-planned James Brown biopic. It all started on Monday with the news that Chadwick Boseman will follow his depiction of Jackie Robinson in 42 with playing the Godfather of Soul.  If the greenlighting of this biopic is (at least somewhat) a reaction to the recent successes of 42 and Lee Daniels’ The Butler, the choice of director is also connected to a recent box office hit with a large African American cast.  The James Brown biopic (which we just learned today will be called Get On Up) will be directed by Tate Taylor (The Help) from a script by Jez and John Henry Butterworth (brothers and cowriters of Fair Game).  For two of the (currently unknown) supporting roles, Universal and/or Tate Taylor are reportedly talking to two actresses who costarred together in The Help: Viola Davis (Oscar nominated for her role) and Octavia Spencer (an Oscar winner for her role).  If Octavia Spencer signs on to costar in Get On Up, it will be the… let’s just call it the “umpteenth” time she’s worked with Tate Taylor (check this list out at IMDb).  Universal Pictures has scheduled Get On Up for next year’s awards season on October 17, 2014.\n\n\n\t\n#2 THIS WEEK IN WHO MATT DAMON WON’T BE: ROBIN OR JASON BOURNE (ANYTIME SOON)\n\nFirst, there was Batfleck.  Then, there were all the stories either about movies that Ben Affleck won’t direct, or about how he will still direct one movie (Dennis Lehane’s Live By Night) in between his (possibly many) upcoming Batman roles.  Someone who sort of got caught up in all of this whirlwind of speculation is Ben Affleck’s longtime movie buddy, Matt Damon. People seem to forget that Affleck and Damon aren’t Abbott and Costello.  Anyway, it’s already gotten to the point where Matt Damon has to clarify that he won’t be playing Robin.  If one wants to really get into the speculation game, however, it is rather interesting how specific (and academic) Damon’s debunking was. Damon was clearly never going to be cast as Bruce Wayne’s young ward, but what about any one of several other supporting roles in Batman’s life (Jim Gordon, Lucius Fox, Alfred, the Joker, the Riddler, etc).  There’s also speculation out there about a superhero role for Matt Damon in Warner Bros’ 2017 project Justice League (like maybe Aquaman or Green Arrow?).  Anyway, all of this talk about rumored projects for Damon leads us to the other news this week, which is that there were stories online that he and director Paul Greengrass might be reuniting soon for another Bourne movie.  Well, Universal Pictures quickly debunked that story.  The studio is continuing to develop the next Bourne movie for Jeremy Renner.\n\n\n\t\n#3 THIS WEEK IN WHAT MATT DAMON WILL DO: INTERSTELLAR AND THE FOREIGNER\n\nAll of that preceding text was devoted to what Matt Damon won’t be doing, but there was also a fair amount of news this week pointing the opposite direction.  Matt Damon will be going to Iceland for two weeks to film a small role in Christopher Nolan’s science fiction thriller Interstellar.  And we also learned this week that the premise of Interstellar might revolve around (get ready for this one)… corn.  Christopher Nolan is lucky he’s a critical darling, because there’s certain foods (ham and cheese are two others) that are just inherently bad mojo for movie types.  Matt Damon has also apparently chosen his directorial debut (which was almost last year’s Promised Land, FYI), which will be called The Foreigner (AKA A Murder Foretold).  The Foreigner will be adapted by screenwriter Chris Terrio, who previously worked with Ben Affleck on (and won an Oscar for) last year’s Argo.  You can read the New Yorker story that inspired The Foreigner here, but for those who want a short cut:  it’s a tale of tropical assassination and conspiracy all set in and around the jungles of Guatemala.  It’s not yet known if Matt Damon will also star in The Foreigner.\n\n\n\t\n#4 IDRIS ELBA TO STAR IN MOVIE PREQUEL TO THE HIT BBC SERIES LUTHER\n\nFirst off, this columnist should acknowledge that talk of this movie has been online for quite some time.  The reason it’s finally getting covered by the Weekly Ketchup is that we now know for sure that this movie is a “movie movie” and not, say, a TV movie.  Okay, here’s the actual story:  the hit BBC crime drama series Luther will follow up its third (and final) series (what we in the USA call a season) with a feature film that will serve as a prequel to the three series.  And yes, Idris Elba (Pacific Rim, Prometheus) will be starring in the movie like he does in the TV show.\n\n\n\t\n#5 JESSE PINKMAN GETS BIBLICAL IN RIDLEY SCOTT’S EXODUS\n\nWe, the viewing public, are still waiting for the final episodes of Breaking Bad to air, but for the show’s two stars, their careers are clearly moving onto their respective next phases.  Bryan Cranston’s got Godzilla in 2014, and rumors about playing Lex Luthor (did we mention that?  Yeah, that was a thing this week too) in the Man of Steel sequel.  Aaron Paul, AKA Jesse Pinkman, has the videogame adaptation Need for Speed coming out on March 14, 2014, and this week, the news broke that Aaron Paul is taking on a significant Biblical figure. Paul is in talks with 20th Century Fox and Scott Free Productions to costar in Ridley Scott’s Exodus as Hebrew slave Joshua to Christian Bale’s Moses.  Sigourney Weaver and John Turturro have also signed to play the parents of Egyptian pharoah Ramses II, to be played by Joel Edgerton (that would make Turturro Ramses I).  Filming of Exodus is starting soon in Spain and Morocco (subbing for turbulent Egypt), with 20th Century Fox already scheduling the movie for release on December 12, 2014, the same release date as Disney and Brad Bird’s Tomorrowland.\n\n\n\t\n#6 ONG-BAK STAR TONY JAA IS THE LATEST ADDITION TO THE EVER GROWING FAST &amp; FURIOUS FRANCHISE \n\nWhen entertainment/film writers try to figure out the secrets to the success of the Fast and Furious franchise, they invariably hit upon the multiculturalism of the cast of the six movies (and counting). That notion was supported this week by the announcement that Thai action star Tony Jaa, of the popular Ong Bak trilogy, will be making his Hollywood (and English language) debut as a costar in Fast &amp; Furious 7. The movie is still being written, but Universal is apparently confident that the production can be shot and finished quickly, as the movie is already scheduled for release on July 11, 2014 (a date Fast &amp; Furious 7 has to itself, in between Maleficent on 7/2/14 and Dawn of the Planet of the Apes on 7/18/14).  Tony Jaa is not the only new addition for Fast &amp; Furious 7, as Jason Statham is already confirmed as the film’s main villain (after appearing in the end credits of Fast and Furious 6).  (Last minute breaking news!  Kurt Russell is also in talks for a role in Fast &amp; Furious 7.)\n\n\n\n#7 ZOINKS! SCOOBY-DOO TO GET REBOOTED AS AN ANIMATED MOVIE\n\nThis coming March will mark the 10th anniversary of the release of the 2004 sequel Scooby-Doo 2: Monsters Unleashed, which was the sequel to the 2002 hit live action/CGI adaptation of the popular 1970s Saturday morning cartoon show(s). That upcoming landmark is illuminated because it just means that enough time has passed for Warner Bros to start thinking about what to do next with Scooby-Doo.  And the answer is going to be a new animated Scooby-Doo movie.  Certain questions aren’t answered (like whether it will be traditionally animated), but that might just be because there’s a presumption concerning certain types of “animated” projects these days that “duh, of course” it’s going to be CGI. There really isn’t much else known about this new Scooby-Doo movie yet, but let’s address something that people will probably be quick to question in the comments: Why is the idea of a new animated Scooby-Doo listed under Fresh Developments (way at the bottom, it’s worth pointing out)?  There’s a reason why Scooby-Doo is a cultural icon that is so ingrained in the minds of people of a certain age/generation that it’s become a storytelling code.  Sure, the animation wasn’t great, but the various forms that Scooby-Doo took in the 1970s and 1980s (and a tiny sliver of the 1960s) had some sort of undeniable impact. This writer would love to think that maybe someday a new animated movie could recapture… whatever that was.  Let’s file this in the same “possibly misguided optimism” category as the November 6, 2015 CGI version of Peanuts.\n\n\n\t\n#8  WHAT SWEET MUSIC THEY MAKE (?): THIS WEEK IN NEWS ABOUT THE DRACULA REBOOT\n\nIn addition to a series of stories about the James Brown biopic (see above), Universal Pictures also devoted much of their attention this week to the upcoming reboot of one of the most famous of their Universal Monsters: Dracula. First of all, in what might read as somewhat “inside baseball” studio talk, Legendary Entertainment (The Dark Knight, 300, The Hangover) has chosen Dracula as their first coproduction under their new deal with Universal Pictures.  Luke Evans (Fast &amp; Furious 6, Clash of the Titans) has been cast as the new Dracula, which is expected to be an origin story (rather than, say, a direct adaptation of Bram Stoker’s novel).  The new film will mark the directorial debut of Gary Shore (who directed a short film called The Draft in 2006).  The second story for Dracula this week is that Universal Pictures has shifted the release date back a bit to October 3, 2014, to position Dracula as a more traditional “Halloween” monster/horror movie (versus the former “summer” release date of August 8, 2014).   Legendary is also considering joining in on Jurassic Park IV, but there’s no deal to announce just yet.    (It’s worth noting, just to avoid confusion, that Legendary still has three movies coming out through Warner Bros: 300: Rise of an Empire, the reboot of Godzilla, and Guillermo del Toro’s Crimson Peak). We’re calling this one a borderline Fresh Development to give the new director the benefit of the doubt.  What do you think, commenters?  Will the new Dracula suck?\n\n\n\nRotten Idea of the Week\n\t\n#1 THE DIRECTOR OF NOW YOU SEE ME WILL RETURN FOR THE SEQUEL\n\nMaybe this was a slow movie news week (it really was, being just before Labor Day), or the impending start of fall festival season is inspiring producers and studios to greenlight “good movies” (shock! gasp!).  Whatever the reason, there really weren’t that many stories this week that are obviously “rotten ideas.”  And so, we return to a movie that was a Rotten Idea a few weeks ago… by default.  Anyway, what many writers will write about this one is an acknowledgement that Now You See Me (currently the #17 domestic box office movie of 2013) was a bigger hit than many people realize.  Now You See Me has done better domestically than, say, Epic, Pacific Rim, White House Down (or Olympus Has Fallen) or The Hangover Part III.  And so, Lionsgate is developing a sequel to the magician-heist movie.  The news this week is that the director will once again be Louis Leterrier (Clash of the Titans and the first two Transporter movies). Leterrier’s direction of Now You See Me earned the film an RT Rating of 49%.  Will the possibly titled Now You Don’t do any better?\n\n\nFor more Weekly Ketchup columns by Greg Dean Schmitz, check out the WK archive, and you can contact GDS via ","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"VH1, demand, psychological, drama, competition, Box, Western, cancelled","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Weekly-Ketchup-James-Spader-Is-Ultron-in-Avengers-Age-of-Ultron"},{"id":"47508722069658","title":"All Felicity Jones Movies Ranked by Tomatometer","content":"\n\n                        \n                            \n                            \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                    \n                                                (Photo by Disney/courtesy Everett Collection)\nAll&nbsp;Felicity Jones Movies Ranked by Tomatometer\nBefore starring in the first Fresh Star Wars spin-off (we know, we know, you can’t believe The Ewok Adventure is Rotten), Felicity Jones built an impressive resume in her native Britain, where she had been working as an actress since the age of 12. The Worst Witch and its sequel Weirdster College are beloved in certain circles&nbsp;of English millennials, and Jones graduated after that into movies like Flashbacks of a Fool with Daniel Craig, and Brideshead Revisited. Her start in America came with the 2011 romantic drama Like Crazy with Anton Yelchin, which was able to pick up extra headlines for also co-starring Jennifer Lawrence, who was on the cusp of Hunger Games megastardom.\nUpwards career trajectory in the 2010s suggests that you haven’t made it until you’re in a superhero movie. With Jones, it was The Amazing Spider-Man 2. (Hey, it doesn’t say the superhero movie had to be actually good.) Jones played Felicia Hardy, who would’ve gone on to become Black Cat, had Sony not given Spider-Man over to Marvel Studios for an MCU makeover. That same year, she was nominated for a Best Actress Oscar with The Theory of Everything, starring Eddie Redmayne, who did win an Oscar for it.\nBy 2016, she was picking up blockbuster work: A Monster Calls (which critics loved, but no one saw);&nbsp;Inferno (which critics hated, but some people saw); and Rogue One (which the critics loved, and everyone saw). The packed filming schedule and Rogue One‘s famously troubled production may have been what led Jones to a quiet 2017, before returning in 2018 with On the Basis of Sex, portraying Ruth Bader Ginsburg. That was her only movie that year, and likewise in 2019, she’s got the one: The Aeronauts, a survival adventure of air balloon pioneers that reunites her with Redmayne. She takes to the skies, and we’re taking a look back with all Felicity Jones movies, ranked by Tomatometer!\n\n        \n            #21\n            \n              \n                  \n              \n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                          Collide (2017)  24%\n                        \n                    \n                    \n                        #21\n                    \n                \n                \n                    \n                        Adjusted Score: 24.87% \n                        Critics Consensus: Collide wastes a talented cast on a would-be thriller fatally undermined by eye-rolling dialogue, logical fallacies, and humdrum set pieces.\n                        Synopsis: After a heist goes terribly wrong, Casey Stein (Nicholas Hoult) finds himself on the run from a ruthless gang headed...

Rowling’s long-awaited return to the Harry Potter movies.\n\n\n\nThis Week’s Top Story\n\t\nJ.K. ROWLING RETURNS TO HARRY POTTER’S WORLD WITH FANTASTIC BEASTS…\n\nAs the last of the movie adaptations of J.K. Rowling’s Harry Potter series got closer to release, there was much speculation about how Rowling’s world and characters might someday return to the big screen.  Ideas that people inevitably bandied about included a new series of movies with a new generation of kids to spin offs for various supporting characters (for all those wondering whatever happened to, say, Dilys Derwent).  This week, Warner Bros announced the answer to this lingering question, as J.K. Rowling has agreed to write the adapted screenplay for a movie inspired by her Harry Potter suppplemental book Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them (published in 2001 under the pseudonym Newt Scamander).  The movie will be an original story that starts in New York City seventy years before Harry Potter arrives at Hogwart’s, and tells the story of magical zoologist Newt Scamander, and how he learned so much about fantastic beasts and where to find them. Rowling’s deal right now is for only the one movie, but obviously, Warner Bros is hoping that it will be just the first of a new franchise.  This announcement also has the potential of going a long way to help fill in the holes in Warner Bros’ upcoming releases left by the recent departure of Legendary Pictures, which has a new corporate home at Universal Pictures.\n\n\n\nFresh Developments This Week\n\t\n#1 THIS WEEK IN SUMMER ’15: UNIVERSAL EDITION — JURASSIC WORLD OFFICIALLY ANNOUNCED\n\nWhile much smaller movies continue to be announced, screened and reviewed up at Toronto this week, for some reason, various Hollywood studios decided this was also a great week to discuss the summer of 2015. Every summer has big movies, but 2015 has long seemed like an embarrassment of riches.  Besides the movies we’re just about to start discussing, the summer of 2015 also (tentatively in some cases) currently includes such releases as Assassin’s Creed, The Avengers: Age of Ultron, the Batman/Superman movie, the Independence Day sequel, Pixar’s Inside Out, and the Terminator reboot.  Basically, the news this week is between two studios, so let’s start with Universal Pictures, and their confirmation of one of the longest and most anticipated sequels that doesn’t involve superheroes or spaceships: The dinosaur movie formerly known as Jurassic Park IV is now called Jurassic World, and it’s scheduled for June 12, 2015.  The new title can be interpreted to confirm whichever is your favorite rumored premise for the movie.  We’ve heard before that it will be set back on the original island, and feature a new 21st century relaunch of the original “theme park” concept (think of the title like “SeaWorld” or “Walt Disney World”).  The other way to interpret Jurassic World is to think it means the whole planet gets overtaken by dinosaurs.  Or it could start off as one, and lead to the other.  Anyway, Jurassic World will be directed by Colin Trevorrow (Safety Not Guaranteed) from a script that he cowrote with his writing partner from that movie, Derek Connolly.  Soon after the title was announced, the world was also reminded of this “pitch video” that was also called “Jurassic World,” although we don’t know that it has any official connection to Trevorrow’s movie, besides the title.   Universal Pictures also announced this week the new title of Dracula Untold for their vampire movie scheduled for October 3, 2014. And while we’re sneaking in news of rebooted classic monster movies, there’s also 20th Century Fox’s modern version of Frankenstein. Jessica Brown Findlay (Downton Abbey) this week landed the female lead role, opposite James McAvoy as Dr. Frankenstein, and Daniel Radcliffe as his assistant Igor. Jessica Brown Findlay will play “a trapeze artist who is saved by Igor after an accident, with the two becoming very close in the aftermath.” Speculate away about whether that means she plays the new movie’s version of The Bride.\n\n\n\t\n#2 THIS WEEK IN SUMMER ’15: DISNEY EDITION — ANT-MAN AND PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN 5\n\nThis week, in quick order, Walt Disney Pictures bumped one movie up into the summer of 2015, and then withdrew another one, in a series of moves that one has to interpret as connected.  The vacating movie is Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales, which will be the fifth movie in the franchise starring Johnny Depp.  Producer Jerry Bruckheimer is hoping that the delay is not a permanent stop, but that this will instead just mean that the movie will be released in the summer of 2016 instead.  One reason offered for the delay is the budget issue, which for past PotC movies has sometimes gone over $300 million.  Disney is hoping that this fifth one can be done for “only” something closer to the $200 million range.  Dead Men Tell No Tales will be directed by Kon-Tiki codirectors Joachim Ronning and Espen Sandberg.  There are also rumors about script issues, which you can read about here, along with premise details (one word summary: witches).  Disney also made the news this week when talk of budget caps was also applied to the Star Wars movies coming out every year starting in 2015.  The movie that will be replacing PotC:DMTNT in the summer of 2015 is Ant-Man, the first movie of Marvel’s Phase 3, which was previously scheduled over three months later on November 6, 2015. We still don’t know who will be starring as Dr. Henry Pym in Edgar Wright’s shrinking superhero comedy, but the movie is now scheduled for July 31, 2015.  This forms something of a superhero sandwich, with the Batman/Superman sequel on July 17, 2015 being the DC meat between two slices of Marvel bread, following The Avengers: Age of Ultron on May 1, 2015.\n\n\n\t\n#3 DJIMON HOUNSOU JOINS THE FAST AND THE FURIOUS FRANCHISE WITH MOVIE #7\n\nJames Wan (Saw, Insidious, The Conjuring) has already started filming of Fast &amp; Furious 7, but we’re still hearing about new cast members (some of whom we can also expect to return in the eighth movie as well).  Previous announcements were for Jason Statham and Kurt Russell (more about him later), and this week, we learned that Djimon Hounsou (Gladiator, Blood Diamond) has also signed on for an unspecified role.  That last phrase brings us back to Kurt Russell, who some recent Twitter posts led to speculation that he had dropped out (or had just never signed on, or was merely rumored).  Anyway, James Wan himself posted yesterday that yes, he’s currently directing Kurt Russell (who we also now know is playing the father of Jesse, Chad Lindberg’s character from the first movie).\n\n\n\t\n#4 PLANET OF THE APES ALUMNI MARK WAHLBERG AND DIRECTOR RUPERT WYATT UNITE FOR THE GAMBLER\n\nSomeone at Paramount Pictures is apparently quite obsessed with the idea of remaking the 1974 James Caan movie The Gambler, about an English professor with a gambling addiction.  At one time, Martin Scorsese was considering the remake, and he was followed by Todd Phillips (The Hangover), who would have been working with Leonardo DiCaprio in the lead role.  They’re now both gone from the project, and the director and star who are in talks to replace them both have connections to separate reboots of the Planet of the Apes franchise.  That director is Rupert Wyatt (Rise of the Planet of the Apes), and that star is Mark Wahlberg, who starred in Tim Burton’s 2001 version of Planet of the Apes.  This is being seen as the latest step in Paramount’s relationship with Mark Wahlberg as one of the studio’s stars, as he also recently starred for them in Pain and Gain, and is the star of next year’s Transformers: Age of Extinction.  As for Rupert Wyatt, there is speculation that The Gambler might be part of a deal that will eventually see Wyatt signing on to replace J.J. Abrams as the director of the third Star Trek reboot movie.\n\n\n\t\n#5 JESSE PINKMAN TO PLAY A BAD DAD IN THE INDIE HELLION\n\nThere’s still three more episodes of Breaking Bad left to air, but the show’s Aaron Paul (AKA Jesse Pinkman) is already well on his way to establishing a post-series film career.  The videogame adaptation Need for Speed is already filmed and scheduled for release next April, and a few weeks ago, Aaron Paul signed to star as Joshua in Ridley Scott’s Biblical epic Exodus.  So, yeah, a big action movie, a sword-and-sandal epic, what’s missing from the mix, here?  Besides a romantic comedy or a supernatural horror movie, another possible answer might be “festival friendly indie drama.”  Aaron Paul and Juliette Lewis (Cape Fear, Natural Born Killers) have both signed on to star as a couple struggling to keep their family together in indie director Kat Candler’s Hellion.  The drama will be a feature length adaptation of her short film which premiered last year at Sundance.  Kat Candler also wrote the low budget Scooby-Doo “homage” Saturday Morning Mystery.  That short film was about a seven year old boy whose brothers are encouraging (bullying, really) him not to act like a little… hmm, how would Jesse Pinkman finish that sentence?  Yeah, kind of like that.\n\n\n\t\n#6 THE MORTAL INSTRUMENTS FRANCHISE PROVES ALL TOO MORTAL AFTER DISAPPOINTING BOX OFFICE\n\nIt’s almost five years ago now that the first Twilight movie debuted to huge box office (which only got bigger for subsequent movies). That led to a new cinematic land rush as every studio and/or production company tried to have their own “female YA genre novel” adaptation in the pipeline.  Except for The Hunger Games, however, most of these efforts have failed to get anywhere close to duplicating the Pied Piper effect that sparkly vampires had on the pitter-pattering of teen girl hearts. The latest would-be franchise starter to receive bad news at the box office was last month’s The Mortal Instruments: City of Bones, which has thus far made only $65 million (from a budget in the $60 million range).  An adaptation of the next book by Cassandra Clare, City of Ashes, had previously been planned to start filming in Germany in the next couple of months, but those plans have now been “shut down indefinitely.” Besides the sequel The Hunger Games: Catching Fire (11/22/13), the next major adaptations of female YA genre novel franchises will be Vampire Academy: Blood Sisters (2/14/14) and Divergent (3/21/14).\n\n\n\nRotten Ideas of the Week\n\n#3 KEANU REEVES TO STAR IN HITMAN THRILLER JOHN WICK \n\nThe way the publicist business works often results in stories that bury the lead considerably. Take, for example, the hitman thriller called John Wick. So, this week, Willem Dafoe signed on to play a hitman who is hired to kill the title character, who is himself a former hitman. So, Willem Dafoe has his publicist send out the story, because, you know, hey, he’s got a new role, and that’s worth telling people about, because maybe it will land him other future roles.  However, this is where it gets kind of funny, because Willem Dafoe is joining the already cast actor who actually plays the lead role, and is known to you and me as Keanu Reeves. Except, it looks like Keanu Reeves’ publicist was not as vigilant about spreading the news, and so we only find out what one would think is the headline in someone else’s story. And to wrap this whole story about the whole story not being told, here’s this one last detail: we still don’t know the name of the film’s director.  The John Wick screenplay was written by Derek Kolstad, whose current big claim to fame was cowriting the 2012 action movie One in the Chamber, starring Dolph Lundgren and Cuba Gooding, Jr.\n\n\n\t\n#2 ELLEN PAGE TO ADOPT A BRITISH ACCENT AS THE LEAD SPY IN QUEEN &amp; COUNTRY\n\nEllen Page has already played a superhero a few times (as Kitty Pryde twice and also in Super), and apparently, the studio behind those two X-Men movies, 20th Century Fox, has wanted for a while to get Page into another comic book adaptation.  That goal materialized this week with the news that Ellen Page has signed with Fox to star in the studio’s adaptation of Greg Rucka’s comic book franchise Queen &amp; Country.  The comic will be adapted as a “spy action” movie in which Ellen Page will play “a British Intelligence agent who tries to stop an international terrorist plot after her identity is compromised and as her personal demons spiral out of control.”  Comparisons are made to the way The Bourne Identity relaunched Matt Damon’s career, but Matt Damon also wasn’t playing someone “British.” Your next hint that this is a “Rotten Idea” story is that the screenplay is being adapted by John Rogers, whose last three credits on the RT Tomatometer were American Outlaws (14%), The Core (41%), and Catwoman (9%).\n\n\n\t\n#1 THE STEP UP 5 CAST IS ANNOUNCED, TYING TOGETHER THE FIRST FOUR MOVIES, SO GET CAUGHT UP NOW!\n\nThere’s a pretty common comment section joke to be made about sequels, and how you never saw the first movie(s), so would you be able to follow the story for this one?  By the time a franchise gets around to movie number five, that’s arguably a good question.  But then, you remember that we’re about to discuss the Step Up dance series, which is coming up to its fifth movie, and still, their best claim to fame is that Channing Tatum was in the first one. Step Up 5 is really trying hard to take advantage of the large casts of the first four movies, and for the last couple of weeks, we’ve been getting these stories released about cast members from previous films signing on for this one.  Something funny that happened to this writer when he saw a headline about “Guzman and Evigan” returning for Step Up 5 was that brief moment when I imagined they were talking about Luis Guzman (Boogie Nights) and Greg Evigan (B.J. and the Bear), two additions that might just have convinced me to actually watch (on Netflix someday) Step Up 5.  But no, they were actually talking about Ryan Guzman (Step Up: Revolution) and Briana Evigan (Step Up 2: The Streets) (Greg Evigan’s her dad).   For the record, the tally for returning cast members currently stands at: one from Step Up, six from Step Up 2: The Streets, ten from Step Up 3-D, and a whopping thirteen from Step Up: Revolution (it’s worth noting that many were in multiple films, so we’re actually talking about 18 dancers, not 30).  Here’s a link to the RT Tomatometer page for the Step Up franchise to explain why this is a “Rotten Idea” story.\n\n\nFor more Weekly Ketchup columns by Greg Dean Schmitz, check out the WK archive, and you can contact GDS via ","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"Peacock, rings","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Weekly-Ketchup-JK-Rowling-Will-Adapt-Harry-Potter-Spinoff-Fantastic-Beasts-and-Where-to-Find-Them"},{"id":"47509207951919","title":"Weekly Ketchup: Disney Secures Indiana Jones Rights","content":"\n\n                                            Weekly Ketchup\n                                        \n                        \n                        \n                            var mps=mps||{}; mps._queue=mps._queue||{}; mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[];\n                            mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function() {\n                                mps.rt.insertlogo('#article_sponsorship_ad', 'ploc=articlesponsorship');\n                            });\n                        \n                    \n                    \n                        Weekly Ketchup: Disney Secures Indiana Jones Rights\n                        Also, some biopics, a couple of reboots, and lots of sequels.\n                        by Greg Dean Schmitz | December 13, 2013                          | \n                          \n                              Comments\n                          \n                     \n\n                     \n\n                     \n                       \n                         \n                           \n                         \n                           \n                         \n                           \n                         \n                           \n                       \n                     \n\n                    \n                                                \nThis was a crazily busy week for movie development news. This writer is absolutely certain that in the future, it will be easy to think a story was covered in the Weekly Ketchup, only to discover that it wasn’t, because the week in question was this one. The movies that did make the cut include new projects for Sandra Bullock, Tom Cruise and Dwayne Johnson, new entries in the Amazing Spider-Man, Avengers, and Man of Steel superhero franchises.\n\n\n\nThis Week’s Top Story\n\t\nWALT DISNEY AND THE RAIDERS OF THE LOST INDIANA JONES FRANCHISE\n\nWalt Disney Pictures has been steadily building quite a mountain of franchises that are now theirs to produce and distribute. The series of acquisitions in recent years has included The Jim Henson Company, Pixar, Marvel, and most recently, Lucasfilm. When that last deal happened, the hype and the talk was mostly about the new Star Wars movies.  This week, however, we learned that Disney has not forgotten about that other big franchise that Lucasfilm was involved with: Indiana Jones. The series may have lost some of its lustre due to Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull (though one might be surprised that movie actually has a Certified Fresh rating of 78%), and there’s also obviously the issue of an aging 71-year-old Harrison Ford (though there’s always Shia LeBeouf, right?). Anyway, a deal has been agreed upon between Walt Disney Pictures and Paramount Pictures that leaves the distribution of the first four movies at Paramount, but allows Disney to produce future movies (which Paramount retains a financial “participation” in). However, as a subsequent Variety headline declares, “Don’t expect the next Indiana Jones for at least two to three years.” Disney CEO Alan Horn was quoted as saying, “We haven’t done anything. We don’t have a story. We need a story.” You know that had to stop some people in Hollywood… “Wait… we do?”\n\n\n\nFresh Developments This Week\n\t\n#1 DON CHEADLE SUITING UP FOR AVENGERS: AGE OF ULTRON, PLUS A BELOVED COMIC BOOK CHARACTER IS HIRED?\n\nOh, mainstream media, you sometimes totally bury leads that online movie journalists are going to lose their **** over.  In this case, it’s the revelation that Don Cheadle will be appearing in Avengers: Age of Ultron (as James Rhodes, AKA War Machine). See, we didn’t know that, at least, not for sure.  Now, this doesn’t necessarily mean that War Machine is joining the Avengers, but hey, it’s something. We also learned this week of a rumor that British actor Simon McBurney might be in talks to play Jarvis. Before you say, oh, they’re not using the voice of Paul Bettany as the voice of J.A.R.V.I.S. anymore, no, we’re talking about the “original” Jarvis, AKA Edwin Jarvis. Before the name was adapted (rather funnily) in Iron Man, Edwin Jarvis was the Avengers’ (and Tony Stark’s) butler almost since the beginning. He’s a beloved old school comic book character (who probably wasn’t included right away because people would think he was too much like that other “butler to a millionaire playboy superhero,” and admittedly, such an opinion wouldn’t have necessarily been wrong). By now, however, J.A.R.V.I.S. has been in the movies long enough that the idea of a “human” Jarvis has the chance of seeming original and funny. Edwin Jarvis also provides the Avengers with their heart.\n\n\n\t\n#2 SANDRA BULLOCK TO REUNITE WITH HER GRAVITY COSTAR GEORGE CLOONEY (SORT OF)\n\nSandra Bullock is reportedly in early talks with Warner Bros and producing partners George Clooney and Grant Heslov to star in a comedic adaptation of the 2005 documentary Our Brand is Crisis. That film “focused on the use of American political campaign strategies in Bolivia by President Clinton’s former consultants James Carville and Stan Greenberg.” If Bullock does sign on, she would be playing “a retired American political consultant who often quotes famous people to help hammer home her talking points.” The script is being adapted by Peter Straughan, who previously worked with George Clooney on 2009’s The Men Who Stare at Goats. It’s currently unknown whether Clooney will also costar in Our Brand is Crisis, but it’s probably a good bet that he wouldn’t be playing James Carville. George Clooney also made the news this week as possibly reuniting with the Coen Bros on the long-in-development comedy Hail Caesar, about a 1920s matinee idol who tackles a sword-and-sandal epic.   This could have been its own story, but hey, it was a busy week.\n\n\n\t\n#3 THIS WEEK IN BIOPICS: FREDDIE MERCURY, JESUS, AND… AN ANIMATED ANNE FRANK MOVIE?\n\nConsider this single “story” a sort of dustbin for a few not-really-otherwise-connected stories that are all technically “biopics.” First off, there is the long-in-development biopic about the life of Freddie Mercury, the lead singer of the rock group Queen. At one time, Sacha Baron Cohen had been attached to star, but this week, we learned that the role is instead going to Ben Whishaw, costar of such movies as Cloud Atlas and Layer Cake. The movie will also be directed by actor-turned-director Dexter Fletcher, who was also in Layer Cake. Speaking of Queen, a certain someone has been called the “King of Kings” and that someone was… Jesus.  Lionsgate has acquired the feature film rights to Dr. Reza Aslan’s best selling book Zealot: The Life and Times of Jesus of Nazareth. The book has come under fire from some sources mostly due to Aslan himself not being a Jew or a Christian (sort of ironic for a guy named Aslan, right, Narnia fans?). Finally, there is the animated adaptation of Anne Frank: The Diary of a Young Girl. That notion is a bit of a headline grabber, but that’s until you hear that the animator and director in question is Ari Folman, the director of Waltz with Bashir. So, yeah, it’s not going to be a wacky CGI kids movie.\n\n\n\t\n#4 THE DWAYNE JOHNSON MOVIE THE RUNDOWN MAY GET THE SEQUEL YOU DIDN’T EVEN REALIZE YOU WANTED\n\nThere are plenty of very obvious movies about which there will always be sequels talked about, and eventual sequels produced. And then, there’s a movie like 2003’s The Rundown, about a bounty hunter played by Dwayne Johnson bringing Seann William Scott back to civilization from the jungle. It was a fun movie, but probably not one most people ever seriously thought would get a sequel. Well, director Peter Berg (Battleship, Hancock) apparently isn’t listening to those people, because he revealed this week that he is talking to writers, and that Dwayne Johnson wants to do the sequel.  We don’t know the story yet, but it would feature a new actor, probably playing someone else that Dwayne Johnson has to go and Rundown. There’s lots of green splotches on director Peter Berg’s RT Tomatometer page, but The Rundown isn’t one of them at 71% Fresh.\n\n\n\t\n#5 TOM CRUISE TO RETURN AS JACK REACHER\n\nReleased in a busy December movie season, many people may not have really noticed the release of last year’s Jack Reacher, starring Tom Cruise. The adaptation of the book series character created by author Lee Child went on to earn over $218 million worldwide on a production budget of just $57 million. And so, this week, we learned that Paramount Pictures and Skydance Productions have acquired the rights to the most recent Jack Reacher novel, Never Go Back. In this one, Jack Reacher returns to one of his former military bases in Virginia to find himself in a series of social and criminal messes (hence the title). Paramount is now looking for a writer to adapt the book. Christopher McQuarrie, who wrote and directed the first movie, isn’t expected to work on this second Jack Reacher movie because he is otherwise engaged getting ready to film Tom Cruise in Mission: Impossible 5.\n\n\n\t\n#6 JASON CLARKE IN TALKS TO PLAY JOHN CONNOR IN THE TERMINATOR REBOOT\n\nFirst off, it’s worth noting that this is a borderline Fresh Development, because this writer’s reluctance in supporting yet another sci-fi reboot keeps being subverted by the talents of everyone actually making the news associated with it. Okay, so here’s the big news. Jason Clarke (Zero Dark Thirty) is now in talks with Skydance Productions and Paramount Pictures to play future rebellion leader John Connor in the Terminator reboot (which may end up being called Terminator: Genesis). Previously, John Connor has been portrayed by Edward Furlong, Nick Stahl, Christian Bale, and Thomas Dekker (on the TV show).  Meanwhile, the casting of Sarah Connor is still ongoing, with director Alan Taylor (Thor: The Dark World, Game of Thrones) wanting to cast his show’s Khaleesi, Emilia Clarke, and Paramount favoring Brie Larson, who the studio recently cast in the Mark Wahlberg movie The Gambler. Arnold Schwarzenegger is also expected to be reprising his role as at least one of the cyborg killers in the reboot.\n\n\n\nRotten Idea of the Week\n\t\n#3 AMAZING SPIDER-MAN SPINOFFS ARE REVEALED TO START WITH VENOM AND SINISTER SIX\n\nThe online movie journalism community is pretty much acting today like this story is the biggest story, but it’s handicapped by something, in regards to whether this should have been the week’s “Top Story.” It already was, three weeks ago. Oh sure, we got some of the speculation confirmed today, but the gist is pretty much the same. Sony Pictures is expanding their share of the Marvel movie spectrum into more than just The Amazing Spider-Man, with a series of spinoff movies for other characters. What we learned this week is that the first two spinoffs have been confirmed as being Venom and The Sinister Six. The Amazing Spider-Man spinoffs are being developed by a new brain trust of writers which include Alex Kurtzman and Roberto Orci (of the Star Trek and Transformers franchises), Jeff Pinkner (of TV’s LOST and Fringe), Drew Goddard (Cloverfield), and Ed Solomon (Men in Black). Kurtzman, Orci and Solomon will work on Venom, which Kurtzman will direct, and Drew Goddard will work on The Sinister Six, which he will also possibly direct. And of course, we already see the beginnings of what may become The Sinister Six in the trailers for The Amazing Spider-Man (Rhino, Electro, the Goblin-related character, etc). The reason all of this is one of the week’s Rotten Ideas is that this seems like just the latest example of one of the hottest new trends of 2013, AKA copying Marvel Studios and The Avengers. This piece over at Vulture sums up the sentiment.\n\n\n\t\n#2 JASON MOMOA AND HIS MUSCLES IN TALKS TO COSTAR IN MAN OF STEEL SEQUEL\n\nThere are just certain actors that don’t get cast against type (very often, anyway). Take, for example, Jason Momoa, the absolute mountain of a man who might be best known for costarring in Game of Thrones, and for starring in the failed Conan the Barbarian reboot.  What we’re saying is, you cast Jason Momoa when you want a guy with lots of muscles; it’s sort of his thing. And so, the news this week that Jason Momoa is in talks with Warner Bros to costar in their sequel to Man of Steel has online writers all aflutter, trying to figure out which muscley DC Comics character Jason Momoa might play (the original article speculates about Doomsday and Martian Manhunter). As said above, it’s telling that people just don’t even bother speculating about characters like say, Elongated Man, or The Atom (though it’s worth noting that in many comic books, every male superhero is drawn as being muscle bound). As long as we’re all just making up guesses anyway, what about Hawkman, who also has to show off his shirtless muscles in pretty much every shot. Anyway, if Jason Momoa signs, he joins the various actors from the first movie, as well as Ben Affleck (Batman) and Gal Gadot (Wonder Woman).\n\n\n\t\n#1 ED HELMS TO STAR IN THE NAKED GUN REBOOT (THAT YOU REALLY KNEW YOU DIDN’T WANT)\n\nBuried in the busy news cycle this week was this revelation:  Paramount Pictures is rebooting The Naked Gun, the TV and film comedy series starring the late Leslie Nielsen as bungling police Detective Frank Drebin. And for a project we didn’t even know was happening, it’s surprisingly well along, because Ed Helms (The Hangover) is attached to be the new Frank Drebin. This is about as welcome a remake announcement as when Steve Martin became the new Inspector Clouseau. It’s not so much that Ed Helms isn’t a funny comedian, but some roles are best left to age like fine grape juice. The reboot of The Naked Gun is being adapted by the screenwriting team of Thomas Lennon and Robert Ben Garant, formerly of The State and Reno 911!, and also the writers of the Night at the Museum franchise. So, commenters, who should they get to reprise O.J. Simpson’s role as Detective Nordberg?\n\n\nFor more Weekly Ketchup columns by Greg Dean Schmitz, check out the WK archive, and you can contact GDS via ","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"crime, movies","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Weekly-Ketchup-Disney-Secures-Indiana-Jones-Rights"},{"id":"47509214928513","title":"Weekly Ketchup: Tom Cruise to Remake The Magnificent Seven","content":"\n\n                                            Weekly Ketchup\n                                        \n                        \n                        \n                            var mps=mps||{}; mps._queue=mps._queue||{}; mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[];\n                            mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function() {\n                                mps.rt.insertlogo('#article_sponsorship_ad', 'ploc=articlesponsorship');\n                            });\n                        \n                    \n                    \n                        Weekly Ketchup: Tom Cruise to Remake The Magnificent Seven\n                        Plus, a couple of supervillain anouncements and a biopic for the creator of 007.\n                        by Greg Dean Schmitz | May 25, 2012                          | \n                          \n                              Comments\n                          \n                     \n\n                     \n\n                     \n                       \n                         \n                           \n                         \n                           \n                         \n                           \n                         \n                           \n                       \n                     \n\n                    \n                                                \nThis week’s Ketchup is heavy with news about remakes (Robocop, The Magnificent Seven), villain news for Iron Man 3 and Thor 2, and new roles for Sandra Bullock, Zach Galifianakis, Gary Oldman, and Seth Rogen.  Often Hollywood seems to shut down the news-making side of the movie-making business right before holiday weekends, but this year’s Memorial Day weekend, not so much!\n\n\n\nThis Week’s Top Story\n\t\nTOM CRUISE TO REMAKE THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN\n\nAmong Tom Cruise’s current slate of potential upcoming movies are at least two reboots/remakes (A Star is Born and Van Helsing), and this week, another one joined the list.  MGM, a studio that’s all about remakes these days (Carrie, Red Dawn, Poltergeist, Robocop, etc), has started development on a remake of the 1960 western The Magnificent Seven, which was itself a remake of Akira Kurosawa’s 1954 film Seven Samurai.  And, as you can tell from the way this article started, Tom Cruise is already attached to star as one of the seven American gunfighters that are hired to defend a Mexican town from a gang of outlaw banditos.   That, however, is as much as we know right now.  Other very important answers, such as who will be hired to write the adaptation, who will direct, who will play the other six gunslingers, and whether the setting will remain in the 19th century (or be modernized), are all subjects that are very much in the wind right now.\n\n\n\nFresh Developments This Week\n\t\n#1 WILL ZACH GALIFIANAKIS FINALLY BE IGNATIUS J. REILLY IN A CONFEDERACY OF DUNCES\n\nThe Pulitzer Prize winning novel A Confederacy of Dunces by John Kennedy Toole is a book that from its very origin has always been shrouded in unusual events, starting with the fact that it wasn’t published until 1980, 11 years after Toole committed suicide in 1969.  The notion that A Confederacy of Dunces could be adapted as a movie goes back some 30 years, and even that story is one of significant coincidence.  Back in 1982, Harold Ramis (Caddyshack, Groundhog Day) scheduled a meeting at Universal Pictures to discuss the movie with John Belushi… and then Belushi died a few days before the meeting.   This started what some might almost call a curse (but probably has more to do with the sometimes short lives of heavyset American men), as in later years, John Candy and Chris Farley were also considered for A Confederacy of Dunces, and then… they both died too (Will Ferrell was also attached at one point, but happily, it didn’t kill him).   All of that set up leads us to this much buried lead:  Zach Galifianakis is now attached to star as Ignatius J. Reilly in A Confederacy of Dunces.  The project is now the subject of negotiations with director James Bobin, the cocreator of HBO’s The Flight of the Conchords, who made his feature debut last year with The Muppets.  A Confederacy of Dunces is being developed by producer Scott Rudin and Paramount Pictures, who have hired screenwriter Phil Johnston (Cedar Rapids) to adapt Toole’s tale of an odd man and all of the people he knows and meets in New Orleans’ French Quarter.\n\n\n\t\n#2 GARY OLDMAN WILL BE THE GEPETTO/FRANKENSTEIN BEHIND THE REBOOTED… ROBOCOP\n\nDarren Aronofsky may have long since departed MGM’s reboot of Robocop, but it’s starting to look like there are still reasons for movie fans to be excited that maybe the reboot won’t be an abomination.  Namely, Gary Oldman has signed a deal with MGM to play a scientist named Norton who creates the Robocop technology, and “finds himself torn between the ideals of the machine trying to rediscover its humanity and the callous needs of a corporation.”  There really wasn’t much of a character like that in the original film, unless this Norton is somehow related to Bob Morton, the OCP executive played by Miguel Ferrer.  This also all ties into what director Jose Padilha (Elite Squad, Bus 174) has already said about how his version will differ from the original.  Explaining how his movie will be very much about the story not told originally, Padilha said, “My movie is between those two cuts.  How do you make Robocop?  How do you slowly bring a guy to be a robot?  How do you actually take humanity out of someone and how do you program a brain, so to speak, and how does that affect an individual?”   Robocop himself, AKA Alex Murphy, will be played by Joel Kinnaman (The Darkest Hour).  Filming is scheduled to start in Toronto in September, 2012, and MGM is currently eyeying a release sometime in the summer of 2013.\n\n\n\t\n#3 SANDRA BULLOCK JOINS THE DE FACTO BRIDESMAIDS REUNION PROJECT\n\nThere’s been a lot of talk over the last year about what the various people behind Bridesmaids will be doing next.  Now, we have the answer for director Paul Feig, who also directed Unaccompanied Minors in 2006 and created the TV show Freaks and Geeks.  The comedy will also reunite Paul Feig with Melissa McCarthy, who garnered dozens of nominations for Bridesmaids.  McCarthy will play an “unconventional” Boston cop who has to team up with an “uptight” FBI agent played by Sandra Bullock, who previously played an agent (but probably a different one) in the two Miss Congeniality movies.  The untitled comedy was written by Katie Dippold, a writer and producer of episodes of MADtv and Parks and Recreation.   20th Century Fox is hoping to get production on this comedy started sometime this summer while Melissa McCarthy is on hiatus from her CBS sitcom Mike &amp; Molly.\n\n\n\t\n#4 THE IAN FLEMING BIOPIC TO START FILMING THIS YEAR AS PART OF THE JAMES BOND GOLDEN ANNIVERSARY\n\nThe James Bond film franchise turns 50 this year, and the golden anniversary is being celebrated commercially in a few different ways, including the release of Skyfall in November, and a massive Blu Ray boxed set of all the films to date.  Bond’s creator, Ian Fleming, will himself be directly involved with all of this (well, as directly as can be for someone who died in 1964), as he will be the subject of Fleming. The long planned biopic will tell the true story of how Fleming’s own experiences as a Naval Intelligence Officer led to the creation of the world’s most famous (fictitious) super spy.  After a search that included Gary Ross and Francis Lawrence (coincidentally, the directors of The Hunger Games and its upcoming sequel, Catching Fire), the director job for Fleming has gone to Duncan Jones, the David Bowie progeny who made his auspicious debut with Moon and whose second film was Source Code.  Fleming will be a British production in association with Fleming’s estate, and will be based upon the book Ian Fleming: The Man Behind James Bond by Andrew Lycett.  Duncan Jones is currently casting up, and production is expected to start by the end of 2012.\n\n\n\t\n#5 ZAC EFRON AND SETH ROGEN TEAM UP FOR TOWNIES\n\nDirector Nicholas Stoller got his film career started with a hit in the form of Forgetting Sarah Marshall, which was followed by the spinoff Get Him to the Greek, and continued this year with The Five-Year Engagement.  Now, Stoller is lining up his fourth film, and it will be the first movie that doesn’t either star Jason Segel, or is a spinoff of a movie starring Jason Segel.  That movie is called Townies, a comedy for Universal Pictures, that will star Seth Rogen and Zac Efron as two guys on either side of a turf war between a “family man” (Rogen) and a hard-partying fraternity member (Efron).  Townies got its start last summer as the subject of a bidding war between the studios, and is seen as a top priority, so it is likely that filming will start relatively soon.\n\n\n\t\n#6 PETER BOGDANOVICH WILL RETURN WITH SQUIRRELS TO THE NUTS\n\nIt is literally cinema history now, but there was a time when Peter Bogdanovich was one of the hottest screenwriters/directors in Hollywood, as a member of the “New Hollywood” scene of the 1970s.  Bogdanovich’s career included such films as Mask, Paper Moon, and The Last Picture Show, and he has also long been prolific as an expert on film history, aided greatly by his early friendships with such old school directors as John Ford, Alfred Hitchcock, Howard Hawks and Orson Welles.  However, along the way, Bogdanovich’s own career as a screenwriter and director sort of hit the brakes, with his last film as director (The Cat’s Meow) opening way back in 2001, and his last film as screenwriter even further back (Texasville in 1990).  In an arc that is quite circular considering what Bogdanovich did for some of those old time directors, he is now the benefactor of younger directors Wes Anderson and Noah Baumbach, who are helping him get a new movie made.  That movie is called Squirrels to the Nuts, and it’s about a New York prostitute whose “business” with a Broadway director leads to her getting a new career on the stage.  Brie Larson will be that “working girl,” Owen Wilson will play the director, and Olivia Wilde will play a “therapist dealing with her own mother’s alcoholism.”\n\n\n\t\n#7 MORE VILLAINS GET CAST IN BOTH THOR 2 AND IRON MAN 3\n\nAs The Avengers continues to smoke just about any other film released this month, development of the sequels for two of that film’s central characters continued with much haste and activity this week.  And the theme was villains!  Mads Mikkelsen is a Danish actor who is probably best known for playing the villain Le Chiffre in Casino Royale, and he also had roles in King Arthur (2004), Valhalla Rising, and Clash of the Titans.  Mikkelsen’s Nordic ancestry arguably makes him sort of inevitable for any short list for future Thor casting, and sure enough, he’s in talks to play one of (if not “the”) the villains in Thor 2.  Now, that’s pretty much all we know, so any further speculation on who that might be will have to remain in the realm of fan chat for now.  Some possibilities, however, could be Skurge the Executioner (especially if Amora the Enchatress is the other villain), or maybe someone like Malekith the Accursed, if the storyline focuses more on the Dark Elves of Svartalfheim.  Meanwhile, over in the Iron Man 3 production offices, relatively unknown actor Ashley Hamilton (Sunset Beach) has landed a small role as the super armored villain Firepower.  The addition of a relatively unknown villain (who is more memorable for the story that introduced him than his legacy as an actual character) is particularly interesting when we factor in another hiring from last week.  James Badge Dale (AMC’s Rubicon) was cast to play Eric Savin, AKA Coldblood, another “wait… who’s that again?” nearly unknown Marvel super villain.  On the bright side, the inclusion of lesser known villains for the movies might be seen as a good thing in that it means the script isn’t being written just to fit in popular villains just… because.  Lesser known characters might service the story of this film better… we don’t know.  And in other news… Jon Favreau may not be directing Iron Man 3 (Shane Black of Kiss Kiss Bang Bang is), but he will still be on set anyway, because he’s returning as bodyguard/chauffeur Happy Hogan.\n\n\n\t\n#8 THE VIDEO GAME MOVIE CURSE… CAN SHADOW OF THE COLOSSUS FARE ANY BETTER THAN MOST?\n\nAfter Hollywood got its first look at the super-powered-teens movie Chronicle back in January, that film’s director Josh Trank has since lined up three different comic book adaptations at various studios (Red Star, Venom and the Fantastic Four reboot).  But to paraphrase the old show business expression, what Josh Trank may have really wanted to do was make a video game adaptation, delving into a collective source material that thus far has not had its own Blade/X-Men moment, marked by increased and frenzied Hollywood interest. Trank has signed with Sony Pictures for an adaptation of the 2005 PS2 game Shadow of the Colossus from Japanese developer Team Ico.  In the fantasy game, a young adventurer named Wander has to explore a vast expanse on horseback searching to defeat sixteen massive monsters to restore life to his girlfriend.   Trank has long been a fan of Shadow of the Colossus and basically sought this project out, and it is his interest that may be the key to it actually getting made someday.\n\n\n\nRotten Idea of the Week\n\t\n#1 LEGO COMPETES WITH ITSELF WITH HERO FACTORY\n\nCGI animated movies take a long time to actually get produced, as is evidenced by the February 28, 2014 release date that Warner Bros has set aside for their movie inspired by the popular LEGO building block toys.  LEGO this week made the very unusual move of actually starting negotiations with another studio, Universal Pictures, for a completely separate adaptation of their Hero Factory line of robotic action figures.  Universal has already found screenwriters for Hero Factory in the form of Michael Finch and Alex Litvak, who are best known for their work on 2010’s Predators.   The premise of Hero Factory should seem extremely familiar to most movie fans, as it sounds a lot like Transformers: there’s a factory planet that churns out robotic machines, and they are locked in a war between good guy robots and bad guy robots.  Hero Factory was introduced in 2010 by LEGO as a replacement to the Bionicle line, which also got a series of direct-to-video movies back in the day.  Unlike Warner Bros’ LEGO movie, which will be entirely CGI animation, Universal is eying Hero Factory as a live action action film.  In other news… Universal released Battleship last weekend.

The stories that did actually get announced this week include casting news for the next Hunger Games sequel, a new Stephen King adaptation, and new roles for Samuel L. Jackson and Viggo Mortensen.\n\n\n\nThis Week’s Top Story\n\t\nJENA MALONE JOINS THE HUNGER GAMES: CATCHING FIRE\n\nWeeks of speculation over the casting of District 7 tribute Johanna Mason in The Hunger Games: Catching Fire came to an end this week.  27 year old Jenna Malone (Donnie Darko, Stepmom) is in negotiations for the role, which will also be featured in the third film, The Hunger Games:  Mockingjay.   What everyone seems to mention about Johanna Mason, so this writer will mention too, is that she strips out of her costume in her first encounter with Katniss.  Jenna Malone will be of course joined by several of the actors from the first film (whose characters survived).  Filming of The Hunger Games: Catching Fire is scheduled to start in late September, 2012 under the direction of Francis Lawrence (Constantine, Water for Elephants, I Am Legend).\n\n\n\nFresh Developments This Week\n\t\n#1 JENNIFER HUDSON, SAM JACKSON AND ANGELA BASSETT IN TALKS FOR BLACK NATIVITY\n\nBlack Nativity is the title of an off-and-on Broadway musical written by Langston Hughes that features traditional Christmas carols sung in a gospel style.  Black Nativity tells the traditional Nativity tale of the birth of Jesus Christ within a larger story of a teenager spending Christmas with his grandparents.  The production first premiered in 1961, but now over 50 years later, it is on its way to becoming a musical feature film thanks to Fox Searchlight and director/writer Kasi Lemmons (Eve’s Bayou, Talk to Me).  Jennifer Hudson is now in talks to play the boy’s mother, and for the roles of the grandparents, negotiations are ongoing with Angela Bassett and Samuel L. Jackson, who is also likely to play multiple roles within the Nativity scenes.\n\n\n\t\n#2 VIGGO MORTENSEN IS ONE OF THE TWO FACES OF JANUARY\n\nViggo Mortensen and Oscar Isaac (Drive, Sucker Punch) have signed on to star in The Two Faces of January, an adaptation of a novel by Patricia Highsmith (The Talented Mr. Ripley).   Oscar Isaac will play the proprietor of a rundown Athens hotel, and Viggo Mortenson will play a man involved with “stock manipulation and fraud.”  The third major role yet to be cast is that of Mortenson’s wife.  The Two Faces of January will be the directorial debut of screenwriter Hossein Amini (Drive; cowriter of Snow White and the Huntsman).\n\n\t\n#3 TRUE BLOOD STAR STEPHEN MOYER TIES THE DEVIL’S KNOT\n\nBritish actor Stephen Moyer (True Blood) is the latest to join the cast of Devil’s Knot, the dramatic retelling of the case of the West Memphis Three.  Atom Egoyan (Chloe, The Sweet Hereafter) is directing, and some of the actors already cast include Reese Witherspoon, Colin Firth, Alessandro Nivola and Kevin Durand.\n\n\t\n#4 THE AVENGERS TALE CONTINUES IN ITEM 47\n\nNormally, this column only covers full length feature films, but this is a really, really slow news week because of Independence Day being on a Wednesday.   And so, this news story breaks two of those rules, by being about a short film that’s going direct-to-video.  Item 47 isn’t, however, just any short film, as it’s also a de facto sequel to the most successful film of the year, The Avengers.  Lizzy Caplan (Cloverfield) and Jesse Bradford (Hackers) will play a couple that gets their hands on one of the alien Chitauri guns which they use for a crime spree, leading to two S.H.I.E.L.D. agents (Maximiliano Herndandez and Titus Welliver from LOST) going after them to get the weapon out of their hands.  Item 47 will be included on the DVD and Blu Ray releases of The Avengers, which comes to stores and homes near you on September 25, 2012.\n\n\n\t\n#5 WILL CHUCK PALAHNIUK’S SNUFF GETS THE MOST BANG OUT OF ITS GANG?\n\nAuthor Chuck Palahniuk’s novels have thus far been turned into two movies, one of which makes many people’s lists of favorite movies (Fight Club), while the other one was Choke.  Palahniuk’s 2008 novel Snuff was told from the perspective of three of the men (#72, #137 and #600) participating in a 600 man gang bang orgy with an aging female porn star.   And now, Snuff is on its way to becoming an R rated “story of love and redemption” courtesy of director Fabien Martorell (Tromatized: Meet Lloyd Kaufman).  Curiously, the “official” announcement came this week, but as far back as early 2011, Martorell was talking about casting Snuff.  Back then, Martorell claimed that Daryl Hannah (probably as the porn star), Thora Birch (probably as her assistant), and Tom Sizemore had joined the cast.  It’s unknown if any of those actors are still involved with Snuff, 17 months later.\n\n\n\nRotten Ideas of the Week\n\t\n#4 ANOTHER WEEK, ANOTHER STEPHEN KING ADAPTATION: THE TEN O’CLOCK PEOPLE\n\nStephen King has written hundreds of novels, novellas and short stories, and dozens of movies have been based upon them since the 1970s.  The latest entry in the massive line of Stephen King adaptations will be based upon The Ten O’Clock People, one of the stories in the 1993 collection Nightmares and Dreamscapes.   Justin Long (Live Free or Die Hard, Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story) is now in talks to star as a Boston man whose efforts to quit smoking lead him to discover that monsters called “Batmen” are controlling the world disguised as humans in varying levels of power.  Basically, it’s a lot like John Carpenter’s They Live, but without the glasses, Rowdy Roddy Piper, or chewing gum shortages.  The Ten O’Clock People will be directed by Tom Holland, an old hand at horror who has two genuine 1980s classics to his credit (Fright Night and Child’s Play), as well as two other Stephen King adaptations (Thinner and the Langoliers mini-series).  However, none of his films’ RT Tomatometer scores besides Child’s Play and Fright Night (and none since 1988) are “Fresh,” and so that’s why The Ten O’Clock People is one of the week’s Rotten Ideas.\n\n\n\t\n#3 MORE WHITE HOUSE ATTACK CASTING NEWS: DYLAN MCDERMOTT IN OLYMPUS HAS FALLEN\n\nThis is another story one can credit to an extremely slow news week.  Dylan McDermott has joined the cast as a Secret Service agent in Antoine Fuqua’s Olympus Has Fallen.  That’s the one with Gerard Butler, Angela Bassett, and Aaron Eckhart (as President), and Antoine Fuqua directing.  The other White House attack movie is White House Down, and that’s the one with Channing Tatum, Maggie Gyllenhaal, Jamie Foxx as POTUS, and Roland Emmerich directing.\n\n\t\n#2 BRITISH TV-TURNED-MOVIE THE INBETWEENERS TO GET AMERICANIZED\n\nThe Inbetweeners is the title of a British sitcom TV show that got turned into a movie which subsequently became the top grossing British comedy of all time.  And so, Paramount Pictures has started development on an American version of The Inbetweeners, although the new version may not keep that title.   The original movie was about four nerdy teenage boys who go on vacation in Greece, but the new version may not keep that destination, either.  So, what Paramount has is a movie about four horny teenage boys on vacation trying to get laid.  Paramount’s development of this movie comes just as MTV is preparing to debut an Americanized version of the TV show as well, starting on August 20, 2012.  The cast of the MTV show will probably also star in this movie version, but that doesn’t hasn’t officially been confirmed yet.  It just seems the most obvious answer.\n\n\n\t\n#1 FILE UNDER SEQUELS WAY PAST THEIR EXPIRATION DATE: HOCUS POCUS 2\n\nFirst off, it should be noted that this story hasn’t officially been confirmed by anyone yet, and appears to have started when someone added the title to this Wikipedia page.  It is however, a really, really, slow news week (it’s been said earlier, but really can’t be said enough), so here we go:  Disney may or may not be developing a sequel to the 1993 fantasy comedy Hocus Pocus, starring Bette Midler, Kathy Najimy, Sarah Jessica Parker, and a very young Vinessa Shaw.  If this story is true, the title would be Hocus Pocus 2: Rise of the Elderwitch.  But it might not be.  Regardless, Hocus Pocus was quite over the top (to adult eyes, anyway; people who saw it as kids might remember it differently), and it’s getting close to being 20 years old now.  All of that would be enough to make this the Most Rotten Idea of the week, but the RT Tomatometer agrees with me, too.\n\n\nFor more Weekly Ketchup columns by Greg Dean Schmitz, check out the WK archive, and you can contact GDS via ","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"ITV, Horse, Emmys, History, zombie, Ovation, Oscars, Film, OWN, History, SundanceTV, comic, rotten, Grammys, drama","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Weekly-Ketchup-Jena-Malone-Joins-Catching-Fire-Cast"},{"id":"47508711118907","title":"The 95 Best Movies 3 Hours or Longer, Ranked","content":"\n\n                        \n                            \n                            \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                    \n                                                (Photo by Paramount Pictures/courtesy Everett Collection. Thumbnail: Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures / © Marvel Studios / courtesy Everett Collection; New Line Cinema / courtesy Everett Collection.)\nThe 95&nbsp;Best Movies 3 Hours or Longer, Ranked by Tomatometer\nSuddenly finding yourself with lots of free time? In possession of a murder of minutes, a bounty of hours, a gaggle of extra days, wondering how to fill them all up? Sounds like you could go for a movie – a really loooong movie. Well, we’ve sifted through the backend of cinema history, from the silent era all the way up to the present, and collected and ranked the 95 best-reviewed movies that run three hours or longer (and have a Tomatometer score) to vanquish those pesky waking moments.\nThe director who takes the most advantage of your attention span? No surprise: It’s Martin Scorsese, with six films on this list, including 2019’s The Irishman. Other directors with multiple entries are legends known for their predilection for epic storytelling: Akira Kurosawa (Seven Samurai, Red Beard); David Lean (Lawrence of Arabia, Doctor Zhivago); Oliver Stone (JFK, Malcom X); and Stanley Kubrick (Spartacus, Barry Lyndon). Of course, Francis Ford Coppola gets a couple in there: There’s The Godfather, Part II (though not The Godfather, which is three minutes shy of three hours), and Apocalypse Now Redux over regular ol’ vanilla Apocalypse Now, which runs a swift 2.5 hours.\nNow Redux underscores an interesting point. It’s included because the film had a national theatrical release, and got its own separate Tomatometer score from the original movie. Other director’s cuts that clear the 3-hour mark, like Watchmen or Kingdom of Heaven, or extended editions like Lord of the Rings, are excluded because they don’t have their own Tomatometers, and never saw major release.\nMeanwhile, Kill Bill Vol. 1 &amp; 2 were cut from the list: You had to buy two tickets, meaning two separate movies. (But Grindhouse is in because one ticket at the box office got you the whole sleazy shebang.) This Kill Bill rule applies in excluding other potential candidates like the Nymphomaniac volumes, or Steven Soderbergh’s Che: Though it screened at Cannes as a single release, in America it was split in two, requiring two purchases, making them two movies.\nThen we arrive at European films like Scenes From a Marriage or The Best of Youth, which were originally presented as TV miniseries before being edited into singular entities. Those count. Again, it’s all about how the movie was packaged and exhibited for consumption in North America. And finally, we put in a minimum requirement of 10 Tomatometer-approved critic reviews and ratings for each movie to keep this guide from trending too obscure.\nAre longer movies better? We wrote an article exploring the notion. Something must be keeping these filmmakers in the edit bay, piling on the celluloid. With a movie like Avengers: Endgame, the appeal of a long runtime is apparent: It’s got dozens and dozens of colorful characters eager to pummel each other, and had to wrap up a 22-movie story arc. Titanic‘s got a sinking boat. King Kong has a big ape.\nBut some of the other movies’ hooks aren’t as obvious. Films like Andrei Tarkovsky’s Andrei Rublev or Bela Tarr’s Satantango use their generous runtimes to explore new dimensions in cinema, to build something mystical and mysterious within viewers, culminating close to a rapturous experience. And a few of the documentaries, such as Shoah or O.J.: Made in America (which had an awards-qualifying theatrical run), need the space to do right by their topics.\nWith all that said, it’s time to get real comfy on that couch: Check out the 95 best movies 3 hours or longer! –&nbsp;Alex Vo\n\n        \n            #95\n            \n              \n                  \n              \n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                          Exodus (1960)  63%\n                        \n                    \n                    \n                        #95\n                    \n                \n                \n                    \n                        Adjusted Score: 64.254% \n                        Critics Consensus: No consensus yet.\n                        Synopsis: Fictional but fact-based account of the struggle for the emergence of modern Israel as an independent country and home for...

From promising releases by new voices to&nbsp;experimental efforts&nbsp;from storied filmmakers – or perhaps the next indie darling to go the distance for end-of-year accolades – we will break it all down for you here each week.This week for our&nbsp;Indie Fresh List, we have a pair of Golden Globe-nominated films&nbsp; — a quiet wanderlust drama about finding purpose in dire circumstances and a hilarious dark comedy about caring for the elderly — alongside an intimate LGBTQ love story. In our Spotlight Section, we have a new drama from How I Met Your Mother star Jason Segel.New This WeekendNomadland (2021) 94%Chloé Zhao will perhaps be sporting new hardware when Marvel’s long-awaited MCU team-up flick&nbsp;Eternals&nbsp;hits theaters later this year.&nbsp;She has literally swept up every major Best Director prize this season, making her the odds-on favorite for Best Director at the Oscars. After a limited theatrical run, Nomadland will finally debut on Hulu this weekend, giving many a first look at what is arguably the best film of 2020. Led by star Frances McDormand,&nbsp;Nomadland follows an aging widow who, due to the 2008 recession, is forced to live in her van as a nomad, like many aging Americans&nbsp;who faced the horrific financial crisis. The film is “achingly beautiful and sad, a profound work of empathy from Zhao. It’s a true elegy, a lament for the dead, a yearning for the lost,” according to Alissa Wilkinson of Vox.Streaming now on Hulu.&nbsp;I Care a Lot (2021) 78%Rosamund Pike shocked many —&nbsp;but not us&nbsp;— when she snagged a Golden Globe nomination for her hilarious and dark turn in I Care a Lot. Debuting on Netflix today, the film will be appointment viewing for anyone looking for a wicked laugh this weekend. Playing a sinister care agent who cons elderly people and drains their finances under the guise of helping out, Pike is incredibly captivating. Courtesy of writer-director J Blakeson, the film has more layers than you gather at first blush and “takes Blakeson’s morally complex script and adds a whole new layer – daring us to hold up this despicable character as some twisted vision of female empowerment,” according to&nbsp;Clarisse Loughrey of&nbsp;The Independent (UK).Streaming now on Netflix.Supernova (2021) 88%In between&nbsp;giving us the perfect way to make classic cocktails on Instagram and guiding folks through the wonders of Tuscany for his new travel show on CNN, Stanley Tucci&nbsp;does still find the time to act. This week he’s back on the Indie Fresh List reminding us why he is one of the most underappreciated actors of our generation. In Supernova, he and Colin Firth play a long-term couple that is faced with the grim reality of early-onset&nbsp;Alzheimer’s. Tucci’s character knows the disease is gaining&nbsp;on him as&nbsp;the pair embark on a road trip to see friends and have one last adventure. “The chemistry between Firth and Tucci is so natural and lived in that it’s impossible to say which of the two is better. It’s practically a tandem performance,” writes&nbsp;Andrew Parker of The Gate.In theaters and available on VOD now.Spotlight PickOur Friend (2020) 85%Since his incredible performance as&nbsp;David Foster Wallace in the End of the Tour, Jason Segel has been on a consistent indie drama track. This week for our Spotlight Pick, we have his latest, a family drama about the extents we go to for the ones we love.&nbsp;Our Friend chronicles the true-life tale of the Teague Family&nbsp;and how their lives were upended by the matriarch’s&nbsp;heartbreaking diagnosis of terminal cancer. The couple’s best friend Dane (Segel) offers to come and help out, putting his life on hold, and&nbsp;in doing so has a profound revelation that irrevocably changes him. “A beautiful portrait of embodied, relational love in action. It’s a film about being there for each other in the most literal, incarnate sense. No screens, no filters,” writes Brett McCracken of The Gospel Coalition.Availible on VOD now.Along with… 92% Another Round (Druk) (2020) , starring Mads Mikkelsen in Thomas Vinterberg’s dramatic comedy about four teachers who decide to drink at work. 92% Baby, Done (2021) , a comedy about a couple who go on a baby bucket list after finding out they’re pregnant.&nbsp; 97% Billie (2020) , a documentary biopic on famed jazz singer Billie Holiday. 89% Black Bear (2020) , about a writer struggling to find story who heads to a remote cabin to meet married friends and make potentially inspirational mischief between the couple. 90% The Climb (2020) , a comedy about a pair of best friends whose relationship is tested when one of them gets involved with a woman. 91% The Dark and the Wicked (2020) , a horror film about a pair of siblings who discover something sinister when they return to their childhood home to care for their dying father. 89% Dear Santa (2020) , a documentary about the long tradition of the United States Postal Service’s Dear Santa program. 79% I Am Greta (2020) , a powerful documentary on climate activist Greta Thunberg. 68% Kindred (2020) , a thriller about a young pregnant woman who suspects the family&nbsp;caring for her has&nbsp;nefarious intentions for her unborn child.&nbsp; 70% Land (2021) , a drama about a woman&nbsp;in search of her&nbsp;true self as she treks across the American Midwest. 91% Little Fish (2021) , a sci-fi romance centering on a new memory disease that wrecks the idyllic love story of a young couple. 77% The Map of Tiny Perfect Things (2021) , a time loop comedy about two people stuck in the same day. 99% MLK/FBI (2021) , a documentary about the U.S. government’s attempts to surveil and discredit Martin Luther King, Jr.&nbsp; 98% One Night in Miami (2020) , Regina King’s directorial debut about a fictionalized evening spent together in a hotel room by Cassius Clay, Sam Cooke, Malcolm X, and Jim Brown.&nbsp; 75% Pieces of a Woman (2020) , a drama about a woman trying to put her life back together after a tragedy. 90% Promising Young Woman (2020) ,&nbsp;starring Carey Mulligan in a darkly comic drama about a med school dropout who spends her evenings bringing a form of justice to would-be sexual predators. 96% The Reason I Jump (2021) , a documentary following five young people diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder.Thumbnail image by Fox SearchlightOn an Apple device?

So if you’re wondering why your favorite show or TV movie isn’t on here, it likely just doesn’t yet have enough reviews to qualify under our criteria. And remember: a Certified Fresh badge generally means that a show or film has earned the respect of the majority of reviewers weighing in (at least 20 for a TV season and 40 for movies on TV and streaming), including some of the industry’s top critics.\nThe series included have premiered since September 22, so if you want to see a title like the second season of Amazon Prime Video’s The Boys, have a look at how it did on our Spring-Summer TV Scorecard, which tracked TV series and movies that premiered between March 20 and September 21.\nSince 2020 was a rather unique year, there are definitely more streaming films included in this list than in years past. But&nbsp;unsurprisingly, TV shows that wound up on top include the well-reviewed sensation The Queen’s Gambit, HBO Max whodunnit The Flight Attendant (which started as a limited series but has been renewed for a second season), and the fourth season of The Crown. The lack of broadcast series on this list is unquestionably due to pandemic-related production pauses, in case you were wondering about the network representation.\nUltimately, seven different series and films wound up at the top of the list with Tomatometer scores of 100, while a dozen more rounded out the top of the pack with scores of 97, 98 or 99.&nbsp;Read on for the&nbsp;full&nbsp;list of Fall TV shows and movies that premiered through December 20.\n\n        \n            #124\n            \n              \n                  \n              \n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                          Books of Blood (2020)  22%\n                        \n                    \n                    \n                        #124\n                    \n                \n                \n                    \n                        Adjusted Score: 22.264% \n                        Critics Consensus: No consensus yet.\n                        Synopsis: Based on Clive Barker's acclaimed and influential horror anthology, Books of Blood takes audiences on a journey into uncharted and...

Nelson), some of Hollywood’s funniest fellows trying to touch one another without permission (Tag, starring&nbsp;Ed Helms,&nbsp;Jeremy Renner, and Jon Hamm), and a remade blast from the blaxploitation past (Superfly, starring Trevor Jackson&nbsp;and Jason Mitchell).&nbsp;What are the critics saying?Incredibles 2 (2018)  93%If you’re going to try and follow up an acclaimed blockbuster, you might as well take your time getting the sequel right — and in animation, where time can stand still forever, you have the added benefit of not needing to rush your cast back in front of the camera. Still, after waiting nearly 15 years for a second installment of The Incredibles, fans can be forgiven a certain amount of impatience; while the creative teams at formerly franchise-averse Pixar dreamed up new stories for the characters in Toy Story, Cars, Finding Nemo, and Monsters Inc., the ability to return to theaters continued to elude the superpowered Parr family. All that waiting has finally paid off with Incredibles 2, which reunites the original voice cast for a new adventure serving up more of the domestic turmoil, superhero satire, and brilliantly animated action that made the first one such a hit. It’d be tough to improve on the original Incredibles, and critics say that while this sequel doesn’t quite pull off that feat, it comes impressively close, adding yet another acclaimed entry to Pixar’s already estimable filmography. If you were a kid when The Incredibles&nbsp;came out, you might have kids of your own now — and like all the best stuff the studio has put out, the whole family can look forward to enjoying Incredibles 2.Tag (2018)  56%On one hand, it’s easy to believe Hollywood has long since exhausted most of the reasonable possibilities for comedy that exist in movies about grown men acting like boys. On the other, when you’ve got the Wall Street Journal writing about a real-life group of guys who take a month off every year to continue the game of tag they’ve been playing since they were kids, well, it’s awfully hard to resist the temptation to turn that into a film. Enter the descriptively titled Tag, starring Hannibal Buress, Jon Hamm, Ed Helms, Jake Johnson, and Jeremy Renner as the fellows in question — a talented bunch whose commitment to the story was reflected in the set injury Renner sustained, breaking both of his arms and necessitating some last-minute CGI limb replacements in post-production. It would be wonderful to report that Renner’s suffering came in service of one of the year’s best-reviewed action comedies; alas, the truth is that critics are kinda meh on Tag, which reviews describe as funny and engaging in fits and starts, but ultimately not consistent or committed enough to fully deliver on its premise. Still, this is one talented cast, and even the critical pans say the movie isn’t without its moments, so if you’re in the mood for some arrested development laughs, you may want to check your local listings.Superfly (2018)  51%Released in 1972, the original Superfly&nbsp;helped lead the blaxploitation wave with a thoughtful Harlem-set drama about a drug dealer looking for one last big score; the movie’s trappings may look somewhat dated today, but thanks to Ron O’Neal‘s performance as main character Youngblood Priest — not to mention a killer Curtis Mayfield soundtrack — it still feels fresh. It’s easy to understand why music video veteran Director X wanted to take a shot at updating the story, and its themes are just as relevant as they were more than 45 years ago; unfortunately, critics say those themes have mostly been lost in this new version, which is far more focused on style than substance. Starring Trevor Jackson as Priest, the 2018 edition moves the action to Atlanta, but the basic contours of the story remain the same — which is part of why a number of reviews have outlined pundits’ disappointment with the lost social subtext. This Superfly&nbsp;will make its fortune by and by, thanks to Director X’s way with an artfully arranged scene or set piece, but as is so often the case with remakes, the original still reigns supreme.What’s New on TVThe Bold Type: Season 2 (2018)  100%The Bold Type presents an aspirational yet refreshingly realistic portrait of young women’s careers, friendships and love lives in a big city.Strange Angel: Season 1 (2018)  71%A beautiful slow burn, Strange Angel shoots for the stars, but gets a little lost in its own orbit.Also&nbsp;Opening This Week In Limited Release Eating Animals (2018) , a documentary about the commercial factory farming industry and its various impacts, is at 100%.

But indeed, Foxx the multi-hyphenate&nbsp;found time to debut as a comedy movie lead for The Truth About Cats &amp; Dogs in 1996 and then delivered his first dramatic performance in Oliver Stone’s Any Given Sunday&nbsp;three years later. But that was all a prelude to his big 2004, when Foxx was nominated for the Best Supporting Actor Academy Award&nbsp;with the Michael Mann/Tom Cruise thriller Collateral&nbsp;and took&nbsp;home Oscar gold that&nbsp;night for Best Actor, thanks to the musical biopic Ray.\nHe teamed up with Mann again for Miami Vice in 2006, the same year of musical sensation Dreamgirls‘ arrival. Due Date, Valentine’s Day, Rio, and Horrible Bosses were four $100 million-grossing box office hits in a row, so with his reputation as a guy who can get awards and put butts in seats cemented, there was only one place to go left: Casa de QT. Working with Quentin Tarantino produced the brassy Western Django Unchained, which would go on to become the director’s biggest B.O. draw.\nDjango would be Foxx’s last Certified Fresh movie for a while, through a stretch of years that has included The Amazing Spider-Man 2, Robin Hood, and White House Down. 2017’s Baby Driver brought back some of that critical acclaim, and so has his latest: Just Mercy, a true story legal drama featuring Foxx as Walter McMillian, who was imprisoned for a murder in 1986 he did not commit. Co-starring Michael B. Jordan and Brie Larson, see where the critics place Just Mercy as we rank all Jamie Foxx movies by Tomatometer!\n\n        \n            #33\n            \n              \n                  \n              \n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                          Stealth (2005)  12%\n                        \n                    \n                    \n                        #33\n                    \n                \n                \n                    \n                        Adjusted Score: 16.444% \n                        Critics Consensus: Loud, preposterous, and predictable, Stealth borrows heavily and unsucessfully from Top Gun and 2001.\n                        Synopsis: A squadron of elite pilots embarks on a mission of global consequence to neutralize and out-of-control prototype drone fighter plane...

Nelson), some of Hollywood’s funniest fellows trying to touch one another without permission (Tag, starring&nbsp;Ed Helms,&nbsp;Jeremy Renner, and Jon Hamm), and a remade blast from the blaxploitation past (Superfly, starring Trevor Jackson&nbsp;and Jason Mitchell).&nbsp;What are the critics saying?Incredibles 2 (2018)  93%If you’re going to try and follow up an acclaimed blockbuster, you might as well take your time getting the sequel right — and in animation, where time can stand still forever, you have the added benefit of not needing to rush your cast back in front of the camera. Still, after waiting nearly 15 years for a second installment of The Incredibles, fans can be forgiven a certain amount of impatience; while the creative teams at formerly franchise-averse Pixar dreamed up new stories for the characters in Toy Story, Cars, Finding Nemo, and Monsters Inc., the ability to return to theaters continued to elude the superpowered Parr family. All that waiting has finally paid off with Incredibles 2, which reunites the original voice cast for a new adventure serving up more of the domestic turmoil, superhero satire, and brilliantly animated action that made the first one such a hit. It’d be tough to improve on the original Incredibles, and critics say that while this sequel doesn’t quite pull off that feat, it comes impressively close, adding yet another acclaimed entry to Pixar’s already estimable filmography. If you were a kid when The Incredibles&nbsp;came out, you might have kids of your own now — and like all the best stuff the studio has put out, the whole family can look forward to enjoying Incredibles 2.Tag (2018)  56%On one hand, it’s easy to believe Hollywood has long since exhausted most of the reasonable possibilities for comedy that exist in movies about grown men acting like boys. On the other, when you’ve got the Wall Street Journal writing about a real-life group of guys who take a month off every year to continue the game of tag they’ve been playing since they were kids, well, it’s awfully hard to resist the temptation to turn that into a film. Enter the descriptively titled Tag, starring Hannibal Buress, Jon Hamm, Ed Helms, Jake Johnson, and Jeremy Renner as the fellows in question — a talented bunch whose commitment to the story was reflected in the set injury Renner sustained, breaking both of his arms and necessitating some last-minute CGI limb replacements in post-production. It would be wonderful to report that Renner’s suffering came in service of one of the year’s best-reviewed action comedies; alas, the truth is that critics are kinda meh on Tag, which reviews describe as funny and engaging in fits and starts, but ultimately not consistent or committed enough to fully deliver on its premise. Still, this is one talented cast, and even the critical pans say the movie isn’t without its moments, so if you’re in the mood for some arrested development laughs, you may want to check your local listings.Superfly (2018)  51%Released in 1972, the original Superfly&nbsp;helped lead the blaxploitation wave with a thoughtful Harlem-set drama about a drug dealer looking for one last big score; the movie’s trappings may look somewhat dated today, but thanks to Ron O’Neal‘s performance as main character Youngblood Priest — not to mention a killer Curtis Mayfield soundtrack — it still feels fresh. It’s easy to understand why music video veteran Director X wanted to take a shot at updating the story, and its themes are just as relevant as they were more than 45 years ago; unfortunately, critics say those themes have mostly been lost in this new version, which is far more focused on style than substance. Starring Trevor Jackson as Priest, the 2018 edition moves the action to Atlanta, but the basic contours of the story remain the same — which is part of why a number of reviews have outlined pundits’ disappointment with the lost social subtext. This Superfly&nbsp;will make its fortune by and by, thanks to Director X’s way with an artfully arranged scene or set piece, but as is so often the case with remakes, the original still reigns supreme.What’s New on TVThe Bold Type: Season 2 (2018)  100%The Bold Type presents an aspirational yet refreshingly realistic portrait of young women’s careers, friendships and love lives in a big city.Strange Angel: Season 1 (2018)  71%A beautiful slow burn, Strange Angel shoots for the stars, but gets a little lost in its own orbit.Also&nbsp;Opening This Week In Limited Release Eating Animals (2018) , a documentary about the commercial factory farming industry and its various impacts, is at 100%.

After a bombshell interview with the Royal family this weekend, today at 6am the British Academy of Film Television and Arts (BAFTA) released the nominations for its 2021 Film Awards,&nbsp;bucking convention and selecting a new exciting mix of diverse cinema.After years of all-white or mostly white nominees in several categories, the BAFTAs recently overhauled their membership, eligibility, and voting guidelines.&nbsp;No longer would nominations be solely determined by the voting body, but rather members would vote to create the “long list” of films that garnered the most votes and then a jury selected by BAFTA for each category would select the top five or six nominees.So it is that just seven months after #BAFTASoWhite trended on Twitter and Best Actor winner Joaquin Phoenix called the organization out at the ceremony, this morning saw&nbsp;a record 50 different films nominated. Films by&nbsp;women directors Chloé Zhao&nbsp;(Nomadland) and&nbsp;Sarah Gavron (Rocks) led all nominations, with seven each, and after years of all-male noms, this year’s directing category consisted of four women and two people of color. Even the 100% Fresh indie horror favorite His House pulled through to snag the nominations.Read on for the full list 2021 EE British Academy Film Awards nominees.Best Film 98% The Father (2021) 75% The Mauritanian (2021) 94% Nomadland (2021) 90% Promising Young Woman (2020) 89% The Trial of the Chicago 7 (2020)Best ActressBukky Bakray,&nbsp;RocksRadha Blank,&nbsp;The Forty-Year-Old VersionVanessa Kirby,&nbsp;Pieces Of A WomanFrances McDormand,&nbsp;NomadlandWunmi Mosaku,&nbsp;His HouseAlfre Woodard,&nbsp;ClemencyLeading ActorRiz Ahmed,&nbsp;Sound Of MetalChadwick Boseman,&nbsp;Ma Rainey’s Black BottomAdarsh Gourav,&nbsp;The White TigerAnthony Hopkins,&nbsp;The FatherMads Mikkelsen,&nbsp;Another RoundTahar Rahim,&nbsp;The MauritanianSupporting ActressNiamh Algar,&nbsp;Calm With HorsesKosar Ali,&nbsp;RocksMaria Bakalova,&nbsp;Borat Subsequent MoviefilmDominique Fishback,&nbsp;Judas And The Black MessiahAshley Madekwe,&nbsp;County LinesYuh-Jung Youn,&nbsp;MinariSupporting ActorDaniel Kaluuya,&nbsp;Judas And The Black MessiahBarry Keoghan,&nbsp;Calm With HorsesAlan Kim,&nbsp;MinariLeslie Odom Jr.,&nbsp;One Night In Miami…Clarke Peters,&nbsp;Da 5 BloodsPaul Raci,&nbsp;Sound Of MetalRising StarBukky BakrayConrad KhanKingsley Ben-AdirMorfydd ClarkSope DirisuBest British Film 94% Calm with Horses (The Shadow of Violence) (2020) 87% The Dig (2021) 98% The Father (2021) 100% His House (2020) 92% Limbo (2021) 75% The Mauritanian (2021) 96% Mogul Mowgli (2020) 90% Promising Young Woman (2020) 97% Rocks (2020) 93% Saint Maud (2020)Outstanding Debut by British Writer, Producer, or Director 100% His House (2020)Remi Weekes (Writer/Director) 92% Limbo (2021)Ben Sharrock (Writer/Director), Irune Gurtubai (Producer) 90% Moffie (2019)Jack Sidey (Writer/Producer) 97% Rocks (2020)Theresa Ikoko, Claire Wilson (Writers) 93% Saint Maud (2020)Rose Glass (Writer/Director), Oliver Kassman (Producer)Film Not In The English LanguageAnother RoundDear Comrades!Les MisérablesMinariQuo Vadis, Aida?DocumentaryCollectiveDavid Attenborough: A Life On Our PlanetThe DissidentMy Octopus TeacherThe Social DilemmaAnimated FilmOnwardSoulWolfwalkersDirectorAnother Round –&nbsp;Thomas VinterbergBabyteeth –&nbsp;Shannon MurphyMinari –&nbsp;Lee Isaac ChungNomadland –&nbsp;Chloé ZhaoQuo Vadis, Aida? –&nbsp;Jasmila ZbanicRocks –&nbsp;Sarah GavronOriginal ScreenplayAnother RoundMankPromising Young WomanRocks, Theresa IkokoThe Trial Of The Chicago 7Adapted ScreenplayThe DigThe FatherThe MauritanianNomadlandThe White TigerOriginal ScoreMankMinariNews Of The WorldPromising Young WomanSoulCastingCalm With HorsesJudas And The Black MessiahMinariPromising Young WomanRocksCinematographyJudas And The Black MessiahMankThe MauritanianNews Of The WorldNomadlandEditingThe FatherNomadlandPromising Young WomanSound Of MetalThe Trial Of The Chicago 7Production DesignThe DigThe FatherMankNews Of The WorldRebeccaCostume DesignAmmoniteThe DigEmmaMa Rainey’s Black BottomMankMakeup &amp; HairThe DigHillbilly ElegyMa Rainey’s Black BottomMankPinocchioSoundGreyhound, TbcNews Of The WorldNomadlandSoul, Coya ElliottSound Of MetalSpecial Visual EffectsGreyhoundThe Midnight SkyMulanThe One And Only IvanTenetBritish Short AnimationThe Fire Next Time, Renaldho Pelle, Yanling Wang, Kerry Jade KolbeThe Owl And The Pussycat, Mole Hill, Laura DuncalfThe Song Of A Lost Boy, Daniel Quirke, Jamie Macdonald, Brid ArnsteinThe 2021 EE British Academy Film Awards will take place on&nbsp;April 11, 2021 with a precursor show on the 10th for all the crafts and below-the-line categories.&nbsp;On an Apple device?

The releases slated for 2021 are so exciting they’ll make you salivate with anticipation, and we can’t wait to see them – especially now that it looks like we can see them. For starters we’ll be getting another Asian blockbuster in director Destin Daniel Cretton’s Marvel entry,&nbsp;Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings. The Fast Family will be back for another action-packed installment of the&nbsp;Fast and the Furious franchise (can you believe we’re at 9 movies already?!). Venom: Let There Be Carnage arrives, as do horror sequels A Quiet Place 2 and Halloween Kills, and quasi-sequel Candyman. One big change in 2021: The way we watch the movies is changing big time. Warner Bros., for example, has announced that they will release their&nbsp;entire slate of 2021 movies on HBO Max as well as in theaters in an unprecedented move that could signal bigger changes in the industry.&nbsp;The list is long and it’ll probably get longer, so start marking your calendars now.&nbsp;[Updated 6/18/2021]Jan-Mar | Apr-June | July-Sep | Oct-DecThe Best Movies of 2020&nbsp;| The Most Anticipated Movies of 2022JanuaryThe Dig (2021)  87%Directed by:&nbsp;Simon StoneStarring:&nbsp;Carey Mulligan, Ralph Fiennes, Lily James, Johnny Flynn, Ben ChaplinOpening on:&nbsp;January 15, 2021 (limited), followed by Netflix premiere on January 29, 2021Ralph Fiennes and Carey Mulligan star in this Netflix original film based on true events and set in 1939.

Jackson, Max Minghella, Marisol NicholsOpening on:&nbsp;May 14, 2021 (formerly May 21, 2021)The&nbsp;Saw&nbsp;franchise officially gets revived in this new thriller, with Darren Lynn Bousman (Saw II,&nbsp;III, and&nbsp;IV) back behind the camera. This time, two cops played by Chris Rock and Samuel L. Jackson investigate a series of gruesome murders and find themselves at the mercy of a killer reminiscent of the past (Jigsaw copycat, anyone?).The Woman in the Window (2021)  26%Directed by:&nbsp;Joe WrightStarring:&nbsp;Amy Adams, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Gary Oldman, Julianne Moore, Anthony Mackie, Brian Tyree HenryOpening on:&nbsp;May 14, 2021 (formerly May 15, 2020)In Joe Wright’s adaptation of the novel of the same name that takes the premise of&nbsp;Rear Window&nbsp;to new places,&nbsp;Amy Adams stars as child psychologist Anna Fox, an agoraphobic woman who develops a friendship with a neighbor who lives in the building across the street (played by Julianne Moore), only to witness her friend being murdered by her husband. Except, maybe that’s not actually what happened, and maybe Anna’s medication is playing tricks on her mind.Army Of The Dead (2021)  68%Directed by:&nbsp;Zack SnyderStarring:&nbsp;Dave Bautista, Ella Purnell, Omari Hardwick, Ana De La Reguera, Theo RossiOpening on: May 21, 2021 on NetflixBefore he set about rejiggering&nbsp;Justice League for HBO Max, Zack Snyder returned to his undead roots to helm this zombie thriller about a group of mercenaries who&nbsp;head into the heart of Las Vegas after a zombie outbreak in order to pull off a daring casino heist.Cruella (2021)  74%Directed by: Alex Timbers and Craig GillespieStarring: Emma Stone, Joel Fry, Kirby Howell-Baptiste, Paul Walter Hauser, Emma ThompsonOpening on: May 28, 2021 with Premier Access on Disney+Emma Stone will star in Disney’s latest live-action remake of an old classic. In the vein of Maleficient, Cruella will focus on the enigmatic villain of 101 Dalmatians in her youth and show how she became obsessed with Dalmatian fur. With Emma Thompson and Mark Strong rounding out the cast, it’s bound to be worth the wait.A Quiet Place Part II (2021)  91%Directed by:&nbsp;John KrasinskiStarring:&nbsp;Emily Blunt, Noah Jupe,&nbsp;Millicent Simmonds, Cillian Murphy, Djimon HounsouOpening on:&nbsp;May 28, 2021 (formerly September 17, 2021)Director John Krasinski&nbsp;returns to helm this sequel, which he also wrote, starring his real-life wife Emily Blunt, as it follows up with the Abbott family after the events of the first film. Judging from the first trailer, we’ll also get some flashbacks to the beginning of the… invasion? Infestation? Whatever you want to call it, it looks like Krasinski has done a bang-up job ratcheting up the tension, and audiences should be in for another great ride.JuneThe Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It (2021)  56%Directed by:&nbsp;Michael ChavesStarring:&nbsp;Vera Farmiga, Patrick Wilson,&nbsp;Ruairi O’Connor, Sarah Catherine Hook, Julian HilliardOpening on:&nbsp;June 4, 2021, with simultaneous release on HBO MaxPatrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga return to reprise their roles as real-life paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren in this third chapter of the original&nbsp;Conjuring&nbsp;franchise, focusing on a real case they investigated in which a murder suspect invoked demonic possession as a defense for his crimes. Michael Chaves, who directed 2019’s&nbsp;Conjuring-adjacent spinoff&nbsp;The Curse of La Llorona, takes the reins as director, while James Wan remains attached to the film as a producers.In the Heights (2021)  96%Directed by:&nbsp;Jon M. ChuStarring:&nbsp;Anthony Ramos, Leslie Grace, Corey Hawkins, Jimmy Smits, Stephanie Beatriz, Dascha PolancoOpening on:&nbsp;June 11, 2021, with simultaneous release on HBO MaxCrazy Rich Asians&nbsp;director&nbsp;Jon M. Chu adapts Lin-Manuel Miranda’s breakout musical,&nbsp;In the Heights.&nbsp;The show, which kicked off the&nbsp;Hamilton&nbsp;creator’s career, won four Tony Awards in 2008, including Best Musical and Best Original Score. Chu demonstrated real skill with spectacle in&nbsp;Crazy Rich Asians, and the new movie shares similar themes of reclaiming one’s heritage – it follows the stories of several characters in New York’s heavily Latino neighborhood, Washington Heights, over three days.Peter Rabbit 2: The Runaway (2021)  67%Directed by:&nbsp;Will GluckStarring:&nbsp;James Corden, Rose Byrne, Domhnall Gleeson, David Oyelowo, Elizabeth DebickiOpening on:&nbsp;June 11, 2021 (formerly July 2, 2021)First the garden, then the world. The plot for this sequel to the surprise hit loosely based on the work of Beatrix Potter is still under lock and key, but we’re sure it will involve James Corden’s cheeky rabbit causing all sorts of PG-rated trouble. We do not expect&nbsp;any blackberries to be involved, however.The Hitman's Wife's Bodyguard (2021)  25%Directed by:&nbsp;Patrick HughesStarring:&nbsp;Ryan Reynolds, Samuel L. Jackson, Salma Hayek, Richard E. Grant, Morgan Freeman, Antonio Banderas, Frank GrilloOpening on: June 16, 2021 (formerly August 20, 2021)2017’s&nbsp;The Hitman’s Bodyguard&nbsp;didn’t exactly wow the critics, but it was a moderate hit at the box office, so why not give it another go? As indicated by the title, it’s Salma Hayek’s Sonia who now&nbsp;enlists the help of&nbsp;Michael (Ryan Reynolds) in order to rescue her husband — and Michael’s old rival — Darius (Samuel L. Jackson).Luca (2021)  89%Directed by: Enrico CasarosaStarring:&nbsp;Jacob Tremblay, Maya Rudolph, Jack Dylan Grazer, Jim GaffiganOpening on:&nbsp;June 18, 2021 on Disney+The latest offering from Pixar (after 2020’s&nbsp;Soul) will be a deeply personal coming-of-age tale with a twist from director Enrico Casarosa. The story will focus on the title character, a sea monster who lives off the coast of the Italian Riviera who strikes up a friendship with another sea monster; together they discover that they take human form when dry and decide to visit the nearby seaside town for an adventure.F9 (2021)  65%Directed by:&nbsp;Justin LinStarring:&nbsp;Vin Diesel, Charlize Theron, Tyrese Gibson, John Cena, Michelle Rodriguez, Ludacris,&nbsp;Lucas BlackOpening on:&nbsp;June 25, 2021 (formerly May 28, 2021)It’s full-throttle and pedal to the metal for the Toretto crime/adventure/anti-terrorism/what-even-are-they family yet again. Director Justin Lin was the man to turn the franchise around, delivering the series’ first Fresh entry on his third try with 2011’s&nbsp;Fast Five&nbsp;(Certified Fresh at 73%); since then, every&nbsp;Fast&nbsp;movie has landed on the red end of the Tomatometer.&nbsp;The new entry will bring the family back together to face off against a new villain played by John Cena… who happens to be Dom Toretto’s brother. Also, Han is back? What? The film was originally slated to open in May of 2020, but was pushed back almost a year to occupy the slot that had originally been reserved for&nbsp;Fast &amp; Furious 10.Zola (2021)  89%Directed by:&nbsp;Janicza BravoStarring:&nbsp;Taylour Paige, Riley KeoughOpening on:&nbsp;June 30, 2021Based on a notoriously stranger-than-fiction series of viral tweets (and a subsequent&nbsp;Rolling Stone article)&nbsp;from 2015, this adventure comedy follows a Detroit waitress who embarked on a&nbsp;road trip to Florida with a stripper and ended up spending the craziest two days of her life with her.JulyThe Boss Baby: Family Business (2021) Directed by:&nbsp;Tom McGrathStarring:&nbsp;Alec Baldwin, Amy Sedaris, Lisa Kudrow, James Marsden, Jeff Goldblum, Jimmy Kimmel, Eva LongoriaOpening on:&nbsp;July 2, 2021 (formerly September 17, 2021) in theaters and streaming on PeacockThe Boss Baby&nbsp;might be Rotten, but its monster box office take shows the audience is hungry for more. This time, though, the story takes place years after the first film, when the original Boss Baby Ted — voiced by Alec Baldwin — and his older brother Tim have both grown up. Tim now has a smarty-pants infant of his own (Amy Sedaris), who embarks on a secret mission involving her big sister.The Forever Purge (2021) Directed by:&nbsp;Everardo GoutStarring:&nbsp;Ana de la Reguera, Josh Lucas, Tenoch Huerta, Will PattonOpening on:&nbsp;July 2, 2021Set after 2016’s&nbsp;Purge: Election Year, in which the Purge was officially abolished,&nbsp;this next chapter in the&nbsp;franchise goes smaller than its predecessors.&nbsp;Forever&nbsp;follows&nbsp;a Mexican couple who become stranded on a ranch&nbsp;and besieged by strangers who miss the good ol’ days of lawless anarchy.Black Widow (2021) Directed by:&nbsp;Cate ShortlandStarring:&nbsp;Scarlett Johansson, Florence Pugh, David Harbour, Rachel WeiszOpening on: July 9, 2021 (formerly November 6, 2020) with Premier Access on Disney+The first Marvel property to kick off its Phase 4 (on the big screen, at least) will be this prequel focusing on Scarlett Johansson’s Natasha Romanoff. The story takes place after the events of Captain America: Civil War and follows Natasha as she deals with dangerous people from her past as a double agent.&nbsp;David Harbour, Rachel Weisz, and Florence Pugh&nbsp;co-star, and who knows? Maybe Jeremy Renner’s Hawkeye will make an appearance.Escape Room: Tournament of Champions (2021) Directed by:&nbsp;Adam RobitelStarring:&nbsp;Taylor Russell, Logan Miller, Isabelle Fuhrman, Holland RodenOpening on:&nbsp;July 16, 2021 (formerly January 7, 2022)Taylor Russell and Logan Miller return to reprise their roles from the first&nbsp;Escape Room, a&nbsp;Saw-inspired horror-thriller that&nbsp;became something of a surprise hit when it premiered in January of 2019. Though we don’t know exactly what the second film will be about, the first one ended on a pretty suggestive cliffhanger, so we can expect Ben (Miller) and Zoey (Russell) to take part in a new round of deadly games. Originally slated to debut in 2020, and then in 2021, the film was ultimately pushed even further back to 2022.Space Jam: A New Legacy (2021) Directed by: Malcolm D. LeeStarring: LeBron James, Don Cheadle, Cedric Joe, Sonequa Martin-GreenOpening on: July 16, 2021, with simultaneous release on HBO MaxSpeaking of old stories for new audiences, LeBron James‘ long-awaited Space Jam sequel will finally arrive in 2021. In this updated take on the original, Bron and his son (Cedric Joe) are transported to a digital world by an evil AI (voiced by&nbsp;Don Cheadle), who forces the basketball icon to team up with the Looney Toons and play a game of hoops against his digital Goon Squad.Old (2021) Directed by:&nbsp;M. Night ShyamalanStarring: Gael García Bernal, Eliza Scanlen, Thomasin McKenzie, Alex WolffOpening on:&nbsp;July 23, 2021 (formerly February 26, 2021)M. Night Shyamalan‘s newest project seems like a fairly straightforward idea, so it’ll be interesting to see where he takes it. In&nbsp;Old, a family on vacation discovers that the isolated beach&nbsp;where they’re relaxing is causing them to age rapidly. This is the first of two films the horror auteur is slated to direct for Universal in the coming years.Snake Eyes (2021) Directed by:&nbsp;Robert SchwentkeStarring:&nbsp;Henry Golding, Samara Weaving, Iko UwaisOpening on:&nbsp;July 23, 2021 (formerly October 22, 2021)This is reportedly&nbsp;an origin story (or maybe not?) for&nbsp;Snake Eyes,&nbsp;the mute ninja/commando previously portrayed by Ray Park in the live-action&nbsp;G.I. Joe&nbsp;film franchise. Snake Eyes’ past has always been shrouded in mystery, save for the fact that he was once close friends with enemy ninja Storm Shadow and the fact that an explosion not only severely disfigured his face but also fried his vocal cords. In other words, it makes sense that this will&nbsp;be a prequel, especially since they’ve hired Henry Golding to play the role.The Green Knight (2021) Director:&nbsp;David LoweryStarring:&nbsp;Dev Patel, Alicia Vikander, Joel Edgerton, Sean Harris, Barry Keoghan, Sarita ChoudhuryOpening on:&nbsp;July 30, 2021Based on the 14th century Arthurian poem&nbsp;Sir Gawain and the Green Knight, this medieval fantasy adventure written and directed by David Lowery (Ain’t Them Bodies Saints,&nbsp;The Old Man &amp; the Gun) appears to be splashed with a touch of horror, at least judging from the cryptic trailer. It was originally slated for a 2020 release before it moved to 2021 due to COVID-19 restrictions.Jungle Cruise (2021) Director:&nbsp;Jaume Collet-SerraStarring:&nbsp;Dwayne Johnson, Emily Blunt, Édgar Ramírez, Jack Whitehall, Jesse Plemons, Paul GiamattiOpening on:&nbsp;July 30, 2021Following the path that&nbsp;Pirates of the Caribbean&nbsp;charted so successfully, this new film (franchise?) is based on the Disney theme park attraction of the same name. Dwayne Johnson and Emily Blunt star, respectively, as a riverboat captain and a scientist on a hunt for a magical cure in this Depression-era action adventure. Comedian Jack Whitehall also joins in the fun, playing Blunt’s character’s brother. Collet-Serra has had a string of action-thriller hits working with Liam Neeson (Commuter,&nbsp;Non-Stop,&nbsp;Unknown), so there’s a chance this one could be slightly darker than anticipated.Stillwater (2021) Directed by:&nbsp;Tom McCarthyStarring:&nbsp;Matt Damon, Abigail Breslin, Camille CottinOpening on:&nbsp;July 30, 2021&nbsp;(formerly November&nbsp;6, 2020)Matt Damon stars in this thriller about an Oklahoma oil-rig worker who travels to Marseille, France to unravel a mystery and clear his daughter’s name when when&nbsp;she is imprisoned for a crime she says she didn’t commit. The film co-stars Abigail Breslin and is directed and co-written by Tom McCarthy, who won a pair of Oscars for 2015’s&nbsp;Spotlight, so there’s considerable pedigree behind this project, and there’s no reason not to be optimistic about it.AugustThe Suicide Squad (2021) Directed by: James GunnStarring:&nbsp;Margot Robbie, Viola Davis, Joel Kinnaman, Jai Courtney, John Cena, Peter Capaldi, Sylvester StalloneOpening on: August 6, 2021, with simultaneous release on HBO MaxDirector&nbsp;James Gunn&nbsp;looks to erase the memory of 2016’s&nbsp;Suicide Squad&nbsp;with this soft quasi-reboot.&nbsp;A handful of the cast members from the first film return, while Idris Elba, John Cena, Peter Capaldi, and more join in on the fun, as Amanda Waller sends the Squad to take out a Nazi-era prison in South America.Free Guy (2021) Directed by:&nbsp;Shawn LevyStarring:&nbsp;Ryan Reynolds, Taika Waititi, Jody Comer, Joe Keery, Lel Rel HoweryOpening on:&nbsp;August 13, 2021 (formerly May 21, 2021)Ryan Reynolds brings his sarcastic wit and boyishly good-looking everyman charm to this self-referential, special effects-driven comedy. He stars as Guy, a nondescript bank teller non-player character (NPC) in a violent, open-world video game who suddenly becomes self-aware and decides to take his destiny into his own hands. Expect a lot of ironic, self-referential humor and over-the-top action shenanigans, which, when Ryan Reynolds is involved, is&nbsp;essentially its own genre these days.Respect (2021) Directed by:&nbsp;Liesl TommyStarring:&nbsp;Jennifer Hudson, Forest Whitaker, Marlon Wayans, Marc Maron, Audra McDonald, Mary J. BligeOpening on:&nbsp;August 13, 2021 (formerly January 15, 2021)Jennifer Hudson has some big shoes to fill, as she steps into the role of Aretha Franklin in Liesl Tommy’s biopic of the legendary singer in&nbsp;Respect. It was originally slated for a January release before, like a lot of other films, it was delayed by coronavirus-related shutdowns.Candyman (2021) Directed by:&nbsp;Nia DaCostaStarring:&nbsp;Yahya Abdul-Mateen II, Tony Todd, Teyonah ParrisOpening on:&nbsp;August 27,2021 (formerly October 16, 2020)Longtime fan and contemporary horror maestro Jordan Peele is producing this sequel to — not a remake of — the classic 1992 horror film about the&nbsp;murdered son of a slave whose ghost haunts the Chicago neighborhood where the Cabrini Green housing projects once stood. The update is set after the gentrification of Cabrini Green, as an artist learns about the history of his neighborhood and begins to explore it in his work, unknowingly opening a door he may not be able to close.SeptemberCinderella (2021) Directed by:&nbsp;Kay CannonStarring:&nbsp;Camila Cabello, Billy Porter, Idina MenzelOpening on:&nbsp;September on Amazon Prime (formerly July 16, 2021)If there’s anyone who can do justice to&nbsp;Whitney Houston‘s turn as&nbsp;the Fairy Godmother, it’s none other than Broadway legend and&nbsp;Pose&nbsp;star&nbsp;Billy Porter. Sure, we might not need another Cinderella story, but what could be better than vocal legends like&nbsp;Idina Menzel&nbsp;and newcomers like&nbsp;Camila Cabello&nbsp;bringing a classic story to life?Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings (2021) Directed by:&nbsp;Destin Daniel CrettonStarring:&nbsp;Simu Liu, Tony Leung, AwkwafinaOpening on:&nbsp;September 3, 2021 (formerly July 9, 2021)After bringing the true story of Bryan Stevenson to screen in this year’s&nbsp;Just Mercy,&nbsp;Destin Daniel Cretton&nbsp;will be joining&nbsp;the big leagues for his next project.&nbsp;Shang-Chi&nbsp;will be the Marvel Cinematic Universe’s first Asian-led film.&nbsp;Kim’s Conveince‘s&nbsp;Simu Liu&nbsp;is set to star, and&nbsp;The Farewell’s&nbsp;Awkwafina&nbsp;has also been cast in an unknown role.Reminiscence (2021) Directed by:&nbsp;Lisa JoyStarring:&nbsp;Hugh Jackman, Rebecca Ferguson, Thandie Newton, Daniel Wu, Cliff CurtisOpening on:&nbsp;September 3, 2021,&nbsp;with simultaneous release on HBO MaxHugh Jackman stars in this sci-fi drama&nbsp;set in a flooded, near-future Miami about a man who offers people the chance to relive any memory. As he begins to fall for one of his clients, he discovers she may or may not be involved in a series of violent crimes and dives into her past to learn the truth. This is the feature debut of Lisa Joy, who previously worked on TV series like&nbsp;Pushing Daisies,&nbsp;Burn Notice, and most recently&nbsp;Westworld.The Card Counter (2021) Directed by:&nbsp;Paul SchraderStarring:&nbsp;Oscar Isaac, Tiffany Haddish, Tye Sheridan, Willem DafoeOpening on:&nbsp;September 10, 2021Writer-director Paul Schrader, who recently earned an Oscar nomination for First Reformed, helms this thriller about a man (Oscar Isaac) who reverts back to his old, dangerous ways when he meets a young&nbsp;man (Tye Sheridan) out for revenge on a military colonel (Willem Dafoe).Malignant (2021) Directed by:&nbsp;James WanStarring:&nbsp;Annabelle Wallis, George Young, Jake Abel, McKenna GraceOpening on:&nbsp;September 10, 2021 (formerly August 14, 2020)James Wan’s next project was initially set to debut in 2020, but like many things, it was held back until this year. We don’t know what the film — also written by Wan — is about, except that it’s a horror thriller and it’s decidedly not an adaptation of Wan’s graphic novel&nbsp;Malignant Man.The Eyes of Tammy Faye (2021) Directed by:&nbsp;Michael ShowalterStarring:&nbsp;Jessica Chastain, Andrew Garfield, Vincent D’Onofrio, Cherry Jones, Sam JaegerOpening on:&nbsp;September 17, 2021Director Michael Showalter (The Big Sick)&nbsp;takes a more dramatic turn with this film based on the documentary of the same name that chronicles the rise and fall of televangelists Jim and Tammy Faye Bakker, with Jessica Chastain and Andrew Garfield set to play the infamous couple.Venom: Let There Be Carnage (2021) Directed by:&nbsp;Andy SerkisStarring:&nbsp;Tom Hardy, Michelle Williams, Woody Harrelson, Naomie Harris, Stephen GrahamOpening on:&nbsp;September 24, 2021 (formerly September 17, 2021)Andy Serkis takes the reins for this follow-up to 2018’s Spider-Man-adjacent Sony hit&nbsp;Venom. Tom Hardy returns to reprise his role as journalist Eddie Brock, who entered into a mutually beneficial partnership with the alien symbiote who possessed his body in the first film, and he’ll face off against a new villain in the form of Woody Harrelson’s Carnage, who was teased in the post-credits scene of the first film.The Many Saints of Newark (2021) Directed by:&nbsp;Alan TaylorStarring:&nbsp;Michael Gandolfini, Vera Farmiga, Jon Bernthal, Billy Magnussen, Ray Liotta, Corey&nbsp; Stoll, Alessandro NivolaOpening on:&nbsp;September 24, 2021 (formerly March 12, 2021), with simultaneous release on HBO MaxWhether you feel that the end of&nbsp;The Sopranos&nbsp;— you know, that controversial fade to black — was fitting and poignant or anti-climactic and unsatisfying, you probably jumped at the news that a&nbsp;Sopranos&nbsp;movie was in the works. With the late James Gandolfini no longer around, however, the only way to go was a prequel, and who better to portray a young Tony Soprano than Gandolfini’s son himself, Michael? Alan Taylor directs this look back at the early years of the iconic TV mobster, with Vera Farmiga, Jon Bernthal, and Ray Liotta in supporting roles.OctoberDune (2020) Directed by:&nbsp;Denis VilleneuveStarring:&nbsp;Timothée Chalamet, Josh Brolin, Rebecca Ferguson, Oscar Isaac, Javier Bardem, Jason Momoa, Dave Bautista, ZendayaOpening on:&nbsp;October 1, 2021 (formerly December 18, 2020), with simultaneous release on HBO MaxAcclaimed director Denis Villeneuve takes on the massive challenge of re-adapting Frank Herbert’s sprawling sci-fi epic more than 30 years after&nbsp;David Lynch attempted the same&nbsp;and, according to many fans, fell short.

Jared Leto, who sparked a lot of online chatter with his portrayal of the Joker in 2016’s&nbsp;Suicide Squad, plays the title character. Like&nbsp;F9&nbsp;and&nbsp;Ghostbusters: Afterlife, this film was pushed back from its original 2020 release.No Time To Die (2020) Directed by:&nbsp;Cary FukunagaStarring:&nbsp;Daniel Craig, Ralph Fiennes, Rami Malek, Naomie Harris, Lea Seydoux, Ben Whishaw, Rory Kinnear, Jeffrey Wright, Ana de Armas, Lashana LynchOpening on:&nbsp;October 8, 2021 (formerly April 2, 2021)True Detective&nbsp;director Cary Fukunaga takes the reins for the 25th James Bond film, with Daniel Craig returning for his fifth and (presumably) final turn as 007.

But throw in the fact that he’s assembled a cast that includes up-and-coming young stars like Anya Taylor-Joy and Thomasin McKenzie, as well as legendary vets like Diana Rigg and Terence Stamp?&nbsp;And&nbsp;the fact that it’s a horror film inspired by both&nbsp;Don’t Look Now&nbsp;and&nbsp;Repulsion?

In brief, the Eternals are powerful immortals who helped shape humanity and history on Earth, and the cast includes a lot of big names, from Angelina Jolie and Salma Hayek to Kumail Nanjiani and a couple of&nbsp;Game of Thrones&nbsp;kings, Richard Madden and Kit Harington. Plus, director&nbsp;Chloé Zhao is no slouch herself; she had one of 2018’s best-reviewed films in&nbsp;The Rider.

Will said robot be as lovable as, say, Wilson? Time will tell.

In our spotlight section, we have a documentary that examines the fall of the co-working space WeWork and the cult-like company culture that allowed it to thrive despite clear warning signs.New This WeekendHysterical (2021) 89%Some of the funniest women in comedy join forces to break down the hilarious, heartbreaking, and oftentimes brutal world of comedy, an industry&nbsp;historically dominated by men and fans who take every opportunity to declare “women aren’t funny.” Hysterical (as the name suggests) relies on funny women Fortune Feimster, Margaret Cho, and others to break down the history and future of funny ladies on stage — check out our chat with Sherri Shepherd, who is also featured. More than that, the film also serves as an interesting conduit to discuss hard-hitting&nbsp;subjects including&nbsp;every facet of comedy, sexism, and pop culture. “It’s achingly hilarious at times, these ladies are really funny, but the constant undertone of active, open, traditional sexism smarts,” writes Anne Brodie of What She Said.Streaming now on FX.Concrete Cowboy (2021) 80%Idris Elba and Stranger Things star Caleb McLaughlin star in Concrete Cowboy, a dramatic look at the real-life urban cowboys of Philadelphia nestled in an intimate father-son coming-of-age tale. After his rebellious actions leave his mother at the end of her rope,&nbsp;young teen Cole (McLaughlin) is sent&nbsp;to live with his estranged father for the summer. As he reluctantly tries to adapt to his new surroundings, he finds purpose in the local community of Black cowboys. Featuring a dynamic one-two punch of impressive performances, this “inner-city western featuring Black cowboys in a real-life setting deserves celebrating and the dynamite teamwork of Idris Elba and young Caleb McLaughlin head off the father-son cliches in the script to keep you riveted,”&nbsp;according to Peter Travers of ABC.Streaming now&nbsp;on Netflix.Shiva Baby (2021) 98%Hilarious twists and turns litter every moment of writer-director&nbsp;Emma Seligman’s debut feature Shiva Baby.&nbsp;Set primarily during&nbsp;a Jewish funeral service — or, more appropriately, a Jewish wake (aka Shiva) — the story centers on a college student who&nbsp;struggles to maintain her sanity&nbsp;when she discovers her&nbsp;sugar daddy and her ex-girlfriend are both in attendance.&nbsp;Painfully&nbsp;authentic on family (particularly Jewish American family) dynamics,&nbsp;Shiva Baby&nbsp;will have you laughing at every deadpan delivery and awkward exchange. “A perfectly engineered and performed piece of comic cringe,” writes Helen Shaw of Vulture.Available now&nbsp;on VOD.Spotlight PickWeWork: or The Making and Breaking of a $47 Billion Unicorn (2021) 74%If the documentary about failed Theranos start-up founder Elizabeth Holmes (The&nbsp;Inventor: Out for Blood in Silicon Valley),&nbsp;failed to convince you of the troubling&nbsp;cult of personality that drives Silicon Valley investment, this new investigative doc about the rise and fall of WeWork will convert you. With another charismatic founder/con-man at its center (hippie-messianic leader Adam Neumann),&nbsp;WeWork: or The Making and Breaking of a $47 Billion Unicorn serves as a stark reminder that tech investment is primarily based on a company’s ability to convince people an idea is worthy, more so than its ability to actually deliver on that idea. An eye-opening autopsy of one of the biggest busts in tech history, this doc is “a fast-paced, entertaining saga of WeWork’s relentless self-selling and what it portrays as a cultlike corporate atmosphere,”&nbsp;writes&nbsp;Ben Kenigsberg&nbsp;of The New York Times.Streaming now&nbsp;on Hulu.Along with… 92% Baby, Done (2021) , a comedy about a couple who go on a baby bucket list after finding out they’re pregnant.&nbsp; 97% Billie (2020) , a documentary biopic on famed jazz singer Billie Holiday. 89% Black Bear (2020) , about a writer struggling to find story who heads to a remote cabin to meet married friends and make potentially inspirational mischief between the couple. 90% The Climb (2020) , a comedy about a pair of best friends whose relationship is tested when one of them gets involved with a woman. 91% The Dark and the Wicked (2020) , a horror film about a pair of siblings who discover something sinister when they return to their childhood home to care for their dying father. 89% Dear Santa (2020) , a documentary about the long tradition of the United States Postal Service’s Dear Santa program. 79% I Am Greta (2020) , a powerful documentary on climate activist Greta Thunberg. 68% Kindred (2020) , a thriller about a young pregnant woman who suspects the family&nbsp;caring for her has&nbsp;nefarious intentions for her unborn child.&nbsp; 70% Land (2021) , a drama about a woman&nbsp;in search of her&nbsp;true self as she treks across the American Midwest. 91% Little Fish (2021) , a sci-fi romance centering on a new memory disease that wrecks the idyllic love story of a young couple. 77% The Map of Tiny Perfect Things (2021) , a time loop comedy about two people stuck in the same day. 99% MLK/FBI (2021) , a documentary about the U.S. government’s attempts to surveil and discredit Martin Luther King, Jr.&nbsp; 98% One Night in Miami (2020) , Regina King’s directorial debut about a fictionalized evening spent together in a hotel room by Cassius Clay, Sam Cooke, Malcolm X, and Jim Brown.&nbsp; 75% Pieces of a Woman (2020) , a drama about a woman trying to put her life back together after a tragedy. 90% Promising Young Woman (2020) ,&nbsp;starring Carey Mulligan in a darkly comic drama about a med school dropout who spends her evenings bringing a form of justice to would-be sexual predators. 96% The Reason I Jump (2021) , a documentary following five young people diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder.Thumbnail image by&nbsp;NetflixOn an Apple device?

Last year,&nbsp;Miss Juneteenth, Palm Springs, and&nbsp;The Forty-Year-Old Version debuted to critical acclaim, setting up their runs for trophies in 2021. This year, the Park City festival will be primarily conducted virtually, but that isn’t to say there isn’t plenty of buzz on this year’s slate. With debuts from names like Rebecca Hall and Robin Wright and alums Lin-Manuel Miranda and Zoe Lister-Jones returning with new offerings, this is still on track to be one of the best — albeit strangest — years yet.Normally, journalists, filmmakers, studios, producers, and film fans alike head to Park City every year with one question on their mind: Who will break out of the pack? After looking over&nbsp;the offerings, these are&nbsp;our picks for who is heading to the annual event with the most buzz and why we are so excited to catch them.Passing (2021)(Photo by Edu Grau courtesy of Sundance Institute)Director &amp; Screenwriter: Rebecca HallCast: Tessa Thompson, Ruth Negga, André Holland, Alexander Skarsgård, Bill CampOfficial Synopsis:&nbsp;Irene Redfield (Tessa Thompson), a refined, upper-class 1920s woman, finds breezy refuge from a hot summer day in the grand tearoom of New York City’s Drayton Hotel. Across the room, she spots a blond woman staring her down. Irene wants to steal away, but before she can, Clare Kendry (Ruth Negga) rushes over to stop her. It turns out the two were in high school together, and while both are African American women who can “pass” as white, they have chosen to live on opposite sides of the color line. Now, their renewed acquaintance threatens them both.Why we want to see it:&nbsp;Rebecca Hall has made a name for herself as a talented indie darling with a varied filmography of challenging projects, so her directorial debut starring two of the hottest actresses in Hollywood would be an easy choice for a buzzy title. However, the little-known the fact that Hall, who presents as white, is actually of mixed-race heritage — something that was once seen as a hindrance to financing —&nbsp;is an intriguing nugget of information about the filmmaker and her perspective on the story. Hall’s producers even said that, though they loved the script, they were hesitant to join because they were under the impression Hall was white and therefore less equipped to tackle the film’s subject matter. Passing&nbsp;is sure to spark conversation this season, and we can’t wait to see what Hall has in store.Summer of Soul (...Or, When the Revolution Could Not Be Televised) (2021) (Photo by Mass Distraction Media)Director:&nbsp;Ahmir “Questlove” ThompsonOfficial Synopsis:&nbsp;In 1969, during the same summer as Woodstock, a different music festival took place 100 miles away. More than 300,000 people attended the summer concert series known as the Harlem Cultural Festival. It was filmed, but after that summer, the footage sat in a basement for 50 years. It has never been seen until now.Why we want to see it:&nbsp;Ahmir “Questlove” Thomspon was already an accomplished, award-winning musician when his band The Roots were tapped to be Jimmy Fallon’s house band on The Tonight Show. Since then, he has become a household name with more than few film credits, including his recent voice performance in Pixar’s Soul. We think Sundance attendees will be well pleased to see his directorial debut about the lesser-known Harlem Cultural Festival, which took place during the same summer as the famed Woodstock music festival just 100 miles away.Land (2021) Director:&nbsp;Robin WrightScreenwriters:&nbsp;Jesse Chatham and Erin DignamCast: Robin Wright, Demián Bichir, Kim DickensOfficial Synopsis:&nbsp;The poignant story of one woman’s search for meaning in the vast and harsh American wilderness. Edee (Wright), in the aftermath of an unfathomable event, finds herself unable to stay connected to the world she once knew and, in the face of that uncertainty, retreats to the magnificent but unforgiving wilds of the Rockies. After a local hunter (Demián Bichir) brings her back from the brink of death, she must find a way to live again.Why we want to see it:&nbsp;Let’s be honest, Robin Wright is known for stunning debuts. Starting with her first major film role in The Princess Bride to her streaming debut in the Netflix flagship series House of Cards,&nbsp;Wright has never been an actress to shy away from challenging and dynamic performances. With the survival story&nbsp;Land, Wright not only stars but also makes her feature directorial debut. Wright has gone on to say she has found new power in directing, and if it’s anything like what we saw with General Antiope in&nbsp;Wonder Woman,&nbsp;we can’t wait to see how she wields it.On the Count of Three (2021) (Photo by Marshall Adams courtesy of Sundance Institute)Director: Jerrod CarmichaelScreenwriters: Ari Katcher &amp; Ryan WelchCast: Jerrod Carmichael, Christopher Abbott, Tiffany Haddish, JB Smoove, Lavell Crawford, and Henry WinklerOfficial Synopsis:&nbsp;Val (Jerrod Carmichael) has reached a place where he feels the only way out is to end things. But he considers himself a bit of a failure — his effectiveness lacking — so he figures he could use some help. As luck would have it, Val’s best friend, Kevin (Christopher Abbott), is recovering from a failed suicide attempt, so he seems like the perfect partner for executing this double suicide plan. But before they go, they have some unfinished business to attend to.Why we want to see it:&nbsp;Jerrod Carmicheal’s groundbreaking television sitcom The Carmichael Show&nbsp;was equally frustrating and liberating, but since then, he has gone on to serve as executive producer and showrunner for Ramy Yousef’s critically acclaimed series Ramy. After cutting his teeth with Comedy specials and docs, Carmicheal makes his narrative debut with On The Count of Three. The fast-paced buddy comedy should capitalize on the former comic’s comedic timing and laser-sharp cutural commentary, and with&nbsp;Indie Fresh List&nbsp;regular&nbsp;Christopher Abbott on hand to lend an air of gravitas to the project, this is not one to be missed.How It Ends (2021) (Photo by Daryl Wein courtesy of Sundance Institute)Director/Screenwriters:&nbsp;Daryl Wein and&nbsp;Zoe Lister-JonesCast:&nbsp;Zoe Lister-Jones, Helen Hunt, Olivia Wilde, Fred Armisen, Lamorne Morris, Cailee Spaeny, and Nick KrollOfficial Synopsis:&nbsp;On the day an asteroid is scheduled to obliterate Earth, freewheeling Liza (Zoe Lister-Jones) scores an invite to one last wild gathering before it all goes down. Making it to the party won’t be easy, though, after her car is unceremoniously stolen, and the clock is ticking on her plan to tie up loose ends with friends and family. With a little help from her whimsical younger self (Cailee Spaeny), Liza embarks on a journey by foot across Los Angeles as she seeks to make peace with her regrets — and find the right company for those last few hours.Why we want to see it:&nbsp;Though it may seem strange given the current state of the world, Zoe Lister-Jones’ apocalyptic comedy How it Ends looks to be a darkly funny take on the end of the world. Since debuting at Sundance with&nbsp;Band Aid&nbsp;in 2017, Lister-Jones has&nbsp;amassed&nbsp;an impressive filmography both in front of and behind the camera.Prisoners of the Ghostland (2021) (Photo by Coutesty of RDJE Films)Director:&nbsp;Sion SonoScreenwriter: Aaron Hendry and Rexa Sixo SafaiCast:&nbsp;Nicolas Cage, Sofia Boutella, Nick Cassavetes, Bill Moseley, Tak Sakaguchi, and Yuzuka NakayaOfficial Synopsis:&nbsp;A ruthless bank robber (Cage) is sprung from jail by wealthy warlord The Governor (Moseley), whose adopted granddaughter Bernice (Boutella) has gone missing. The Governor offers the prisoner his freedom in exchange for retrieving the runaway. Strapped into a leather suit that will self-destruct within three days, the bandit sets off on a journey to find the young woman — and his own path to redemption.Why we want to see it:&nbsp;Nicolas Cage has recently come out to say that Prisoners of Ghostland is his “wildest” role yet. Coming from the actor who has never met&nbsp;a role that was too weird or a line read he couldn’t take to another gear, it will be interesting to see if the film can live up to that ringing endorsement, but we are more than eagerly hoping he is right. Let’s just be honest: crazy Nic Cage is the best Nic Cage.Rita Moreno: Just a Girl Who Decided to Go For It (2021) (Photo by Getty Images)Director:&nbsp;Mariem Pérez RieraCast:&nbsp;Rita&nbsp;Moreno, Morgan Freeman, Whoopi Goldberg, Norman Lear, Eva Longoria, Gloria Estefan, Lin-Manuel Miranda, George Chakiris, Héctor Elizondo, Tom Fontana, Mitzi Gaynor, Justina Machado, Terrence McNally, and Karen OlivoOfficial Synopsis:&nbsp;Rita Moreno defied both her humble upbringing and relentless racism to become one of a select group who has won an Emmy, Grammy, Oscar, and Tony Award. Over a 70-year career, she has paved the way for Hispanic-American performers by refusing to be pigeonholed into one-dimensional stereotypes.Why we want to see it:&nbsp;Before she makes a return to the world of her iconic performance as Anita in West Side Story or&nbsp;appears in Lin-Manuel Miranda’s upcoming musical adaptation of In the Heights, it’s not a bad idea to take an intimate look at one of the early pioneers of Latinx representation in Hollywood. And let’s be honest, it’s gonna be so much fun seeing what she has to say&nbsp;reflecting on her long, storied career.Judas and the Black Messiah (2021) Director: Shaka KingScreenwriter:&nbsp;Will Berson and Shaka KingCast: Daniel Kaluuya,&nbsp;Dominique Fishback, LaKeith Stanfield, Jesse PlemonsOfficial Synopsis:&nbsp;Fred Hampton’s cathartic words “I am a revolutionary” became a rallying call in 1969. As chairman of the Illinois chapter of the Black Panther Party, Hampton demanded all power to the people and inspired a growing movement of solidarity, prompting the FBI to consider him a threat and plant informant William O’Neal to infiltrate the party.&nbsp;Judas and the Black Messiah&nbsp;not only recounts Hampton’s legacy and the FBI’s conspiring but also gives equal footing to the man who became infamous for his betrayal — highlighting the systems of inequality and oppression that fed both of their roles.Why we want to see it:&nbsp;Daniel Kaluuya is likely going to win an Oscar for his portrayal of the revolutionary Civil Rights leadeer and Black Panther Founder. Still, if you need more, co-writer and director Shaka King is a vibrant and talented filmmaker, and with an ensemble that includes LaKeith Stanfield, Jesse Plemons, and Dominique Fishback, this taut historical thriller has&nbsp;never been told with a cast like this.CODA (2021) Director and Screenwriter:&nbsp;Sian HederCast:&nbsp;Emilia Jones, Eugenio Derbez, Troy Kotsur, Ferdia Walsh-Peelo, Daniel Durant, and Marlee Matlin.Official Synopsis: Ruby (Emilia Jones) is the only hearing member of a deaf family. At 17, she works mornings before school to help her parents (Marlee Matlin and Troy Kotsur) and brother (Daniel Durant) keep their Gloucester fishing business afloat. But in joining her high school’s choir club, Ruby finds herself drawn to both her duet partner (Ferdia Walsh-Peelo) and her latent passion for singing. Her enthusiastic, tough-love choirmaster (Eugenio Derbez) hears something special and encourages Ruby to consider music school and a future beyond fishing, leaving her torn between obligation to family and pursuit of her dream.Why we want to see it:&nbsp;As the recent film Sound of Metal&nbsp;proved, disability representation on screen is woefully behind reflecting the audience it intends to serve. Films like that and Sian Heder’s CODA&nbsp;, a remake of the French film&nbsp;La Famille Bélier, go a long way toward rectifying that oversight on screen. Using a cast of primarily deaf actors and the Children of Deaf (or Hearing Impaired) Adults — or CODA for short — the film examines the lives of those who exist in the margins of an already marginalized community.Mass (2021) (Photo by Ryan Jackson-Healy courtesy of Sundance Institute)Director and screenwriter: Fran KranzCast:&nbsp;Reed Birney,&nbsp;Ann Dowd,&nbsp;Jason Isaacs, and Martha PlimptonOfficial Synopsis:&nbsp;Imagine the most dreaded, tense, and emotionally draining interaction you could find yourself in and multiply it by 10. That is exactly what two sets of parents — Richard (Reed Birney), Linda (Ann Dowd), Jay (Jason Isaacs), and Gail (Martha Plimpton) — are facing. Years after a tragedy caused by Richard and Linda’s son tore all their lives apart, Jay and Gail are finally ready to talk in an attempt to move forward.Why we want to see it:&nbsp;A tragic but important footnote to the current state of the world is that, due to pandemic-related quarantine orders, there have been no school shootings in the United States for the first time in decades. Mass, which will feel familiar to those who watched We Need to Talk about Kevin,&nbsp;focuses on the parents of not just the perpetrator but also those of the victims of a mass school shooting, setting up the chance for powerful Oscar-worthy performances from leads Jason Issacs and Ann Dowd.The&nbsp;Sundance Film Festival&nbsp;runs from January 28 to February 3.On an Apple device?

At least, that’s the sentiment we’re feeling here at RT from the collective movie industry, which decided it was safe enough to kick off the summer movie season with a fairly robust calendar of releases in May. With that in mind, we thought it made sense to look ahead to the most anticipated movies of the month, which looks like an unusually horror-filled affair. Not only do we have sequels to&nbsp;A Quiet Place and the&nbsp;Saw franchise, but we also have Zack Snyder’s return to the zombie genre and a dark psychological thriller. Even the one Disney film on the list is about a classic villain who just wants to turn puppies into fur coats! In any case, it’s nice to feel some semblance of normalcy again, so read on for the full list of the Most Anticipated Movies in May 2021.A Quiet Place Part II (2021) #1 pick by our Facebook, Instagram and Twitter fans; #1 on RTIn theaters on&nbsp;May 28It probably won’t come as a surprise to anyone that this long-awaited sequel&nbsp;to the surprise 2018 horror hit topped every single one of our fan polls and amassed the most Want-to-See votes on the site. It was originally scheduled to hit theaters over a full year ago, and&nbsp;it even topped our list&nbsp;back then, right before the widespread coronavirus lockdowns hit and it was pulled from the calendar. Emily Blunt reprises her role from the first film as a mother trying to keep her three children alive in a world overrun by terrible monsters attracted to sound; this time she meets up with other survivors, and we learn more about the past. Cillian Murphy and Djimon Hounsou are among the new additions to the cast, and we just can’t wait to see the damn thing already.Spiral: From the Book of Saw (2021) #2&nbsp;on&nbsp;RT and Instagram, #3&nbsp;on Twitter, #4&nbsp;on FacebookIn theaters on&nbsp;May 14Not everyone is a fan of the&nbsp;Saw movies; we get that. But&nbsp;Spiral&nbsp;— aka&nbsp;Spiral: From the Book of Saw — feels just a little different, thanks to the involvement of stars Chris Rock and Samuel L. Jackson. Billed as sort of an unofficial reboot of the franchise, the film follows a pair of detectives on the trail of a serial killer whose crime scenes are, shall we say,&nbsp;familiar. Don’t worry, we’ve been assured all the freaky traps and gory kills are still around, but Rock’s personal&nbsp;involvement&nbsp;in the development of the film guarantees this won’t exactly be your typical visit to torture town.Army Of The Dead (2021) #2&nbsp;on Facebook and Twitter, #3 on InstagramPremiering on&nbsp;Netflix on May 21Continuing on the horror trend — well, in a way, but we’ll get to that — is director Zack Snyder’s return to the zombie genre where he got his start. Though it bears no relation to&nbsp;Dawn of the Dead, Snyder’s directorial debut remake of the George Romero classic,&nbsp;Army of the Dead does feature a horde of zombies descending upon a ragtag group of survivors. Only thing is, these particular survivors happen to be a band of mercenaries who have intentionally entered zombie territory —&nbsp;an infested Las Vegas — in order to pull off a casino heist while the world’s attention is focused on the walking dead. In other words, this may fit more under Action than Horror, but either way, it could be a lot of fun.Cruella (2021) #3 on Facebook, #4&nbsp;on Instagram (tie), Twitter (tie), and RTIn theaters and available on Disney+ on May 28Disney’s has taken two approaches to their live-action films based on classic animated features: straightforward remakes or fresh and unexpected spins on familiar stories.&nbsp;The Lion King and&nbsp;Aladdin would fit into the former category, while&nbsp;Maleficent and, now,&nbsp;Cruella fall into the latter. Emma Stone stars in this origin story for the villain of&nbsp;101 Dalmatians, who famously spent that entire film looking to murder a litter of puppies for a new coat. The new film casts Cruella De Vil as an aspiring fashion designer in 1970s London with a flair for the dramatic and a touch of madness, and there are echoes of Todd Phillips’&nbsp;Joker in the portrayal, so expect a wild ride.The Woman in the Window (2021)#3 on RT,&nbsp;#4 pick on Twitter (tie), #5 pick on Facebook and InstagramPremiering on&nbsp;Netflix on May 14Lastly, this psychological thriller based on the novel of the same name centers on a reclusive woman who witnesses her friend and neighbor being murdered… or has she?&nbsp;The film boasts a pretty impressive pedigree — directed by Joe Wright, written by Tracy Letts, starring Amy Adams, Gary Oldman, Julianne Moore, Anthony Mackie, Jennifer Jason Leigh, and Brian Tyree Henry — but ran into some bad luck early on. Originally scheduled to open in 2019, the film was delayed for reshoots after poor test screenings, and then COVID-19 hit, and it was pulled from the calendar altogether until Netflix picked it up. Now it’s finally seeing the light of day, and we can only hope it was worth the wait.Thumnail image by Jonny Cournoyer/©Paramount PicturesOn an Apple device?

Now the actor is betting its dark twists and unique tone are just what mystery-hungry American audiences are looking for, too.by Joel Meares | May 21, 2021 |  Comments(Photo by Courtesy of IFC Films. An IFC Films Release.)When the team behind Australian thriller The Dry – which includes its lead star and producer Eric Bana – decided to release the film into cinemas there on January 1, it was a risky call. While the country has been largely spared from the worst effects of the COVID-19 pandemic (one of the reasons so many Hollywood productions have set up shop there), audiences were still cautious about large indoor gatherings, and snap lockdowns to snuff out small COVID-19 outbreaks – even in the low single-digits – were a regular occurrence in major cities. But Bana, his fellow producers, and distributor Village Roadshow felt sure they had something special in their adaptation of Jane Harper’s hugely popular book of the same name, the kind of Australian movie that might just bring Australian audiences back to cinemas in big numbers. And it turns out they were right.The Dry follows Bana’s Melbourne-based detective, Aaron Falk, who returns to the rural town in which he was raised to attend the funeral of a childhood friend who appears to have killed his wife and child in a murder-suicide. Reconnecting with friends and sparring with enemies from his youth, Falk becomes sucked into the case which, it turns out, has links to another mystery from 20 years ago – one in which he may have played a part. These dual twisting threads, Bana’s stoic and layered work as Falk, and an incredible look that splays the baked Australian landscape across the screen to stark and arresting effect, made The Dry a hit in Australia. In January and February, it became the movie to see there, a might-have-been-indie-thriller that tapped into the popular consciousness like a big-budget Hollywood action flick, and it now ranks as the 15th biggest Australian movie ever at the local box office. (Fun if unsurprising fact: Crocodile Dundee is number one.)Talking with Rotten Tomatoes, Bana is clearly chuffed with the film’s success Down Under, and excited for American and international audiences now to be transported to Kiewarra, the fictional farming community in which The Dry‘s twin mysteries unfold. The movie opens in theaters here on May 21. From his home in Melbourne, the star of Troy, Munich, and Romulus, My Father – his last Aussie film before The Dry – opened up about the sudden popularity of Australian movies in Australian cinemas (The Dry was part of a high-earning crop of recent films including High Ground and Penguin Bloom), scouting the perfect locations to bring Kiewarra to life, and what he hopes will be the impact of so many overseas productions shooting in his backyard. Plus, he reacts to discovering that The Dry helped get this author’s mother a date. Really.(Photo by Courtesy of IFC Films. An IFC Films Release.)Joel Meares for Rotten Tomatoes: I actually had a chance to see The Dry in theaters when I was back in Australia for two months over Christmas. It was a great experience and I have to let you know that you’re actually responsible for getting my mother a date: we were in the lobby before the movie and I’d gone to get popcorn and when I came back a man had come up to her with a notepad. She introduced me, and she said, “This is John and he’s giving me his number.”Eric Bana: This might be my favorite theatrical story yet from The Dry.Rotten Tomatoes: She took the number and he walked away, but he also said, “I had to say your mother was beautiful and I had to shoot my shot.” And mom hadn’t been to the movies in 10 years! There’s not really a question there, but I guess: How do you feel making love happen?Bana: That is pretty spectacular. I love that story. It’s in a lot of ways symbolic of, as you mentioned, so many people going back to the cinema for the first time. Not only I guess regular cinema goers, but we’ve found that there are a lot of people who, for whatever reason, just really felt compelled to see this film on a big screen, which is so rewarding for us because it’s exactly what our intention was. The way that that energy was picked up on by the Australian public was beyond what we had obviously expected, so it was amazing.Rotten Tomatoes: It was a very strange thing to be back in Australia and have the likes of network morning TV talking about this Australian film as a phenomenon. Our films sometimes struggle to cut through the clutter back home. And at the same time as The Dry, cinemas were filled with more Aussie films: Penguin Bloom and High Ground and Rams and all these other films were out. Was it a kind of exciting moment to see Australians going to the movies to see Australian films?Bana: Yeah, it was. It was exciting because it was a deliberate thing. We wanted the film to be commercial. We knew that it had the hallmarks of an indie – with dark themes. But on top of that, there was a potential to try and lure people in with a more commercial sell, which is why [distributor] Village Roadshow were such good partners for us.But you’re right, it was the beginning. The release date was really scary when we got it, January 1. [Editor’s note: COVID-19 cases were down in low single and double-digits in Australia at the time, but cinemas were only newly operating at capacity and snap lockdowns were regular occurrences in Australian cities.] It was sink or swim. But we felt really confident in the film and that it helped set up this trend of people going, “Yeah, we really want to get behind these Australian films.”It has changed the language around theatrical releases for Australian films, which is the thing that I’m most excited about and that all the producers are excited about: That we can start seeing the potential for Australian films and think about them differently.(Photo by Courtesy of IFC Films. An IFC Films Release.)Rotten Tomatoes: It’s exciting to be here back in America now and seeing these films being released and embraced here. The Dry struck me, though, as quite particularly Australian in some ways –&nbsp;it deals with issues that we face, I think, more acutely than some other nations, like the drought and the problem of gambling; and it also gave me a lot of Wake In Fright vibes with the aggressive macho-ness that your character faces at the pub. But in what ways do you feel the movie is universal, and what are you hoping that international audiences are going to get from this film?Bana: Look, we were really lucky that Jane Harper chose to set the story in a fictitious Victorian town of Kiewarra. The key elements of the thriller/whodunit would have worked in any country, in any landscape, with her writing. But we felt like the worst thing we could have done was set this film in Texas, because the hyper-Australian-ess and the attention to detail of the characters and locations are what makes it so specific and is what makes it unique, and that’s what made the book unique.That was playing to our strengths, because it was language we understood, it was characters we understood, it was locations and landscape that we understood. It enabled us, in terms of producers, directors, actors, crew, cinematography, to elevate our game to the highest possible level in a local landscape. By making it hyper-Australian in terms of its detail, I think it helps amp up all those other aspects of an already completely solid story and whodunit, which would have worked like I say in any landscape around the world, but fortunately for us it was set here.To answer your question, I hope the audience enjoys being transported. We’re really excited about the idea that Americans will feel like they’ve spent two hours in Kiewarra at the end of the film. I’m really, really excited to see Americans’ reactions, because it’s a depiction of – as you know – rural Australia that we don’t always get in cinema. It’s usually quite a caricature. It’s usually the Outback. It’s not usually these towns, which is how – I don’t know about you – but how I identify with rural Australia is through these little country towns.Rotten Tomatoes: And they’re towns that are changing, they’re affected by a number of impacts. I found the choice for John Polson’s character to live in that isolated McMansion/new monstrosity very interesting.Bana: Yeah.(Photo by Courtesy of IFC Films. An IFC Films Release.)Rotten Tomatoes: That said, we do also get these amazing vistas and we do get this beautiful – somewhat despairing if you think about the drought that underlies it – striking imagery. From what I understand, you were part of the location scouting for this film. What was that process like and visually what were you going for in terms of the locations?Bana: We really wanted to try and capture the essence of what Jane had written in the book. We knew that area, the Wheat Belt of Victoria, which is about five hours away from the city in which I am now, Melbourne. There was no one town that could do the job so we based ourselves in a place called Warracknabeal and then we had about an hour-and-a-half circle from there that we could cherry pick all these tiny little towns to stitch together our Kiewarra. So, we use the pub from Minyip, we’ll use the main street from Beulah, we’ll use the house from here, and so forth.It was a lot of different locations to get the greatest possible visual consistency with what was in the book. Stefan Duscio, our Director of Photography, did an amazing job. He is from the country and really understands that landscape. Because you had to believe that the dryness and the tension and the mental scarring that comes from people not only living through a severe drought, but also being dependent upon rainfall in order to survive financially and emotionally as well.We shot the beginning of 2019, at the peak of the drought and just as the bush fires were starting. It just felt, it did, it felt like it was never going to rain. It did rain after we left, which is traditional for film crews, of course, but it was very important to us.Rotten Tomatoes: You’ve spoken about what was important to you as the producer of this film. I’m wondering, as you look at what you’re going to produce next, and as you develop a body of work that you’ve produced, is there a guiding principle or something you’re looking to do with the projects that you want to shepherd now?Bana: They tend to be projects that I want to be very closely involved in myself. I don’t want to be someone who just attaches their name to things for the sake of it. So, it will generally be stuff that I’m intrinsically involved with. I was fortunate enough that in this case, Bruna Papandrea, the producer who acquired the rights some years ago, was someone that we knew well and wanted to get involved with. That was wonderful to learn from her and my co-producer, Robert Connolly, who is our director as well, who is just so experienced and fantastic.I guess, yeah, it’s stuff that I really feel that I can have a solid contribution to and have a voice in. The Dry was a “gimme” because it was in my backyard. I knew the area; we were working out of our office and post-production was just a two-minute walk away, so it was fantastic in that sense.(Photo by Courtesy of IFC Films. An IFC Films Release.)Rotten Tomatoes: It’s great to see Australian movies at the cinemas, but the other thing that’s happening in Australia at the moment is that it feels like every American production in the world is currently based there on the Gold Coast or in Byron Bay –&nbsp;largely thanks to COVID being fully under control and some generous tax incentives. I’m wondering, what do you hope the impact of all this activity that’s happening now will be for the local industry? There is a fear I see when speaking to some people that everyone is going to pack up once the pandemic ends and things settle back to normal, and tax incentives won’t be enough to keep this level of production in the country. Is there a hope you have or something you’re thinking about in terms the impact of all this production happening right now?Bana: I think the volume is such that definitely there will be a slight legacy there – that more people will feel comfortable traveling to Australia to film. I’m confident that there will be some kind of continual, residual value in people being comfortable with Australia as a shooting location, even when we lose our ultra-competitive edge due to COVID and the situation being back to normal. Obviously, the UK is a long way off being back online in that strong production sense. We will lose some production, eventually, so hopefully we can regain some of that.But it’s really important that we strike the right balance and that we make the most of the theatrical energy that came out of this year with Australian cinema. We’re starting to get government to really pay attention now, which is great, both on a state level here in Victoria and on a federal level with the offset remaining at 40% – which was super, super important.I hope that there is a long tail. I think we have to be prepared for that drop-off that you talk of, when the rest of the world goes back to normal and every other shooting location becomes available. But hopefully there will be a bit of a legacy here and people go, “Actually, it was great shooting down there. Studios were great in all the different cities. Australians made us feel welcome.”You’d like to think it’s not just a tax break that lures someone to a shooting location. And I’ve been on the receiving end of that myself. I’ve worked in a lot of international cinema that’s shot in tax-break locations, so I get it and I’ve benefited from that, so I can’t criticize that process too much. But at the same time, what makes those locations something that you want to go back to are the crews and the conditions and how great those cities are to be in –&nbsp;it makes a really big difference.Hopefully, we can get our way into people’s hearts and all these directors, producers, actors want to keep coming back here. That’s what we have to try and concentrate on.(Photo by ©Dendy Films/Courtesy Everett Collection)Rotten Tomatoes: You hadn’t made an Australian film for quite some time before The Dry. Are you focused on staying there at the moment and working on Australian stories? Or are you still open to what tickles you, wherever it happens to be?Bana: It’s not a driving principle for me. Since Romulus, My Father (pictured above), Rob [Connolly, who directed Romulus and The Dry] and I have been looking to find something to do at home because this is where we live and it’s obviously hugely advantageous. I don’t have to fly 24 hours to go to work; it was novel to shoot something at home!It has to compete with everything else on the pile. I don’t feel like a patriotic sense of “I must do this many Australian films.” I’d much rather do the greatest work I can possibly do here when it comes along. That, I think, is a more important contribution. I don’t have a personal quota or anything like that. Obviously, if I found something else to do here that was of that quality, I’d do it tomorrow.But the pool is much smaller here, obviously. The Australian pile is much smaller, and it’s much harder for me to find films of that quality here at the same frequency as I do. So, there’s no real priority given to it, but obviously it’s hugely rewarding when it does come along.Rotten Tomatoes: And just finally, I know you said it’s a very particularly Australian story and that’s what elevates it. But also because of its interesting structure, this dual mystery, it has a hook where I can see it could be remade. They could take this idea and set it somewhere else as a remake. I’m not saying that anyone’s suggested that, but it did pop into my head. How would you feel about potentially having a remade version of this in another location or country?Bana: I’m good with accents! [Laughs]. I’ve had people ask me about a sequel; I haven’t had people ask me about a version in another country. I’ll just go play Aaron in Denmark or Germany! That’s not something I’ve heard, yet. Let’s hope that the specific nature of this one means that people would rather experience the original and not have the accent subtitled even in English. Let’s hope they can understand what the hell we’re saying and enjoy. Enjoy our wonderful Australian accents for a change. It’s not often Australians get to play Australians in international cinema. I’m happy for them to get a real taste of Australia through this film.Rotten Tomatoes: My favorite accent moment in any film, by the way, happens to be Leslie Mann making fun of how you say “No” in Funny People.Bana: [Laughing] Yeah, it was pretty special. Gosh, she’s funny.The Dry&nbsp;is in U.S. theaters May 21, 2021.On an Apple device?

And Marvel Cinematic Universe film Black Widow will be in both theaters and on Disney+ Premier Access on July 9 and new animated film Luca will skip theaters all together and premiere June 18 on Disney+.Whew. Sometimes it’s hard to remember exactly which of Mickey Mouse’s relatives in the Walt Disney Studios orbit are releasing films, and when – and increasingly, where.This is especially true now that the company owns so many major IP machines (Marvel, Lucasfilm, Pixar)&nbsp;and 21st Century Fox and its subsidiaries (now known as 20th Century Studios and Searchlight Pictures). So yes, add&nbsp;Avatar&nbsp;to the growing list of hotly anticipated Disney franchise titles that also includes MCU titles like&nbsp;Black Panther 2&nbsp;and&nbsp;Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3. And with experimental release strategies, things can be even harder to follow.Below, we’ve gathered details for some of the flashier Disney and Disney-associated films that are expected to hit in the next few years – it’s the most comprehensive new Disney movies list you’ll find. The Mouse House’s planned release schedule through at least 2023 has been given a major shakeup following the outbreak of the coronavirus and the subsequent upending of the movie industry, with Disney taking a number of films off the schedule, reworking its entire calendar, and leaning heavily into its streaming service, Disney+.We’ll add to this list as more information becomes available, especially in regards to the speculation surrounding Marvel and Pixar movies still waiting release dates – and in some cases, titles – as well as&nbsp;other rumored and in-development films like&nbsp;the sixth Pirates of the Caribbean.Best Disney+ Series |&nbsp;2021 Disney Movies&nbsp;|&nbsp;2022 Disney MoviesMost Anticipated 2021 MoviesUpcoming PremieresBelow, you’ll find the Disney-produced projects that have locked release dates – for now.

Some directors, like Cathy Yan, made the leap from small budget indies like Dead Pigs to big budget studio movies like her next project, Birds of Prey (And the Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn). Others, like Steven Soderbergh, have continued to blaze an unconventional path since his debut with Sex, Lies and Videotape over 30 years ago. This year’s group of first-time filmmakers are no less talented, many of them already earning praise from audiences and critics alike. There’s a good chance we may see many more movies from them in the years to come.I Carry You with Me (2021)  93%(Photo by Alejandro López courtesy of Sundance Institute)Distributor:&nbsp;Sony Pictures ClassicsTechnically speaking, I Carry You With Me&nbsp;isn’t a true debut for Heidi Ewing, who has been crafting acclaimed feature documentaries for a decade and a half (2006’s&nbsp;Jesus Camp was even nominated for an Oscar).&nbsp;That said, Ewing makes her first foray into narrative filmmaking with this touching drama,&nbsp;which&nbsp;follows two men in Mexico, Iván and Gerardo, as they meet, fall in love and decide to try their luck in the United States. The film moves back and forth through the men’s lives, revisiting different moments from their childhood up to the present day, where they now live in New York and are unable to reunite with their families south of the border because they left without immigration papers. I Carry You with Me&nbsp;won Sundance’s NEXT Innovator Award and the audience award for its category. Carlos Aguilar wrote for Remezcla, “Ravishing and unshakable, Ewing’s authentic film feels like the crossbreed between a painful memory and a hopeful dream about a place, a relationship and a fight for acceptance that’s not political but entirely humanistic.”Crip Camp: A Disability Revolution (2020)  100%(Photo by Steve Honigsbaum courtesy of Sundance Institute)Distributor:&nbsp;NetflixNicole Newnham and Jim LeBrecht teamed up to revisit a chapter of nearly forgotten history and trace its influence on attendees. In the early ‘70s, not far from Woodstock, an inclusive camp gave unprecedented training and opportunities to people with disabilities. Empowered by their experiences, LeBrecht and his fellow campers and counselors would go on to accomplish many things – including advocating for the Americans with Disabilities Act. Crip Camp won the audience award for its U.S. Documentary category. Esther Zuckerman wrote for Thrillist, “Through incredible archival footage, the documentary shows how campers at Jened were given the freedom they so often lacked in the outside world. There’s smoking, sex, partying, and a sense of pure community.”The Forty-Year-Old Version (2020)  98%(Photo by Jeong Park courtesy of Sundance Institute)Distributor: NetflixWritten, directed by, and starring Radha Blank, this dramedy&nbsp;is a loosely autobiographical riff filtered through a classic-looking black-and-white lens.&nbsp;Blank plays a version of herself who’s nervous about approaching 40 as a single woman and struggling artist. Luckily, she rediscovers her love of hip-hop and finds a new source of inspiration for her material. Blank, a playwright and comedian off-screen, brings her sharp wit to the experience of a woman on the edge of a career breaking point, winning the Directing Award in the U.S. Dramatic category at Sundance in the process. Aramide Tinubu wrote in Shadow and Act, “Vulnerable but vibrant in all of it’s black, white and grey-hued glory, The 40-Year-Old Version is an ode to BLACK Harlem, fearlessness and the art of putting yourself on.”Some Kind of Heaven (2021)  93%(Photo by Becca Haydu courtesy of Sundance Institute)Distributor:&nbsp;N/ALance Oppenheim’s quirky documentary takes audiences to a picture-perfect retirement community in Florida known as The Villages. Despite dozens of clubs, activities and smiling faces, his camera finds subjects who aren’t so pleased with paradise but are trying to make the best of their remaining years.&nbsp;Writing for Variety, Dennis Harvey said, “Those nostalgic for the fond portraits of eccentric Americana in Errol Morris’ early work – and pretty much everyone else – will be delighted by Some Kind of Heaven.”This Is Not a Burial, It's a Resurrection (2021)  100%(Photo by Pierrede Villiers courtesy of Sundance Institute)Distributor: N/ALemohang Jeremiah Mosese’s debut opens in the mountains of Lesotho, where an 80-year-old woman loses her son and takes up a new cause in life: to protect her village from bureaucratic plans that would wipe it off the face of the earth. The film won the World Cinema Dramatic Special Jury Award for Visionary Filmmaking at Sundance. Allan Hunter of Screen International said, “This Is Not A Burial, It’s A Resurrection offers a vivid, beautifully crafted reflection on identity, community and the tension between respecting age-old traditions and accepting the seemingly unstoppable march of progress.”Save Yourselves! (2020)  89%(Photo by Matt Clegg courtesy of Sundance Institute)Distributor:&nbsp;N/AIt’s the ultimate sci-fi nightmare: in an effort to disconnect from their addictions to smartphones, a Brooklyn couple, Jack (John Reynolds) and Su (Sunita Mani), go off the grid for some peace and quiet. Unfortunately, they picked the wrong time to swear off the internet, as the planet falls under attack by aliens. Amy Nicholson of Variety wrote about Alex Huston Fischer and Eleanor Wilson’s comedy, “There’s only one joke in Save Yourselves! – this hapless generation is doomed! – but the survival comedy is delightful from start to apocalypse.”Palm Springs (2020)  95%(Photo by Chris Willard courtesy of Sundance Institute)Distributor: Hulu, NeonMax Barbakow’s time-traveling romantic comedy follows Sarah (Cristin Milioti) and Nyles (Andy Samberg) on the day of Sarah’s little sister’s wedding. When Sarah looks reluctant to give a toast at the party, Nyles steps in to help, and the two strike up a rapport that eventually leads them both into a type of time warp that causes the hellish wedding day to start anew. Kevin Fallon of The Daily Beast said, “There’s a massive, Groundhog Day-evoking twist that instantly transports this from cute rom-com to high-concept deconstruction of a rom-com that illuminates our need for connection – of course, filtered through the wily charms of Lonely Island.”Promising Young Woman (2020)  90%(Photo by Focus Features)Distributor:&nbsp;Focus FeaturesTurning the revenge narrative upside down, Emerald Fennell’s clever Promising Young Woman follows Cassie (Carey Mulligan) as an old school friend Ryan (Bo Burnham) reenters her life and reminds her of the terrible incident that caused her to drop out of med school. Forever affected by this event, Cassie decides to turn her grief into a teaching moment for those who betrayed her years ago. Joi Childs wrote in Teen Vogue, “A stellar performance from Mulligan paired with an ambitious vision from Fennell comes together to create a story that’s a bold takedown of rape culture and those that defend it.”Miss Juneteenth (2020)  99%(Photo by Rambo Elliott courtesy of Sundance Institute)Distributor: N/AChanning Godfrey Peoples’ debut feature follows a mother-daughter story deep in the heart of Texas. Turquoise (Nicole Beharie), the winner of her town’s beauty pageant title of Miss Juneteenth, lives a very different life than the one she once imagined as a reigning champion. She’s just scraping by as a single mom, trying her hardest to stay above the bills and convince her daughter Kai (Alexis Chikaeze) to go after the crown to finish what she started – even if Kai isn’t too keen on following through. Valerie Complex wrote in AwardsWatch, “Miss Juneteenth is written with hope in mind, and the audience will root for Turquoise. Not a tropey caricature that Hollywood likes to box Black actresses into.”Nine Days (2021)  87%(Photo by Wyatt Garfield courtesy of Sundance Institute)Distributor:&nbsp;N/AAlthough divisive among some critics, many supported Edson Oda’s vision for his feature debut, Nine Days. Starring Winston Duke, Zazie Beetz, Benedict Wong, Bill Skarsgård, Tony Hale and David Rysdahl, Nine Days takes place outside the realm of this reality for a mind-bending look at birth, existence, and life. Nine Days also won the Waldo Salt Screenwriting Award in the U.S. Dramatic category. Brian Tallerico wrote in RogerEbert.com that the film was “one of the most unexpected experiences I’ve had in almost a decade of going to Sundance.”Like this?

Typically unfolding over weeks, this year’s event went hybrid, presenting films virtually to fans of the festival while also hosting limited-capacity events in person in the wonderful Canadian city. What didn’t change this year was the quality of the line-up. While a lot of festivals in 2020 have had to shutter almost entirely, the team behind Fantasia presented a fascinating array of genre offerings, including world premieres from major directors and virtual appearances from cast and crew. Somehow, Fantasia still produced buzz in 2020, emblematic of a festival that always fought against the norm and refused to allow genre voices to be silenced. With dozens of films premiering over roughly two weeks, there was a little bit of something for everyone. Here are 12 to pay attention to when they find their way to your neck of the woods, physically or digitally.12 Hour Shift (2020) 77%(Photo by Magnet Releasing)Brea Grant wrote and directed this pitch-black comedy with a gruesome sense of humor that will appeal to gorehounds. The wonderful Angela Bettis (May) plays Mandy, a night nurse at an Arkansas hospital who has a few demons of her own, including a minor drug addiction and her participation in a black market organ-trafficking racket. She takes the profitable organs from the recently deceased and passes them along to her cousin Regina (Chloe Farnworth) to move up the criminal food chain, but a shipment goes missing one night, leading to utter chaos. As Regina comes to the hospital in search of a replacement kidney, tension rises, thanks in part to the arrival of a criminal (David Arquette) and someone from Mandy’s past. It’s really a comedy of errors that just happens to include murder and organ theft. Alternately grisly and humorous, Grant’s film works because of how much Bettis grounds it in world-weary exhaustion as mistakes pile up. It feels oddly relatable in 2020.12 Hour Shift will open on October 2, 2020.Bleed with Me (2020) 81%(Photo by Epic Pictures)A tense chamber piece, writer/director Amelia Moses’s latest film slowly works its way under your skin, allowing you to question what exactly is happening as much as its paranoid protagonist. Rowan (Lee Marshall) is awkward and shy as she joins her more outgoing friend Emily (Lauren Beatty) and Emily’s boyfriend Brendan (Aris Tyros) on a retreat to a remote cabin — yes, you’d think cabin in the woods movies had gone out of style by 2020, but this one works. Before long, Rowan starts to wonder if she’s way more than just a third wheel. She wakes up with slash marks on her arm and legitimately questions if Emily might be behind the bloodletting. Marshall is excellent at conveying the blend of fear and confusion rising within Rowan and making that feel palpable to the audience.Chasing Dream (2019) 100%(Photo by Milkyway Image)Beloved director Johnnie To is more well-known for his highly acclaimed crime epics like Triad Election&nbsp;(Certified Fresh at 96%) and Vengeance (Fresh at 91%), but his latest blends styles that his fans may not be accustomed to seeing. It’s such a daring piece of moviemaking that tells a story that feels like a hybrid of Rocky and A Star is Born, embedded with a love for movie musicals at the same time. Yes, it’s another one of those. Jacky Heung plays an MMA fighter who makes ends meet by working as an enforcer for a crime syndicate. One night, he encounters a homeless singer named Cuckoo (the wonderful Keru Wang), and he helps her rise in the ranks of a national singing competition called “Perfect Diva.” Filled with striking imagery and perfect pacing, Chasing Dream is just a fun, old-fashioned movie made by one of the world’s most perfectionist craftsmen. And, to top it off, it has a ridiculously fun musical number right when one least expects it. More movies should have random musical numbers.The Columnist (De Kuthoer) (2020) 79%(Photo by NL Film &amp; TV)Dutch director Ivo van Aart’s latest pitch-black comedy struggles to find its tone and kind of writes itself into a corner, but it’s worth keeping an eye out for simply because of the central performance by the great Katja Herbers. The star of CBS’s excellent Evil plays a columnist named Femke who is routinely assaulted online by trolls and detractors, who call her horrible names and even issue threats on her safety. One day, when Femke discovers that one of her trolls is her neighbor, she decides she’s had enough, and takes violent action. The problem with killing one troll is that another just takes its place. Blending satire and horror, The Columnist reaches for timeliness with our current online nightmare, but it’s Herbers who holds it all together as best she can. She’s able to convincingly portray a woman pushed so far that she turns into a serial killer without resorting to histrionics or melodrama.The Dark and the Wicked (2020) 91%(Photo by Shudder)Bryan Bertino, the writer and director of The Strangers and The Monster, has returned to destroy domesticity yet again with one of the darkest, most brutal films in years. Some horror movies promise to offer a glimpse at true malevolence but resort to cheap tricks or jump scares. Not Bertino. He has made a film that’s incredibly hard to shake once it’s over, a movie that gets under your skin and makes you sleep with the lights on. It’s the simple story of a man who is slowly dying on a secluded farm. His children (Marin Ireland&nbsp;and&nbsp;Michael Abbott Jr.) come to say goodbye and care for him in his final days, only to discover that there is something sinister in the house around their parents. A story of pure, unleashed evil with fascinating subtext about religion and grief buried in it, The Dark and the Wicked will be one of the most discussed horror films of 2020.RLJE Films will release&nbsp;The Dark and the Wicked on November 6, 2020, and it will land on Shudder in 2021.Lapsis (2021) 94%(Photo by Couple 3 Films)Not everything at Fantasia could be called horror, as they often premiere fantasy, animated, and sci-fi films as well. This falls into the final category, a lo-fi vision of the future that comments on the gig economy and income inequality of today. Noah Hutton’s film was scheduled to premiere at SXSW before the end of festivals in 2020 and has been making the virtual rounds since then. It is the kind of low-budget, high-intelligence science fiction that is certain to find an audience when it’s more widely available. Dean Imperial gives a fantastic performance as an ordinary Joe who has to get an extraordinary job when he needs money to pay for his brother’s treatments for a mysterious disease called Omnia. The job entails pulling cable through the wilderness, connecting devices meant to change the technological future of man. Of course, there are a few surprises along the journey, including rules to his job that seem designed to make him fail. Who can’t relate to feeling like the system is rigged against the people forced to work it?A Mermaid in Paris (Une Sirène à Paris) (2020) 100%(Photo by Wonder Films)One of the most enjoyable features at a festival not exactly known for whimsy was this French fantasy film from Mathias Malzieu that could accurately be summed up as “What if Jean-Pierre Jeunet remade Splash?” Gaspard (Nicolas Duvauchelle) is a musician who seems to be living in the past, trying to save his family’s cabaret called the Flowerburger. He leads a relatively lonely life until he literally stumbles upon the injured Lula (Marilyn Lima), who is actually more of a siren than a traditional mermaid. She has been singing men to their watery graves in the Seine, but something is different with Gaspard. He takes Lula home and tends to her wounds, but the danger in Lula’s ability to make men’s hearts explode with her song remains. A whimsical romantic fantasy that still finds a way to say something about loneliness and connection, A Mermaid in Paris is sweet and fun.The Mortuary Collection (2019) 95%(Photo by Trapdoor Pictures)Anthology horror films are inherently hit-and-miss affairs, but the latest from Ryan Spindell is nearly all hits, even if they are to varying degrees. The main reason for that is Spindell’s clear affinity for old-fashioned filmmaking, crafting his stories of gruesome horror with simply fantastic practical effects that pop off the screen in ways that CGI never could. Clearly inspired by Tales from the Crypt, the stories are told by a mortician named Montgomery Dark (Clancy Brown), and they all feature a cautionary angle, typically driven by gender roles. For example, a frat boy learns the very hard way that he should have kept the condom on last night instead of lying about doing so, and a husband discovers the true meaning of “’til death do us part.” Anchored by powerful, bloody visuals that elevate the clever storytelling in a way that recalls practical effects masters like Sam Raimi and Peter Jackson, this is one of the best horror anthologies in years.The Oak Room (2020) 90%(Photo by Breakthrough Entertainment)Rarely has a film that’s essentially about storytelling felt so ominous. Director Cody Calahan and writer Peter Genoway understand the power of a good story, and they build their film around the idea that a haunting tale can find its way under your skin in a way that gives words physical power. RJ Mitte (Breaking Bad) plays a man who has returned home after a long absence and estrangement from his father. As dad’s former watering hole is closing for the night, the young man argues with the owner, perfectly played by Peter Outerbridge. The two clearly have a past that’s not completely defined at first, and they start to aggressively share stories of other bar encounters between two men on snowy nights. The film works its way back in on itself, leading one to question motives and exactly where it’s going. Imagine the best story you heard in a bar as closing time approached, and then twist that into a horror movie aesthetic. That’s what Calahan and Genoway offer here, and it’s very good.PVT CHAT (2021) 65%(Photo by Dark Star Films)Every relationship is transactional in Ben Hozie’s daring drama about two people who connect over the inherently disconnected world of webcam chats. Jack (Peter Vack) is an urban wanderer, someone who talks about tech projects he’s working on but doesn’t seem to have much drive beyond playing blackjack online and talking to cam girls. When Scarlet (instant star Julia Fox of Uncut Gems) expresses interest in his tech dreams, Jack begins an obsession with the woman on the other end of the webcam, which is amplified into physical form when he spots her on the street in Chinatown one night. Deftly walking an uncomfortable line in which it’s not too clear if we’re supposed to sympathize with a stalker, Hozie’s film is really a platform for the two performers, both of whom are vulnerable and daring on-screen in ways that make this film very much for adults only. In the end, it’s a smart movie about a world that feels increasingly disconnected even as it presents more technological ways to connect.Special Actors (2019) 82%(Photo by Shochiku)Writer/director Shin’ichirô Ueda made a huge splash in genre circles with One Cut of the Dead, which worked its way through film festivals to honest cult hit status. That film subverted expectations of the zombie genre to become a commentary on filmmaking as well as a story of the undead. His latest plays similar games with perception to comment on the form of acting through the story of Kazuto (Kazuto Osawa), a young man who wants to be a performer but passes out at any sign of conflict, even if it’s fictional. Through his brother, Kazuto ends up getting work with a troupe of what could be called “social actors,” people who are hired to “act” in real life. It could be as simple as being hired by a studio to laugh at opening night of a new comedy, or a heavily scripted encounter on the street to give a man a chance to prove his courage to his new girlfriend. Kazuto’s biggest assignment involves infiltrating a cult, another group that is playing with perception and belief. And all of this meta commentary is embedded in a film that could be called a screwball comedy. This could be as big as One Cut of the Dead if there’s a way to get it to the audiences that will appreciate it.Tiny Tim: King for a Day (2021) 84%(Photo by Juno Films)Documentaries also find a home at Fantasia Fest, and the best this year was about one of the most unique personalities in the history of pop culture, the man with the unforgettable falsetto. A staple on late night talk shows, Tiny Tim was a most unexpected celebrity, but this excellent documentary conveys why people were drawn to the performer, and includes narration by someone who feels cut from a similar cloth, “Weird” Al Yankovic, who reads Tiny Tim’s letters and diary entries. Tiny Tim fell from superstardom as quickly as he rose, one of the first sudden celebrities whose fifteen minutes of fame seemed even tragically shorter, but this documentary expertly humanizes the man behind the goofy image on talk shows. It has a wonderful tonal balance, never taking itself too seriously — Tiny Tim wouldn’t have liked that — but also not shying away from the dark side of a bright personality.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"Comedy, GoT, revenge, Guide, 007, concert, BBC, USA, CNN, tv","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"12-fantasia-fest-films-to-watch"},{"id":"47611753802863","title":"Your Full List of All Upcoming DC Movies – With Key Details","content":"Newsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Your Full List of All Upcoming DC Movies – With Key DetailsNew casting news for Shazam: Fury of the Gods.

Plus check out The Suicide Squad&nbsp;trailer,&nbsp;news on Ta-Nehisi Coates’ Superman film, the announcement of Hourman, plus news on the shelving of Ava DuVernay’s New Gods and James Wan’s&nbsp;The Trench.Much like the DC Comics Multiverse itself, WarnerMedia’s plans for a film Multiverse are always changing. Projects are announced, but then seemingly go into hibernation. The stalwart of the line, Batman, always gets its movies made while Wonder Woman seems poised to join the Dark Knight as a reliable franchise. Superman, sadly, has been lost with no Man of Steel sequel or reboot in sight.Nevertheless, DC Films chief Walter Hamada recently revealed a plan to release six DC-related films a year in the coming decade – four will arrive in theaters while two will be made exclusively for HBO Max. The library is certainly deep enough to support such an endeavor. And thanks to Hamada embracing the multiverse concept, it seems plans are in place for a second Batman saga to coincide with Matt Reeves’ upcoming The Batman. It all means DC fans will get a lot of content in the next 10 years.Listen to our Podcast: “Rotten Tomatoes Is Wrong” About… Batman v SupermanListen to our Podcast: “Rotten Tomatoes Is Wrong” About… Wonder Woman 1984The change is the latest shockwave in the often incredible story of Warner Bros.’ attempts to bring the DC Multiverse to the screen. So before we take a look at the latest changes, let’s go back to the beginning of WB’s ambitious plans for its extended universe…In 2014, Warner Bros. Pictures and DC Entertainment announced a series of movies based on DC Comics characters. The original schedule included a two-part Justice League project and at least two films a year through 2020. Things did not go according to plan, with Justice League compressing its story into one film and projects like Flash experiencing constant delays. Despite projects shifting around the slate – and the critical backlash against Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice&nbsp;and Justice League – the original 2014 master plan has been executed for the most part, with only 2018 missing a second DC-derived film and Cyborg disappearing entirely. And even as features like Aquaman and Shazam! went into production, the studio never stopped trying to get new projects off the ground utilizing the comic book characters and the universe initiated by 2013’s Man of Steel. The next several&nbsp;years will deliver a number of projects from that original slate and&nbsp;some surprises in the form of&nbsp;Aquaman 2&nbsp;and&nbsp;The New Gods.&nbsp;On the TV/streaming front, Zack Snyder’s cut of&nbsp;Justice League is finally available on HBO Max.For now, the following represents everything we know about those projects and their place in the DC Films universe, as well as a few DC adaptations that will exist separate from the universe. (Want to see what the other camp has in store? Check out our breakdown of upcoming Marvel movies.)SEE: Most Anticipated 2021 Movies | Most Anticipated 2022 MoviesComing SoonThere is a lot that is uncertain about which DC Comics characters are coming to the big screen, who’s bringing them there, and in what order — but nothing is uncertain about these first movies. They’re in production, or in pre- or post-production, and we know exactly when they will be hitting theaters. (At least, we know the&nbsp;latest&nbsp;dates, and will update as those change with COVID-19 leaving the landscape a little uncertain.)The Suicide SquadWatch the debut trailer for James Gunn's #TheSuicideSquad: pic.twitter.com/5cH0wp1ubQ— Rotten Tomatoes (@RottenTomatoes) March 26, 2021Release Date:&nbsp;August 6, 2021What We Know:&nbsp;At one time,&nbsp;The Accountant’s Gavin O’Connor was set to direct the&nbsp;Suicide Squad&nbsp;sequel. But in October of 2018, Warner Bros. made the startling announcement that&nbsp;Guardians of the Galaxy&nbsp;director James Gunn – who had temporarily departed his post as director of that series’&nbsp;Volume 3 –&nbsp;was working on a “fresh take” on&nbsp;Suicide Squad, a reboot of the concept with a partially new set of characters. When details of Gunn’s involvement first emerged, it was unclear if he would direct the film. But in January of 2019, word broke that he was in talks to helm the film, which was&nbsp;now called&nbsp;The Suicide Squad.At DC FanDome in August 2020, Gunn declared the new film is “by far the biggest movie I’ve ever made” and features “as many explosions and crashes… as any film ever.” A behind-the-scenes video teased that the movie would be a “gritty 1970s war movie” inflected with Gunn’s skill with character and comedy, and hinted that not all of our favorite characters will make it to the end credits. “Don’t get attached,” Joel Kinnaman says in the featurette.Recommended: Everything We Know About&nbsp;The Suicide SquadGunn was joined by the huge cast and fans finally learned who was playing whom. Margot Robbie returns as Harley Quinn, as do Kinnaman as Rick Flagg, Jai Courtney as Captain Boomerang, and Viola Davis as Amanda Waller. The new cast and characters include: Idris Elba as Bloodsport, John Cena as Peacemaker, David Dastmalchian as Polka-Dot Man, Daniela Melchior as Ratcatcher 2, Steve Agee as King Shark, Nathan Fillion as T.D.K., Mayling Ng as Mongal, Flula Borg as Javelin, Sean Gunn as Weasel, Michael Rooker as Savant, Pete Davidson as Blackguard, Peter Capaldi as The Thinker, and Alice Braga as Sol Soria.The film is holding the line with the same August 2021 release date it has had for roughly a year. Securing the film’s release date is WarnerMedia’s audacious plan to release all of its 2021 films simultaneously in theaters and on HBO Max. Like Wonder Woman 1984 before it, the film will be available on the service for one month upon its theatrical release. It is, currently, the only other DC film slated for the company’s hybrid strategy. Although, it is possible this sort of release pattern will be standard procedure by the time The Suicide Squad debuts.A full redband trailer released late March, suggests Gunn is not holding back, bringing an R-rated flavor to his&nbsp;Guardians-style action and antics.How It Fits in the DC Multiverse:&nbsp;Somehow,&nbsp;The Suicide Squad, with its returning cast members, will be the anchor of DC’s shared film continuity – which, at this point, only really matters to Harley Quinn’s situation and some die-hard fans. Nonetheless, it is possible the film may set up some ideas for subsequent films that the&nbsp;Aquaman&nbsp;sequel and&nbsp;Flash&nbsp;film could follow-up on.The BatmanRelease Date:&nbsp;March 4, 2022What We Know:&nbsp;War for the Planet of the Apes’&nbsp;Matt Reeves&nbsp;took over directing duties on&nbsp;The Batman&nbsp;following the departure of Ben Affleck, who intended to star, co-write, and direct. Creative differences saw his role reduced to star even as his personal problems overshadowed the ongoing question about his continued involvement. Late in January of 2019, Warner Bros. announced a release date while Affleck definitively stated he was leaving the cape and cowl behind. (Though not so&nbsp;definitively, if you skip down to our latest update on&nbsp;Flash).&nbsp;A new man behind the mask emerged that May when Robert Pattinson took over the role. That casting choice confirmed the story would revolve around a younger Batman, and Reeves has confirmed that, telling DC FanDome it will be set during Year Two when a serial killer is stalking Gotham.&nbsp;Across late summer and early Fall, the cast began to round out with Jeffrey Wright joining up as Commissioner Gordon, Paul Dano taking on The Riddler, and Zoe Kravitz signing on as Catwoman. In November, word broke indicating Colin Farrell would play The Penguin and Andy Serkis would be the new face of Alfred Pennyworth. Other cast members include Peter Sarsgaard as District Attorney Gil Colson, Alex Ferns as Commissioner Pete Savage, John Turturro as Falcone, and Jayme Lawson as Bella Reál. Rumors also suggest a new Two-Face will also emerge. Stacking the film with almost all of the notable Batman villains is something of a change for modern Batman movies, which generally only use two at a time – although Batman Begins featured a whopping five when you count lesser known characters like Carmine Falcone, Joe Chill, and Victor Zsasz alongside The Scarecrow and Ra’s Al Ghul.&nbsp;Despite a member of the crew – allegedly star Robert Pattinson himself – coming down with the coronavirus, the film seemed poised to hold its October 2021 release date until Dune took its slot during the recent changes to the calendar. The film is now scheduled for March of 2022.Recommended: Everything We Know About&nbsp;The Batman&nbsp;How It Fits in the DC Multiverse:&nbsp;The project’s ties to the established film continuity are questionable. Late in 2018, rumors began to emerge that Reeves’ vision for the film set it&nbsp;outside&nbsp;the&nbsp;Man of Steel&nbsp;universe as a “standalone” story, like Joker. The studio moved quickly to quash the rumors, but it now seems clear the film will exist in its own universe with a HBO Max spin-off series already in development.Black Adam(Photo by © Warner Bros. Pictures)Release Date: July 29, 2022What We Know:&nbsp;After listening to fans when he was initially interested in&nbsp;Shazam!, Johnson signed on to star in a film featuring that character’s greatest nemesis, Black Adam. Jaume Collet-Serra will direct from a script by&nbsp;Adam Sztykiel, with Noah Centineo on board as well to play Albert Rothstein/Atom Smasher, whose superpower is his super strength and ability to grow…&nbsp;huge. At DC FanDome, Johnson showed two clips. One, produced by Jim Lee and Boss Logic which gave fans a quick rundown of the character’s origins – formerly enslaved, he’s in the pursuit of Justice the Black Adam way. The other introduced the idea of the Justice Society of America, and revealed that Hawkman, Doctor Fate, Cyclone, and Atom Smasher would feature in the film. In late September 2020, Aldis Hodge emerged as Hawkman, but the news was soon tempered as the film lost its December 22, 2021 release date entirely during the shuffling of Warner Bros.’ release slate&nbsp;10 days later. As for most of the project’s existence, it is once again unclear when it will be released. But with members of the cast already assembled, it is possible the film will arrive in 2023. Aiding this possibility: Sarah Shahi joined the cast in October with a role described as both a professor and freedom fighter. In the months following, Quintessa Swindell joined the cast as JSAer Cyclone and Marwan Kenzari signed up for an as-yet undisclosed role; Pierce Brosnan will star as Dr. Fate. Additional cast members include Bodhi Sabongui and James Cusati-Moyer. In March 2021, a release date was finally announced, with Johnson taking over billboards in Times Square to reveal the movie will release July 29, 2022.(Photo by © Warner Bros. Pictures)How It Fits in the DC Multiverse: Black Adam is the archenemy of Shazam, so their film worlds are definitely connected. But he is also a fairly complicated anti-hero when dealing with anyone else. Heroic one moment and brutal the next, Adam could emerge as the powerful leader of his own country – an idea straight from the comic books. At DC FanDome, Johnson hinted that the movie could feature an appearance from Superman, and sent a warning to all those in the Justice League: “The hierarchy of power in the DC Universe is about to change.”The FlashRelease Date:&nbsp;November 4, 2022What We Know:&nbsp;A&nbsp;Flash&nbsp;film starring&nbsp;Ezra Miller&nbsp;as the Barry Allen featured in&nbsp;Justice League&nbsp;is finally getting made.&nbsp;After losing multiple&nbsp;directors – among them, Seth Grahame-Smith and Rick Famuyiwa – and&nbsp;undergoing a title change from&nbsp;The Flash&nbsp;to&nbsp;Flashpoint&nbsp;and back again, the nature of the film is finally coming into focus as we’ve learned that Allen will crash through multiple dimensions&nbsp;to change his mother’s fate in an adaptation of DC’s ambitious 2011 Flashpoint event comic&nbsp;book series,&nbsp;and meet various versions of some of DC’s biggest heroes along the way.&nbsp;It&nbsp;helmer Andy Muschietti signed on as the project’s fifth director in July, and at DC FanDome revealed a first look at concept art for Allen’s new suit, which features embedded light and was made by Bruce Wayne.&nbsp;And someone else has signed on, too. Ben Affleck will return in a small, cameo-style role as the version of Batman we’ve seen in&nbsp;Justice League, while Michael Keaton returns, too, as the Batman we met in 1989’s&nbsp;Batman; Muschietti told&nbsp;Vanity Fair&nbsp;that Keaton’s role is “substantial.” Rudy Mancuso will also appear in an as-yet undisclosed role. In March of 2021, Kiersey Clemons, who signed on to play Iris West back when Famuyiwa was going to direct, recommitted to project. Additionally, word broke soon after indicating Maribel Verdú will play Barry’s mother Nora, but due to scheduling conflicts, Billy Crudup will not reprise his Justice League role as Barry’s father Henry. Ron Livingston will play the part instead. Also, Michael Keaton’s future with the project is up in the air as he admitted in an interview to concerns about COVID-19. Of course, the actor has walked away from superhero roles before only to return – see the brief moment he quit Spider-Man: Homecoming only to ultimately play the Vulture.How It Fits in the DC Multiverse:&nbsp;With the story focusing on the Flashpoint&nbsp;storyline&nbsp;– in which Barry’s attempt to save his mother wrecks the universe – the film will feature&nbsp;Ben Affleck&nbsp;as the Batman, as well as Michael Keaton, and may&nbsp;include other familiar faces. A promo package at DC FanDome also suggested Allen may encounter DC heroes from TV and streaming, with multiple clips of&nbsp;Watchmen&nbsp;playing as the panel discussed the Flashpoint possibilities.&nbsp;And considering how the original Flashpoint comic book radically altered the DC Comics universe, the film may bring about the end of the DCEU as we knew it.Aquaman 2(Photo by @ Warner Bros. )Release Date:&nbsp;December 16, 2022What We Know:&nbsp;James Wan returns to direct the sequel.&nbsp;According to reports following the first film’s stunning box office debut in December of 2018, the studio wanted Wan to develop the project while he decided whether or not to direct. David Leslie Johnson-McGoldrick, a co-writer on the first film, soon emerged to write the follow-up, and Warner Bros. set it for a 2022 release at the end of February last year. Presumably, any sequel storyline will feature the return of Black Manta (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II) and his thirst for revenge. We’re also going to presume a wedding between Arthur (Jason Momoa) and Mera (Amber Heard) will occur. Wan will direct the sequel after completing work on the horror film Malignant, due out later this year, and told DC FanDome that the movie will have a more serious tone compared with the original, and that new worlds will be explored. At the same panel, he was joined by Patrick Wilson, and the pair confirmed that Ocean Master will return for the sequel.&nbsp;For the moment, the film is still expected to be the DC holiday release of 2022 – a year now packed full of films based on comic book characters from Warner Bros. and other studios. And considering The Flash is expected in theaters a month earlier, Aquaman 2 may switch to a 2023 release.How It Fits in the DC Multiverse: Aquaman’s seas presumably now exist in a universe all their own. That said, it is always possible for one of the characters to seek his help in a stinger scene.Shazam:&nbsp;Fury of the Gods(Photo by © Warner Bros. )Release Date: June 2, 2023What We Know:&nbsp;Well, as of DC FanDome, we know that the title of the movie will be&nbsp;Fury of&nbsp;the Gods, and that Sinbad – who through the Mandela Effect will always be associated with the franchise –&nbsp;may&nbsp;be in it. Other than that, not much.&nbsp;What we&nbsp;do&nbsp;know is that director David F. Sandberg is back, along with star Zachary Levy and co-stars Asher Angel and Jack Dylan Grazer. The credits stinger at the end of&nbsp;Shazam! revealed our hero could be about to face Mister Mind – one of the tiniest but most powerful villains in the DC canon.&nbsp;We also know the film will be the first of Warner Bros.’ DC offerings in 2023 – for the moment – thanks to the October 2020 scheduling shift. In February of 2021, Rachel Zegler joined the production in a reportedly key role, while it’s also been announced Helen Mirren will play villain Hespera, daughter of the god Atlas. In April, Lucy Liu signed on to play Kalypso, one of Hespera’s sisters.How It Fits in the DC Multiverse:&nbsp;Black Adam, anyone? Although that film is not on Warner Bros. release schedule at the moment, the title character’s connection to Shazam means a crossover – and a confrontation – is inevitable.In DevelopmentWith its plans for a Justice League-centric film universe abandoned in favor of more standalone productions like Aquaman and Shazam!, Warner Bros.’ calendar during the first few years of the 2020s reveals a number of re-thought ideas and, to borrow a term from comics, new #1 issues. At one time, the studio planned to release as many as three films per year, a target it will hit in 2022. But it remains to be seen if the projects listed below will ramp up to maintain the pace.Wonder Woman 3Release Date: TBAWhat We Know: Hot on the heels of Wonder Woman 1984’s box office success – well, at least in 2020 metrics – Warner Bros. announced a third film was being fast tracked. Both director Patty Jenkins and star Gal Gadot are set to return. Jenkins also said the film will finally bring Diana’s film series to the present day. Of course, with Jenkins heading off to a galaxy far, far away to direct Star Wars: Rogue Squadron, it may be another four years (at least) before Wonder Woman returns.How It Fits in the DC Multiverse: Presuming Diana’s world still aligns to the DC Extended Universe continuity, Diana will finally be a public superhero and, perhaps, serving as an Amazonian ambassador to the world of men. In fact, reuniting her with her people after a century has a very dramatic appeal following the events of Wonder Woman 1984, Batman v Superman, and Justice League. Of course, if the Wonder Woman films are retroactive placed elsewhere in the Multiverse, the story could go in just about any direction.The Other BatmanRelease Date: TBAWhat We Know: In a New York Times profile of Hamada, the DC Films chief made a curious reference to the Multiverse making two Batman feature film sagas possible. One will likely continue the story of The Batman while the other will … well, it’s anyone’s guess right now. The events of Flash may give Ben Affleck’s Batman a new face in the DCEU. Or, perhaps, Hamada has convinced him to keep the cowl on for subsequent appearances. Then again, maybe HBO Max will get its own Batman.How It Fits in the DC Multiverse: Again, this all depends on the DCEU as we knew it existing after The Flash. But presuming this Batman is meant to interact with the other DC heroes in the established film universe, it is easy to see that aspect of his career invade any solo movies he may star in. Or perhaps, he will finally take on allies in Gotham to support spinoffs like Nightwing and Batgirl.Green Lantern CorpsRelease Date: TBDWhat We Know:&nbsp;Announced back with&nbsp;Cyborg&nbsp;in the 2014 masterplan,&nbsp;Green Lantern Corps&nbsp;continues to slowly move forward. In June of 2018, former DC Entertainment president and chief creative officer Geoff Johns took over writing and producing the project through his production company, Mad Ghost Productions. According to the company website, the film will feature both the Silver Age Green Lantern, Hal Jordan (played by Ryan Reynolds in the 2011 film), and John Stewart, the Green Lantern voiced by&nbsp;Phil LaMarr&nbsp;in various&nbsp;Justice League&nbsp;animated series. An earlier concept developed by&nbsp;Man of Steel’s&nbsp;David S. Goyer&nbsp;and Justin Rhodes was said to be a sort of “Lethal Weapon&nbsp;in space” – a description which may still hold true for Johns’ concept as he worked with&nbsp;Lethal Weapon&nbsp;director&nbsp;Richard Donner&nbsp;for a number of years.&nbsp;With Johns participating in a Green Lantern television series for HBO Max, the project would seem to be postponed again — though it is said to still be a priority for Warner Bros. Pictures.How It Fits in the DC Multiverse:&nbsp;Teased in a&nbsp;Justice League&nbsp;flashback, the lack of an Earthbound Green Lantern is part of the reason Steppenwolf (Ciarán Hinds) chose the planet for conquest. But the film would presumably see the Corps correcting that mistake by revealing the brave humans involved in that organization. No doubt the fans of Jordan and Stewart – to say nothing of characters like Guy Gardner, Simon Baz, Jessica Cruz, and G’Nort, who could potentially appear in the film – will be excited to see them in an ensemble. Additionally, the film would provide a perfect platform with which to introduce DC’s space-faring characters to a larger audience. At one time, the film was slotted for a 2020 release, but with the announcement of a HBO Max Green Lantern series, it is unclear if the film will ever surface.SupergirlRelease Date:&nbsp;TBDWhat We Know: The Cloverfield Paradox’s Oren Uziel is reportedly writing a script based on the Girl of Steel. Like The Flash feature film, it will presumably ignore the successful television series on The CW and tell its own version of Kara Zor-El’s first few days as a superhero on Earth. With Man of Steel star Henry Cavill’s DC future in doubt, it is unlikely that Superman will show up and help greet the cinematic Kara. The producers of the 1984 Supergirl film also tried to get then-Superman Christopher Reeve to appear in the film, but his presence was limited to a poster on a dorm room wall. In February 2021, The Young and the Restless’s Sasha Calle was cast as Kara for an appearance in The Flash feature. Presumably, she will lead Supergirl as well, but it currently unclear.How It Fits in the DC Multiverse: If Calle continues as Kara, The Flash will determine if she’s the Supergirl of Barry’s Earth – our de facto DCEU – or one of the Mutliversal realities he visits in the film.Cyborg(Photo by © Warner Bros. Pictures)Release Date:&nbsp;TBDWhat We Know:&nbsp;Ray Fisher&nbsp;has been set to star as Vic Stone in a 2020&nbsp;Cyborg&nbsp;film since 2014, but no director or screenwriter were announced. Many doubted the film will ever materialize despite still being on the calendar.&nbsp;In September of 2018, Fisher suggested fans of the character may need to become more vocal to make the film a reality. In the summer of 2020, Fisher launched a campaign to expose Joss Whedon’s allegedly abusive behavior on the set of the Justice League reshoots. As the situation expanded to former DC Films chiefs Geoff Johns and Jon Berg, Fisher vowed never to work with current DC Films boss Walter Hamada – whom he alleged was pressuring him to take back his accusations about Johns. Subsequently, Cyborg’s planned role in The Flash was written out and, presumably, any chance of a solo film outing went with it.How It Fits in the DC Multiverse: Frankly, we’ll be surprised if Cyborg ever resurfaces in the current DC Films structure, Multiverse or no.BlackhawkRelease Date:&nbsp;TBDWhat We Know:&nbsp;While it is unclear if Blackhawk will be part of the DC film universe, it is a favorite comic book of director Steven Spielberg. He even tried to get a Blackhawk movie off the ground in the 1980s. The current version of the project will see him direct a film based on the golden-age Quality Comics concept later bought by DC in 1957 with The Lost World: Jurassic Park screenwriter David Koepp adapting the concept. The main character is the leader of the Blackhawks squadron, a famed air outfit of seven ace pilots during World War II. When DC incorporated them into a post-war context, they became mercenaries, battled James Bond-style supervillains, and even flirted with becoming superheroes themselves! Considering the director’s fascination with the Second World War and aviation of the period, the original Golden Age version seems like the best fit, provided the film ever gets off the ground.How It Fits In The DC Multiverse: While current narrative conceits allow the film to take place in the past of Barry’s Earth, the Multiverse means the project could be as closely or loosely tied to other films as Spielberg wants. That is presuming, of course, he’s still interested in making it.BatgirlRelease Date:&nbsp;TBDWhat We Know: Originally intended as Joss Whedon’s writing and directing debut in the DC&nbsp;Extended Universe, the project is now being written by Birds of Prey&nbsp;scribe Christina&nbsp;Hodson while the studio looks for a director. Presumably, the film will establish Barbara Gordon as the Batgirl of Gotham. Her relationship to the Birds of Prey will likely be established in a subsequent sequel to either film, if at all. But considering Hodson’s involvement in both films, she probably has a plan for Babs.How It Fits in the DC Multiverse: Considering the project comes from developments outside of the original Justice League plan, it is difficult to guess how it will fit in. Perhaps Batgirl will be set sometime in the past or see Barbara taking up the cape and cowl after the Batman appears to quit.Untitled Jared Leto Joker Project(Photo by © Warner Bros.)Release Date:&nbsp;TBDWhat We Know: According to reports, Jared Leto will star and serve as executive producer in his own solo Joker film – a deal which happens to be quite similar to Robbie’s involvement in Birds of Prey. Details are scarce, other than it will be a separate project from both the “Joker and Harley” concept and the standalone Joker. It will also spearhead a batch of films based on the characters featured in Suicide Squad,&nbsp;which means rumors of that Deadshot movie might be more than idle talk.&nbsp;Then again, it has been a long time since the actor has made any mention of returning to the role. Also, the announcement of a Peacemaker HBO Max series – centered on The Suicide Squad character played John Cena – may indicate the original spin-off plan has gone by the wayside. It would seem Leto’s time in the DC Multiverse is already over.How It Fits in the DC Multiverse: The Leto Joker was not only featured in Suicide Squad, but is also the murderer of Batman’s second Robin, as implied in Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice. As of Birds of Prey,&nbsp;his relationship with Harley is kaput, setting the two characters off in separate films series. If the “Joker and Harley” project is still happening, then it may serve as a capstone to the characters’ storylines across The&nbsp;Suicide Squad, Birds of Prey, and Leto’s Joker. But it may also serve as a replacement for that film as Robbie’s Harley projects may preclude “Joker and Harley.”&nbsp;Of course, Joker’s success – and Leto’s comments about being “alienated and upset” when it was announced – may mean the end of this version of the character. His appearance in Zack Snyder’s Justice League and the very nature of the Multiverse offer some glimmers of hope, however.NightwingRelease Date:&nbsp;TBDWhat We Know: As of February 2018, The LEGO Batman Movie’s Chris McKay was still developing a project centered on the first Robin, Dick Grayson. A final draft from screenwriter Bill Dubuque was due at the time, but there has been no movement since.&nbsp;Reportedly, the film has been postponed in anticipation of The Batman, which may ultimately introduce its own version of Dick Grayson.How It Fits in the DC Multiverse: As established in Justice League, the Robin costume in the Batcave is not Dick Grayson’s uniform, suggesting plans for Nightwing go all the way back to the 2014 masterplan. A solo film would presumably see the character living in Bludhaven (Grayson’s adopted city in the comics) and coming to grips with becoming his own hero.&nbsp;McKay also plans to direct a new Dungeons &amp; Dragons film and a feature film version of Johnny Quest, so it is hard to tell if Nightwing will happen anytime soon. Last time McKay was asked about it, he said fans will have to wait, but they should also “keep hope alive.”Man of Steel SequelRelease Date:&nbsp;TBDWhat We Know: In September of 2017, X-Men: First Class director Matthew Vaughn met with the studio in regards to a direct Man of Steel sequel. Three-ish years on, the return of Superman to the big screen seems like a distant possibility. Also, plans for an entirely new Superman project (more below) may end any hope.How It Fits in the DC Multiverse: Clark (Henry Cavill) has to reestablish himself at the Daily Planet at some point, right? Meanwhile, Superman could face any number of DCU villains from Lex Luthor (Jesse Eisenberg) to Black Adam (Dwayne Johnson).LoboRelease Date:&nbsp;TBDWhat We Know: The Main Man, a Czarnian with various superpowers and healing factors, has always been of interest to Warner Bros. Attempts to make a Lobo movie date back to 2009 with Guy Ritchie and Brad Peyton circling the director’s chair. As of February last year, screenwriter Jason Fuchs&nbsp;(Wonder Woman)&nbsp;was completing a new draft. Michael Bay was linked to the project, but it is unclear if he ever really signed on.How It Fits in the DC Multiverse: Lobo, like Green Lantern Corps, could introduce the cosmic elements of the DC Universe. The character’s irreverence and stark design also set him apart from the rest the DC characters audiences are familiar with. And considering the times his comic book counterpart and Superman have butted heads, he could become a worthy opponent for the Man of Steel in a subsequent film.Static ShockRelease Date:&nbsp;TBDWhat We Know: First revealed at August’s DC FanDome event, a film based on Milestone’s Static – and, of course, the Static Shock animated series – is in development at Warner Bros Pictures. Michael B. Jordan will join Reggie Hudlin as an executive producer on the project. Based on the character created by Milestone Media founders Dwayne McDuffie, Denys Cowan, Michael Davis, and Derek T. Dingle, the film will center on Virgil Hawkins, a teenager with electromagnetic powers who finds his way into a larger world while still keeping his local streets safe. Originally set in Milestone’s Dakotaverse, it is unclear if Virgil will start his adventures there or as a regular DC hero. As it happens, Static only transferred to the DC Universe in 2008 while his cartoon counterpart made cameo appearances in DC animated shows much earlier. In March, Randy McKinnon signed on to write the script.How It Fits in the DC Multiverse: Considering “multiverse” is now the buzzword of Warner’s DC initiative, it is entirely possible Static Shock won’t fit into the established DC film universe. But it’s also possible the Flash’s tinkering with time will make Virgil a key figure before production even starts on the film.Blue BeetleWhat We Know: In February of 2021, word broke revealing Charm City Kings director Angel Manuel Soto will helm a film based on the Jaime Reyes version of Blue Beetle. The character is a Mexican-American teenager living in Texas who discovers a scarab that turns out to be an alien battle suit. It gives him fantastic powers, but makes his life much more complicated.How It Fits Into The DC Multiverse: Like Static Shock and some of the other projects, we’re going to assume the film takes place on the same Earth Barry establishes in The Flash. If so, it gives Jaime a chance to join whatever Justice League we might see in the future.Superman(Photo by © First Run Features /Courtesy Everett Collection)What We Know: Just a few days after the Blue Beetle news broke, word surfaced that J.J. Abrams’ production company, Bad Robot, would produce an entirely new Superman film with novelist and Captain America comic book writer Ta-Nehisi Coates (above in the documentary Moynihan) on scripting duties. Reportedly, the project will feature a Black actor in the lead – although it is unclear if it will be Clark Kent or one of the various Black Superman characters DC Comics has introduced over the years.How It Fits Into The DC Multiverse: The infinite DC worlds will presumably allow for both this Superman and Cavill’s Man of Steel to co-exist. It also allows the two characters to meet. Reports seem to indicate the film will take place in a reality other than Barry’s, but it is always possible the film will introduce the Superman of the next decade.HourmanWhat We Know: In March of 2021, Chernin Entertainment signed on to produce a film featuring the 1940s comic character or one of his subsequent iterations. In most cases, Hourman obtains heightened strength and endurance via a pill called Miraclo. Unfortunately, its effects only last an hour and he can only use it once a day. Gavin James and Neil Widener are set to write the script.How It Fits Into The DC Multiverse: Again, we assume this will be set in Barry’s world. But with versions of the character ranging from a 1940s mystery man to a time traveling android from the 853rd Century, the possibilities for Hourman are endless.New Gods(Photo by Photo By: Priscilla Grant/Everett Collection)Release Date:&nbsp;ShelvedWhat We Know:&nbsp;A Wrinkle In Time’s&nbsp;Ava DuVernay&nbsp;was set to direct a film version Jack Kirby’s&nbsp;New Gods&nbsp;for Warner Bros.,&nbsp;writing the script alongside&nbsp;Mr. Miracle&nbsp;writer Tom King.&nbsp;The film allegedly would have centered on escape artist Scott Free – aka Mr. Miracle – and his wife Barda. Both are refugees from the plant Apokolips; a miserable world under the grip of the tyrant god Darkseid. Scott was given to Darkseid as a baby by his own father to maintain a peace between Apokolips and the nearby world of New Genesis. Despite the detente, Darksied plots to control the universe and the battle of the New Gods rages on. DuVernay thrilled fans in early 2020 when she said she “may in fact be taking some notes” from the Twitter dream casting threads, which included names like Diego Luna for Mr. Miracle and Gina Carano for Big Barda.Unfortunately,&nbsp;Warner Bros. and DC&nbsp;announced on April 1, 2021 that two of their films in development — one of them being&nbsp;New Gods — “will not be moving forward… Their projects will remain in their skillful hands if they were to move forward in the future.” As far as we can tell, this was not an elaborate April Fools prank. That said, DuVernay remains attached to the upcoming 2022 CW series&nbsp;Naomi, about a teen superhero, as both writer and executive producer, which keeps her in the DC family.The TrenchRelease Date:&nbsp;ShelvedWhat We Know:&nbsp;As part of an effort to keep&nbsp;Aquaman’s corner of the DC film universe alive, Warner Bros. hired screenwriters Noah Gardner and Aidan Fitzgerald to write a script centered on The Trench in February of 2019. As referenced in the film’s early moments, The Trench are the descendants of an Atlantean tribe who devolved into fish monsters after breaking away from the rest of the kingdoms. They can be seen attacking Arthur and Mera’s boat shortly before they make their way to the secret sea. Wan publicly discussed his adoration for the creatures and it seems the project&nbsp;would have develop quickly into an offshoot of&nbsp;Aquaman&nbsp;a la the&nbsp;Annabelle&nbsp;spin-offs from Wan’s&nbsp;The Conjuring&nbsp;series.&nbsp;The film was reportedly set to take place after the first&nbsp;Aquaman&nbsp;film and lean into some horror elements,&nbsp;which of course makes sense, considering Wan’s résumé.As with Ava DuVernay’s&nbsp;New Gods, however, development of&nbsp;The Trench was also halted indefinitely by Warner Bros. and DC, even though a script for the film had been completed by Gardner and Fitzgerald. The announcement did keep the door open just enough to allow for future developments, but as of now,&nbsp;The Trench is no longer a part of the studio’s immediate plans. In the meantime, Wan will continue to focus his efforts on&nbsp;Aquaman 2.On an Apple device?

With so many documentaries to choose from, it can be easy to get lost in all of the&nbsp;options. Fortunately, if you missed the film industry’s annual trek to Park City, many of these award-winning films will soon make it to a streaming platform or screen near you.Boys State (2020)  94%(Photo by Thorsten Thielow courtesy of Sundance Institute)Distributor: Apple TV+, A24First-time director Amanda McBaine made the jump from producing to collaborate with her The Overnighters director Jesse Moss for an incisive look at U.S. politics through the eyes of young boys in Texas. The result is an astonishing documentary that examines how young people are shaping politics and how campaign strategies affect our own views – even on the scale of a boys’ civics camp. On awards night, Boys State won the U.S. Grand Jury Prize in its category. Jordan Raup wrote in The Film Stage, “This extraordinary portrait of a democratic process in microcosm is both a testament to how Washington, D.C. and the rest of the country could achieve bipartisanship as well as a look at what has led to such a fractured political system.”The Truffle Hunters (2020)  97%(Photo by Courtesy of Sundance Institute)Distributor: Sony Pictures ClassicsDirecting team Michael Dweck and Gregory Kershaw set their sights on Northern Italy, where a secret society of village elders and dogs protect their ritual of hunting for rare Alba Truffles from prying eyes. Although demand for the truffles is high, the group resists giving out their locations and even hunts at night to avoid detection. The documentary is at once a delightful character study and a meditation on greed versus the need to keep the tradition alive. Lee Marshall of Screen International&nbsp;wrote, “A slow-burn watch, The Truffle Hunters is a film as distinctive and lingering as the scent of the rare tuber that inspires it.”The Dissident (2020)  98%(Photo by Jake Swantko courtesy of Sundance Institute)Distributor: N/AOscar-winning documentarian Bryan Fogel investigates the mysteries surrounding the death of Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi after he entered the Saudi Arabian consulate in Turkey and never returned to his fiancée, Hatice Cengiz. The film retraces his steps through new footage and the testimonies of those who knew him for an intimate portrait of a man whose work continues to spurn the Saudi Arabian officials who tried to silence him. Eric Kohn of Indiewire said, “Fogel assembles a sturdy compendium of talking heads to explain how Khashoggi managed to speak truth to power for so long, and why his fate reverberates for other Saudis who share his sentiments.”Mucho Mucho Amor: The Legend of Walter Mercado (2020)  100%(Photo by Giovan Cordero courtesy of Sundance Institute)Distributor: NetflixCristina Costantini and Kareem Tabsch had just finished filming their documentary about famed Puerto Rican astrologer Walter Mercado when he died in November of 2019. At the height of his fame, Mercado reached around 120 million people with his messages of love and hope – before he mysteriously went off the air in the 2000s. The result became Mucho Mucho Amor, a tribute to the man behind many sequined capes that reveals what happened to Mercado before and after his time as one of TV’s most charismatic personalities. Writing for The Wrap,&nbsp;Carlos Aguilar called&nbsp;Much Mucho Amor “a tribute as inspired and jubilant as its majestic subject, a true original.”Bloody Nose, Empty Pockets (2020)  93%(Photo by Courtesy of Sundance Institute)Distributor: N/AIn the waning months of 2016, documentarians Bill Ross IV and Turner Ross filmed the closing night of a local Las Vegas bar, capturing the patrons’ tearful goodbyes and plenty of dazed stares from one too many drinks. Only, the premise was actually a set-up: the bar is still open (and located in New Orleans), and everyone involved was instructed to behave as if the set-up were true. Nevertheless, the film is full of genuine&nbsp;emotions coming from normal&nbsp;people, blurring the lines between documentary film and traditional narrative. Amy Nicholson of Variety&nbsp;wrote, “It’s The Bachelorette&nbsp;wed to The Iceman Cometh: the setup is staged, but the tears are real.”Dick Johnson Is Dead (2020)  100%(Photo by John Wakayama Carey courtesy of Sundance Institute)Distributor: NetflixWith her feature debut,&nbsp;Cameraperson, Kirsten Johnson emerged as one of the documentary world’s most exciting new voices. Her next project, Dick Johnson is Dead, is radically different but no less inventive, challenging the way we talk about and imagine faith, aging, death,&nbsp;and the afterlife. As Johnson follows her own father’s struggles with memory loss, the two&nbsp;confront the inevitable with plenty of laughs and heartfelt moments. Nick Allen of RogerEbert.com&nbsp;called it “a gorgeous blend of truth and fiction, with a guiding sense of humor that allows her film to always be honest and hilarious.”On the Record (2020)  99%(Photo by Becca Haydu courtesy of Sundance Institute)Distributor: HBO MaxAlthough Kirby Dick and Amy Ziering’s documentary On the Record may have first caught the national spotlight after the departure of one of its top producers and a distributor, they bounced back at the Sundance Film Festival with a rapturous premiere screening. Their movie follows Drew Dixon as she recounts in vivid detail the night Russell Simmons assaulted her and processes the impact it eventually left on her career, wrestling with the pressure of coming forward in the wake of the #MeToo era. Her story was later painfully corroborated by several women who Simmons also harassed or assaulted. Beandrea July wrote in The Hollywood Reporter, “The overall result is an intimate look at what is at stake when rape victims decide whether or not to tell their stories.”Welcome to Chechnya (2020)  100%(Photo by Courtesy of Sundance Institute)Distributor: HBODavid France heads to closed-off Chechnya to meet the LGBTQ activists bravely&nbsp;combating the government-sanctioned violence against their community and helping others escape almost certain death. The documentary captures their struggle against the persecution of LGBTQ individuals and anyone seen supporting them, as the international press is shut out and the Russian government turns a blind eye to the carnage. Alonso Duralde&nbsp;of&nbsp;The Wrap&nbsp;called the film “a chilling examination of both the brutality that the Chechen LGBT community is forced to face on a daily basis and the difficulty of leaving the country for peace and safety.”The Painter and the Thief (2020)  96%(Photo by Barbora Kysilkova courtesy of Sundance Institute)Distributor: N/AAfter two of Barbora Kysilkova’s paintings are stolen from an art gallery in Oslo, the artist approaches one of the men accused of stealing them, Karl-Bertil Nordland, and offers to paint his portrait in the hopes of learning where her still-missing paintings may have gone. Instead, the two strike&nbsp;up an unlikely friendship over several years. Benjamin Ree’s The Painter and the Thief won the World Cinema Documentary Special Jury Award for Creative Storytelling at the Sundance Awards on Saturday. Esther Zuckerman said in Thrillist, “Norwegian documentary filmmaker Ree paints a remarkable portrait of two lives that become intertwined.”The Fight (2020)  99%(Photo by Sabrina Lantos courtesy of Sundance Institute)Distributor:&nbsp;Magnolia PicturesCo-directors Elyse Steinberg, Josh Kriegman, and Eli Despres reunite after their first project together,&nbsp;Weiner, to film the ongoing saga of what it’s like to be an ACLU lawyer in the Age of Trump. It’s a behind-the-scenes look at headlines and the high-stakes battles for freedom behind closed doors. The film won the U.S. Documentary Special Jury Award for Social Impact Filmmaking at the Sundance awards ceremony. Kate Erbland wrote in&nbsp;Indiewire,&nbsp;“The unfussy stuff, the human stuff, is what works best, both for The Fight&nbsp;and the very people it follows.”Feels Good Man (2020)  95%(Photo by Christian Bruno courtesy of Sundance Institute)Distributor: N/AFirst-time filmmaker Arthur Jones follows the riveting transformation of the viral Internet character Pepe the Frog from an innocent comic figure to a symbol for internet trolls and the far right. Pepe’s creator, Matt Furie, now wants him back, but is it too late to save the frog’s reputation on the internet? Feels Good Man explores the unruly nature of internet meme culture and reveals how few rights creators have over their creations once they’re online. Jones won the U.S. Documentary Special Jury Award for Emerging Filmmaker. Angie Han of&nbsp;Mashable wrote, “Jones demonstrates an insatiable curiosity about his subject, speaking with everyone from a former Trump campaign insider to a collector of Rare Pepes to an expert on the occult.”Collective (Colectiv) (2020)  99%(Photo by Courtesy of Sundance Institute)Distributor: Magnolia PicturesAs one of the standouts in the festival’s Spotlight section, Collective remained a must-see title, as director Alexander Nanau documents the step-by-step unfolding of a tragedy with in-depth details and breathtaking footage. After a devastating fire at a night club killed many and seriously injured several dozens more, investigative reporters discovered the government blocked survivors from life-saving treatments and covered up health code violations that led to the loss of several more lives. The harrowing account raises questions about who should be held&nbsp;accountable,&nbsp;if anyone will be at all. Vikram Murthi wrote for&nbsp;The Film Stage, “Collective sports a procedural-like pace that keeps the information legible and the action linear. It doesn’t preclude a lighthearted touch nor get bogged down in misery to underline its points.”Like this?

The Gothams honor films that encapsulate every facet of modern independent cinema and pay tribute to the industry’s best, including a tear-jerking tribute to Chadwick Boseman and stunned acceptance speeches from people like&nbsp;The Forty-Year-Old Version&nbsp;writer/director Radha Blank, who took home the prize for Best Screenplay. Amazon led the night with four wins, followed by HBO and Searchlight Pictures with two each.Riz Ahmed&nbsp;took home the Best Actor trophy for his visceral performance of a drummer losing his hearing in Sound of Metal, while Nicole Beharie took Best Actress for her turn in the Texas pageant queen drama&nbsp;Miss Juneteenth. Newcomer Kingsley Ben-Adir was awarded the Breakthrough Actor prize for his role as Malcolm X in One Night in Miami, adding to a landmark year for representation as people of color took home prizes in most of the top categories.&nbsp;See below for the full list of winners.Best Feature 92% The Assistant (2020) 96% First Cow (2020) 94% Nomadland (2021) –&nbsp;WINNER 92% Relic (2020) 99% Never Rarely Sometimes Always (2020)Best ActorRiz Ahmed – Sound of Metal&nbsp;–&nbsp;WINNERChadwick Boseman – Ma Rainey’s Black BottomJude Law – The NestJohn Magaro – First CowJesse Plemons – I’m Thinking of Ending ThingsBest ActressNicole Beharie – Miss Juneteenth&nbsp;–&nbsp;WINNERJessie Buckley – I’m Thinking of Ending ThingsYoun Yuh-jung – MinariCarrie Coon – The NestFrances McDormand – NomadlandBreakthrough ActorJasmine Batchelor – The SurrogateKingsley Ben-Adir – One Night in Miami&nbsp;–&nbsp;WINNERSidney Flanigan – Never Rarely Sometimes AlwaysOrion Lee – First CowKelly O’Sullivan – Saint FrancesBingham Ray Breakthrough Director AwardRadha Blank – The Forty-Year-Old VersionChanning Godfrey Peoples – Miss JuneteenthAlex Thompson – Saint FrancesCarlo Mirabella-Davis – SwallowAndrew Patterson – The Vast of Night&nbsp;–&nbsp;WINNERBreakthrough Series – Long Form 88% The Great 100% Immigration Nation 100% P-Valley 96% Unorthodox 96% Watchmen – WINNERBreakthrough Series –&nbsp;Short&nbsp;Form 98% Betty 86% DAVE 98% I May Destroy You – WINNER 100% Taste the Nation with Padma Lakshmi 100% Work in ProgressBest Screenplay 94% Bad Education (2019) 96% First Cow (2020) 98% The Forty-Year-Old Version (2020) –&nbsp;WINNER (TIE) 98% Fourteen (2020) –&nbsp;WINNER (TIE) 92% The Vast of Night (2020)Best Documentary 100% 76 Days (2020) 98% City Hall (2020) 100% Our Time Machine (2020) 100% A Thousand Cuts (2020) –&nbsp;WINNER (TIE) 98% Time (2020) –&nbsp;WINNER (TIE)Best&nbsp;International Feature 93% Bacurau (Nighthawk) (2020) 92% Beanpole (Dylda) (2020) 88% Cuties (Mignonnes) (2020) 100% Identifying Features (Sin Señas Particulares) (2021) –&nbsp;WINNER 86% Martin Eden (2020) 99% Wolfwalkers (2020)Jury Award for Ensemble Performance 89% The Trial of the Chicago 7 (2020) –&nbsp;WINNERAudience Award 94% Nomadland (2021) –&nbsp;WINNERThumbnail image by&nbsp;©AmazonOn an Apple device?

From promising releases by new voices to&nbsp;experimental efforts&nbsp;from storied filmmakers – or perhaps the next indie darling to go the distance for end-of-year accolades – we will break it all down for you here each week.This week in our&nbsp;Indie Fresh List, we have a coming-of-age rom-com, a concert documentary about David Byrne, and a powerful courtroom drama from Aaron Sorkin about the 1968 riots at the Democratic national convention. In our Spotlight Section, we have a new black-and-white documentary about incarceration,&nbsp;and in our indie trailer section, we have new trailers featuring&nbsp;Henry Golding,&nbsp;Rachel Brosnahan,&nbsp;Glenn Close,&nbsp;and&nbsp;Amy Adams.New&nbsp;This Weekend&nbsp;The Trial of the Chicago 7 (2020) 89%Aaron Sorkin is back with his second directorial feature, a courtroom drama that retells the raucous and at times ridiculous Trial of the Chicago 7. The 1968 democratic convention was a powder keg before it even convened, as counter-culture icons like&nbsp;Abbie Hoffman&nbsp;and&nbsp;Jerry Rubin&nbsp;and anti-war protesters like Tom Hagen all descended on Chicago looking to protest what they felt was the abandonment of ideals with the nomination of Hubert Humprey, a vocal supporter of the Vietnam war. Touting a jaw-dropping cast of talents including Eddie Redmayne, Sacha Baron Cohen, Frank Langella, Jeremy Strong, and Yahya Abdul-Mateen II, Sorkin’s signature writing style is delivered with passion and humor. “Sorkin, who’s unmatched in his ability to write debates and speeches, manages to freshen up those old benches, robes, and gavels.” writes&nbsp;Johnny Oleksinski of The New York Post.Playing select theaters and available to stream October 16 on&nbsp;Netflix.Shithouse (2020) 97%A new take on a wild night of romance, Shithouse&nbsp;is a touching love story about a lonely college freshman desperate for connection who attends a frat party as a last-ditch effort to make new friends.&nbsp;Cooper Raiff wrote, directed, produced, and stars in his directorial debut, which was slated to premiere at the South by Southwest film festival. Despite the cancellation, Shithouse&nbsp;took home the top Jury Prize in the Narrative Feature section. “Those who dismiss the film based on its title alone may miss out on a deeply affecting and profound portrayal of late adolescence which pays tribute to the coming-of-age tradition even as it forges new emotional pathways,” writes Joel Mayward of Cinemayward.Playing select theaters October 16.&nbsp;David Byrne's American Utopia (2020) 98%Spike Lee and David Byrne have joined forces to produce one of the greatest concert documentaries ever set to film. Byrne, the frontman of The Talking Heads, transformed his hit Broadway show American Utopia into a one-of-a-kind concert experience.&nbsp;Assembling a band of world-renowned musicians, he yet again proves why he is one of the most captivating and inventive musicians of our generation. Surprisingly heartfelt for a concert film, “American Utopia is just the kind of healing, inspiring balm that the audience needs right now. It arrives like an unexpected answer to an unspoken prayer,” writes Ann Hornaday of The&nbsp;Washington Post.Available to stream October 17th on HBO Max.Spotlight PickTime (2020) 98%Fox Rich has had one goal for the past 20 years: to see the release of her husband Rob G. Rich from prison. In our spotlight selection this week we have a Sundance Film Festival award-winning documentary that chronicles the human cost of mass incarceration, highlighting the inequities of who can truly find justice in our current system. Directed by&nbsp;Garrett Bradley, Time follows Rich as she tirelessly works to free her husband, incorporating home videos and private moments to drive home the message. Time is&nbsp;“heartbreaking and passionate,” according to Alissa Wilkinson of Vox,&nbsp;and a “chronicle of love deferred and the life that hope can provide.”&nbsp;Available to stream October 16 on&nbsp;Amazon Prime.Along with… 92% Alone (2020) , a thriller about a woman on the run who is stalked by a violent predator.&nbsp; 100% All In: The Fight for Democracy (2020) , a documentary that examines&nbsp;the fight against voter disenfranchisement. 93% Babyteeth (2020) , a dark rom-com about a sickly girl who falls for the town screw-up. 72% Becky (2020) , a thriller about a girl left alone who must battle escaped convicts when they invade her vacation home. 93% Blue Story (2020) ,&nbsp;a drama about two childhood friends who are torn apart by gang violence. 70% Black Box (2020) , a thriller about a widower recovering from a traumatic brain injury who undergoes experimental treatment.&nbsp;&nbsp; 78% The Broken Hearts Gallery (2020) , a rom-com about an aimless twenty-something who creates an art exhibit to showcase items from past relationships as a means to find closure. 80% Charm City Kings (2020) , a drama about a young man who is seduced by the Baltimore street bike community. 98% Disclosure (2020) , an in-depth documentary about trans performers on screen. 87% Get Duked!

We're betting on Schitt's Creek, Watchmen, and Succession to dominate.by Debbie Day | September 17, 2020 |  Comments(Photo by HBO)When the Television Academy announces winners for the 72nd Annual Emmy Awards on Sunday, HBO’s Watchmen&nbsp;and Succession&nbsp;and the final season of&nbsp;Schitt’s Creek are sure to dominate&nbsp;— in the world according to us.We’ve weighed the variables&nbsp;— including Tomatometer scores (critical reception), Audience Scores, industry buzz, competition in each category, and our own wild (but educated) hunches&nbsp;— to come up with our list of who we think will take home awards this weekend.Check out our Emmy award predictions below and&nbsp;come back on Sunday when we reveal the winners of the 2020 Emmy Awards.Disagree?

Schitt’s CreekAnd why?&nbsp;The sixth and final season of Pop series&nbsp;Schitt’s Creek&nbsp;climbed from four nominations last year to a whopping 15 this year, and its cast is likely to dominate in their respective categories. With 20 nominations this year&nbsp;and 17 past Emmy wins, Amazon Prime Video’s The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel is the title to beat, but its Certified Fresh third season scored an 82% compared to Schitt’s Creek season 6’s Certified Fresh 100% score. Meanwhile, a win by&nbsp;What We Do in the Shadows, another title whose most recent season is Certified Fresh at 100%,&nbsp;would be a big category upset.Lead Actress in a Comedy Series(Photo by Pop TV)Who&nbsp;is nominated? 100% Schitt's Creek: Season 6 (2020) —&nbsp;Catherine O’Hara 80% The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel: Season 3 (2019) —&nbsp;Rachel Brosnahan 93% Dead to Me: Season 2 (2020) —&nbsp;Christina Applegate 93% Dead to Me: Season 2 (2020) —&nbsp;Linda Cardellini 95% Insecure: Season 4 (2020) —&nbsp;Issa Rae - - black-ish: Season 6 (2019) —&nbsp;Tracee Ellis RossWho will win?&nbsp;O’HaraAnd why?&nbsp;O’Hara&nbsp;will ride the Schitt’s Creek wave and take the category&nbsp;for her role as the Rose family’s wig-loving matriarch, Moira. Brosnahan, with three Emmy nominations in her career, won this category once for her as Midge Maisel. The stars of Dead to Me are likely to have split their vote, while Ross was the surprise nomination for the category, despite having been nominated three previous times for her role as Rainbow Johnson.Lead Actor in a Comedy Series(Photo by Pop TV)Who&nbsp;is nominated? 100% Schitt's Creek: Season 6 (2020) — Eugene Levy 100% The Good Place: Season 4 (2019) —&nbsp;Ted Danson 83% Black Monday: Season 2 (2020) —&nbsp;Don Cheadle 98% Ramy: Season 2 (2020) —&nbsp;Ramy Youssef 100% The Kominsky Method: Season 2 (2019) —&nbsp;Michael Douglas - - black-ish: Season 6 (2019) —&nbsp;Anthony AndersonWho will win? LevyAnd why?&nbsp;We’re betting on Levy and that Schitt’s Creek love, though we felt that Youssef was a strong contender for the award. They face Danson, who’s been nominated in this category for the past two years, and Douglas, while Cheadle and Anderson’s nominations came as a surprise.Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series(Photo by Amazon Prime Video)Who&nbsp;will&nbsp;be nominated? 80% The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel: Season 3 (2019) —&nbsp;Alex Borstein - - Saturday Night Live: Season 45 (2019) —&nbsp;Kate McKinnon - - Saturday Night Live: Season 45 (2019) —&nbsp;Cecily Strong 100% Schitt's Creek: Season 6 (2020) —&nbsp;Annie Murphy 80% The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel: Season 3 (2019) —&nbsp;Marin Hinkle 86% GLOW: Season 3 (2019) —&nbsp;Betty Gilpin 100% The Good Place: Season 4 (2019) —&nbsp;D’Arcy Carden 95% Insecure: Season 4 (2020) —&nbsp;Yvonne OrjiWho will win?&nbsp;BorsteinAnd why?&nbsp;Borstein won this category the past two years in a row for her role as&nbsp;Susie Myerson in The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel and, we think, is again the front runner this year. Seven-time nominee, two-time winner McKinnon&nbsp;and nomination newcomer Strong, may split votes for their Saturday Night Live work. Meanwhile, Emmy-nomination newbies Murphy and Carden have strong support for the final seasons of their respective shows — but this is a tough category.Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series(Photo by Amazon Prime Video)Who&nbsp;is nominated? 80% The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel: Season 3 (2019) —&nbsp;Tony Shalhoub 100% Schitt's Creek: Season 6 (2020) —&nbsp;Dan Levy 100% The Kominsky Method: Season 2 (2019) —&nbsp;Alan Arkin 80% The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel: Season 3 (2019) —&nbsp;Sterling K. Brown - - Saturday Night Live: Season 45 (2019) —&nbsp;Kenan Thompson 98% Ramy: Season 2 (2020) —&nbsp;Mahershala Ali 89% Brooklyn Nine-Nine: Season 7 (2020) —&nbsp;Andre Braugher 100% The Good Place: Season 4 (2019) —&nbsp;William Jackson HarperWho will win?&nbsp;ShalhoubAnd why?&nbsp;Emmy heavyweight Shalhoub (11 career nominations, four wins) will defend his title in this category against Schitt’s Creek&nbsp;executive producer, co-creator, and star Levy. (We’re thinking the Television Academy will reward Levy’s producer role with the comedy series win.) Braugher and Harper’s nominations were a nice surprise, but they’re facing an uphill battle against the two favorites; that said, Ali could provide an even bigger surprise and knock everyone out come awards&nbsp;time.Outstanding Drama Series(Photo by HBO)What is nominated? 97% Succession: Season 2 (2019) 98% Ozark: Season 3 (2020) 90% The Crown: Season 3 (2019) 99% Better Call Saul: Season 5 (2020) 81% The Handmaid's Tale: Season 3 (2019) 94% The Mandalorian: Season 2 (2020) 80% Killing Eve: Season 3 (2020) 89% Stranger Things: Season 3 (2019)What will win?&nbsp;SuccessionAnd why?&nbsp;The strength of&nbsp;Succession’s first season seemed to take some off-guard, but series creator Jesse Armstrong (Oscar nominated for 2009’s In The Loop) went on to win a writing Emmy for it. The HBO show’s story&nbsp;was on steroids in season 2, setting the series itself up for an award this year. Still, the category offers a few questions to ponder: Could all that Baby Yoda love carry surprise nominee&nbsp;The Mandalorian into the winners’ circle? Or will Better Call Saul take revenge for its stars’ snubs in the acting nominations and spank everyone in the category? We’re sticking with Succession in our predictions.Lead Actress in a Drama Series(Photo by Steve Dietl/Netflix)Who&nbsp;is nominated? 90% The Crown: Season 3 (2019) —&nbsp;Olivia Colman 98% Ozark: Season 3 (2020) —&nbsp;Laura Linney 61% The Morning Show: Season 1 (2019) —&nbsp;Jennifer Aniston 80% Killing Eve: Season 3 (2020) —&nbsp;Sandra Oh 80% Killing Eve: Season 3 (2020) —&nbsp;Jodie Comer 81% Euphoria: Season 1 (2019) —&nbsp;ZendayaWho will win?&nbsp;LinneyAnd why?&nbsp;Colman seemed&nbsp;the actress to beat for her highly-anticipated turn as Queen Elizabeth II in season 3 of The Crown, but&nbsp;Linney and Aniston are Emmy favorites, now with seven nominations each in their careers, with Linney winning four times and Aniston winning once. Comer is the incumbent here, but Killing Eve&nbsp;Tomatometer score took a dive in season 3 at 80%, compared to season 1’s 96% and 2’s 92% (all were Certified Fresh), and then there’s the nomination of Oh in the category that&nbsp;further dilutes&nbsp;the Killing Eve&nbsp;duo’s individual chances. Zendaya’s nomination surprised many (not us), but with so many awards-veteran challengers, a win seems out of reach.&nbsp;We’re giving it to Linney for the buzz on her chances — but wouldn’t be surprised at all if Colman snagged it from her.Lead Actor in a Drama Series(Photo by Peter Kramer/HBO)Who&nbsp;is&nbsp;nominated? 97% Succession: Season 2 (2019) —&nbsp;Brian Cox 98% Ozark: Season 3 (2020) —&nbsp;Jason Bateman 97% Succession: Season 2 (2019) —&nbsp;Jeremy Strong 98% Pose: Season 2 (2019) —&nbsp;Billy Porter 61% The Morning Show: Season 1 (2019) —&nbsp;Steve Carell 91% This Is Us: Season 4 (2019) —&nbsp;Sterling K. BrownWho&nbsp;will win?&nbsp;CoxAnd why?&nbsp;Forgive us, we’re still reeling from the nomination snub of&nbsp;Bob Odenkirk in this category for his work on season 5 of Better Call Saul.&nbsp;That leaves Cox in the strongest position; though Strong may have split the vote among Succession fans, leaving Bateman in the lead. Porter won this category last year for his role as Pray Tell in the FX series, and there’s every reason to think he could take it again. Brown and Carell were the surprise nominations for us,&nbsp;and we don’t see them overtaking the front runners. We’re betting Cox will prevail for his&nbsp;epic performance as the Roy family patriarch.Supporting Actress in a Drama Series(Photo by Sophie Mutevelian/Netflix)Who&nbsp;is nominated? 90% The Crown: Season 3 (2019) —&nbsp;Helena Bonham Carter 98% Ozark: Season 3 (2020) —&nbsp;Julia Garner 86% Big Little Lies: Season 2 (2019) —&nbsp;Meryl Streep 86% Big Little Lies: Season 2 (2019) —&nbsp;Laura Dern 97% Succession: Season 2 (2019) —&nbsp;Sarah Snook 73% Westworld: Season 3 (2020) —&nbsp;Thandie Newton 80% Killing Eve: Season 3 (2020) —&nbsp;Fiona Shaw 81% The Handmaid's Tale: Season 3 (2019) —&nbsp;Samira WileyWho&nbsp;will win?&nbsp;CarterAnd why?&nbsp;Carter&nbsp;clearly had a ball playing aging&nbsp;Princess Margaret in season 3 of The Crown, but the big question is how she will fare against last year’s winner in the category, Garner, for her role as Ruth Langmore in Ozark. The category’s competition is wickedly strong across the board, but we think it’s down to those two, and we’ll give it to Carter for&nbsp;her surprising and delightful portrayal.Supporting Actor in a Drama Series(Photo by Apple TV+)Who&nbsp;is nominated? 61% The Morning Show: Season 1 (2019) —&nbsp;Mark Duplass 61% The Morning Show: Season 1 (2019) —&nbsp;Billy Crudup 99% Better Call Saul: Season 5 (2020) —&nbsp;Giancarlo Esposito 73% Westworld: Season 3 (2020) —&nbsp;Jeffrey Wright 97% Succession: Season 2 (2019) —&nbsp;Kieran Culkin 81% The Handmaid's Tale: Season 3 (2019) —&nbsp;Bradley Whitford 97% Succession: Season 2 (2019) —&nbsp;Nicholas Braun 97% Succession: Season 2 (2019) —&nbsp;Matthew MacFadyenWho&nbsp;will win?&nbsp;CrudupAnd why?&nbsp;Our guess is that Crudup&nbsp;and&nbsp;Culkin battled it out for supremacy; though both must contend with the possibility that their costars siphoned off votes, and maybe Whitford, Wright, or Esposito will have realized an advantage because of it. Team Succession probably collectively won,&nbsp;but we’re betting on Crudup&nbsp;in a&nbsp;category that could really go to any of the nominees.Outstanding Limited Series(Photo by HBO)What is nominated? 96% Watchmen: Season 1 (2019) 96% Mrs. America: Miniseries (2020) 98% Unbelievable: Season 1 (2019) 78% Little Fires Everywhere: Season 1 (2020) 96% Unorthodox: Miniseries (2020)What will win?&nbsp;WatchmenAnd why? Mrs. America and Unbelievable may have higher Tomatometer scores, but we think the category is going Watchmen,&nbsp;Damon Lindelof’s timely and tense examination of history, race, and justice within the superhero milieu.TV MovieThe winner in this category will be announced on Saturday, September 19 as part of the Creative Arts Emmy Awards presentation, airing at 5 p.m. PT / 8 p.m. ET on FXX.(Photo by Ben Rothstein / Netflix )What&nbsp;is nominated? 91% El Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie (2019) 94% Bad Education (2019) 94% Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt: Kimmy Vs. the Reverend (2020) 50% Dolly Parton's Heartstrings —&nbsp;These Old Bones 46% American Son (2019)What will win? Bad EducationAnd why? The power of Bad Education, with its Certified Fresh 93% score and outstanding performances led by Hugh Jackman and Allison Janney, is undeniable.

Featuring countless interviews with stuntwomen, filmmakers, and Hollywood stars&nbsp;like&nbsp;Michelle Rodriguez, who serves a the narrator, the film is “engaging as it weaves personal interviews with a treasure trove of archival footage and images.

Within the pageant, things are further shaken up when news breaks that one of the competition’s first Black contestants defied the odds and took home the top prize.&nbsp;“Misbehaviour is excellent at not pitting women against each other.

Screening at the Venice and Toronto International Film Festivals, the film was showered with praise and awards, and it was the Polish selection for Best International Feature at the Academy Awards. The story centers on a young man sentenced to a youth detention center who has a spiritual awakening and&nbsp;impersonates a vicar at a small Parrish after his release.&nbsp;Bartosz Bielenia’s&nbsp;captivating performance is further illuminated by&nbsp;Jan Komasa’s skill behind the camera, creating “a quite interesting and irresistible movie, a cross between Paul Schrader’s recent film of spiritual crisis, First Reformed, and Spielberg’s Catch Me If You Can,” according to G.

We've got you covered. Thanks to virtual cinemas, these gems from around the world will make you forget you're sitting on your couch.by Carlos Aguilar | May 27, 2020 |  Comments(Photo by Magnolia Pictures, Film Movement, Eleven Arts, Kino Lorber)Over the last couple months, in response to the ongoing pandemic, several independent distributors have opted to release their new films via digital theatrical experiences&nbsp;that&nbsp;allow audiences to access the films from their homes while supporting local art houses. The revolutionary initiative has expanded access to the best of international cinema to viewers across the country, some of whom may otherwise not have had the chance to see these gems and can now rent them from any participating theaters. The list below takes you around the world via 23 new titles with stories representing 16 countries from four continents, including award-winners at festivals like Cannes, Sundance, Venice, and SXSW. These highlights feature a variety of genres, a mix of emerging and established filmmakers, and above all, a tapestry of human experiences that can help us feel connected in the midst of uncertainty.15 Years (2020)  67%Yoav (Oded Leopold) and Dan (Udi Persi), a well-off gay couple in Tel Aviv, find themselves at a crossroads in their long-standing union because the former is vehemently against having children. Unresolved family wounds and resentment towards his best friend’s pregnancy push Yoav down a self-destructive path in Yuval Hadadi’s debut feature, a touching, character-driven drama that ponders the fear of growing old and the notion of finding purpose through parenthood.Watch on: FandangoNOW, Vudu, Amazon, Google Play,&nbsp;iTunes, VimeoAlice (2019)  90%Australian writer-director Josephine Mackerras introduces us to Alice (Emilie Piponnier), a French mother and wife who, in a matter of days, goes from a conventional and seemingly comfortable existence to working as a high-end escort in order to save her home. With her life upended due to her husband’s reckless actions, a journey of self-discovery ignites within her. In a star-making role, Piponnier traverses a wide range of layered emotions that make Alice deeply endearing and relatable.Watch via Virtual CinemaAnd Then We Danced (2020)  93%Traditional Georgian dance, a symbol of accepted masculinity, has been a lifelong passion for Merab (Levan Gelbakhiani), a promising male dancer at the national ensemble who is involved in a closeted love affair with colleague Irakli (Bachi Valishvili), but pervasive homophobia and economic hardship hinder his dreams of greatness. An outstanding lead turn by Gelbakhiani, both physical and intimate, make Swedish-born Georgian director Levan Akin’s third feature a portrait of gracious defiance.Watch via Virtual CinemaBacurau (Nighthawk) (2020)  93%Iconic Brazilian actress Sonia Braga &nbsp;(Aquarius) reteams with outspoken filmmaker Kleber Mendonça Filho, now working with co-director Juliano Dornelles, for a Western with a social justice edge set in a not-so-distant future where a tyrannical government seeks to obliterate entire populations for financial gain. Under attack by foreign mercenaries, with German star Udo Kier as their villainous leader, the small town of Bacurau furiously fights back. In the end, realty and fiction look terrifyingly similar.Watch via Virtual Cinema&nbsp;or on FandangoNOW, Vudu, Amazon, Google PlayBeanpole (Dylda) (2020)  92%In ravaged, post–World War II Leningrad, two former female soldiers, Iya (Viktoria Miroshnichenko) and Masha (Vasilisa Perelygina), survive working as nurses. Their friendship relies on an unjust power dynamic in which Masha sees motherhood as a chance for redemption and Iya as the vehicle to achieve it. Young Russian auteur Kantemir Balagov elicits exquisite imagery from the stark circumstances and directs the two first-time actresses in fiercely complex roles for a masterful accomplishment.Watch via Virtual Cinema&nbsp;or on FandangoNOW, Vudu, Amazon, Google Play, iTunesCorpus Christi (Boze cialo) (2020)  98%Oscar-nominated for Best International Film at the most recent Academy Awards, this spiritual drama from Polish director Jan Komasa observes the rigidness of the Catholic Church from the point of view of an ex-con impersonating a priest in a small town. Though his intentions are genuinely compassionate, the redeemed sinner, Daniel (Bartosz Bielenia), carries the stigma of his past mistakes as he tries to assert his faith. Bielenia is a revelation as the unorthodox believer.Watch now via Virtual Cinema&nbsp;or June 23 on FandangoNOW, VuduDeerskin (2020)  88%Inanimate objects fascinate French auteur Quentin Dupieux. For his latest absurdist tale, Oscar-winner Jean Dujardin (The Artist) plays a man whose midlife crisis manifests in his deranged relationship with a jacket made of 100% deerskin. Under the pretense of being a successful filmmaker, the leather-clad man convinces an aspiring film editor (Portrait of a Lady on Fire star Adèle Haenel) to finance his project; however, he and his new garment have a large-scale, egotistical goal in mind.Watch via Virtual CinemaI'm No Longer Here (Ya no estoy aquí) (2019)  98%Head of a teen gang in Mexico’s northern metropolis of Monterrey, Ulises (Juan Daniel Garcia Treviño) dances to “cumbia rebajada,” a low-tempo style of the Colombian genre, and speaks with slang that reflects the American influence on the local street identity. Director Fernando Frias’ social realist stunner cuts between the young man’s past and present as an undocumented immigrant in New York City for a compelling and honest peek into an unseen subculture.Watch on: NetflixIncitement (2020)  96%Yaron Zilberman’s chilling historical profile chronicles the radicalization of a devout law student, Yigal Amir (Yehuda Nahari Halevi), whose extreme Jewish nationalist views were inflamed by right-wing religious leaders. In the aftermath of the 1993 Oslo I Accord, which aimed to end the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, Amir saw Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin as an enemy of the people and began plotting his assassination.

Often captured from afar or from behind, as if to conceal what society sees as sinful, the eponymous character (played by newcomer Enrique Salanic) suppresses his desire for freedom, internalizing his painful frustration.

Dialogue is scarce in this nocturnal parade of anarchic depravity, but when participants do articulate their philosophy, lines piercingly question the pre-Revolution establishment and Christianity’s own fascination with pain and degradation as a pathway to divinity. To put it mildly, it’s a polarizing piece.Watch via Virtual CinemaOn a Magical Night (Chambre 212) (2020)  65%Centered on how love and desire change over the years, Christophe Honoré’s whimsical new romance explores a marriage on the brink of collapse through magical realism. Uninterested in restrictive faithfulness, Maria (Chiara Mastroianni) is confronted with a much younger version of her husband — and many of her ex-lovers — to reevaluate whether the bond they once had can adapt and endure.

Before that, she was a television critic at The Hollywood Reporter and a staff writer for&nbsp;Slate, with reviews also published at the LA Times, MTV News, and Village Voice&nbsp;– to name a few.Suffice it to say she’s well-versed in the deluge of series available to us all, and knows how to pinpoint what makes a show worth watching: it offers something we’ve never seen before.“I think the most distinct example I can think of is the HBO show Betty, which is about like a bunch of girl skaters in New York, and they all have a certain look to them,” Kang shared in an interview with Rotten Tomatoes. “Even though it was very small and really under-watched, it was the type of show that you want to talk about with people because you’re like, ‘Wow, this is something that I haven’t seen on TV before’ – not just because it was about female skaters, but because it just feels different.”In short, it’s got a “distinct vibe.” And she knows it when she sees it.“I feel like I hear a lot of people using the word “vibe” on Twitter and they’re all younger than me. I’m always trying to catch up on what exactly they mean by vibe,” she joked.Inkoo Kang is TV Critic at The Washington Post. She co-hosts the All About Almodóvar podcast with Daniel Schroeder. Find her on Twitter: @inkookang.What’s the best thing that you’ve watched in quarantine?Oh wow, that’s so easy. It’s a Sin… It’s essentially an overview of the AIDS crisis in the 1980s in London. But it’s done with such unexpected joie de vivre. Even though it’s obviously a very sad watch, it really captures a lot of emotional vitality and variability.When you’re watching things at home, do you have a screening ritual – snacks that you eat, or an ambience that you like to create?No, I just snuggle in bed. It’s very boring. And then I try to not partake in anything because, I don’t think it’s really fair to watch a show drunk or high or even just mildly buzzed. Because if I’m evaluating something, I want to do it under the same conditions as every other thing I’m reviewing.That probably sounds really self-serious, but I have a very low tolerance to everything so I don’t want to unduly enjoy something. Please note: that was sarcastic.Do you binge-watch? What are you watching at the moment?I love binge-watching. Especially with TV right now, I think that creators, for better or for worse, are really using a lot of connective tissue between the episodes. And so I think that if you watch them one right after the other, you get more out of it generally, or at least that’s been my experience.I just finished the second season of Mythic Quest. But I don’t know – it’s not a show I would necessarily recommend. There’s an honest answer.I’m also really enjoying The Circle and I’m really glad I can’t binge that one, because it’s just like the stupid fun that we all need. And it mirrors quarantine situations in a sort of way, because of so much about isolation&nbsp;is just projecting your own feelings and desires on to essentially text conversations or communication media, through technology.What’s the longest binge-watching session you’ve had?I think the most Olympian binge that I’ve ever done is to watch four seasons of The Americans within a week and a half. I remember that being extremely grueling, just because at a certain point, it gets physically tiring to binge. And yet, that is an amazing show. And so it was both really grueling and really rewarding.Do you still watch TV and movies when you’re on vacation or do you completely unplug&nbsp;– no Twitter, no TV, no nothing?I mean, you’re talking to someone who watched two seasons of Mindhunter&nbsp;while she was vacationing in Rome two years ago. So yeah, that’s your answer.I love it.Listen, Rome’s really great and so are parts of season two of that show.(Photo by CJ Entertainment/TMS Entertainment)What are you most proud of in your career so far?I really liked the Criterion essay that I did, because it was a way to go deep on one film. And I feel that it probably could have been double the length because there’s so much to say about Parasite. But it was really wonderful to have the opportunity to both write about what mattered to me and then also write freely in the style that I want to write in.I will say that the recent cover story that I did for The Hollywood Reporter, for Minari, it felt like a fairly big coup. It felt like a personal coup. Not specifically because it was my first cover story, although that was also a big deal, but because I don’t consider interviewing to be my biggest forte. It was just nice being good at something that I’m not traditionally very good at.What’s an under-the-radar show that you think more people should be watching?I really hope that people are watching Chad. It’s a TBS comedy starring Nasim Pedrad. For whatever reason, it’s connecting with me a lot more than PEN15. Maybe just because I feel as a 30-something woman, I can relate in a lot of ways much more to a 12-year-old boy than a 15-year-old girl.I think Pedrad is doing an amazing performance. And I’m just really enjoying everything that this show is doing, which is this combination of a puberty comedy that’s about a boy who’s afraid of puberty and sex. And it’s also set in an Iranian-American home, and it deals with identity issues in a slightly different way than a lot of these shows that we used to see before.What’s a Rotten thing you love – movie or TV?I feel like the Alicia Vikander Tomb Raider got a really bad rap. That was one of my favorite action movies of that year. And I feel there was this really raw intensity and the visceral-ity to a lot of the action scenes that you just don’t get in a standard action film, especially when it stars a woman. I was really glad to hear it got a sequel.(Photo by Walt Disney/courtesy Everett Collection)What is your favorite series or movies from your childhood?I’m going to be a super basic b—h and say The Little Mermaid. I think it’s just one of those primal bonding things where it was, one of the very first movies that I watched in school, I think in the first grade. And I both remember the pleasure of it as a viewer and also like a tiny baby critic.You had that instinct even as a kid?I was a very annoying child.Did you always imagine that you would become a critic?No, because I had this vague idea in my head that I wanted to be some sort of writer, starting from when I was a preteen. But also, I grew up in a very immigrant working-class home. And so whenever these adults would ask me what I wanted to be when I grew up and I would say “a writer,” my mom would get really mad because she was like, “Well, that’s not a way that you can really make a living.” Because she doesn’t know anyone really who was making a living doing that.What was the first time you saw yourself on screen?I think that one of the very first times I sort of felt represented on screen, or could see a version of myself on screen was when I was six, I was deeply obsessed with the Beetlejuice cartoon. It was basically this super morbid girl who was hanging out with a decaying corpse and a skeleton. And had this one polite demeanor around her family and at school, and then to let her imagination go wild when she was alone in a room. And I really identified with that. I just also loved how adorably disgusting all of the animation was in the world.I do think that part of the reason why it was an animated character that I related to so strongly was that it’s a lot easier to project things on to animated characters, including race, because I never thought of Lydia as white. I just thought of her as a pale-faced like me.But I think that in the way that this question is generally formulated and understood, I remember having a real wow moment when I first saw Margaret Cho do stand-up on TV. I think I was probably 12 or 13.&nbsp;As I reflect on things that I have seen around Asian-American women telling jokes and taking pride in her sense of humor and the talking of a very openly about things like sex, I just remember discovering Margaret Cho and feeling like the world had opened up in some really major way. She’s a pop-culture icon. I will always stan.(Photo by Ali Goldstein / © NBC / Courtesy Everett Collection)Is there an actor, director, or showrunner whose work you always love? Someone who regardless of what they make, you’re going to watch it?I would say 30 Rock is probably my number one default favorite show of all time. I’ve been rethinking my love for this show. At the same time, as many problematic things as she racks up, I’m pretty sure that I will watch any Tina Fey show for the rest of my life. Even though Mr. Mayor is really bad.One of Tina Fey’s writers has come up with a new show called Girls5eva. It’s basically all of the stuff that I love about 30 Rock, where the jokes are super sharp and it’s coming at you at this cascading pace where you can barely keep up. I just loved being back in that Fey-ish zone again. And so it’s reaffirmed my – can I say love? – fondness I guess for 30 Rock and all of the shows that have come in its wake.Is 30 Rock the show that you’ve watched more than any other?Yeah, probably.So you believe in repeat-viewing, then?I don’t understand why you wouldn’t. But I’m also a child of the ’90s, so I feel like a lot of my TV digestion pattern has been that of a cow, where you take in something and then you regurgitate it, like you eat it again and then you learn more from it. And then it just goes through all of your different stomachs, I guess. Should continue with this terrible metaphor? Where each time you just get things out of something that you didn’t get out of them before. And I think that 30 Rock is the perfect show for that type of re-watching.And I think now that we’re about 10 years out from the show – I’m in the middle of a re-watch now – it’s definitely interesting to see how jokes hit differently, especially because there was that whole thing last year when&nbsp;they pulled a bunch of the episodes involving blackface. Several years ago, I wrote a piece about how 30 Rock is sort of this all-time-great show that will age like milk because so many of its jokes are so topical. I’m really being proven right, although in ways I didn’t initially intend.Inkoo Kang&nbsp;is TV Critic at&nbsp;The Washington Post.

Following&nbsp;Mikhail Khodorkovsky, a former oligarch-turned-political-dissident, Gibney dissects how the unrest that followed the dissolution of the U.S.S.R. benefited him and others like eventual Russian president Vladimir Putin. When Khodorkovsky&nbsp;turned on Putin and accused him of corruption, he was swiftly arrested, tried, and sentenced to more than 10 years in prison. Today, as an exile living in London, he continues to speak out against Putin and the oligarchical government. More than just an examination of Russian politics,&nbsp;Citizen K&nbsp;explores how the events in Russia relate to the larger political landscape.&nbsp;Kaleem Aftab of Cineuropa writes, “What makes Citizen K so good is that Gibney always doubts what he is being told… there are no heroes and villains – just a bunch of ‘bad&nbsp;hombres.‘”Playing Los Angeles&nbsp;this weekend;&nbsp;expanding to limited screens in early 2020.Dark Waters (2019)  89%&nbsp;Todd Haynes‘&nbsp;based-on-true-events thriller&nbsp;plays like&nbsp;Erin Brockovich&nbsp;updated for 2019.

The first female photographer to be employed by an Italian newspaper, Battaglia was relentless in her efforts to capture&nbsp;how the community was terrorized by the heinous acts of the Cosa Nostra, and she gave the world a firsthand view of what would become one of the bloodiest moments in Italian history since World War II.&nbsp;Shooting the Mafia is&nbsp;“a fascinating look at the Mafia’s vice-like grip,” writes Ed Gibbs of Little White Lies.Playing New York and Los Angeles this&nbsp;weekend.Fresh and Still in TheatersWaves (2019)  84%SPOTLIGHT PICK!In just four theaters, the cinematic “love story”&nbsp;Waves racked up a $33,000 per-screen average last weekend and made a strong entry into the specialty box-office.

In the end, it was Bong Joon-ho’s social satire thriller Parasite that walked away with four trophies and made Oscar history as the first South Korean film to be nominated for (and win) an Academy Award and the first non-English language film to win Best Picture, as well as the first non-English language film to win both Best Picture and Best Director. Oh, and by the way, it was also the first film to win in the newly renamed Best International Feature Film category, and it snatched the Best Original Screenplay award out from under the nose of Quentin Tarantino, who was hoping to become only the second person to win the award three times.If you want to know who we ultimately&nbsp;thought would be the Oscar winners in each category, check out our 2020 Oscar Predictions.Recommended: All 93 Best Picture Winners RankedRecommended: The 2020 Oscars Red Carpet GalleryRecommended:&nbsp;The 2020 Best Picture Nominees, Ranked by TomatometerRecommended:&nbsp;All the Winners of the Golden Tomato AwardsFor the second year in a row, the Oscars went host-less, but the star wattage on stage was as huge as ever: Tom Hanks, Jane Fonda, Natalie Portman, Mahershala Ali, Keanu Reeves, and Diane Keaton were among the lineup of presenters.

From promising releases from new voices to&nbsp;experimental efforts&nbsp;from storied filmmakers – or perhaps the next indie darling to go the distance for end-of-year accolades – we will break it all down for you here each week in Fresh&nbsp;Indie Finds.&nbsp;This week at the specialty box office, we have a horror film about a sinister dress, an&nbsp;atmospheric teen thriller from writer-director Jennifer Reeder, and a SXSW favorite about a troubled college freshman who’s revisited by his childhood imaginary friend.&nbsp;In our spotlight section, we&nbsp;have the&nbsp;French love story&nbsp;Portrait of a Lady on Fire,&nbsp;and in our indie trailer section, we have a new clip from a film co-starring Peter Dinklage and&nbsp;the second trailer for the Shia LaBeouf-penned and Alma Har’el-directed Honey Boy.Opening This WeekendIn Fabric (2019)  91%&nbsp;The Duke of Burgundy director&nbsp;Peter Strickland&nbsp;returns to theaters this week with In Fabric, which follows a solitary woman whose quest for the perfect dress&nbsp;leads her down a sinister path. This haunting, sensual, and at times hilarious horror tale starring&nbsp;Marianne Jean-Baptiste&nbsp;was called “a beautiful, unpredictable nightmare for those drawn to giggle in the dark” by&nbsp;Barry Hertz&nbsp;of the Globe and Mail.Playing Los Angeles&nbsp;and New York this weekend.Knives and Skin (2019)  69%&nbsp;Jennifer Reeder’s follow-up to indie darling&nbsp;Signature Move&nbsp;is a&nbsp;disturbing high school horror tale about a girl’s strange and sudden disappearance, and it plays like an intriguing&nbsp;mix of Heathers and&nbsp;Twin Peaks.&nbsp;Shelagh Rowan-Legg&nbsp;of Screen Anarchy said Reeder’s sophomore effort is “fraught with anxiety, haunting in quiet horror, blackly comedic, and aching with sorrow and love,” and it’s&nbsp;“many things and also defies easy categorization, as it puts forth a perspective that is multiple and complicated.”Playing New York and Los Angeles&nbsp;this weekend and available on VOD.&nbsp;Daniel Isn't Real (2019)  83%&nbsp;Adults with imaginary friends&nbsp;are not typically treated kindly, but in&nbsp;Adam Egypt Mortimer’s new&nbsp;psychological horror film, things get much worse than mere social stigmatization. When college student Luke is struck by tragedy, his childhood imaginary friend suddenly returns and, though initially helpful,&nbsp;ultimately&nbsp;wreaks havoc on what’s left of Luke’s life and psyche. “A highly imaginative and stylish delve into madness and seduction that takes known horror tropes and twists them into a unique and engrossing character-driven movie,” writes&nbsp;Trace Thurman&nbsp;of Bloody Disgusting.Playing New York and Los Angeles, Vancouver, Brooklyn, Knoxville, El Paso, Columbus, Houston, Phoenix Denver, Kansas, Minneapolis, Detroit, San Francisco, Seattle&nbsp;this&nbsp;weekend.Fresh and Still in TheatersPortrait of a Lady on Fire (Portrait de la jeune fille en feu) (2020)  98%– OUR SPOTLIGHT PICK!&nbsp;In a one week only limited engagement, Cannes Film Festival prize-winner Portrait of a Lady on Fire will screen in select theaters before a larger roll-out domestically in 2020. Starring&nbsp;Noémie Merlant&nbsp;as artist Marianne and&nbsp;Adèle Haenel&nbsp;as her reluctant muse, writer-director&nbsp;Céline Sciamma‘s period love story is a cinematic wonder that Katie Walsh of the Tribune News Service called “not just a film about love between women, but a rumination on the sacredness of a feminine space and the nature of art created by and for women.”Playing New York and Los Angeles&nbsp;this weekend only.Along with… Parasite (Gisaengchung) (2019) , a satire about a low-income family who try to hustle their way to a better life through their association with an affluent family.

Share your recommendations in the comments.Our Planet: Season 1 (2019)  93% (Netflix)What it is: This Netflix series showcases the vast ecosystems of Earth,&nbsp;visiting 50 countries in the process. Each episode is practically a feature-length documentary in its own right. After the introductory episode, each installment focuses on a different habitat&nbsp;—&nbsp;“Deserts and Grasslands,” “Frozen Worlds,” “Forests,” and “Jungles” —&nbsp;and three separate episodes are dedications to freshwater and oceanic environments.Critics Consensus: A cornucopia of visual wonder and environmental advocacy, Our Planet’s breathtaking cinematography explores more of this beautiful, blue marble while presenting an urgent call to action to its inhabitants.Where to watch it: NetflixCommitment: ~6 hours (8 episodes, around 50 minutes each)Planet Earth: Miniseries (2007)  95% (Discovery Channel)(Photo by Discovery Channel/BBC)What it is: Like Our Planet, but released a decade earlier and by the BBC, Planet Earth charts the Earth’s ecosystems episodically. Perhaps no voice is more recognizable in the nature documentary genre than that of British natural historian David Attenborough, who narrates the BBC version of this documentary series (if you watch the Discovery Channel version, you’ll hear none other than Sigourney Weaver guiding you through each hour-long episode). Planet Earth is essentially the go-to for nature series. It won four Emmys the year it was released: non-fiction series, cinematography, sound editing, and music.Critics Consensus: Planet Earth weaves innovative camera techniques and patient observation to deliver viewers an astounding glimpse of the world’s perils and wonders, capturing jaw-dropping scenery and animals on both an epic and intimate scale.Where to watch it: YouTube, Amazon, iTunes, Google Play, VuduCommitment: 9 hours (11 episodes, around 50 minutes each)Planet Earth II: Miniseries (2017)  100% (Discovery Channel)What it is: Ten years after the award-winning original, BBC’s Natural History Unit released a second, shorter&nbsp;sequel called Planet Earth II&nbsp;that takes viewers to new locales – and a few familiar ones – to document even more harrowing survival stories most of us have never seen before. This time around, the series&nbsp;also explores city-dwelling animals — and they’re probably not the species you’d expect to see thriving in urban environments.Critics Consensus: Planet Earth II offers a spectacular, moving, unprecedented account of the natural world.Where to watch it:&nbsp;Amazon, Google Play,&nbsp;iTunes, VuduCommitment: 5 hours (6 episodes, around 50 minutes each)Blue Planet II: Miniseries (2017)  97% (BBC America)What it is:&nbsp;Even before they made&nbsp;Planet Earth, in 2001 the BBC released the first Blue Planet, yet another nature documentary series narrated by Attenborough. The original won two Emmys for its cinematography and music composition. This follow-up series was released in the U.S.&nbsp;in 2018 — Attenborough returned, and won the series another Emmy for his narration to boot. Both iterations in the series provide intimate, breathtaking looks at the undersea world with particular focus on its occupants (from seahorses to squids and whales) and the environmental issues that threaten them.Critics Consensus: Blue Planet II‘s hypnotic beauty is complemented by intense ethical musing, contrasting the micro and the macro in a humbling exploration of humanity’s relationship with the ground it stands on.Where to watch it: Amazon, YouTube, iTunes, Google Play, VuduCommitment: ~6 hours (7 episodes, around 50 minutes each — plus an additional 6.5 hours if you want to watch the original series)Chasing Ice (2012)  96% (National Geographic)(Photo by National Geographic)What it is: Chasing Ice follows a celebrated National Geographic photographer as he documents several years of climate change using time-lapse cameras. Critics called the film “spectacular but depressing” and “the most important documentary of the year.”&nbsp;Chasing Ice is a call to attention — and for some, a call to action.Where to watch it: Amazon, iTunesCommitment: 1 hour 30 minutesFlight of the Butterflies (2012)  100% (SK Films)What it is: If you’re short on time this Earth Day, or on any other binge day, but still want to marvel at the planet’s beauty, look no further than this short but marvelously compelling documentary. Flight of the Butterflies follows the yearlong migration cycle of monarch butterflies from Mexico through the U.S. to Canada and back.Where to watch it: Amazon, iTunes, VuduCommitment: 45 minutesBlackfish (2013)  98% (Magnolia Pictures)What it is: This unforgettable documentary feature rattled the world when it was released in 2013. Blackfish follows the story of a performing orca named Tilikum, highlighting the species’ intelligence and the impact of lifelong captivity. Critics called the film “startling,” “powerful,” and “a troubling exposé of Sea World’s hazardous entertainment trade.” It was powerful enough for the amusement park to make several changes.Critics Consensus: Blackfish is an aggressive, impassioned documentary that will change the way you look at performance killer whales.Where to watch it: Amazon, FandangoNow,&nbsp;iTunes, Vudu, Netflix, HuluCommitment: 83 minutesThe Ivory Game (2016)  77% (Netflix)What it is: This Netflix documentary (produced by Leonardo DiCaprio) goes undercover to investigate the ivory trade (both illegal and legal), and brings to light the horrific practice of elephant tusk poaching. A call to action for activists and governments alike, The Ivory Game&nbsp;sheds light on and condemns the international ivory trade to prevent the imminent and violent extinction of elephants. Since its release, some of the poachers seen in the film have been apprehended and&nbsp; sentenced to years in prison.Critics Consensus: Hard-hitting and ambitious to a fault, The Ivory Game serves as a fittingly urgent call to action against a looming threat against vulnerable wildlife and a fragile ecosystem.Where to watch it: NetflixCommitment: 1hour 52 minutesVirunga (2014)  100% (Netflix)What it is: Virunga is titled after Virunga National Park in the Congo — “one of the most biologically diverse areas on the planet,” according to the park’s website, and home to an endangered group of mountain gorillas. This Netflix documentary not only aims to capture the wildlife in the national park, but also the dedication of teams aiming to protect it and the militia that target it. A year after Virunga was released, Netflix also provided a behind-the-scenes look at its production, with particular focus on the gorillas it features. Since the documentary’s release just a few years ago, the park has been temporarily closed to the public due to an increase in violence.Critics Consensus: Virunga offers a heart-rending glimpse of natural wonders vulnerable to the atrocities of greed&nbsp;— and the people devoting their lives to defending them.Where to watch it: NetflixCommitment: 1 hour 40 minutes (plus 30 extra minutes if you want to watch Virunga: Gorillas in Peril, too)Encounters at the End of the World (2007)  94% (Thinkfilm)What it is:&nbsp;Another legendary voice in the documentary genre alongside Attenborough is German director Werner Herzog. In&nbsp;Encounters at the End of the World, Herzog serves as both narrator and guide on a trip to Antarctica, and the result is a thoughtful (if at times absurd) study of the environment and human nature.Critics Consensus:&nbsp;Encounters at the End of the World&nbsp;offers a poignant study of the human psyche amid haunting landscapes.Where to watch it:&nbsp;Amazon,&nbsp;FandangoNow,&nbsp;iTunes,&nbsp;VuduCommitment:&nbsp;1 hour 40 minutesJane (2017)  98% (National Geographic)What it is:&nbsp;This critically acclaimed&nbsp;National Geographic doc drew from more than 100 hours of previously never-before-seen footage to give viewers an intimate portrait of one of the most famous and beloved conservationists of our time, Jane Goodall. For those familiar with Goodall’s work and current activism,&nbsp;Jane&nbsp;will be particularly fascinating, as it transports viewers back to the 1960s when Goodall was in her mid-20s and doing her earliest work observing chimpanzees. The film features a score from composer Philip Glass.Critics Consensus:&nbsp;Jane&nbsp;honors its subject’s legacy with an absorbing, beautifully filmed, and overall enlightening look at her decades of invaluable work.Where to watch it:&nbsp;Disney+,&nbsp;Amazon, FandangoNow, Hulu,&nbsp;iTunes, VuduCommitment: 1 hour 30 minutesChasing Coral (2017)  100% (Netflix)What it is: After directing Chasing Ice in 2012, Jeff Orlowski turned his focus from the arctic to the ocean with Chasing Coral in 2017. The latter documents coral bleaching and the environmental impact of carbon emissions and pesticides on the reefs. Like many films on this list, this Netflix documentary is a call to consciousness regarding the tangible, quantifiable impacts of global warming.Critics Consensus: Chasing Coral offers a breathtakingly beautiful look at some of the Earth’s most incredible natural wonders while delivering a sobering warning about their uncertain future.Where to watch it: NetflixCommitment:&nbsp;1 hour 30 minutesThe Year Earth Changed (2021)  100% (Apple)What it is:&nbsp;This timely documentary narrated by David Attenborough reflects on the past year, during which the COVID-19 pandemic effectively shut down several aspects of everyday life for many of us and, rather unexpectedly, served as an invitation for elements of the natural world to creep back into virtually empty cities. It’s a fascinating look at an unprecedented phenomenon and a testament to the resilience of nature. The release of&nbsp;The Year the Earth Changed also coincides with two other Apple TV+ originals: the second seasons&nbsp;of both the Paul Rudd-narrated&nbsp;Tiny World&nbsp;and the Tom Hiddleston-narrated&nbsp;Earth at Night in Color. (We assume you can gather what they’re about from their titles.)Where to watch it:&nbsp;Apple TV+Commitment:&nbsp;48 minutesMarch of the Penguins (2005)  94% (National Geographic)What it is:&nbsp;For viewers of a certain age,&nbsp;March of the Penguins&nbsp;represents their first exposure to nature documentaries. Thanks to some incredible cinematography, a compelling narrative, and the unforgettable voice of Morgan Freeman, the film&nbsp;was a hit at the box office and became a pop culture touchstone, going on to win the Oscar for Best Documentary. The sequel,&nbsp;March of the Penguins 2: The Next Step, can be streamed on Hulu.Critics Consensus: Only the most hardened soul won’t be moved by this heartwarming doc.Where to watch it:&nbsp;Tubi, HBO MaxCommitment:&nbsp;1 hour 20 minutesMy Octopus Teacher (2020)  97% (Netflix)What it is:&nbsp;Rather than a broad, sweeping look at the natural world,&nbsp;My Octopus Teacher&nbsp;instead offers a more intimate story about one man’s journey to self discovery, thanks in large part to the&nbsp;unique relationship he forms with — you guessed it — an octopus. The Oscar-nominated documentary follows South African free diver Craig Foster, who meets an unusually curious octopus during one of his dives and chronicles a year of his experiences bonding with the creature. In the process, Foster learns to appreciate his own life and humanity’s crucial ties to nature.Where to watch it:&nbsp;NetflixCommitment:&nbsp;1 hour 24 minutesDavid Attenborough: A Life on Our Planet (2020)  95% (Netflix)What it is:&nbsp;As evidenced by this list, Sir David Attenborough has been the elegant, soothing voice behind many of the best nature documentaries ever produced, and his work over the past half century has not only highlighted the most astonishing wonders of our planet but also advocated for a greater dedication to ecological preservation. This documentary — narrated by Attenborough himself, of course — utilizes his remarkable life as a backdrop to examine how drastically the world has changed during the course of his career, and it serves as his personal “witness statement” to&nbsp;encourage humanity to fundamentally change its relationship with nature for the greater good.Where to watch it:&nbsp;NetflixCommitment:&nbsp;1 hour 23 minutesOn an Apple device?

It has become a hallmark of Black cinema, and impacted the industry by blending romance and sports in a new way. Since then, she has worked on projects in other genres because she refuses to be pigeonholed – both in TV and film. (Though she did return to romance, triumphantly, in the acclaimed drama Beyond the Lights.)Her latest film, the big-budget adaptation of Greg Rucka’s graphic novel, The Old Guard, was perhaps her biggest departure yet. Starring Charlize Theron, Kiki Layne, Chiwetel Ejiofor, and more, the action flick hit Netflix last year after a planned theatrical release was scuttled by the COVID-19 pandemic. Action is a genre that few women get the opportunity to tackle, and there are even fewer Black women at the helm of big-budget action features. Prince-Bythewood may have pushed the door open a little further: The Old Guard was a huge success for the streaming service, with 72 million views in the first month of release and talk of a sequel. She is following it up with The Woman King, starring Viola Davis as General Nanisca of Dahomey, who leads all-female unit known as the Dahomey Amazons who fought back against the French in the 19th century.Read more: Filmmaker Selects: Alma Har’el’s 10 Movies (and a Series) for Women’s History MonthRead more: Filmmaker Selects: Issa Lópex’s 10 Movies For Women’s History MonthAs part of our “Filmmaker Selects” series for Women’s History Month, Prince-Bythewood shared 10 films from creatives that inspired her, and spoke with Top Critic Valerie Complex about what makes her tick, her favorite directors, and what the future is looking like for women filmmakers.Gina Prince-Bythewood on the set of The Old Guard. (Photo by Mohammad Kamal © Netflix 2020)Valerie Complex for Rotten Tomatoes: Do you miss the movie theater?Gina Prince-Bythewood: Yes! I love the collective theater experience of sitting with a group of people I don’t know, yet we all laugh/cry at the same thing. I love sitting in the theater when those opening credits come up. Especially when it’s a movie that I’ve done and it’s an exciting moment we all have to miss right now.What was the first film that made you really want to become a director?Prince-Bythewood: It’s interesting because I didn’t have that epiphany watching a movie. I had that epiphany that I was a director working on a movie. I was working on a student film at UCLA. I was on set and looked around then it hit me in that moment: you’re a director. From then on, I worked on improving the craft and watching great films, which is the benefit of film school. You get to see so many movies that you normally wouldn’t be able to. As time moved forward, I became more and more enamored with the craft and the power of filmmaking.Being on set, what were some of the challenges you remember having when shooting your first feature Love &amp; Basketball?Prince-Bythewood: While in school, you’re given room to fail, but for Love &amp; Basketball, that was my first shot. I worked on the script for so long and fought hard to make it. I was in a constant state of anxiety that I couldn’t fail. It was the fear of: If I blow this, I’ll blow my entire career. Working on the film, the crew developed a sense of family, and everyone there wanted me to win, which helped fuel me to see it through to the end.Gina Prince-Bythewood and Sanaa Lathan while making Love &amp; Basketball. (Photo by © New Line Cinema)When you talk about that collective anxiety about failure, where does that stem from for you? Is it like a collective thing of being a woman, and being a woman of color? Was it being new in the industry? All of the above?Prince-Bythewood: It’s history. Women, Black folks, and people of color don’t have the luxury of failure in this industry. It is very hard to get a second film, and a third film. Suddenly, you look around and you don’t see anybody that looks like you – and I learned this pretty early on in my career.Are there any particular women filmmakers that you admire?Prince-Bythewood: Well, there is Kathryn Bigelow, and Euzhan Palcy – she is someone who looks like me, and is working with people like Marlon Brando. Then there is Kasi Lemmons who directed Eve’s Bayou. It’s a film I respect immensely and was so different from anything that had come out before it. When Eve’s Bayou came out, it was on such another level. The craft, the storytelling, the performances inspired me. The two sisters and their story, the performance that she got from Journee Smollett and Meagan Good, that movie stayed with me. I thought it was such an incredible debut from Kasi. I’ll never forget when I met Kasi before directing Love &amp; Basketball, and she was so giving of her time, support, and encouragement.Adepero Oduye in Dee Rees’ Pariah. (Photo by © Focus Features)What new filmmakers are you into right now?Prince-Bythewood: There are also some dope young women out there. I get excited, not only by their work and their talent, but the fight. I know what it takes to get a film made, and for them to have the grit to get it done is impressive. There is Dee Rees, her film Pariah blew me away. I loved Tina Mabry’s film Mississippi Damned; Little Woods by Nia DaCosta, and looking forward to her next film Candyman; and Channing Godfrey Peoples, who impressed me with Miss Juneteenth.Miss Juneteenth is such a great film.Prince-Bythewood: The movie took me into a world that I had no idea existed. There are a couple of scenes in there that are devastating to watch in the best way. Peoples did phenomenal world-building, which brought me into this small Texas community and taught me something. I cared about Turquoise (Nicole Beharie) and her daughter Kai (Alexis Chikaeze). She wants a better life for them both, and will do what it takes to change her circumstance. I just think Peoples created something special.I hear you really enjoyed Mati Diop’s first feature film, Atlantics, as well. I saw that one at Cannes in 2019.Prince-Bythewood: There was a lot of buzz about it, and I finally got a screener to watch it. I’m glad I didn’t know much about the film because it was exciting to experience that way. It’s a quiet, beautiful movie, and I was just so invested in the love story. It’s beautiful, surprising, and heartbreaking.Radha Blank in The Forty-Year-Old Version. (Photo by © Netflix)And one of your favorites of last year is The Forty-Year-Old Version, which is written and directed by Radha Blank.Prince-Bythewood: Blank created something with all the elements: There’s drama, comedy, and an honest depiction of one woman’s life who works in the creative arts. She has a fresh voice and clear vision that’s dope, dynamic, and bold. And shooting in black-and-white? A brilliant touch. I also loved the music and how it helps tell the story. It’s the best kind of humor because it comes from a place of truth.Your portfolio is super diversified. Like you got action, drama, romance. Do you like to do it all? Do you want to experiment with horror next? What’s coming?Prince-Bythewood: I love every genre except for horror and westerns. I can’t even tell you why. That’s not to say I can’t recognize a great western or horror film, but it’s not my thing. Personally, I crave to do another love story. That is my favorite genre. However, I certainly want to see women, particularly Black women, creating in every genre. The next thing I am working on is The Woman King with Viola Davis. It’s a historical epic. I’m so hyped about the project because it’s a beautiful story, and we don’t often get epics of this caliber with women at the forefront.Kiki Layne with Gina Prince-Bythewood on the set of The Old Guard. (Photo by Amy Spinks / © Netflix)Do you think, since you directed Love &amp; Basketball, that the industry has changed for women filmmakers?Prince-Bythewood: It’s interesting you asked that, because I came across an interview I did 21 years ago during the press tour for Love &amp; Basketball, and I talked about my hopes for the future, and the fact that we’re still having those conversations 21 years later is wild to me. When I shot The Old Guard I thought to myself that few women get the opportunity to do big tent-pole and action films. When I was in film school we had Kathryn Bigelow. She was the only woman I knew doing big-budget movies.This past year, seven of us – and the majority of us, women of color – got the opportunity to do the high title films. However, you can’t get too excited though because you see the actual numbers and it’s like, “Oh my God, how is this still happening? How are we at 12% of anything?!” But it’s important to remember there are so many great films by a fantastic group of women that are in the awards conversation this year and it’s long overdue.Kathryn Bigelow on the set of Point Break in 1991. (Photo by Courtesy the Everett Collection)What do you hope to see for the future for not just women directors, but for Black women specifically? Paint a picture of how that would work if you had it your way.Prince-Bythewood: More Black women in the director’s chair. I had this conversation with Regina King for another publication and we talked about that, what we bring as Black women to our storytelling. Hollywood needs to understand that we all bring something different, that we are not a monolith. We don’t all share the same experiences, so we need women who are bringing different things, in different genres to the table. My life experiences are what’s important to me and a large part of my work. Things are wide open, and there are so many stories and different perspectives to share. I want all of these women to have the opportunity to tell a story that no one else can tell.Gina Prince-Bythewood’s The Old Guard is available on Netflix; Love &amp; Basketball, The Secret Life of Bees, and Beyond the Lights are available on Vudu and FandangoNOW.Gina Prince-Bythewood’s 10 Films for Women’s History MonthWhale Rider (2003) 91%Only males are allowed to ascend to chiefdom in a Maori tribe in New Zealand.

Eve, though, manages to find some solace with her quirky psychic aunt, Mozelle (Debbi Morgan).Critics Consensus: Eve’s Bayou marks a striking feature debut for director Kasi Lemmons, layering terrific performances and Southern mysticism into a measured meditation on disillusionment and forgiveness.Written and directed by Kasi LemmonsAtlantics (2019) 96%In Dakar, a group of construction workers abandon their work on a sky-scraper in response to months of withheld wages.

From promising releases from new voices to&nbsp;experimental efforts&nbsp;from storied filmmakers – or perhaps the next indie darling to go the distance for end-of-year accolades – we will break it all down for you here each week in Fresh&nbsp;Indie Finds.&nbsp;This week at the specialty box office,&nbsp;we focus on three&nbsp;dark new films&nbsp;that will terrify you in exciting, original, and confronting ways. Fun, right? Walton Goggins plays a snake-charming faith healer with a dark&nbsp;disposition in Them That Follow;&nbsp;Octavia Spencer plays the meddlesome teacher of a star student who may be hiding a secret in Luce;&nbsp;and director Jennifer Kent chronicles the horrors of colonization in Australia&nbsp;for her The Babadook follow-up,&nbsp;The Nightingale. In our indie trailer section, we see have our first look at&nbsp;Robert Pattinson – OK, fine,&nbsp;Battinson – in The Lighthouse&nbsp;and the first trailer for&nbsp;a Sundance standout.Opening This WeekendThe Nightingale (2019)  86%&nbsp;Jennifer Kent’s The Nightingale is visceral, disturbing, and – according to many critics –&nbsp;required viewing. An Irish indentured convict in colonial Australia, Clare (Aisling Franciosi), is subjected to the worst tortures imaginable at the hands her captor/employer&nbsp;British lieutenant, Hawkins (Sam Claflin). Left for dead after a brutal attack, Clare awakens hell-bent on retribution. She enlists&nbsp;– with some force – the help of an Indigenous man named Billy (Baykali Ganambarr) to track her prey, and we follow along her arduous trek through the Tasmanian&nbsp;wilderness in pursuit. It’s a difficult but profound film, writes&nbsp;Los Angeles Times critic&nbsp;Justin Chang&nbsp;of the film that’s currently Certified Fresh at 80%.&nbsp;Kent&nbsp;told us&nbsp;at the Sundance Film Festival that her frank and unsparing approach to the material, which has divided some audiences, is all “in service to the story,” adding that “it [was] a really brutal time. But I think [the time] where we’re living now is brutal.”Playing&nbsp;New York and Los Angeles this weekend and&nbsp;expanding to limited screens August 9.&nbsp;Luce (2019)  90%&nbsp;We called out Octavia Spencer’s complex portrayal of a concerned schoolteacher in Luce&nbsp;as one of the standout performances from Sundance early this year, and soon audiences will see why. She’s that&nbsp;good – but so is the film, according to critics. The story is simple but deep, adapted from an acclaimed play by J.C. Lee; Katie Walsh of the&nbsp;Chicago Tribune&nbsp;says it’s a “contained drama that contains the whole nation, where every character represents an aspect of how race, class and justice collide in this country.”&nbsp;Luce (Kelvin Harrison Jr.) is a star student-athlete and model teen in every way; he’s also a&nbsp;former African child soldier who was adopted by an affluent white family.

As for general audiences, there are countless movies that open in just a few theaters in the biggest markets (i.e. Los Angeles and New York) before transitioning unceremoniously to home video, eluding the notice of most casual moviegoers entirely. Luckily, the staff at RT are here to offer up some recommendations for films we personally loved that quite possibly came and went from your local theater — or never arrived at all — without much fanfare. Maybe you’re familiar with some of these and simply never got around to seeing them, or maybe this is the first time you’ve heard of them; either way, there’s a good chance you’ll find something new and interesting in our list of compelling 2019 limited releases below.The Biggest Little Farm (2019)  91%It’s difficult to describe the documentary The Biggest Little Farm without feeling as though you’re pitching a quirky sitcom: John and Molly Chester are an adorable married couple living in Los Angeles who, sick of the urban grind, decide to hatch a manic scheme: they’ll sink their savings into starting a farm! What the film offers, though, is a beautifully woven story of a family investing not merely money, but also their faith literally into the ground as they slowly construct a 213-acre biodynamic farm. Apricot Lane Farms was founded on a holistic approach, meaning every element on the property serves a connective purpose in the entire farm’s growth and survival (for example, the animals’ manure nurtures the soil, which then sustains the ground plants that feed their sheep, and so forth). Spanning an eight-year timeline, The Biggest Little Farm allows us an intimate look at the complex ecosystem at a working farm, depicting the high points – adorable animals, of course, including the marvelous Emma the pig – but also the low, such as the ongoing struggle with natural hardships and the impact of climate change on the Chesters’ utopian vision. Although it wanders into too-cute territory at times, The Biggest Little Farm is, at its core, an inspired look at the impact of humans purposely learning to coexist with nature. The perseverance and sincere aim of the Chesters is a heartening reminder that if we don’t give up on the Earth, she won’t give up on us. —&nbsp;Jenny JedinyAvailable on: Amazon, FandangoNOW, Google Play, iTunes,&nbsp;VuduFast Color (2019)  81%Julia Hart’s&nbsp;Fast Color&nbsp;deserves your attention. The multigenerational family drama about a black woman with unexplainable powers played in just 25 theaters this year and had almost no marketing to speak of, but still managed to be one of the most poignant looks at the superhero narrative in the last decade. Instead of going bigger,&nbsp;Fast Color&nbsp;made everything smaller, keeping the stakes to the realm of the family, and exploring how the vast possibilities presented by superhuman abilities might be exploited in a dying world. Lorainne Toussiant and Gugu Mbatha-Raw give incredible performances as Bo and Ruth, an estranged mother and daughter bonded by trauma and their love of Ruth’s daughter Lila (Saniyya Sidney). This Certified Fresh original film is a nuanced take on responsibility, guilt, and grief, effectively built inside a genre we all know and love. —&nbsp;Cate YoungAvailable on:&nbsp;Amazon Prime, FandangoNOW,&nbsp;Google Play, iTunes,&nbsp;VuduGreener Grass (2019)  81%Welcome to a twisted vision of American suburbia — as if there’s any other interesting kind in the movies. Greener Grass takes a pillowy sledgehammer to the trappings of upper-middle-class home life to a repellent extreme. There’s “courtesy”: Neighbors spend minutes at four-way stop signs, imploring everyone else to go first. There’s “looking good”: Everyone unnecessarily wears braces. There’s “jealousy”: A woman puts a soccer ball under her dress for the pregnancy attention, and then gives so-called birth to it later. There’s “being disappointed in your kids”: A dad thinks his son is a loser until his problem is solved after he falls in a pool and turns into a golden retriever. And there’s “being neighborly”: A woman gives her friend her newborn baby for the hell of it — of course, there’s the matter of what happens when she wants it back… Jocelyn DeBoer and Dawn Luebbe pull off triple duty as stars, writers, directors, the Tim and Eric of this placid, candy-coated nightmare. Comedies of this head-scratching and disgusting variety often fall under the direction of men, and they’re normally repulsive to look at and listen to from the top down. That’s their, uh, charm. But DeBoer and Luebbe use a more fanciful touch: The sets are carefully arranged and presented, the colors pop, and there isn’t really the threat of imminent violence — which of course makes this demonic comedy of manners all the more pressurized and chaotic.&nbsp;— Alex VoAvailable on: Amazon,&nbsp;Google Play, iTunes,&nbsp;VuduHer Smell (2019)  84%I love Alex Ross Perry movies, but I’ve never been sure whether or not the writer-director has much love for people. Gifted at writing memorably vicious put-downs and mining agonizing tension from passive aggression, the indie filmmaker has made a name for himself with caustic chamber pieces about acerbic characters who are confronted by their own narcissism, only to emerge from the tumult even more misanthropic than before. Not so with Her Smell, the enfant terrible’s most redemptive film yet. Elisabeth Moss stars as tempestuous rocker Becky Something, whose abuse of her body and all of those within her proximity blazes a steady march towards self-immolation in the film’s first half. The slow-motion train wreck gives way to shaky optimism as Becky slowly rebuilds her life, haunted by past mistakes. This marks the director and star’s third collaboration, and Moss is astonishing as a musical dynamo who is too enthralled by the demons raging inside her mind to ever consider the damage she is wreaking upon colleagues and family. Her Smell&nbsp;is not just a vehicle for one of this generation’s greatest actresses, however; the ensemble is rich with some of the year’s best performances, from Agyness Deyn as a bandmate at the end of her rope to Eric Stoltz’s indefatigably patient manager. Perry’s evident affection for punk rock also infuses the set-pieces — which are almost exclusively confined to green rooms and recording studios — with an anarchic energy. Her Smell&nbsp;is an exhausting and rewarding testament to Moss’ power as a performer and evidence that Perry may be developing a soft spot for people after all.&nbsp;—&nbsp;Rob FowlerAvailable on:&nbsp;Amazon, FandangoNOW, Google Play, iTunes,&nbsp;VuduHigh Life (2019)  82%The last few years, we have been gifted with a glut of space films that have taken great pains to explore the way humans love and find meaning in the galaxy, but none will disgust and mystify you the way that Claire Denis’&nbsp;High Life&nbsp;will. Anchored by an arresting performance from Robert Pattinson and haunting&nbsp;work from Juliette Binoche, the film follows a group of prisoners sent on a space mission to explore a black hole and jumps back in forth in time filling us in on how its passengers were taken out. Denis dismisses the sleek and lavish looks of films like 2014’s&nbsp;Interstellar or this year’s&nbsp;Ad Astra&nbsp;in favor of a minimalist design, and unlike those films,&nbsp;High Life&nbsp;chooses to retain its focus inward on the existential dread that pervades those aboard. In space, no one can hear you cry? Denis explores what really lies underneath the surface of human nature with poetic rigor.&nbsp;High Life&nbsp;is angry. It’s ugly. But it’s beautiful and even hopeful. You will see nothing else like this, and its hypnotic allure will draw you in and never let go.&nbsp;—&nbsp;Daisy GonzalezAvailable on:&nbsp;Amazon Prime,&nbsp;FandangoNOW,&nbsp;Google Play, iTunes,&nbsp;VuduThe Last Black Man in San Francisco (2019)  92%Change is inevitable, but that doesn’t make it any easier to swallow. The Last Black Man in San Francisco deftly captures the uncomfortable truths of change, both environmental and internal. The story follows Jimmie (Jimmie Fails) and his best friend Mont (Jonathan Majors) as they attempt to save the most precious thing in San Francisco: the house Jimmie’s grandfather built with his own two hands, now unlovingly left to rot by its new owners. Though his methods are not always… by the book, Jimmie is determined to do whatever he can to ensure the home of his dreams and the dreams of his forefathers aren’t lost to the endlessly hungry monster that is gentrification. It’s a story of love and devotion, obsession and mythology, and above all, how difficult and disorienting change can be. It’s a familiar message to many living in quickly changing metropolitan areas: As money moves in, places once sacred are quickly consumed and repurposed for the new tenants. The Last Black Man in San Francisco explores the feeling of that change with poise, beauty, and of course, a lot of heartache. Visually,&nbsp;the film&nbsp;is stunning; shots are composed like paintings, with rich light bouncing off of deep saturation to create tableaus that look like oil paintings come to life. Fails and Majors’ easy chemistry and charming idiosyncrasies make it easy to root for them, even when they make questionable choices, while&nbsp;Rob Richert and Joe Talbot’s script gives them plenty to play with and surrounds them with an equally compelling cast of characters. But more than anything, The Last Black Man in San Francisco captures the beauty and suffering that is watching something you love die and become something entirely new, for better or worse. — Haña Lucero-ColinAvailable on: Amazon Prime,&nbsp;FandangoNOW, Google Play, iTunes,&nbsp;VuduLittle Woods (2019)  95%Enjoying debut films tends to be an exercise in forgiveness.&nbsp; They’re made with limited resources, yet are under tremendous pressure to strive for perfection. They need to stand out long after the festival buzz has died down and hopefully become a career stepping stone for the filmmaker. As far as premiere films go,&nbsp;Little&nbsp;Woods&nbsp;definitely has a leg up, with stars Tessa Thompson, Lily James, and Lance Reddick.&nbsp; However, the film ends up being a showcase for filmmaker&nbsp;and native New Yorker Nia DaCosta’s poised voice as she&nbsp;puts forth a tense, emotionally honest look at what it means to be a woman living in rural poverty.&nbsp;Little&nbsp;Woods&nbsp;sometimes brushes up against romanticizing said poverty. The grit, rust, and long stretches of road at times feel poetic, rather than a harsh reality, but that’s almost unavoidable with DaCosta’s use of the gorgeous scenery that surrounds the film. The environment is a constant reminder that just outside of truck stops, fracking sites, and homeless encampments&nbsp;are natural riches the characters are rarely able to enjoy. Like Frozen River and Winter’s Bone, these wide open spaces are both awe-inspiring&nbsp;and threatening. Tessa Thompson’s Ollie and Lily James’ Deb are facing homelessness and an unwanted pregnancy unless Ollie manages to make some quick cash smuggling prescription pills across the Canadian border. However, Ollie is still on probation from a previous drug-running charge. Part heist and part rural noir, the film is still, at its core, an evocative, moving, family drama. If all this doesn’t make you want to see&nbsp;Little&nbsp;Woods, maybe this will: DaCosta’s been tapped to direct the upcoming Candyman reboot produced by Jordan Peele. — Sara AtaiiyanAvailable on: Amazon, FandangoNOW, Google Play, iTunes,&nbsp;VuduLuce (2019)  90%In 2018, director Julius Onah&nbsp;gave us&nbsp;The Cloverfield Paradox, which came in at 19% on the Tomatometer; in 2019, he released&nbsp;Luce, which stunned at Sundance and went on to land at a Certified Fresh 93% – and just happens to be one of my favorite films of the year. Talk about a turnaround.&nbsp;Luce&nbsp;did well enough at the specialty box office when it was released in September, and has earned three Independent Spirit Award nominations – for Onah, for Kelvin Harrison Jr., who plays the titular overachieving high school student, and for Octavia Spencer, who plays the teacher who sees something off in him. Yet it confounds me that this complex drama (almost a thriller, in some ways) isn’t lighting up awards seasons and top 10 lists. Based on a play by J.C. Lee, who also wrote the screenplay, the story centers on teenaged Luce, a star athlete and student, who was adopted as a young child after spending his early years in war-torn Eritrea; when his teacher brings a troubling essay he’s written to the attention of his adoptive parents (a harrowed and perfectly cast Tim Roth and Naomi Watts), they’re forced to wonder if their son is as perfect – and level-headed – as he seems. It’s the kind of set-up that could get silly if overplayed by any of the actors or oversteered by the director, but the work here is subtle, the audience left to guess at the truth and various motivations. Harrison Jr., who many will have seen in&nbsp;Waves&nbsp;this year, is great as the terrify-er/charmer at the movie’s center, and Octavia Spencer gives one of the best supporting performances of any man or woman on screen this year as the teacher who seems to see him for what he is. Seriously: Nominate her. It’s a small story, contained, and at times it can’t shake off its stage roots, but it’s also somehow big and bold and about everything happening in America right now. Onah didn’t need to go to space to make his mark – he found liftoff in a drab suburban high school. —&nbsp;Joel MearesAvailable on:&nbsp;Amazon,&nbsp;FandangoNOW,&nbsp;Google Play,&nbsp;iTunes,&nbsp;VuduThe Nightingale (2019)  86%Jennifer Kent followed up her critically acclaimed horror film The Babadook (Certified Fresh at 98%) with this war story set in 1825 colonial Australia. Aisling Franciosi (Game of Thrones) plays Clare, an abused convict who has served out her seven-year sentence and is desperate to be free of her overseer, Lieutenant Hawkins (Sam Claflin) of the British military. When her husband Aidan (Michael Sheasby) retaliates for Hawkins’ refusal to release Clare, Hawkins and his men commit atrocities against her and her small family. Left for dead, Clare then finds herself on the road to vengeance, chasing the lieutenant and his men north, where Hawkins hopes to secure a promotion. Clare faces more brutalities along the road, with Aboriginal tracker Billy (Baykali Ganambarr) as the reluctant guide and unwilling protector of the traumatized and hostile young woman. A limited release in the States, the harrowing film was nominated for the Golden Lion at the Venice Film Festival, won several festival and critics awards, and took six Australian Academy of Cinema and Television Arts awards, including best film, screenplay, direction, lead actress, supporting actress, and casting. The Nightingale is also Certified Fresh at 87% on the Tomatometer with 220 reviews. “Jennifer Kent’s The Nightingale is a film that bruises the soul,” wrote critic Clarisse Loughrey of the UK’s Independent. “One of the most powerful films yet seen about the country’s colonial foundation and the cruelties that were an indelible part of it,” Sydney Morning Herald critic Sandra Hall wrote. Rolling Stone’s Pete Travers praised Franciosi: “In Jennifer Kent’s pulverizing revenge tale, Aisling Franciosi delivers a tour de force as an Australian woman determined to put a stake through the heart of toxic masculinity. You won’t know what hit you.” —&nbsp;Debbie DayAvailable on:&nbsp;Amazon, Google Play, iTunes,&nbsp;VuduThis is not Berlin (2019)  82%Director Hari Sama’s This is Not Berlin is a coming-of-age story through the lens of 1980s Mexico City’s underground arts scene. It follows 17-year-old Carlos (Xabiani Ponce de León) as he falls in love with punk music, discovers drugs, explores his sexuality, shaves himself an undercut, sheds his shame, and challenges the world around him. When the film begins, Carlos is quiet, the least inclined of his classmates to engage in violent brawls, despite the fact that his masculinity appears to depend on it. When he discovers a space filled with eyeliner and protest art, he’s all-in. And the rest of the film sees him navigating his place in that space, where his talents as an engineer can be leveraged to amplify his voice. Carlos’ transformation is beautiful, and Sama’s direction places us right there with him through every peak and valley. This is Not Berlin paints a gritty, deeply felt portrait of teenage angst — the pressures, the temptations, the desire to be understood and heard by the world.&nbsp;—&nbsp;Sophie-Marie PrimeAvailable on:&nbsp;Amazon, FandangoNOW, Google Play,&nbsp;iTunes,&nbsp;VuduVillains (2019)  85%Writer-directors Dan Berk and Robert Olsen’s darkly comedic third feature is exactly the kind of oddball treat I tend to&nbsp;seek out when I’m exhausted from heavy Oscar contenders and numb from blockbuster pyrotechnics. It’s a fairly contained cat-and-mouse game of a thriller that makes the most of its dedicated cast, who all get individual moments to shine and look like they’re having a&nbsp;blast with their characters. The setup isn’t especially revolutionary: Petty criminals Mickey and Jules&nbsp;(Bill Skarsgård and Maika Monroe from&nbsp;It&nbsp;and&nbsp;It Follows&nbsp;— no relation) break into what looks like an ordinary house in search of a getaway vehicle, only to be confronted by the homeowners, George and Gloria (Jeffrey Donovan and Kyra Sedgwick), a disturbed married couple who just happen to have a young girl chained up in their basement. The tables quickly turn, before they turn again, and then again, but the moments in between are populated by off-kilter humor and little touches that almost —&nbsp;almost — make you root for everyone involved, particularly thanks to a quartet of no-holds-barred performances. It’s not the most subversive thriller, nor is it without a handful of predictable moments, but it’s just weird enough, funny enough, and vicious enough to scratch multiple itches for me. Plus, Jeffrey Donovan’s George, with his lazy drawl and mannered affectations, is the most charming psychopath this side of Ted Bundy, and he is just so much fun to watch. — Ryan FujitaniAvailable on: Amazon, FandangoNOW, Google Play, iTunes,&nbsp;VuduLike this?

But for many, summer also means catching up with or checking in on great documentaries. At home and in theaters, summer always boasts a fresh crop of gripping true-to-life&nbsp;stories to keep us entertained.To help you narrow down your choices, we’ve put together a list of some our favorite Fresh and Certified Fresh docs that you can stream today or catch in theaters now or very soon. From socially conscious&nbsp;documentaries to harrowing retrospectives on historic events – with dynamic subjects like Aretha Franklin, Anton Yelchin, Beto O’Rourke, and disgraced Silicon Valley CEO Elizabeth Holmes – we have you covered with our list of the some of the&nbsp;buzziest&nbsp;true-life feature films of the year so far, and where to watch them.Stream it: Apollo 11 (2019)  99%Unprecedented access to unreleased audio from the Apollo 11 space mission gave director&nbsp;Todd Douglas Miller a whole new avenue to craft a unique story about well-known events. Premiering at the Sundance Film Festival, this reconstruction of humanity’s first successful trip to the moon uses archival footage to completely enthrall the audiences. Expect the movie, which is one of the best-reviewed films of the year, to be a big contender in Documentary categories come awards season.Critics Consensus: Edifying and inspiring in equal measure,&nbsp;Apollo 11&nbsp;uses artfully repurposed archival footage to send audiences soaring back to a pivotal time in American history.Where to watch it:&nbsp;Stream it now on,&nbsp;FandangoNow,&nbsp;Amazon,&nbsp;Vudu,&nbsp;Google.Stream it: Knock Down the House (2019)  99%What it is:&nbsp;When documentarian Rachel Lears started filming&nbsp;Knock Down the House, she was solely interested in documenting four progressive Democrats who had challenged incumbents. Each faced tough odds, but no one could predict that one of the film’s subjects, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez&nbsp;of New York, would become one of the most talked about politicians in the legislature. The film documents AOC’s road to the ballot box alongside Amy Vilela of Nevada,&nbsp;Cori Bush&nbsp;of Missouri, and&nbsp;Paula Jean Swearengin&nbsp;of West Virginia.Critics Consensus:&nbsp;A galvanizing glimpse behind the scenes of a pivotal election,&nbsp;Knock Down the House&nbsp;should prove engrossing for viewers of all political persuasions.Where to watch it:&nbsp;Stream it on Netflix.Stream it soon: Amazing Grace (2019)  99%What it is:&nbsp;The late Queen of Soul, Aretha Franklin, was in a decades-long legal battle with the man behind the concert doc Amazing Grace. Originally intended for release by Warner Bros. in 1972, director&nbsp;Alan Elliott’s film was long delayed as he spent time trying to find lost footage&nbsp;and fend off legal challenges from Franklin. Though never publicly stated, Elliott maintains the soul singer’s suit and objections were just a negotiating tactic.&nbsp;After the singer’s death, her estate reached an agreement with Elliott and Amazing Grace was cleared to premiere in 2018. Shot by late director Sydney Pollack and reassembled by Elliott, the feature lives as the only video documentation of one of the best-selling gospel albums in history and an enduring tribute to the late singer at the height of her power.&nbsp;&nbsp;Critics Consensus: Brilliantly capturing a remarkable performer near the peak of her prodigious power,&nbsp;Amazing Grace&nbsp;is a thrilling must-watch documentary for Aretha Franklin fans.Where to watch it: Currently in limited release.&nbsp;Available for digital download or on Blu-Ray&nbsp;and DVD August 6.Stream It: Running with Beto (2019)  91%What it is:&nbsp;Regardless of your political leanings,&nbsp;Running with Beto is a highly entertaining and intimate look at a candidate&nbsp;running against&nbsp;political convention. A Democrat has not won a statewide election in Texas for over 25 years, but with a millennial-friendly social media strategy and old-fashioned grassroots campaigning Texas Congressman Beto O’Rourke made a serious run against incumbent Senator Ted Cruz.&nbsp;Running With Beto&nbsp;captures the drama of the campaign.Critics Consensus: Candid and compelling,&nbsp;Running with Beto&nbsp;is an illuminating exploration of an up-and-coming politician and the changing political landscape around him.Where to watch it:&nbsp;Watch on HBO or HBONow.In theaters: Pavarotti (2019)  87%What it is:&nbsp;In the age&nbsp; ofInstagram celebs it’s hard to believe that at one time – for several decades in fact – one of the biggest stars in the world was an opera singer. Luciano Pavarotti transcended the&nbsp;opera singer stereotype to become a bona fide A-list celebrity and live a fascinating life.&nbsp;Handled by a rock-and-roll manager, Pavarotti lived the life of a hard-rock&nbsp;frontman and documented much of what happened. Director Ron Howard was given access to the late singer’s home movies and – for the first time – given permission to interview Pavarotti’s wives, children, and closest friends.Critics Consensus:&nbsp;Pavarotti&nbsp;pays entertaining tribute to a towering cultural figure with a documentary whose evident affection for its subject proves contagious.Where to watch it:&nbsp;Currently in limited theatrical release.In theaters: The Biggest Little Farm (2019)  91%&nbsp;What it is:&nbsp;When a noise complaint about their dog got them&nbsp;evicted them from their apartments, filmmaker John Chester and his chef wife Molly Chester bet it all on ‘The Farm.’ The revolutionary organic farm they created&nbsp;is actually a return to noncommercial farming techniques, and the trials and tribulations of achieving it&nbsp;are the focus of this documentary, which spans the course of seven years. A perfect watch if you’re looking for inspiration for your own veggie patch.Critics Consensus: Uplifting, educational, and entertaining,&nbsp;The Biggest Little Farm&nbsp;is an environmental advocacy documentary with a satisfying side dish of hope for the future.Where to watch it:&nbsp;Currently in limited theatrical release.Coming soon: Maiden (2019)  98%&nbsp;What it is: The tale of Tracy Edwards, a 24-year-old cook turned skipper for the first all-female crew to sail around the world, is&nbsp;one&nbsp;so incredible it sounds like a work of fiction. In truth, tired of being dismissed and passed over because of her gender, Edwards took on&nbsp;the male-dominated sailing competition Whitbread Round the World with her historic team entry. Following the formation of the crew and every battle they fought just to compete, this is one of the most rousing feelgood stories of the summer.Where to watch it:&nbsp;In&nbsp;limited release June 28.Stream it: The Inventor: Out for Blood in Silicon Valley (2019)  78%&nbsp;What it is:&nbsp;Elizabeth Holmes, the disgraced former CEO and founder of blood-testing startup Theranos, is another one of those figures destined to inspire hours of entertainment. She’s the subject of several books, countless articles, and an upcoming feature film with Jennifer Lawrence attached, and&nbsp;The&nbsp;Inventor: Out for Blood in Silicon Valley is the latest to feature the poster child for everything wrong with the tech industry and icon idolatry. Chronicled by Going Clear documentarian Alex Gibney, Stanford dropout Holmes was obsessed with Apple CEO Steve Jobs and molded herself in his image, crafting a house-of-cards empire built largely on hero worship and aggressive PR without having&nbsp;ever achieved&nbsp;actual success.Critics Consensus: Alex Gibney’s&nbsp;The Inventor&nbsp;declines to outright condemn the actions by Theranos founder Elizabeth Holmes, but instead provides a comprehensive overview of the scandal that allows viewers to mull over its implications towards the broader Silicon ValleyWhere to watch it: Watch on HBO or HBONow.Coming Soon: Love, Antosha (2019)  97%&nbsp;What it is:&nbsp;Actor Anton Yelchin was an artist that defied categorization. The star of blockbuster films like Star Trek, Terminator: Salvation, and The Smurfs and beloved indies like Green Room, Like Crazy, and Odd Thomas, Yelchin was a cinematic chameleon. The documentary gives us a peek inside the enigmatic actor’s life&nbsp;and his tragic death at the age 27. Editor Turned director Garret Price conducted interviews with Yelchin’s family and friends, including Chris Pine, JJ Abrams, Nicolas Cage, Bryce Dallas Howard, and Simon Pegg.Where to watch it:&nbsp;In limited theaters August 2.Coming&nbsp;Soon:&nbsp;Hail Satan? (2019)  96%&nbsp;What it is:&nbsp;Satanism takes center stage in the hilarious documentary Hail Satan?.&nbsp;The movie chronicles the satanic temple’s fight in deeply Christian Arkansas and forces audiences to reconsider the sect religion that is so often a punchline. After only 30 minutes of Hail Satan?, you’ll begin to question if the group&nbsp;is in fact comprised of assumed weirdo outcasts&nbsp;or something more like patriots.Critics Consensus: Hail Satan?&nbsp;challenges preconceived notions of its subject with a smart, witty, and overall entertaining dispatch from the front lines of the fight for social justice.Where to watch it:&nbsp;Available for digital download or on Blu-Ray and DVD July 23.Like this?

She sits front-row at the theater to be as close to the film as possible – no distractions from her fellow audience members, no popcorn-crunching, just her and the movie on a journey together.“The thing I always encourage people to do is go on a little adventure with movies,” Loughrey said. “Go on Tumblr and try and find some film that no one else has watched, that you will absolutely fall in love with – it will be your new favorite film, and you’ll be obsessed with it forever.”Like many movie and television fans, she likes to be challenged and appreciates authenticity. Her favorite Rotten movie is one she saw as a teenager and simply couldn’t shake: King Arthur, starring Keira Knightly and Clive Owen.“It’s just all swords and sandals, and every line is ridiculous and over the top,” she said. “It’s all like, ‘Scatter my ashes to a strong west wind.’ I love it because it’s just trying so hard, and I appreciate that.”Clarisse Loughrey is chief film critic at The Independent,&nbsp;appears on Kermode and Mayo’s Film Review (BBC Radio), and co-hosts The Next Supremes podcast. Find her on Twitter: @clarisselou.What have you been watching while sheltered-in-place?I’ve been overwhelmed by the amount of options now that I’m just home and I only have the internet – and the internet is filled with unlimited opportunities and every movie ever made on the planet is suddenly at my feet.I’ve got a subscription to MUBI, and that’s been very helpful because MUBI can tell you each day what film to watch. They always have a film of the day, and I love having that choice made for me. Also, it’s been great to go outside of my comfort zone a little bit because they have such a really eclectic mix of films. I’ve been watching stuff I probably normally wouldn’t seek out.What was the last film that you saw in a theater?In the UK, we’ve had a bit of a going back and forth with the cinemas being open and the cinemas being closed. I think the last film I saw in a cinema was a preview showing of Pixar’s Soul, which was at the London Film Festival.What is your preferred seat in a theater?I love to be right at the front so that the screen is so huge, and it’s taking up my entire viewpoint I can’t see anything else but the movie. I can’t see other people. It’s just me alone with the film.I love to feel small. I know that’s such a strange thing to say, but I love when you just feel like a little tiny speck in the universe. I love that movies do that sometimes, especially when you go see something epic and grand. To be right at the front going, “Oh, yeah. Nothing matters.” It’s great. It’s kind of freeing.(Photo by Warner Bros.)What is your personal record for the most movies you’ve watched in one day?I’ve done some all-day marathons, so it probably would be one of those. I watched all the Harry Potter movies just at once. Even if you’re a huge fan, don’t do it. It’s not humanly possible.I had a bad time around the point I got to the Half-Blood Prince. I just couldn’t deal with it anymore. Everything irritated me. Dumbledore irritated me. Hermione … Yeah. I feel like it was an experience, and I learned a lot from it. But, I’m now a “don’t try and cram a million movies in one day” kind of person.I respect that. I’m in awe that you got to the sixth movie before being like, “All right. I’m done with you all.”It’s when they do Dumbledore’s army. I was like, “This is annoying. Why can’t he just phone somebody? You are children. You’re children. You’re not going to beat Dumbledore.” … I don’t know. Get some adults. What is going on?Do you have a favorite childhood film?I was only shown Disney movies when I was a kid, which has been very strange in adulthood because people are so shocked that I haven’t seen Labyrinth. People are very angry that I haven’t seen Labyrinth, and I only saw Princess Bride recently because they were not Disney, so I was not shown them. It would have to be a Disney movie. I think the one I was most obsessed with was Hercules. I think it just came out at the right time, and I got so obsessed with it that I went to university to study ancient history.Is there an under-the-radar director or screenwriter that you think more people should know about?The first person I thought of was this director/actor/screenwriter called Gillian Wallace Horvat.I remember watching this short that she did called “Kiss Kiss Fingerbang.” It had Anton Yelchin and Kate Lyn Sheil in it… It is really dark but really funny; it takes this very, very surreal, incredibly dark turn. I just love the way that it felt so outrageous, but the moment you started unpacking it, you go, “That’s cool.” It’s actually a weirdly great metaphor for ideas of closing and control, and what does abuse look like in a relationship? It really stuck with me. Years and years and years have passed since I watched it.Since then, she’s directed her feature debut called I Blame Society, which just never arrived in the UK, so I haven’t been able to watch it. I’ve just been waiting. I’m like, “One day, she’s going to break out and do great things.”Who’s an up-and-coming critic that you want people to check out?The person that I have been reading the most at the moment is a critic and writer called Jack King (@jackarking), who is based in the UK. He writes a lot about queer cinema and especially the AIDS crisis and how that’s been depicted on film. He did these pieces on The Normal Heart and Boys in the Band that I found fantastic.What I’m really into at the moment from criticism is people who can find that balance between personal passion and insight and also historical and social context, which is really hard to do. This guy Jack, he’s really good at doing it, where you come away from the pieces always feeling like, “I have a greater understanding of the world, but also of this writer.” That, to me, is just one of the most impressive things you can do.What do you think is the biggest misconception about critics?Oh, I think that critics are telling you what to watch or telling you what to like.Every critic is just giving their opinion – and every opinion, I think, is informed by so many different things. It’s informed by your tastes, your perspective and your upbringing and your beliefs and a million things. And so, obviously, that’s why we see so many differences in what critics are writing, because they’re all coming from completely different places. That’s what I think is really cool about film criticism. You learn about the world as you read all these people’s opinions because you see where everyone’s coming from.I love reading somebody who is coming from a completely different position from me and sees the film in a completely different way, and reading it, you go, “I never thought about it that way before.”I think that’s what we should all be taking away from film criticism instead of looking at a review and going like, “Oh, this person told me that I should like this Star Wars movie.” That is not what we’re doing.(Photo by Walt Disney Pictures)What are you most proud of in your career so far?I’m one of the guest critics on a BBC radio show here called Mark Kermode’s and Simon Mayo’s Film Review. It’s live radio.My whole life, I have suffered from pretty bad anxiety and stage fright. I, at one point, wanted to be an actor, and I think the fear really stopped me from pursuing that properly. And so, being able to do that and go on live radio and speak to many, many people at the same time is terrifying but satisfying beyond words. It has been such an amazing, surreal experience. I just feel very proud of myself that I’m able to do that.I’d imagine that, as a writer, you spend so much time delicately thinking over your words – to be live sounds terrifying.Yeah. You can’t take it back, that’s the thing. If you write something and you hate it, you delete it. Radio, you say something, you can’t take it back. It’s totally terrifying.What is the hardest review that you’ve ever written – or, if it was on the radio, delivered live?The one I immediately thought of was just last year: I saw Cats and Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker – it was a double bill. My deadline for both of the reviews was the next morning. I really had to stay up all night writing about what, for me, were two incredibly surreal experiences.Cats, on a very obvious level – I feel like everyone had a very strange experience with that. But, also, I am a huge, huge Star Wars fan, and so, Rise of Skywalker was like three Christmases at the same time. But, then, the film didn’t really do the things I was hoping it would do, so I was dealing with all the emotions of that. That was just a really strange night.What’s your favorite classic film?Wilder’s The Apartment, because there’s something I love about just semi-optimistic endings – because that also has that feeling of everything could be terrible.You could be a loser and have nothing. You just feel like you’ve got nothing going on. But, there’s other people just like you, and maybe you’ll find them, and together you can be a little bit less of a loser. I don’t know why, but that, to me, is just like “yes.” That is how I want to see the world. That makes me feel great about everything.Do you have advice for critics who are still finding their voice?I think just try to be honest with yourself, because that’s what I find so hard about this industry.This is the thing. You are on a weekly basis exposing yourself to the world – not exposing yourself, because that sounds really dodgy, but exposing your soul to the world every week. You have to be quite vulnerable to do that. It’s scary, especially when it’s a film that is about something very personal or something controversial, and you’re really having to make your stand with it.It’s so easy to feel trapped by that and to feel scared, that you don’t want to be honest with yourself because you’re worried that, “Oh, that’s going to be different from how everyone else thinks. I’m going to go against the status quo. I’m going to stand out in a good way or a bad way.”Just have the courage to be like, “This is my honest opinion. I stand by it. I am being true to myself. This is my voice.” Stick by it. If people are being mean, just block them on Twitter, and find nice people who will support you.Is there someone in your life who isn’t a critic, whose opinion on movies you really admire?I would say my best friend, because when I’m having those anxieties about a review – and I think that my opinion might be terrible and stupid, and everyone will make fun of me – I go to my best friend. I will describe my opinion, and even if he hasn’t seen the film, he’s so good at listening and giving his take. We have quite similar taste in films, but in the ways that they vary, I find really interesting. We’re always wanting to talk about that because we have quite similar personalities. But, it’s like, why do we have such different tastes on a handful of specific movies?(Photo by Paramount Home Media Distribution)Is there an actor, director, or screenwriter whose work you always love?I’m a very big fan of Taika Waititi. Boy is, well, I think, my favorite movie, period, because there is something about his outlook on the world that I find so comforting. I could be having the worst day, and I just watch one of his films, particularly Boy, and it’s not so much the feeling that “everything’s going to be all right, don’t worry.” It’s more the feeling of “you can handle this,” which I think all of his movies have that kind of ending.Who are three people that you think everyone should follow on Twitter?I quite obsessively follow an account called Dancer on Film (@DancerOnFilm). It’s just clips of scenes of dancing in movies… It’s so fascinating how this tiny human action is just universal across time, country, language, genre. You’re always just going to find scenes of people dancing. I just find that really comforting for some reason.@TheFinalGirlsUK, which is run by my friend Anna Bogutskaya (@annabdemented). She is just my go-to expert for horror and feminism and those two things combined. She just runs an absolutely brilliant podcast, and also now expanding into a journal that explores those things. I always feel like I’m learning so much from her.Grace Barber-Plentie (@GraceSimone). She is one of these brilliant, all-around, people. She does marketing. She does programming. She does writing. I find her insights really useful because I think, as a film critic, I just sit and watch movies. … Sometimes I feel like I’m in a little bit of a bubble. So, I just always find her insights fascinating, from somebody who’s seeing the industry from all angles.What is the movie or show that you’ve seen more than anything else?I have watched American Horror Story so many times.When I mentioned my friend Anna [Bogutskaya], we have a podcast now about American Horror Story, where we’re now re-watching it from the beginning. We’re up to “Coven” at the moment.We’re both just really obsessed with it because it’s so ridiculous. It always feels like Ryan Murphy is trying to mess with the audience or troll his audience. I just find that great. I love a show creator who has some weird disdain for his own audience, where it’s like “how can I just make you really angry?” But, also, you love it.You’re angry, and you’re obsessed and in love with it. That, to me, is a Ryan Murphy show. If you have those two conflicting feelings, you’re watching a Ryan Murphy show. It’s kind of my comfort TV, but also my TV I like to yell at.The new season is Mermaids, I think, and I’m so excited. I’m so excited. Mermaids. Mermaids.He really knows how to deliver exactly what we want in exactly the way we don’t want it.You nailed it. You want it, but you’re like, “Why are you doing it this way?”Do you have a favorite season?My favorite is “Hotel” because it’s the most ridiculous of them all.The Rudolph Valentino storyline … I think he’s a fan of classic cinema. I nearly threw my laptop out of the window when I saw that. When it’s like, “It’s Rudolph Valentino here. Now he’s a vampire.” I can’t. I can’t with this show. What?That entire season is … It feels like he’s laughing at us.Yes, and I love it. I want to be laughed at. He’ll be like, “You are such a little, dumb person for tuning in every single week thinking that you’re going to get what you want, but you’re not going to.”Clarisse Loughrey is chief film critic at The Independent,&nbsp;appears on Kermode and Mayo’s Film Review (BBC Radio), and co-hosts&nbsp;The Next Supremes&nbsp;podcast.&nbsp;Find her on Twitter: @clarisselou.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"demand","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"know-your-critic-clarisse-loughrey-chief-film-critic-at-the-independent"},{"id":"47611949816973","title":"9 Festival Favorites from 2019 Still On the Horizon","content":"Newsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})9 Festival Favorites from 2019 Still On the HorizonDaniel Radcliffe gets crazy in ultra-violent Guns Akimbo, Shia LaBeouf makes his writing debut, and Ali LeRoi releases an incredible first-time feature.by Cate Young | November 4, 2019 |  CommentsThe next few months are going to be dominated by big “awards” movies (think&nbsp;Bombshell,&nbsp;Little Women) and even bigger blockbusters (The Rise of Skywalker). But they’re not the only films worthy of your attention, and money, on the horizon. There is some great indie fare, much of which debuted on the festival circuit this year, coming to theaters and streaming services&nbsp;soon. So mark these dates down – at least the ones we have; we’re still waiting for release info on some of them – to get your quality indie fill.Guns Akimbo (2020)  51%Courtesy of TIFFAccording to critics,&nbsp;Jason Lei Howden’s latest action-packed adventure is just the right balance&nbsp;of good old-fashioned American excess and pointed social commentary about our fascination with guns, violence, and masculinity. Starring Daniel Radcliffe as Miles, a bumbling ne’er-do-well,&nbsp;Guns Akimbo&nbsp;is what Robert Daniels at rogerebert.com calls an&nbsp;“exciting and sometimes trite” adventure into the world of tech, the internet, and our insatiable need for brutality on demand. When Miles is unwillingly recruited into a notorious and illegal underground death match called “Skizm,” he must figure out how to survive the day, save the girl, and become the hero. Nothing goes according to plan, of course, but the journey is what makes it fun.Pursued by Skizm champion Nix (played with campy fun by Samara Weaving in another killer role following her breakout performance earlier this summer in the Certified Fresh&nbsp;Ready or Not) and trying hard not to “shoot his dick off” with the guns literally bolted into his hands,&nbsp;Miles&nbsp;embarks on a darkly funny race through the city.&nbsp;According to Birth.Movies.Death.,&nbsp;the movie overflows with a “frenetic, intense energy” that supports Radcliffe’s “progressively-more-unhinged performance.”&nbsp;Release date TBD.The Obituary of Tunde Johnson (2019)  89%Courtesy of TIFFAli LeRoi’s feature debut is a lyrical take on police brutality and the many vagaries of living as a black gay man in America. Working from a screenplay by USC film student Stanley Kalu, LeRoi blends terror and fiction in this time-loop drama: his protagonist wakes up dead every day, repeating old routines, meeting with his secret boyfriend, and coming out to his parents again and again before being murdered by police once more.The film’s slow build makes these rash of deaths feel immediate and terrifying. Each path to the “end”&nbsp;is different from the last and tragic in its own way. As Tunde navigates his relationships anew each day, he is never quite conscious of the last, forced to make new decisions without any knowledge of his past and future. But as he’s constantly reminded that he has so much to live for, the arc of his fateful day begins to bend.&nbsp;Beandrea July for&nbsp;The Hollywood Reporter writes that&nbsp;The Obituary of Tunde Johnson&nbsp;is “an agonizing tale about the weight society hoists upon too many black gay men’s weary shoulders.”Release date TBD.The Platform (El Hoyo) (2020)  80%Courtesy of TIFFCritics are calling this&nbsp;debut from Spanish director Galder Gaztelu-Urrutia&nbsp;a thrilling morality tale about the radical power of working toward the common good. The film’s focus is the terrifying prison of Urrutia’s near-future dystopia: The Pit. Vertically stacked cells set around holes in the ceiling and floor connect each level’s two captives to each of the others. Every day, a decadent feast is sent down to the prisoners through the tower’s delivery system, stopping at each floor for a brief time. Those at the top are kept well-fed, while those at the bottom starve. One citizen volunteers to serve a six-month sentence in exchange for professional credentials upon his release, but the horrors he experiences as he makes his way through the Pit’s “vertical self-management system” force him to think about what we owe each other, how we can support each other, and who precisely wins when we choose neglect instead of cooperation.Critics and audiences are saying that the Spanish thriller is disorienting, but incredibly arresting in its tight critique of our current political climate. Variety called it a “brutalist nightmare” for the way Urrutia’s vivid and inventive cruelties flesh out the psychological madness of living in such casually cruel conditions. The prisoners demonstrate how social mores can break down when people are pushed to the outer edges of their own humanity.&nbsp;The Platform&nbsp;is coming to Netflix. Release date TBD.&nbsp;How to Build a Girl (2020)  79%Courtesy of TIFFStarring&nbsp;Booksmart&nbsp;and&nbsp;Lady Bird’s Beanie Feldstein and based on the novel of the same name by screenwriter and journalist Caitlin Moran,&nbsp;How To Build A Girl&nbsp;is&nbsp;what Rendy Reviews calls&nbsp;“another cementing case of the gleaming star power of Feldstein’s talent.” The film&nbsp;follows protagonist Johanna Morrigan (Feldstein) through the highs and lows of rock and roll. Initially lonely and longing for adventure, Morrigan gets it when she auditions to be the rock critic for English magazine D&amp;ME with a review of “Tomorrow” from the musical Annie.&nbsp;Writing under the alias Dolly Wilde, Morrigan constructs a version of herself she thinks other people prefer but loses herself in the process.&nbsp;Critics say what follows is an earnest but devilish adventure into teen girlhood, and how finding yourself can mean breaking yourself down and starting from scratch. Variety&nbsp;writes,&nbsp;“How to Build a Girl dares to argue that reinventing yourself doesn’t make you a poseur.”Release date TBD.Waves (2019)  84%© A24Still sizzling from the Certified Fresh&nbsp;Luce, Kelvin Harrison Jr. leads the&nbsp;highly acclaimed&nbsp;Waves&nbsp;alongside&nbsp;a cast of highly recognizable faces. Written and directed by Trey Edward Shults,&nbsp;Waves&nbsp;explores the struggles of a young African-American teen with his family and his ambitions, and his ultimate fall from grace. The film is&nbsp;“a kinetic essay on the beauty of the body in motion” according to the Los Angeles Times,&nbsp;and blends music and memory to create what Film Inquiry calls a “grandiose, quasi-Greek tragedy.”In limited release November 15, 2019.Hala (2019)  89%Courtesy of TIFFThis quiet, contemporary coming-of-age film written and directed by&nbsp;Minhal Baig&nbsp;is a stunner in every way that matters. Starring&nbsp;Geraldine Viswanathan&nbsp;(the breakout star of 2018’s&nbsp;Blockers) in the titular role,&nbsp;Hala&nbsp;explores the intimacy of family life and the weight of cultural expectations. As Hala, a young Muslim woman of Pakistani descent, comes into herself and discovers the ways in which her parents were people before she came along, she begins to find the dividing line between who they are, who she is, and who they want her to be.Faced with budding romantic and sexual feelings and her parents’ disapproval, Hala starts meeting a male classmate in secret, telling as many lies as are necessary to give her a solid alibi. But when she discovers a devastating secret about the state of her parents’ marriage, she’s forced to re-evaluate her position in the family and her willingness to pretend for the sake of appearances. As&nbsp;812 Film Reviews&nbsp;puts it, the film “balances the familiar with the foreign to pull for a girl whose strength of freedom is at once powerful and quiet.”&nbsp;In limited release November 22, 2019.Clemency (2019)  91%©&nbsp;Neon Chinonye Chukwu’s sophomore feature stars Alfre Woodard as Bernadine Williams in what Nick Allen&nbsp;of&nbsp;rogerebert.com&nbsp;calls a “towering performance [that] is sure to push her into awards contention.” Woodard takes on the role of a prison warden tasked with carrying out the execution of inmate Anthony Woods (Aldis Hodge). The film not only explores the emotional toll executions take on the prisoners facing certain death, but&nbsp;also digs into&nbsp;the long-term psychological effects of being mandated to take another human life.As Woodard’s Bernadine struggles with taking pride in a job that means carrying out legal but often unjust sentences, her marriage crumbles.&nbsp;Populated with strong supporting performances from the likes of Wendell Pierce and Danielle Brooks, Clemency is a study in how the barbaric can become mundane, and what changes for the people forced to witness or inflict violence as a matter of course.In limited release December&nbsp;27, 2019.Honey Boy (2019)  94%© AmazonShia LaBeouf&nbsp;makes his screenwriting debut and stars as an analogue of his father in a reimagining of his own life story.&nbsp;Honey Boy&nbsp;recounts the difficult childhood of Otis Lort (Lucas Hedges) as he reflects on life with his abusive father. Reckoning with the trauma of his past, LaBeouf finds a way to create “the cinematic exorcism needed to deal with a major actor’s PTSD,” according to Brian Tallerico at&nbsp;rogerebert.com.&nbsp;A.A. Dowd at the&nbsp;AV Club&nbsp;writes of LaBeouf: “It’s just fascinating to see the actor play with the power of his persona and our association with it.”&nbsp;A Quiet Place’s Noah Jupe plays young Otis, giving a performance that&nbsp;EW‘s Leah Greenblatt&nbsp;calls “remarkably tender and unsentimental.”In limited release November 8, 2019.Midnight Family (2019)  97%A&nbsp;documentary that provides what&nbsp;The Hollywood Reporter&nbsp;calls “a visceral understanding of the cutthroat nature of this private-ambulance business,”&nbsp;Midnight Family&nbsp;follows the exploits of a family of EMTs in Mexico City as they try to make a living by providing critical medical care. Filling in the gaps left by the government’s inadequate resources, the Ochoa family battles with other private ambulance providers to race to the scene of accidents and earn their keep – all while knowing that they have no recourse should a client be unable or simply refuse to pay.As they come up against the glad-handing and corruption of the city (money changes hands in transactions that seem less than legal), it is the 17-year-old Juan Ochoa who maintains order in the household, taking care of his brother, minding the money frugally, and trying to keep his struggling family together. As Alissa Wilkinson at&nbsp;Vox&nbsp;puts it,&nbsp;Midnight Family&nbsp;is ultimately a “sweet, fascinating portrait of a group of people trying to make the best of a bad situation, and sometimes succeeding.”In limited release November 15, 2019.Like this?

(Oh, and working, too.)by RT Staff | April 23, 2020 |  CommentsWe have been busy at Rotten Tomatoes these last two months recommending tons of movies and TV series to watch during quarantine (you can find a ton of lists here). But sometimes you’re not in a position, or mood, to plonk yourself down in front of a screen. Perhaps you’re working, or gardening, or cooking, or exercising, or hiding in a closet for a few minutes of peace and quiet away from your kids/pupils/audience. Either way: tough to follow the twists and turns of&nbsp;Ozark&nbsp;as you do that. To help in these moments – and to generally keep you sane and healthy as we endure our collective cabin fever – the RT staff curated a list of 15 scores to pair with different parts of your quarantine life. Looking for something to push you through that last set of burpees?&nbsp;We have an orchestral doozy for you. Got a swoony Zoom date? Try something with French flavors. Want a new soundtrack to your Animal Crossing hours? Daft Punk is here to help.What movie music are you listening to at home? Let us know in the comments.&nbsp;Gattaca (1997)  83%(Photo by © Columbia/courtesy Everett Collection)Composer: Michael NymanThere are moments in Gattaca where nothing much is happening on-screen, but the rich Michael Nyman score is going in hard. In my early Gattaca-watching career (I’ve seen the movie eight or nine times now), I thought this was faulty, like the music was overcompensating. Plainly, this was a bad take. The music is devastatingly romantic. And not just how it informs the relationship between Jerome and Irene (Ethan Hawke, Uma Thurman), but also Jerome’s love for himself, to believe he is capable of something far beyond his cursed birthright. These times ask us to search for this kind of inner strength, to navigate daily life’s new chaos, and carry a torch of hope for the not-too-distant-future. Gattaca‘s soundtrack, culminating in the impossible beauty of “The Arrival,” is the music of that guiding light.Listen when:&nbsp;Working from home – this s–t is motivating! – but only if you like your job, and you’re not on a call. –&nbsp;Alex Vo, EditorRomeo and Juliet (1968)  95%(Photo by Courtesy Everett Collection)Composer: Nino RotaItalian composer Nino Rota has quite the résumé: La Dolce Vita, 8 1/2, and, of course, the first two Godfather films, both of which earned him Oscar nominations, and the second of which got him a win. My personal favorite, though, is his score for Franco Zeffirelli’s 1968 version of Romeo and Juliet, starring Leonard Whiting and Olivia Hussey. Maybe it takes me back to the high school English class in which I first saw the film, but there’s something about Rota’s love theme – a little trepidatious at first before a rousing strings-led swell, all laced with a certain feeling it’s not going to turn out well – that helps me focus when editing or reading. Be warned though: The score’s final tracks, which accompany the tragic finale on screen, are intense. Skip those, re-start from the beginning, and pretend the young lovers had a dagger-less ending.Listen when: You’ve carved out some time in your day to read (and have got your “looking interested” photo programmed to your Zoom feed). –&nbsp;Joel Meares, Editor-in-ChiefAnatomy of a Murder (1959)  100%(Photo by Courtesy the Everett Collection )Composers: Duke Ellington, Billy StrayhornThere are several reasons why Otto Preminger’s Anatomy of a Murder is one of the greatest courtroom dramas ever, but it’s arguably best remembered for its striking opening title sequence by Saul Bass and its incredible soundtrack, composed by none other than jazz legend Duke Ellington and his longtime collaborator Billy Strayhorn. Together, Ellington and Strayhorn put together a complete musical package that was alternately sultry (“Flirtibird”), playful (“Happy Anatomy”), melancholic (“Almost Cried”), and mysterious (“Midnight Indigo”), and it all still feels fresh and alive today. Of course, the most memorable song is probably the “Main Title” theme that accompanies Bass’ opening credits, but the whole score just drips with style. It’s also worth noting that it was not only one of the first soundtracks entirely scored by jazz musicians, but also the first one for a major Hollywood film that was created by an African-American composer. Movie soundtrack or not, it’s a masterpiece.Listen when: You’re feeling fancy and having a glass of wine in a bubble bath. –&nbsp;Ryan Fujitani, Snr. EditorThe Handmaiden (Ah-ga-ssi) (2016)  95%(Photo by © Amazon Studios /Courtesy Everett Collection)Composer: Jo Yeong-wookThe Handmaiden, like so many others, is the type of film that Bong Joon-ho spoke of when he urged English-speaking audiences to hurdle over the “one-inch barrier of subtitles” during one of his acceptance speeches last year for Parasite. The Korean- and Japanese-language film, which was not selected for Best International Film in 2016, sadly never reached a wide audience and was instead relegated to join other underrated/unknown non-English gems (most of which are available to stream – so get busy). Due to its under-the-radar status, many not only missed the seductive romance-thriller director Park Chan-wook&nbsp;weaved, but also the&nbsp;humorous and erotic score that plays throughout most of the film. The music, like the film it plays beneath, is surprising and genre-defying, mixing dark themes employing strings, clarinets, and harps with romantic melodies.Listen when:&nbsp;You’re scrolling through exotic locales, dreaming of the day you can travel to distant lands once again. –&nbsp;Jacqueline Coley, EditorDrive (2011)  93%(Photo by Richard Foreman Jr/©FilmDistric/Courtesy Everett Collection)Composer: Cliff MartinezYou can split Drive‘s original Cliff Martinez soundtrack into three categories: Pensive, ethereal, and fittingly, driving. “Kick Your Teeth” and “Skull Crushing” are among the pensive songs, and they suggest a shadow looming high over your shoulders, like a clockwork beast wound up to strike. The ethereal songs make you feel like you’re drifting through a hazy dream, and have incongruous names like “They Broke His Pelvis” and “Wrong Floor.” These two moods converge in the driving songs (“Rubber Head,” “Where’s the Deluxe Version?,” “Hammer”) that speak to those luxuriating in their delusional power fantasies and modern fairy tales. And, in this world, who can blame them?Listen when:&nbsp;You’re out for a sanctioned late-night drive, on the route with the most lights. –&nbsp;VoToy Story (1995)  100%&nbsp;and&nbsp;Toy Story 2 (1999)  100%(Photo by © Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures, © Pixar)Composer: Randy NewmanOver four films, the themes and movements of Randy Newman’s Toy Story scores have become as familiar to many ’90s kids as “The Imperial March” – though the effect of Newman’s sometimes jazzy, sometimes rousing music is far less hair-raising. In fact, the music of Toy Story is total comfort food during these trying times, particularly the first Toy Story’s opening flourish, “Andy’s Birthday,” which will shoot you straight back to a buttery-smelling movie theater circa 1995, to the first time you saw this computer-animated marvel. (“Sid” on the other hand may give you those Darth Vader vibes; skip it.) The sung songs on these soundtracks are a treat – “You’ve Got a Friend In Me” will keep you smiling, while you can turn to Toy Story 2’s “When She Loved Me,” performed by Sarah McLachlan, if you just feel like having a good cry. You know, the kind you have when you’re watching a Pixar movie.Listen when: It’s 3pm, you have a few hours of work left, and you need a solo pick-me-up. –&nbsp;MearesTron Legacy (2010)  51%(Photo by ©Walt Disney Pictures/Courtesy Everett Collection)Composers: Daft PunkDirector Joseph Kosinski already had a daunting task before him when he agreed to helm a sequel to a beloved cult classic, but he made things just a bit easier on himself by recruiting possibly the most fitting composers for the film: Daft Punk. The legendary French electronic duo – who, unsurprisingly, admitted the original Tron was a big influence on them – relied on a mix of traditional orchestral compositions and some that blended strings and horns with synthesized elements and their trademark arpeggios to create a propulsive, otherworldly sound. Their work goes a long way toward establishing the mood and tone of the film, and considering they started working on the score even before the film entered production, it’s incredible how well it fits the dark cyberpunk aesthetic. Daft Punk being who they are, the Tron Legacy soundtrack got a lot of attention, and while audiences may argue about the quality of the film itself, the music remains one of its undisputed high points.Listen when: You need some epic music while you fish in Animal Crossing. –&nbsp;FujitaniAmélie (2001)  89%(Photo by Courtesy the Everett Collection )Composer: Yann TeirsenThe accordion-heavy music that playfully scored Jean-Pierre Jeunet’s Oscar-nominated film Amélie has, in the almost 20 years since the movie’s release, become synonymous with Paris and particularly Montmartre, the cobblestoned neighborhood where most of the&nbsp;story takes place. French musician Yann Tiersen&nbsp;earned wide international acclaim for his work – and a César Award, and a BAFTA nomination – but would go on to later say that the fame Amelie&nbsp;gave him&nbsp;was something he resented; he would be forever linked to the quirky French hit. His score, despite his feelings, is iconic for a reason, providing a sonic fantasy land that, back in 2001, allowed a pixie-like waitress to find her happy ending, but today can take the listener anywhere they want to go. Perhaps you will take a moment in these times to fantasize about slow walks on the Seine with your one true love.Listen when:&nbsp;Noshing on something French – crepes and Nutella are easy enough – on a Zoom date with your boo. –&nbsp;ColeyOldboy (2005)  81%(Photo by Tartan Films/courtesy Everett Collection)Composers: Choi Seung-hyun, Lee Ji-soo, Shim Hyeon-jeongSouth Korean director Park Chan-wook’s twisty and twisted revenge thriller is rightly revered as a genre standout that helped put the country’s contemporary cinema on the world map. Its pulpy narrative, stylish direction, and one-take hallway fight sequence get all the attention, but the film wouldn’t have had the same impact if it weren’t for the score, composed by Choi Seung-hyun, Lee Ji-soo, and Shim Hyeon-jeong. While the more propulsive, electronic pieces may sound a little dated, the moody orchestral numbers feel like they’ve been ripped from some elegant, forgotten film noir; listen to “Kiss Me Deadly,” “It’s Alive!”, “The Big Sleep,” or any of the score’s melancholy waltzes for starters. Oh, and in case those titles didn’t clue you in, most of the original compositions are named after other movies, many of them film noirs themselves, which is a nice extra detail for movie buffs.Listen when: You need to blow off some steam after a long day working from home – or you’re trying to solve the mystery of those undelivered Amazon packages you ordered. –&nbsp;FujitaniThe Farewell (2019)  97%(Photo by Casi Moss, courtesy of A24)Composer: Alex WestonThe score for Lulu Wang’s incredibly moving The Farewell is an aspect of the movie that I think gets too often overlooked; recall some of the film’s most memorable moments –&nbsp;the family slo-mo walk, the driving away in the cab at the end –&nbsp;and you’ll see how important the musical choices were for making them stand out. Alex Weston’s compositions feel unapologetically classical, even operatic – the wordless vocals throughout come courtesy of tenor Mykal Kilgore –&nbsp;and yet they also feel inherently Eastern, an apt&nbsp;sonic effect&nbsp;given the themes of the film. A departure from most of the music, and a standout track, is soul singer Elayna Boynton’s cover of Leonard Cohen’s “Come Healing.”Listen when:&nbsp;The crushing anxiety of&nbsp;all that is happening starts seriously stressing you out. Or when rearranging the bookshelf. –&nbsp;MearesColumbus (2017)  97%(Photo by ©Superlative Films/courtesy Everett Collection)Composer: HammockHammock is a Nashville post-rock band that composes long, unhurried ambient songs without vocals or drums. Columbus is a quiet movie about two lost strangers (John Cho, Haley Lu Richardson) who meet in the Ohio town and bond over its surprising modernist architecture. By any measure, the band and movie are far from mainstream in their respective mediums, but the two coming together for the original soundtrack is a thing of niche beauty. Across Columbus&nbsp;director Kogonada’s pristine, meticulous shots and the building intimacy between the characters, Hammock’s music is used very sparingly, so listening to the 16-song soundtrack is a true act of discovery for Hammock fans. The songs, per usual, are compact galaxies of swelling sound. They suggest stillness, composure, and reflection – the kinds of moods one might feel when studying architecture. Or observing the world around you. As long as you’re looking up.Listen when:&nbsp;Dusk&nbsp;starts to settle in in and your work for the day is all done, or you’re doing a spot of gardening. –&nbsp;VoCarol (2015)  94%(Photo by Wilson Webb/©Weinstein Company/Courtesy Everett Collection)Composer: Carter BurwellThe Oscar-nominated score for Todd Haynes’ haunting love story, Carol, is&nbsp;considered by many to be one of the best film compositions from the 21st century. The ’40s-inspired score also provides the perfect soundtrack for quiet meditation in the age of COVID-19. For Carol, Carter Burwell composed delicate and teasing melodies with woodwinds, strings, and xylophones that will instantly help you get Zen-y. Like the fated lovers at the center of the drama (masterfully brought to life by Rooney Mara and Cate Blanchett),&nbsp;Burwell’s chord progressions delay their resolution but find their home triumphantly in the end.Listen when:&nbsp;You need a moment of relief from your “Baby Shark”-induced headache (and the kids that instigated it). –&nbsp;ColeyIf Beale Street Could Talk (2019)  95%(Photo by Annapurna Pictures)Composer: Nicholas BritellTwo-time Oscar nominee Nicholas Britell’s most recognizable music might be his theme for HBO’s Succession, and while we certainly pay our respects to that antsy ditty – and the memes it inspired – it’s a little anxiety-inducing for our current moment. For something more soothing and just knock-your-socks-off gorgeous, Britell’s score for Barry Jenkins’ If Beale Street Could Talk is a wonderful blend of euphoria and melancholy that feels perfectly of its place and setting (Harlem, 1970s). It’s a lush strings-heavy score that follows the beats of the doomed love story the movie tells; listen to bonus track “Harlem Aria” to see what the score might have sounded like had Britell stuck with horns as the dominant instrument.Listen when:&nbsp;You’re out on a socially distanced walk and really soaking in your surrounds. –&nbsp;MearesThe Last of the Mohicans (1992)  93%(Photo by 20th Century Fox Film Corp. )Composers: Trevor Jones, Randy Edelman, Dougie MacLeanThe story behind the score of Michael Mann’s epic rendition of James Fenimore Cooper’s 1826 novel is fraught with strife, which makes it all the more impressive that it turned out as incredible as it did. Mann initially asked composer Trevor Jones for an electronic score, but switched things up quite far into the production when they realized orchestral music would be more appropriate. Jones had to scramble not only to deliver an entirely new score, but also to keep up with the film’s last-minute editing, and Randy Edelman was brought on board to help finish it on time. The end result, of course, is a dramatic, sweeping array of compositions that evoke the film’s most emotional scenes. The film’s main theme, “Promontory,” a reworking of Scottish singer-songwriter Dougie MacLean’s “The Gael,” is instantly recognizable, but the star of it all is arguably the main title score. It’s an ominous procession of drums, strings, and horns that erupts into an iconic refrain that’s somehow heartbreaking and triumphant at the same time, and if it doesn’t inspire you to fight for something –&nbsp;anything&nbsp;– then you might need to get your pulse checked.Listen when: You need extra motivation during your stay-at-home workout. –Fujitani","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"all-time, TV, 2021, HBO, Fantasy, DC, cars, DirecTV, America, Century, Apple","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"movie-scores-to-keep-you-sane-through-quarantine"},{"id":"47612002392219","title":"13 Oscar-Worthy Genre Performances Awards Voters Should Consider","content":"Newsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})13 Oscar-Worthy Genre Performances Awards Voters Should ConsiderHey, Academy: These final girls, tormented souls, and devilish villains deserve some love.by Carlos Aguilar | January 7, 2020 |  Comments(Photo by Gabor Kotschy / Courtesy A24)Few actors have received the Academy’s recognition for performances&nbsp;in genre cinema, despite the sometimes stunning interpretations those stories allow for. Linda Blair (The Exorcist), Sigourney Weaver (Aliens), Jodie Foster (The Silence of the Lambs),&nbsp;Ian McKellen (The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring), Haley Joel Osment (The Sixth Sense), and, more recently, Daniel Kaluuya (Get Out) are among the limited exceptions to that unfortunate truth.The dismissal of Toni Collette’s remarkable turn in Ari Aster’s terrifying Hereditary, as a mother on the brink of losing her sanity in the face of supernatural tragedy, proved that Oscar voters don’t often see the work in horror, science-fiction, fantasy, and their many subsets on the same plain as the more traditionally dramatic work they celebrate year after year. For every star that earns a nomination for a biopic, countless others miss out for daring parts in boundary-pushing genre productions.This, of course, doesn’t mean that great acting in genre films isn’t out there consistently. This year alone, Lupita Nyong’o has received considerable praise for her dual turn in Jordan Peele’s Us –&nbsp;and has racked up a few awards already – and so has Willem Dafoe for his role in the bizarre black-and-white buddy nightmare The Lighthouse. However, there were many other actors who challenged themselves playing offbeat characters or the grounded-in-reality centers of some excellent genre fare.Psychologically complex characters abound in these movies, which present&nbsp;unique challenges for the actors embodying them – being haunted by malevolent specters, lost in space, tormented by mental illness, or adored by cult members is no easy task. Below, we’ve highlighted 12 actors whose blood-curdling, exhilarating, and even moving appearances in genre movies released in the U.S. this year impressed us enough to advocate for their well-deserved accolades.Take note, Academy.What was your favorite genre performance of the year? Let us know in the comments.&nbsp;BILL HADER, It Chapter Two (2019)  62%&nbsp;(Photo by © Warner Bros. Pictures)The Role: Richie Tozier, a comedian who returns to his hometown to face a killer clown alongside his childhood posse.Why It’s Award-Worthy: Hader’s adult version of Richie captures the spirit of the character as played by Finn Wolfhard in the first installment of Andy Muschietti’s two-part saga. He grapples with the past through humor and in turn adds a thin layer of lightness to the gruesome saga of the Losers Club, who return to Derry to find that Pennywise — the supernatural being that wants them dead and won’t leave them alone — isn’t gone. Instead of playing Richie’s coping mechanism purely for laughs, the gifted actor fully embodies Richie and his inner turmoil, building up to a tear-inducing finale. Having said that, seeing Hader as a self-deprecating trash-talker who doesn’t miss a single moment to make a joke, even when someone has just been murdered, is a weird pleasure we don’t feel guilty about.MILES ROBBINS, Daniel Isn't Real (2019)  83%&nbsp;(Photo by © Samuel Goldwyn Films)The Role: An introverted college student haunted by a diabolical imaginary friend.Why It’s Award-Worthy: Although you might remember Robbins as the man bun-wearing hipster in parental comedy Blockers&nbsp;or the doomed hipster boyfriend in 2018’s Halloween, he has serious range, and it’s on display in Adam Egypt Mortimer’s psychological horror feature. As Luke, a student struggling with his own mental health while caring for his schizophrenic mother, the actor essentially delivers two distinct personalities: First, he is an insecure young man dabbling in dating, but when his old imaginary pal Daniel (Patrick Schwarzenegger) returns, he becomes aggressively masculine right until the new personality fully takes over. The last segment of this under-the-radar creepout gives Robbins the opportunity to truly go all-out with the transformative nature of his performance.SOFIA BOUTELLA, Climax (2019)  68%&nbsp;(Photo by © A24)The Role: The leader of a French dance troupe that collectively devolves into a drug-induced trip into madness.Why It’s Award-Worthy: What the Algerian-born French dancer, model, and actress brings to Gaspar Noé’s intoxicating and provocative vision is sheer emotional rawness. Following a string of action movies – including Kingsman: The Secret Service, Atomic Blonde, and The Mummy –&nbsp;Boutella entered the void of the auteur’s latest mind-bending project to great results. Drugged out of her mind, Selva, her character, roams around a gym where her fellow dancers have also ingested an unknown substance and are morphing into instinct-driven beasts. From executing the incredible choreography that opens Climax to her furious outbursts and the disturbing mindlessness she exhibits, the talented multi-hyphenate lures us into this dehumanized underworld with every wild step. Physical and visceral throughout, Boutella brims with fiery energy.REBECCA FERGUSON, Doctor Sleep (2019)  78%&nbsp;The Role: Rose the Hat, the head of the True Knot cult that preys on Shiners and feeds off of their psychic powers.Why It’s Award-Worthy: Ferguson’s flamboyant villain is part Mad Hatter and part ruthless vampire. In the Swedish thesp’s hands, Rose the Hat exudes a mixture of sophistication and cruelty enhanced by her sleek outfit and centuries-old hat. There’s an unnerving self-assurance in her despicable mission that makes us fear and admire her. Previously seen in blockbusters like Mission: Impossibles Rogue Nation and Fallout and The Greatest Showman, Ferguson has continued to build momentum, and this Stephen King adaption is no exception. Even if critical reception for Doctor Sleep wasn’t unanimously positive –it’s sitting just inside the Certified Fresh zone –&nbsp;Rose the Hat became a fan favorite. Whether she is stealing the life force out of a person cursed with the Shining –&nbsp;rather horrifically in one pivotal scene – or reading their thoughts from a supermarket, she rocks the nefariousness.GUGU MBATHA-RAW, Fast Color (2019)  81%&nbsp;(Photo by © Codeblack Films)The Role: Ruth, a recovering drug addict from a lineage of Black women with superpowers who’s on the run from government agents.Why It’s Award-Worthy: Despite its hyper-limited release and muted reception at the box office, Julia Hart’s sophomore feature found an audience and some serious affection through online word-of-mouth. One of its major assets is Gugu Mbatha-Raw’s commanding presence as a young mother with substance abuse issues caused in part by her inability to control the super-human abilities she was born with. Far from a one-dimensional superhero type, Ruth is conflicted about her life choices and even more so about the power she didn’t ask for. The actress subtly and skillfully conveys the pent-up frustration and guilt the protagonist carries for not being a part of her young daughter’s life in a world where water is scarce. The genre elements are always present, but Fast Color works because it cares more about the multigenerational relationships between Mbatha-Raw and her co-stars Saniyya Sidney and Lorraine Toussaint.ISABELLE HUPPERT, Greta (2019)  60%&nbsp;(Photo by Shane Mahood / © Focus Features)The Role: A deranged European widow obsessed with befriending younger women.Why It’s Award-Worthy: There are no limits to the ways in which French icon Isabelle Huppert can surprise us with each new credit she puts under her elegant belt. For Irish director Neil Jordan’s ’90s-style stalker-thriller, she embraces one of the most wonderfully demented women she has personified in her jaw-droppingly prolific career. In the skin of the title character, a mysterious widow desperate for attention, Huppert goes full-on cuckoo as she lurks around New York City and harasses Chloë Grace Moretz’s character. A scene inside a restaurant where she loses her temper and another where she maniacally twirls while holding a dangerous syringe make for something deliciously unexpected. Nominated for an Oscar once before for Paul Verhoeven’s Elle, as a rape survivor seeking revenge, the goddess of international cinema clearly has no plans to stop amazing us.MARIANNE JEAN-BAPTISTE, In Fabric (2019)  91%&nbsp;(Photo by © A24)The Role: Sheila, a bank teller who buys a new red dress to get back into the dating scene, but ends up being tormented by the wicked garment.Why It’s Award-Worthy: Knitted within Peter Strickland’s giallo-infused horror diptych is a sharp commentary on the weaknesses and desires we all try to escape or fulfill and how evil prays on them. That’s why having Oscar-nominated actress Marianne Jean-Baptiste (Secrets &amp; Lies) act as the emotional anchor of this stylish contender for the most WTF movie of the year feels essential. Sheila is not a mere vehicle for the movie’s madness or just another victim, but rather a woman who wishes to find a partner, whose relationship with her adult son has deteriorated because of his live-in girlfriend, and who, on top of that, has to deal with a freakish piece of clothing that turns her washing machine into a deadly weapon. The near-absurdity of a screenplay centered on a killer dress is grounded thanks to Jean-Baptiste.BRAD PITT,&nbsp;Ad Astra (2019)  83%&nbsp;(Photo by 20th Century Fox)The Role: Roy McBride, a decorated major in the U.S. Space Command and the son of a legend.Why It’s Award-Worthy: &nbsp;Each time a melancholic Brad Pitt wearing an astronaut suit stares into the camera in James Gray’s powerful sci-fi drama, we can sense a profound emptiness, an emotional void that not even an accomplished professional life can fill. With Earth’s future threatened by a phenomenon known as the surge, Major McBride is sent on an outer space mission to save the planet, which may force him to confront his long-lost father. Set in a near future where the moon has become just another enclave of humanity’s voracious ambitions, this spiritual space odyssey is, at its core, a father-son story focused on a man looking for intimate answers in the vastness of the universe. An understated Pitt, both on screen and in voiceover, delivers some of his most finely tuned work.EMILY BEECHAM,&nbsp;Little Joe (2019)  68%&nbsp;(Photo by Chris Harris / © Magnolia Pictures)The Role: Alice, a scientist who creates a “happy flower” meant to help improve the owner’s mood, but instead produces perverse side effects.Why It’s Award-Worthy: The jury at this year’s Cannes Film Festival made a point by awarding Beecham the Best Actress prize for her subdued performance in this eerie slice of science-fiction. Her cerebral character, Alice, is a meticulous plant-breeder and a mother whose most ambitious enterprise yet is a sterile flower that requires lots of care to make it produce a hormone that’s supposed to make people joyful. Beecham begins the film stoically, with her Alice uninterested in developing any relationships at work; it’s only when her teenage son Joe’s (Kit Connor) attitude changes, possibly because of her creation, that she loses her controlled façade. It’s a mostly internal performance, but the precise Beecham knows exactly when to imbue her gaze to communicate anguish, disbelief, and regret. Not a typical awards-winner, but it should be.FLORENCE PUGH,&nbsp;Midsommar (2019)  83%&nbsp;(Photo by © A24)The Role: Dani, an American woman coping with a devastating family tragedy while on a bizarre trip to an almost otherworldly Swedish festival.Why It’s Award-Worthy: Flower crowns can’t hide the immense grief and romantic woes that afflict a young American couple on the brink of separation in Ari Aster’s sun-drenched terror fest. As Dani, Pugh’s face flits between gut-wrenching fear, disappointment, delirious joy, and ultimately menacing empowerment. In her darkest hour, the strange cult that welcomes her could actually mean her salvation. Pugh has enjoyed a banner year with Greta Gerwig’s Little Women and her incredible but under-seen lead role as an aspiring wrestler in Fighting with My Family. It’s difficult to argue which of these three efforts is the greatest, but the notable physicality and mentally draining situations that Midsommar required may tip the needle in its favor. Still, having multiple praise-worthy releases in a single year automatically makes her the queen of the whole year, not just May, in our opinion.TAKAYUKI HAMATSU, One Cut of the Dead (Kamera o tomeru na!) (2019)  100%&nbsp;(Photo by © Shudder)The Role: A spineless director tasked with creating an absurd zombie movie for Japanese television.Why It’s Award-Worthy: In this ingenious horror-comedy movie about making movies, Takayuki Hamatsu, making his movie debut, breathes life into a filmmaker whose bad reputation has pushed him to take whatever job he can get –&nbsp;including a low-budget zombie production to be broadcast live on TV. A natural pushover, the fictional director endures criticism from his daughter and wife at home, but once on set he must act tough to brave the ridiculous obstacles that await him. On the surface, Hamatsu’s hilarious take on an incompetent creator finding a new alter-ego behind and in front of the camera could seem broad, something we’ve seen before. But what’s required of him –&nbsp;and what he delivers – is a deft understanding of the screenplay’s tonal shifts and the movie-within-a-movie-within-a-movie mechanics of this incredibly clever piece of cinema. He gifts us laugh-out-loud brilliance.SAMARA WEAVING, Ready or Not (2019)  88%&nbsp;(Photo by © Fox Searchlight)The Role: Grace Le Domas, a bride who unknowingly marries into a murderous family.Why It’s Award-Worthy: When we first meet Grace, right before she walks down the aisle, her spirited demeanor is infectious. She is unequivocally ecstatic to be getting married, and that effervescence follows her right up to the moment when she discovers that her now-husband’s family treasures a psychopathic and ritualistic tradition: Her in-laws, the Le Domases, want to murder her before dawn via a gory game of hide-and-seek. Weaving, an up-and-coming Australian actress, handles this transition from joy to panic, and later to pure survival mode, with complete believability – and never loses her edgy sense of humor. This is a woman in love forced to rip apart her gorgeous dress, dodge literal bullets, and bash people’s heads in order get through the night. As the twisted plot escalates, the darker parts of Grace awaken, and Weaving renders that blend of emotions impeccably.JUAN RAMÓN LÓPEZ, Tigers Are Not Afraid (Vuelven) (2019)  97%&nbsp;The Role: El Shine, a jaded young boy trying to survive in a merciless Mexican ghost town.Why It’s Award-Worthy: Issa López’s unforgettable dark fantasy features a remarkable troupe of young performers, many of them first-timers, as a group of children fending for themselves in a nameless Mexican city where criminals run the streets and most people have mysteriously disappeared. Among the cast, Juan Ramón López stands out as a young man whose innocence has been ravaged by his environment. But when Estrella (Paola Lara), a girl searching for her missing mother, joins the crew, El Shine shows glimpses of the child’s buoyancy that he’d suppressed. Playing a kid who’s far from likable and contains such heavy emotions at such a young age could easily be daunting, but López channels the right amount of anger and determination into his character.Are you as obsessed with awards as we are?

From promising releases by new voices to&nbsp;experimental efforts&nbsp;from storied filmmakers – or perhaps the next indie darling to go the distance for end-of-year accolades – we will break it all down for you here each week.For the foreseeable future, the specialty box office and all theatrical releases will be on hold as we all make efforts to socially distance ourselves and reduce the spread of the COVID-19 coronavirus. With that in mind, we have reshaped our Indie Fresh List to reflect the specialty box office releases that are newly available on&nbsp;streaming services and VOD. This week, we have the first narrative feature to tackle the Harvey Weinstein sex scandal, a witchy horror flick, and an insightful documentary about an iconic LGBTQ bookstore. In our Spotlight section, we revisit a hilarious Huckleberry Finn styled story about a young man with down syndrome and the drifter he befriends.Streaming This WeekendThe Assistant (2020)  92%&nbsp;If, by chance, you caught the latest season of&nbsp;Ozark or the miniseries Waco (both newly available on Netflix), you might have noticed the captivating power of Emmy-winning actress Julia Garner. And if so, you might also want to take a peek at The Assistant. Harvey Weinstein’s sex scandal gets the Hollywood treatment in this&nbsp;haunting&nbsp;breakout from the Telluride Film Festival, a drama&nbsp;about the pre-#MeToo film industry as told through the eyes of a young assistant (Garner) to a predatory Hollywood producer. The nearly silent narrative is told entirely from&nbsp;the young woman’s perspective as&nbsp;she&nbsp;glimpses her boss’s behavior&nbsp;and questions what can&nbsp;she do when she seems to be the&nbsp;only&nbsp;person who sees a problem with the serial abuser’s&nbsp;treatment of women. “The silence of this movie is devastating because we recognize it all too clearly as our own,” writes&nbsp;Justin Chang of the Los Angeles Times.Available&nbsp;now to&nbsp;rent or buy on&nbsp;FandangoNow,&nbsp;Vudu,&nbsp;Amazon, Google Play, and&nbsp;iTunes.Circus of Books (2020)  98%&nbsp;Outside of San Francisco’s&nbsp;Castro district,&nbsp;during the early 1980s, LA’s West Hollywood neighborhood was the place for gay men to congregate on the west coast and housed the famed&nbsp;Circus of Books. Once the nation’s largest purveyor of gay pornography, the iconic bookstore served as a meeting place for gay men to find each other for&nbsp;social interaction&nbsp;and sexual escapades. Surprisingly, however, the infamous bookstore that sold everything from sex toys to hardcore porn was run by a quiet, heterosexual Jewish couple: Larry and Karen Mason. The documentary&nbsp;Circus of Books examines the history of the bookstore, how it survived the ’80s AIDS epidemic, and how the family who ran it struggled to reconcile their successful business with their conservative lifestyle.&nbsp;Matt Fagerholm of RogerEbert.com&nbsp;wrote, “The film&nbsp;consistently subverts our expectations by revealing new layers about its subjects that deepen their humanity, causing us to challenge our own preconceptions.”Streaming on now Netflix.The Wretched (2020)  75%A mix of&nbsp;Hitchcockian suspense, Spielbergian atmosphere, and gnarly creature design, The Wretched&nbsp;follows a young boy who goes to live with his father following his parent’s divorce and soon discovers his new town and the women who inhabit it are not what they seem. Suspecting that a supernatural force is abducting children, he believes&nbsp;the nearby forest is home to a powerful witch. As he is the only person who&nbsp;seems to understand what is happening, he embarks on a solo mission to kill the monster and return the lost children. “A polished, well-paced nightmare [with] a playfully Hitchcockian suspense approach… [and] likable performances keeping us emotionally grounded.” writes Dennis Harvey of Variety.Available to rent or buy&nbsp;on May 1.Fresh &amp; Available Now on VOD – Spotlight PickThe Peanut Butter Falcon (2019)  94%&nbsp;Feel-good films are in high demand right now, which is why we choose to bring back one of our favorite heartwarming indies from 2019 —&nbsp;The Peanut Butter Falcon, starring Shia LaBeouf — for our Spotlight pick.&nbsp;When we&nbsp;spoke to LaBeouf&nbsp;about his performance in the&nbsp;Certified Fresh indie flick,&nbsp;he confessed that he left the set “a changed man,” and having seen the hilarious and heartwarming tale, we can see why the actor and critics are calling it a transformative experience. Lead actor Zack Gottsagen first met co-directors Tyler Nilson and Michael Schwartz at a retreat for young adults with down syndrome and told them he wanted to be a movie star. When they replied that it was difficult for an actor with disabilities to be cast in feature films, Gottsagen quipped back: “Well why don’t you go make a movie for me?” And they did. The result is a modern-day&nbsp;Huckleberry Finn, centered on a young man with dreams of wrestling stardom and a drifter, whose lives intersect and are changed forever. “The whole thing is just so damn sweet that I couldn’t help but feel uplifted. Add to that a handful of genuine belly laughs and you’ve got yourself a winner,” writes Dan Scully of Cinema 76.Available to rent or buy&nbsp;on&nbsp;FandangoNow,&nbsp;Vudu,&nbsp;Amazon,&nbsp;Google Play,&nbsp;and&nbsp;iTunes.Along with… Swallow (2020) , about an affluent housewife who develops a deadly case of pica — the urge to swallow inanimate objects.

From promising releases from new voices to&nbsp;experimental efforts&nbsp;from storied filmmakers – or perhaps the next indie darling to go the distance for end-of-year accolades – we will break it all down for you here each week in Fresh&nbsp;Indie Finds.&nbsp;This week at the specialty box office, we have new offerings from&nbsp;Cynthia Erivo, Ethan Hawke, and Martin Scorsese. Erivo’s take on Civil War icon Harriet Tubman joins Ethan Hawke in a new indie tale about an ex-con and an abandoned baby, while Scorsese’s long-awaited Jimmy Hoffa gangster epic starring Al Pacino, Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci, and Harvey Keitel – all together for the first time ever&nbsp;– opens a theatrical run before it drops on Netflix. In our spotlight section, we highlight the per-screen-average winning film from last week’s three-way showcase featuring&nbsp;The Lighthouse,&nbsp;Parasite, and&nbsp;Jojo Rabbit. And finally, in our indie trailer section, we have new clips featuring Vin Diesel, Sterling K. Brown, and a foreign language Oscar hopeful some are dubbing a modern-day Parisian Do The Right Thing.&nbsp;Opening This WeekendAdopt a Highway (2019)  69%Logan Marshall-Green follows up his 2018 appearance in the violent, fast-paced action flick&nbsp;Upgrade&nbsp;with his directorial debut, an understated drama&nbsp;starring SXSW darling Ethan Hawke. In&nbsp;Adopt a Highway,&nbsp;Hawke&nbsp;plays Russ Millings, an&nbsp;ex-con who&nbsp;is paroled after a 21-year prison sentence and suddenly&nbsp;finds purpose and meaning after he rescues an abandoned infant from a dumpster. As&nbsp;an instant parent navigating the perils of a world he no longer recognizes, Hawke is moving and heartfelt in Marshall-Green’s first-time effort as both writer and director. Matt Donato&nbsp;of&nbsp;Slashfilm called the film “as naked, vulnerable, and warmly fulfilling a directorial debut as you can ask for.”Playing&nbsp;Los Angeles, New York, Boston, Cleveland, Dallas, Miami, Detroit, Houston, Minneapolis, Orlando, Seattle, Tampa;&nbsp;and available on VOD November 1.Harriet (2019)  73%Tony-winner&nbsp;Cynthia Erivo makes her lead actress feature debut in Kasi Lemmons‘ biopic about the most celebrated member of the underground railroad, Harriet Tubman. The former slave escaped to freedom and then returned several times to free over 300 runaways without a single&nbsp;person lost, and&nbsp;the British-born actress is earning raves for her quiet, moving performance.&nbsp;It’s one that stands slightly above the film itself, as&nbsp;Loren King of&nbsp;Newport This Week&nbsp;notes Erivo is “the main reason to see Harriet, a solid, well-crafted film that aims more for education than innovation.”Playing select cities on November 1.The Irishman (2019)  95%Lastly, we hesitate to call a $200 million&nbsp;Martin Scorsese&nbsp;epic produced by the biggest streaming studio around an “indie” film, but it is only getting a limited release in theaters before it hits Netflix, so if you wanted to see it on the big screen, now you know it’s happening this weekend. Scorsese made headlines recently with&nbsp;his thoughts on superheroes and cinema, with everyone from Jon Favreau to James Gunn weighing in on the Oscar-winning director’s assertion that Marvel movies are more akin to theme parks. But the public brouhaha over that hasn’t affected&nbsp;The Irishman‘s chances to become a major player come Oscar time. Stars&nbsp;Robert De Niro,&nbsp;Al Pacino, and&nbsp;Joe Pesci, as well as&nbsp;the&nbsp;GoodFellas&nbsp;director himself, all look poised for deep runs this awards season, and with the use of new technology not unlike what we’ve seen in the&nbsp;MCU or Ang Lee’s&nbsp;Gemini Man,&nbsp;The Irishman&nbsp;has positioned itself for multiple nominations across the board. “A masterpiece. Scorsese’s most ambitious work to date [and] one of his very best. Believe the hype,” writes&nbsp;Joey Magidson&nbsp;of&nbsp;Hollywood News.Playing New York and Los Angeles;&nbsp;available on&nbsp;Netflix on November 27.Fresh and Still in TheatersJojo Rabbit (2019)  80%&nbsp;Out of our three&nbsp;spotlight picks from last week (The Lighthouse, Parasite, Jojo Rabbit), the anti-hate satire from Taika Waititi earned the highest per-screen-average of the weekend in fewer than 50 markets. When we chatted with the&nbsp;Thor: Ragnarok director, he told us his satire&nbsp;was the perfect antidote to the re-emergence of Nazi ideology. Though critical reaction to the film has been&nbsp;slightly less enthusiastic, audiences have nothing but praise for Waititi, his hilarious script, and the dynamic cast. Set in Germany at the end of World War II, the film follows Jojo, a 10-year-old&nbsp;fan of the Führer&nbsp;who discovers&nbsp;his mother is hiding a teenaged Jewish girl in the attic. Jojo must then decide what to do next: Will he choose to side with his mother or with his best friend and father-figure, an imaginary version of Nazi leader Adolf Hitler, played by Waititi? The winner of the 2019 Audience Award at the Toronto International Film Festival, this absurdist anti-hate satire is a timely skewering of blind ideology as well as a surprisingly feel-good family&nbsp;film with standout performances from&nbsp;Sam Rockwell, Scarlett Johansson,&nbsp;Leave No Trace&nbsp;star&nbsp;Thomasin McKenzie, and newcomer&nbsp;Roman Griffin Davis&nbsp;in the title role. It’s a coming-of-age story that&nbsp;Marc Savlov of the&nbsp;Austin Chronicle&nbsp;writes is&nbsp;“unlike any other, filled with the director’s trademark heart and a soul-stirring argument against the ever-ready darkness of unswerving, ‘patriotic’ nationalism.”Playing New York and Los Angeles;&nbsp;expanding to wide release on November 8.Along with… Parasite (Gisaengchung) (2019) , a darkly comedic satire about the terrifying antics that ensue when an underprivileged family latches on to a more affluent one and things go sideways. The Lighthouse (2019) , a surreal psychological drama about two men who are tortured by the elements and by each other while isolated at a remote lighthouse. First Love (Hatsukoi) (2019) , an action flick/broad comedy/pulse-racing thriller/heartfelt rom-com that follows&nbsp;a young boxer and a call girl through a wild night in Tokyo. Pain and Glory (Dolor y gloria) (2019) , a drama about an aging director who reflects on his films, collaborators, and legacy after he is sidelined by severe back pain. Monos (2019) , a South American&nbsp;Lord of the Flies&nbsp;– but about 1,000 times bloodier.New Indie TrailersWaves (2019)  84%&nbsp;The second trailer for&nbsp;It Comes at Night&nbsp;Director Trey Edward Shults’ third effort,&nbsp;a&nbsp;complex love story and family drama&nbsp;set in Miami Florida, starring&nbsp;Sterling K.

With the help of a fearless panel of women critics made up of some of the best writers in the industry, including a few on the Rotten Tomatoes staff. Starting with a long list of candidates, they whittled down the list to an initial set of 72 amazingly heroic characters and ordered them, crowning the most fearless woman movie hero in the process. Want to know more about the ladies who voted? We included their bios at the end! Then, in addition to their contributions, which make up the bulk of the list, we also added a handful of more recent entries chosen by the RT staff.The final list (you can watch every movie in a special FandangoNOW collection) gives compelling insight into which heroes have resonated through the years, women whose big-screen impact remains even as the times change. We have the usual suspects along with plenty of surprises (Working Girl, your day has come!), and the only way to discover them all is reading on for the 87 fearless women movie heroes — and groups of heroes — who inspire us!(Photo by 20th Century Fox Film Corp.)&nbsp;Alien (1979)  98%#1One of the appeals of science-fiction is the luxury to comment on modern issues and social mores, or even eschew them completely. Take a look at the diverse space crews in Star Trek, Sunshine, or Alien, where people are hired based on nothing but competence, and none have proven their competence under extreme pressure as well as&nbsp;Ellen Ripley. She’s tough, pragmatic, and cunning in Alien. Journey with Ripley into Aliens and we get to see her in a new light: mothering and nurturing with hints of deep empathy (Sigourney Weaver was nominated for a Best Actress Oscar for this performance), which only makes the Xenomorph-stomping side of her even more badass.(Photo by 20th Century Fox Film Corp.)&nbsp;Working Girl (1988)  84%#2And on the other side of the Sigourney spectrum, Weaver here plays Katharine, a particular kind of woman who’s nasty to the competition: other women. The object of her scorn is her secretary, Tess McGill (played by Melanie Griffith), who has her great ideas stolen by Katharine. The plucky Tess in turn pretends to be her boss’s colleague, and proceeds to shake things up in this corporate Cinderella story. Who doesn’t dream of one day suddenly arriving in a higher echelon of society? Of course, it’s what you do once you get there that’s important, and the glowing and tenacious Tess makes the most of it.(Photo by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures/Marvel)&nbsp;Thor: Ragnarok (2017)  93%#3Hard-drinking, ass-kicking Valkyrie makes no apologies for her choices and draws solid boundaries. Sure, she’s flawed, but that’s what makes her successes so sweet. That she’s played by Tessa Thompson doubles the fun.(Photo by Marvel/Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures)&nbsp;Black Panther (2018)  96%#4Letitia Wright proved that a sister doesn’t have to sit in the shadow of her sibling simply because he’s king. Her Shuri has the smarts and the sass to cut her own path, making her technical genius essential not only to the Kingdom of Wakanda, but also the Avengers’ recent efforts to take down the tyrant Thanos.(Photo by Fox 2000 Pictures)&nbsp;Hidden Figures (2017)  93%#5Don’t ask us to choose a favorite among Hidden Figures’ Space Race heroines: Taraji P. Henson as Katherine G. Johnson, Octavia Spencer as Dorothy Vaughan, and Janelle Monáe as Mary Jackson. The Oscar-nominated drama tells the story of a real-life team of female African-American mathematicians crucial to NASA’s early space program.Katie Shearer&nbsp;Mad Max: Fury Road (2015)  97%#6As Imperator Furiosa, Charlize Theron blazed a trail for enslaved post-apocalyptic cult wives in skimpy clothing – literally. With an assist from Max (Tom Hardy), soldier Furiosa set the road on fire to rescue her charges from madman Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne), leader of the Citadel.(Photo by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures/Lucasfilm Ltd)&nbsp;Star Wars: The Last Jedi (2017)  90%#7Daisy Ridley gave girls everywhere – and full-grown women, in truth – a fresh new hero to adore when she debuted in Star Wars: The Force Awakens. Of humble origins, scrappy Rey overcomes her circumstances living as an orphan in a harsh environment to become an essential component in the Resistance. It helps, of course, that The Force is with her.&nbsp;(Photo by Clay Enos/Warner Bros. Pictures)&nbsp;Wonder Woman (2017)  93%#8Despite her superpowers and privileged background, Gal Gadot as&nbsp;Diana – princess of Themyscira and the Amazons, daughter of Queen Hippolyta and King of the Gods Zeus – retains her humility and a genuine care for humanity. She’s also the most rock solid member of DC’s boys club of Justice League superheroes.(Photo by 20th Century Fox)&nbsp;Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi (1983)  82%#9Come on…she’s Princess Leia. She leads the Rebel Alliance. She saves the galaxy again and again (with a little help from Luke, and Han, and Chewy). She eventually becomes a revered general, but from the very start – when she first confronts Darth Vader at the beginning of Episode IV – A New Hope&nbsp;– she shows a defiant, fiery nature that never dims. In her defining film role, Carrie Fisher brings impeccable comic timing to this cosmic princess.(Photo by Roadside Attractions)&nbsp;Winter's Bone (2010)  94%#10Before she was Katniss, Jennifer Lawrence was Ree, the role that made her a star and earned her the first of four Oscar nominations. A no-nonsense teenager, Ree dares to brave the dangers lurking within the Ozark Mountains to track down her drug-dealing father and protect her siblings and their home. With each quietly treacherous encounter, she shows depth and instincts beyond her years, and a willingness to fight for what matters.&nbsp;Katie Shearer&nbsp;The Silence of the Lambs (1991)  96%#11You can’t have any fear when you’re going up against Hannibal Lecter – or at least you can’t show it. He’ll sniff it out from a mile away. But what’s exciting about Jodie Foster’s Oscar-winning portrayal of the young FBI cadet is the way she works through her fear, harnessing that nervous energy alongside her powerful intellect and dogged determination. Clarice Starling is a hero for every little girl who thought she wasn’t good enough.(Photo by Universal Pictures)&nbsp;Erin Brockovich (2000)  84%#12Julia Roberts won a best-actress Oscar for her charismatic portrayal of this larger-than-life, real-life figure. Erin Brockovich&nbsp;is repeatedly underestimated because of the flashy way she dresses and the brash way she carries herself. But as a single mom who becomes an unlikely environmental advocate, she’s a steely fighter. What she lacks in book smarts, she more than makes up for with heart. Steven Soderbergh’s film is an inspiring underdog story.(Photo by 20th Century Fox)&nbsp;Broadcast News (1987)  98%#13Jane Craig is&nbsp;the toughest, sharpest, most prepared woman in the newsroom at all times, but she isn’t afraid to cry to let it all out when the pressure gets too great. Writer-director James L. Brooks created this feminist heroine, this workplace goddess, but Holly Hunter brilliantly brings her to life. She’s just so vibrant. Even when she’s sitting still (which isn’t often), you can feel her thinking. And while two men compete for her attention, no man could ever define her.(Photo by MGM Studios)&nbsp;Fargo (1996)  94%#14It would be easy to underestimate Marge Gunderson. Sure, she’s in a position of power as the Brainerd, Minnesota, police chief. But with her folksy manner – and the fact that she’s so pregnant, she’s about to burst – she’s not exactly the most intimidating figure. But in the hands of the brilliant Frances McDormand, she’s consistently the smartest and most fearless person in the room, and she remains one of the Coen brothers’ most enduring characters. You betcha.(Photo by Marvel/Walt Disney Studios)&nbsp;Avengers: Infinity War (2018)  85%#15Danai Gurira plays Okoye, the leader of the Dora Milaje who specializes in spear fighting and strategic wig flipping. Of late, Okoye has been seen keeping company with Avengers.(Photo by Miramax Films)&nbsp;Bridget Jones's Diary (2001)  80%#16Things Bridget Jones is prone to: accidents, fantasizing about sexy coworkers, worrying about her weight, and running mad into the snow wearing tiger-print underwear. All totally relatable things, so it’s no surprise she’s the highest-ranked romcom heroine on this list. It also doesn’t hurt that, at their best, Bridget’s movies are what romantic comedies aspire to: They’re fun, cute, and just when it feels like everything’s about to fall apart, there’s the exhilarating little twist at the end that leaves watchers feel like they’re floating on air.(Photo by Paramount Pictures)&nbsp;Clueless (1995)  81%#17It’s true that Cher is a little oblivious to the world at large, but she’s just so earnest and she tries so hard. She discovers a passion for doing good after successfully matchmaking a pair of teachers, and after a series of difficult lessons learned, she makes an honest effort to escape her privileged bubble and become a better person. Like we all should.(Photo by MGM Studios)&nbsp;Thelma &amp; Louise (1991)  85%#18Thelma and Louise, best friends who stick by each other no matter what. And when their girls’ getaway weekend quickly turns from frivolous to frightening, they find even deeper levels of loyalty to each other. Geena Davis and Susan Sarandon have an effortless chemistry with each other, and Ridley Scott’s intimate and thrilling film never judges these women for the decisions they make — or for the lengths to which they’ll go in the name of freedom.(Photo by Warner Brothers)&nbsp;The Color Purple (1985)  81%#19Enduring racism, misogyny, and emotional, physical, and sexual violence, Celie (Whoopi Goldberg in her film debut) transcends her traumatic life in the rural South, finding friends, strength, and her own voice.(Photo by Sony Pictures Classics)&nbsp;A Fantastic Woman (Una mujer fantástica) (2018)  94%#20As a transgender waitress, Marina constantly endures cruelty and confusion from the ignorant people around her. When the one man who loves her for who she truly is dies unexpectedly, she finds herself in the midst of an even more emotional, personal fight. Transgender actress Daniela Vega initially was hired as a consultant on Sebastian Lelio’s film; instead, she became its star, and A Fantastic Woman deservedly won this year’s foreign-language Oscar.(Photo by TriStar Pictures)&nbsp;Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991)  93%#21Sarah Connor makes many want to be a better mother – or at least get to the gym and work on our triceps. The once-timid waitress crafts herself into a force of nature, a fearsome and visceral manifestation of pure maternal instinct. Played most memorably by Linda Hamilton in the first two Terminator&nbsp;movies, Sarah may seem unhinged, but she’s got laser-like focus when it comes to protecting her son, John, from the many threats coming his way.(Photo by Miramax Films)&nbsp;Jackie Brown (1997)  87%#22The return of blaxploitation queen, Pam Grier! What’s not to love? Especially in Quentin Tarantino’s killer love letter to South Bay Los Angeles. As Jackie Brown, Grier exudes classic cool with a tough exterior.(Photo by Richard Olley/Columbia Pictures)&nbsp;Zero Dark Thirty (2013)  91%#23Jessica Chastain has made a career of playing quick-witted characters with nerves of steel. Nowhere is this truer than in her starring role in Kathryn Bigelow’s thrilling depiction of the hunt for Osama bin Laden. Maya is obsessively focused in her pursuit of the al Qaeda leader. She’s a confident woman who has to be extra prepared to survive in a man’s world. But when the mission is over and she finally allows some emotion to shine through, it’s cathartic for us all.(Photo by Warner Brothers/ Everett Collection)&nbsp;Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (2004)  90%#24She’s the smartest kid in the class, regardless of the subject. The hardest worker, too. And she’s proud of those qualities, making her an excellent role model for girls out there with an interest in math and science. But Hermione isn’t all about the books. Over the eight Harry Potter&nbsp;films, in Emma Watson’s increasingly confident hands, Hermione reveals her resourcefulness, loyalty, and grace. She’s a great student but an even better friend.(Photo by Columbia Pictures/ Everett Collection)&nbsp;His Girl Friday (1940)  98%#25Howard Hawks’ celebrated screwball comedy benefited from a not-so-small change to the stage play it was based on: In the original The Front Page, Hildy Johnson was a male. But thanks to Rosalind Russell’s lively performance, as well as a few script changes she personally insisted upon, the character blossomed into an early icon of the independent working woman who’s not only just as effective at her job as her male counterparts, but also equally adept with a witty comeback.(Photo by Walt Disney/ Everett Collection)&nbsp;The Incredibles (2004)  97%#26Elastigirl takes on all the trials of motherhood: She’s got hyper kids, a bored husband, and has to witness certain parts of her body unperkify. Elastigirl also just happens to be a superhero, with the fate of the world resting on her shoulders.(Photo by Universal/courtesy Everett Collection)&nbsp;Serenity (2005)  82%#27Fans of the short-lived but beloved Fox sci-fi series Firefly were already familiar with Gina Torres‘ badassery as Zoe Washburne in Serenity. A veteran of the Unification War and second in command of the ship, Zoe is a strong and loyal ally who rarely pulls punches, whether she’s stating a controversial opinion or engaged in a literal fistfight. With her free spirit and deadly skills, it’s no wonder she became a fan favorite.(Photo by 20th Century Fox Film Corp./courtesy Everett Collection)&nbsp;9 to 5 (1980)  83%#28Dolly Parton is a national treasure, and 9 to 5&nbsp;allows her to light up the screen with her sparkling, charismatic personality. But while Doralee may seem like a sweet Southern gal, she’s got a stiff backbone and a sharp tongue, and she isn’t afraid to use them when she’s crossed. When she finally stands up to her sexist bully of a boss alongside co-workers Lily Tomlin and Jane Fonda, it’s nothing short of a revolution – one that remains sadly relevant today.(Photo by Columbia Pictures/courtesy Everett Collection)&nbsp;A League of Their Own (1992)  79%#29The story of the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League is one that deserves to be told, and it’s Geena Davis‘ Dottie Hinson who grounds this fictional account. She’s a talented local player who becomes the star of the Rockford Peaches, and it’s her quick thinking that brings publicity to the sport. When her decision to play in the World Series leads to a spectacular finish, she also demonstrates a very human vulnerability, making her a strong but relatable heroine.(Photo by Focus Features/courtesy Everett Collection)&nbsp;Pride and Prejudice (2005)  86%#30Jane Austen’s classic heroine Elizabeth Bennet jumps off the page in the 2005 film starring Keira Knightley, who gives audiences an intelligent, down-to-Earth, sometimes literally dirty, but uncompromisingly steadfast leading lady.(Photo by Everett Collection)&nbsp;Legally Blonde (2001)  70%#31Never underestimate a sorority girl. They are organized and they know how to get what the want. In the case of Elle Woods, she goes after her law school goals with a smile on her face, a spring in her step, and an impeccably coordinated wardrobe. Reese Witherspoon is impossibly adorable in the role, with a potent combination of smarts and heart to shut down the naysayers who are foolish enough to judge her simply by her looks.(Photo by Warner Bros./Courtesy Everett Collection)&nbsp;Live Die Repeat: Edge of Tomorrow (2014)  91%#32Talk brashly and carry a big sword. As Tom Cruise’s character unravels a complex time travel sci-fi story, a constant in his fluctuating world is Rita Vrataski aka the killer Angel of Verdun. But Emily Blunt gives life to Rita beyond burgeoning love interest. She takes the lead and makes the movie just as much her’s.(Photo by Marvel Studios)&nbsp;Captain Marvel (2019)  79%#33When Nick Fury sent that mysterious intergalactic text message right before disappearing into dust at the end of Avengers: Infinity War, eager fans knew what was in store. As played by Brie Larson, Captain Marvel is one of the most powerful superheroes in the MCU — if not THE most powerful — and she’s in such high demand that she spends most of her time battling evil on other planets. She shows up when it counts, though, and she can rock a mowhawk like nobody’s business.(Photo by Paramount /Courtesy Everett Collection)&nbsp;A Quiet Place (2018)  96%#34Though hit hard by tragedy and seemingly insurmountable odds of surviving an alien invasion, mother and daughter duo Evelin and Regan Abbott prove their mettle in A Quiet Place.(Photo by Paramount Pictures / Courtesy: Everett Collection)&nbsp;Star Trek: The Motion Picture (1979)  40%#35Played first in film by the groundbreaking star of the Star Trek TV series, Nichelle Nichols, the role was passed on to Zoe Saldana in the 2009 reboot film.

She slays vampires while juggling cheerleading and the SATs. But while Kristy Swanson gives the character a satricial bent, it’s the legendary TV adaptation that gives this character a lasting legacy.

She draws attention to disability representation and the lack of accessibility in many theaters she visits for screenings. She’s determined to not be the only person people think of when they hear “disability” and “criticism” in the same sentence.“I don’t speak for everybody, and I would love to have more disabled critics that I could disagree with and be like, No, you’re wrong,” she told Rotten Tomatoes. “I can’t speak for every single disability in the world. There is only so much time in the day that I can devote to writing, I can’t hit everything. I need some other critics to help share the load with me.”Last year,&nbsp;Lopez contributed to Rotten Tomatoes’ first book,&nbsp;Rotten Movies We Love.&nbsp;Her take on&nbsp;The Greatest Showman&nbsp;– as with many of her reviews – suggests that our reactions to movies are personal, even&nbsp;sometimes contradictory, when it comes to style and story. “As a disabled person, it’s so flawed and ableist, but I love the music and the flash,” she told Rotten Tomatoes.Lopez is a Los Angeles-based pop culture writer&nbsp;whose work can be found at Culturess, Forbes, The Movie Isle, Citizen Dame, and Remezcla, among many others.How do you watch award shows?For the first time last year, I watched the Oscars by myself. It was very, very odd, but it allowed me to sit in my pink PJs and eat sushi and yell at the TV, which was nice… I feel like award shows are not something you need to endure alone. You should have friends. Especially when things go wrong.What’s your favorite screening snack?I’m an M&amp;Ms person. I need to have something to keep my mind focused on a movie, and M&amp;Ms are one of those where I can just – I’m sure annoying to whoever I’m sitting next to – I can roll them around in my mouth and have something to focus on.Do you have a movie theater pet peeve?It’s the people that buy the handicap companion seat that they don’t need… I’ve been fortunate that if I ask somebody to move, nine times out of 10, they’ll be like, “Okay” – but that’s always my pet peeve.You’re sitting down to write. Do you prefer a shot of alcohol or espresso, and what is your spirit of choice?I’m a writer, so I can either be an alcoholic or drink coffee, and I prefer to not be an alcoholic, so I drink coffee.Do you read other reviews before or after watching something?I will read reviews after I’ve already seen something, mostly because I want to know if I am completely nuts liking or not liking something. I’m like, “What is everybody else saying?” Then I’ll see that they’re all in love with the movie and I’m sitting there thinking like, “Okay, well, what’s wrong with me? I didn’t like it.”(Photo by IFC Films)Is there an under-the-radar director or screenwriter that you think more people should know about?For me, it’s the team of Mary Harron and Guinevere Turner. They’ve been around forever, but I feel like every time they have something out, people are like, “Oh, yeah. Why are they not doing more?” I say, “Well, they are. It’s just they’re not working with the big studio people yet.”&nbsp;Charlie Says is a really different type of Manson movie that’s really feminist and biting about the misogyny and racism of that time, and it’s awesome.What do you think is the biggest misconception about critics?The biggest misconception is that we hate movies – we only got into this to gripe about things we can’t do, and I have to laugh. I never wanted to be a director. I’ve never wanted to be a screenwriter. I love appreciating films and I love talking about them, especially in the last couple of years where I’ve written about representation and disability. My goal now is I want to talk about movies that should be doing more or are doing really great when it comes to representation that nobody’s talking about.I did not get into this business to work long hours, not make a ton of money, and just be berated on Twitter because I hate films. I got into this because I love movies and I love appreciating them and hopefully influencing somebody to go see something that I love.Is there someone in your life who is not a critic whose opinion you admire?I think as much as I’d like to say I am my own autonomous person and no one else’s opinion is better than mine, I’ll still be like, “Mom, did you think that movie was good?”(Photo by MGM)What is your favorite classic film?Oh, gosh. So many. I love Singin’ in the Rain and Meet Me in St. Louis. It’s a smaller film, but I got to throw out there, too – it’s called On an Island with You. It would never be remade today because it is the story of a guy who knows in his heart that a woman loves him, so he proceeds to kidnap her and put her on a remote island to make her love him by any way, shape, or form, and it’s a romance and it’s delightful. It’s like one of those color spectacles with Esther Williams swimming and it’s a lot of fun, but it is so problematic.Is there an actor, director, or screenwriter whose work you always love?If we’re talking directors, Sofia Coppola. For better or worse, I know that her movies definitely cater to white girls who haven’t really grown out of their teenage dreams, and that’s very much me, so I love her. Actors, the running joke with my friends is that if it’s Oscar Isaac or Jon Bernthal, I will be there no matter what movie it is.Who are some fellow critics whose work you admire?When I was younger and I was first starting out, I always talked about the A.O. Scotts and the Peter Traverses and I realized very late in my life, I was like, “They’re all men. Why do I only gravitate toward male writers?”It’s been a learning process for me to find female critics and people that I do admire, so the April Wolfes, and the Emily VanDerWerffs. Those are the people that I definitely look up to because they are coming at film from marginalized perspective. It’s laying the groundwork for me to go there and talk about a completely different road of thought.(Photo by Sony Pictures Home Entertainment)What is your favorite movie from your childhood?Oh, My Girl. I became an English major because I watched that as a child and I thought Griffin Dunne was the most gorgeous person in the entire world, and I figured if I became an English major, then I would find someone that looked like him. That was a lie, but I did it anyway. My Girl is the reason that I am the way that I am.Do you have advice for critics who are still finding their voice?I’ve been told by people that “nobody goes to the movies to go see reality,” and I say, “Well, that’s not true.” People want to see something that reminds them of them, something that they can relate to, and if your perspective is to look at a film from a trans perspective or a disabled perspective or a race perspective, that’s valuable.I always say that if you have something, a voice or a thought or an angle that you want to explore with a film, you definitely have every right to put that out there. Nine times out of 10, you’ll find somebody who is the exact same way.How has the digital landscape influenced your criticism?It’s funny. I had somebody tell me, “One day you’ll work in a big magazine office,” and I was like, “Not necessarily,” because at the time digital was overtaking print media. But when you are a disabled person, you realize some places aren’t physically prepared for a disabled person to work there. Some places are still not ADA-compliant, so for me, the digital landscape allows me an even playing-field.What are you most proud of in your career so far?I’m always proud of the fact that somebody read something I wrote and they learned something. I do have my nerdy stuff – I’ve interviewed some fantastic people that I never in my wildest dreams thought that I’d get to talk to – but for me, it’s the fact that I get to write about disability and be an expert on something. Never did I think that I use a wheelchair and that made me an expert on something, but I’ve been able to use that and have people say to me, “I didn’t think that way, and you’re right. I should be thinking about disabled people.”The unfortunate fact is that we live in a world now with the way politics are where disabled people are still incredibly marginalized, and I think film is a great conduit to talk about disabled issues, so if somebody reads something I wrote and they say that they’ve learned something from it, I feel like that’s a bigger accomplishment, because teaching somebody like that… I could only have done it with writing.If your life were a movie, what genre would it be?Well, I’ve got the reality there where I would just be like, “No one would tell my story because they don’t tell stories about disabled women,” especially not with a sailor’s mouth and my Twitter feed. They’d say, “No, you don’t exist, we’ve never met a disabled woman like you on-screen. Audiences would not understand it.” That’s how I’m assuming Hollywood would be, but I’d like to think that if ableism was not a factor, it would be a comedy.Kristen Lopez is a freelance pop culture essayist.

David Arquette, a.k.a. Dewey Riley, is also returning, along with co-star and ex-wife Courteney Cox, who will reprise her role as Gale Weathers. On a newly created Instagram account (@screammovies), Paramount also revealed the film’s official title (Scream),&nbsp;release date (January 14, 2022), and a couple of new photos, including a title treatment. Read on for all the full details.[Updated on 11/18/20]The Old Faves: Neve Campbell is Officially Back, along with Courteney Cox and David Arquette(Photo by Phil Bray/©Dimension Films courtesy Everett Collection)We can now officially look forward to&nbsp;the return of Sidney Prescott&nbsp;in&nbsp;Scream 5.In a Five Favorite Films interview with Rotten Tomatoes tied to her newest project, Canadian drama&nbsp;Castle in the Ground, Neve Campbell revealed she was in discussions about the new film.“We’re having conversations –&nbsp;I have been approached about it,” she&nbsp;told Rotten Tomatoes. “The timing’s a bit challenging because of COVID. You know, we only started the conversation maybe a month and a half ago, so it’s going to take some time to figure out how it’s all going to work out…. We’re negotiating, so we’ll see.”It seems she had faith in filmmakers&nbsp;Matt Bettinelli-Olpin&nbsp;and&nbsp;Tyler Gillett, whose most recent film was the Certified Fresh Ready or Not.“The two directors wrote me a very touching letter about Wes Craven and how he was such an inspiration to them and how they really want to honor him, and that meant a great, great deal to me. So we’ll see. Hopefully we can all see eye to eye on the project and find a way to make it.”Campbell added: “I’m so grateful for these films… I love Sidney Prescott. It’s always fun for me to step back in her shoes, and it’s always fun for me to see the cast come back and make one of these films again and try to make another good one.”Then, on September 10, Spyglass and Paramount Pictures officially announced that Campbell would be returning as Sidney, removing all doubt and ending the speculation.All of this comes after&nbsp;Deadline recently reported&nbsp;that Courteney Cox&nbsp;would&nbsp;reprise her role as news reporter Gale Weathers in&nbsp;Scream 5, which will mark her fifth time playing the fan-favorite character. Cox shared an&nbsp;Instagram post&nbsp;which confirmed the news.Directing duo Radio silence – more on them in a bit – said in a statement:&nbsp;“We can’t imagine&nbsp;Scream&nbsp;without the iconic Gale Weathers and are so incredibly thrilled and humbled to have the opportunity to work with Courteney. We’re absolute mega fans of her work and we’re so excited to join her in the next chapter of the&nbsp;Scream&nbsp;saga!”The Hollywood Reporter&nbsp;also reported that David Arquette – who met, fell in love with, married, and ultimately separated from Cox during their time working on the series – is returning to the series as Dewey Riley, the&nbsp;Woodboro Sheriff&nbsp;who has taken a beating – and more than a few stabbings – throughout the franchise.&nbsp;“I am thrilled to be playing Dewey again and to reunite with my&nbsp;Scream&nbsp;family, old and new,” Areuqtte told&nbsp;THR.&nbsp;“Scream&nbsp;has been such a big part of my life, and for both the fans and myself, I look forward to honoring Wes Craven’s legacy.”The New Kids:&nbsp;Boys&nbsp;Star Jack Quaid Joins&nbsp;Scream 5, Along With&nbsp;You‘s Jenna Ortega and&nbsp;In the Heights‘ Melissa Barrera(Photo by Beth Dubber / ©Netflix, Panagiotis Pantazidis / ©Amazon, Kat Marcinowski / ©Starz )While we were all busy wondering which old favorites would be returning — thank you, Neve, for&nbsp;finally signing on —&nbsp;the project announced its first batch of new faces,&nbsp;which will include Jack Quaid from Amazon’s superhero smash,&nbsp;The Boys. The announcement came a week or so after it was announced that Jenna Ortega, who starred in the second season of Netflix’s stalker series,&nbsp;You, and Melissa Barrera, who stars in&nbsp;Vida&nbsp;and the upcoming&nbsp;In the Heights, had also joined the cast. No news on who exactly any of the new cast members will be playing.It Has a Release DateIt was just announced the movie will hit theaters on January 14, 2022.AND THE REST OF WHAT WE KNOW…&nbsp;The feverish anticipation for the new&nbsp;Scream&nbsp;movie is a whole different story than the level of buzz – or lack thereof – that surrounded the original film almost 20 years ago.When Dimension Films announced its intention to release the original Scream in December 1996, critics declared the movie D.O.A. After all, who releases a horror movie during Christmas? But Dimension knew there were a lot of angsty teens looking for something – anything – to serve as an antidote to mistletoe and carols, and the simple question “Do you like scary movies?” ended up receiving a resounding “Yes!” Ever since it stalled out with 2011’s Scream 4, there have been rumors of the cult franchise’s return.It finally seems to be coming to fruition, so here’s what we know about the potential return of Ghostface.Wes Craven’s Baby Is in Good – and Intriguing – Hands(Photo by Eric Zachanowich / TM &amp; copyright © Fox Searchlight Pictures)Horror icon Craven directed all four of the original Scream films, but sadly the legendary creator of A Nightmare on Elm Street and The People Under the Stairs passed away in 2015. It’s been announced, however, that the Scream baton is being handed to Matt Bettinelli-Olpin and Tyler Gillett, the co-directors of 2019’s Ready or Not. That movie was inventive, brutal, and satirically razor-sharp – in other words, Bettinelli-Olpin and Gillett seem like&nbsp;a pretty solid pick to breathe new life into this franchise.The duo, known as Radio Silence, released a statement saying:&nbsp;“It’s impossible to fully express how much Wes Craven’s work and the Scream movies in particular mean to us as fans and have influenced us as storytellers. Kevin Williamson’s incredible stories have entertained and inspired us for decades and we’re insanely honored to have the opportunity to be a part of the cinematic world Wes and Kevin so brilliantly created together. Jamie and Guy’s amazing script does that legacy justice and we’re so excited to bring the next chapter of&nbsp;Scream&nbsp;to life.”The “Jamie and Guy” they’re referring to are writers James Vanderbilt (Murder&nbsp;Mystery,&nbsp;Zodiac) and Guy Busick, who co-wrote&nbsp;Ready Or Not.&nbsp;If you’re wondering whether original&nbsp;Scream&nbsp;scribe Kevin Williamson is involved in the project… scroll down.It May Be Canon, or It May Be a New Beginning(Photo by Dimension Films courtesy Everett Collection)It’s still unclear whether or not this new film is a brand new Scream, or Scream 5 –&nbsp;but at the very least we can assume there will be no retconning. With Campbell in conversations, and Arquette on board, we’re thinking this could be more of a&nbsp;Scream 4&nbsp;situation, with the old gang getting back together, joined by a new crop of youngsters for Ghostface to torment.Yes, Scream 5 and Scream 6&nbsp;Were Already Planned(Photo by Gemma La Mana/Dimension Films courtesy Everett Collection)While promoting Scream 4 in 2011, both Craven and screenwriter Kevin Williamson confirmed that they had 5 and 6 waiting in the wings, should the latest one be another hit. No plot details for either&nbsp;of them&nbsp;were ever revealed, but it was hinted that they&nbsp;would&nbsp;be the start of a new trilogy based around the survivors of part 4. After 4 did middling business at the box office (it only grossed $38.2 million in the U.S.), the enthusiasm for another film died out.Kevin Williamson Is Back(Photo by @screammovies/Instagram)Although he is not listed as writer on the new project as of now, Kevin Williamson has been confirmed to be back onboard at least in an executive producer role. That may turn out to be an honorary credit based on his having written all of the other Scream films and having been – alongside Craven – the driving creative force behind them, but it could also mean he’ll have a more hands-on role. It’s still unclear, but we’re pretty sure Bettinelli-Olpin and Gillett’s Ready or Not writers Guy Busick and R. Christopher Murphy would love a stab (sorry) at writing it.Spyglass Loves a Good RevivalThe rights to the Scream franchise rest with the newly reminted Spyglass Media Group, which is itself a comeback story. Originally founded as Spyglass Entertainment in 1998, the production firm came out swinging with its first film – the pop culture phenomenon The Sixth Sense. It bounced between distribution deals with several studios before fizzling out in 2010, when founders Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum became co-chairmen and CEOs of MGM Holdings. The company reformed in 2019 and announced that its first project would be a remake of the horror classic Hellraiser. They clearly have a “type” and aren’t afraid to retool fan favorites, which gives credence to the idea that the new Scream may be a fresh start.They’re Gearing Up to ShootThe recent&nbsp;Hollywood Reporter&nbsp;article gave us our first indication of timing for the project, with Spyglass apparently looking to start principal photography in late 2020 on Wilmington, North Carolina, once the industry gets back to work following COVID-19. That&nbsp;could&nbsp;place&nbsp;Scream 5&nbsp;in a Halloween 2021 window.Scream Never Really Went Away(Photo by MTV courtesy Everett Collection)Although the last film was released in 2011, the Scream legacy actually continued on in the form of an anthology TV series produced by Dimension Television and MTV. Taking place in the fictional town of Lakewood (not the films’ primary setting, which was the fictional town of Woodsboro), the series featured all new characters and aired on MTV and VH1 from 2015 until 2019. There was also a web series called Scream: If I Die that was released in 2016 and featured video confessionals from some of the characters from the series. If the new movie does continue the franchise directly, it’s unclear (but doubtful) that elements from the TV series would come into play.It Can’t Take on Slasher Tropes Again, Can It?(Photo by Dimension Films courtesy Everett Collection)By the time the original Scream came out, horror films of the late ’80s and early ’90s were mired in a loop of increasingly ridiculous cheeseball sequels featuring predictably unstoppable killers and blood-soaked Z-list actors. Scream breathed new life into horror by being self-referential and self-aware. It cleverly&nbsp;mocked horror movie clichés while also indulging in them. Whether it’s a remake or a reboot, the new Scream enters a world in which horror occupies a much different place than it did in 1996. With big time talents like Jordan Peele (Get Out, Us),&nbsp;Robert Eggers (The Lighthouse, The Witch), Jennifer Kent (The Babadook,&nbsp;The Nightingale), Ari Aster (Midsommar, Hereditary), and Julia Docournau (Raw) bringing horror into art houses and the Oscars, it’s a much more difficult target for satire than Jason Takes Manhattan. The rules have changed, and it’ll be interesting to see if Scream can adapt or if it will once again try and revisit the slasher.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"Polls, BET, worst, video, Holidays, archives, films, Box, Peacock, movies, Grammys, Games, boxoffice, Mary","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"everything-we-know-about-scream-5"},{"id":"47611989634201","title":"What Happened to Cinema’s Virginal Final Girl?","content":"Newsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})What Happened to Cinema's Virginal Final Girl?Happy Death Day, Assassination Nation and horror's new last woman standing.by Cate Young | March 6, 2020 |  CommentsThis&nbsp;feature is by Catherine Young,&nbsp;the&nbsp;current USC Annenberg-Rotten Tomatoes Digital Innovation and Entertainment Criticism fellow, a partnership with the USC Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism. Cate is writing on the representation of women in film.&nbsp;Horror movie fans will be familiar with the concept of the&nbsp;Final Girl. The term was originally conceived in 1992 by&nbsp;Carol J. Clover&nbsp;as a way to describe the traits of the sole female victim who remains alive to tell the story of a film’s violent crime –&nbsp;or&nbsp;many&nbsp;violent crimes. Clover’s central idea was that, in the films where the trope is evident, the viewer initially sees the Final Girl through the killer’s perspective, but that partway through the movie, they begin to identify directly with her instead.Final Girls illustrated the moral split between the chaste and the virtuous. You know the deal – the hard-drinking, promiscuous girl dies first, and the demure, virginal girl survives to take down the murderer.&nbsp;She’s the final one standing. Pop culture is replete with characters that fit the bill – Jess Bradford in the original&nbsp;Black Christmas, Sally Hardesty in&nbsp;The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Nancy Thompson in&nbsp;The Nightmare on Elm Street&nbsp;–&nbsp;and their existence has become as integral to the slasher genre as the killers themselves.(Photo by Lionsgate/Courtesy Everett Collection)But that was then and this is now. The&nbsp;original Final Girl is slowly but surely being crowded out by a newer, more progressive iteration that acknowledges the restrictive ideas that initially gave birth to her. Over the last couple of decades, and particularly in the last 10 years, the last girl standing has looked a lot different from the final girls of the past.&nbsp;Progressively, in&nbsp;films like&nbsp;Scream,&nbsp;The Cabin In The Woods&nbsp;and&nbsp;It Follows, final girls have complicated the existing frame of the trope by pushing against its restrictions.&nbsp;Whether it’s by having sex, refusing to be constricted by archaic ideas of femininity, or simply by teaming up to fight together, these women now survive despite leading lives the genre used to consider wholly immoral and in need of corrective punishment – they’re a new kind of Final Girl. The Final Girls who were introduced in the 1970s and 1980s have become more nuanced over time, and that progress paved the way for the Finals Girls of&nbsp;Ready or Not&nbsp;and 2019’s&nbsp;Black Christmas&nbsp;who directly confront issues of misogyny and sex negativity.In some ways, the&nbsp;New Final Girl&nbsp;is almost the original Final Girl’s polar opposite. Rather than surviving because of her innocence, naïveté or virginity, the New Final Girl is the woman who makes it to the end of the film alive specifically because of her rejection of the old norms about what makes a woman morally deserving. The New Final Girl embraces drink, drugs, and sex and defends her engagement in each of them. She insists on being seen as a full human being and actively, often violently defends her right to do so. Most of all, the New Final Girl is still an active participant in her own survival – she knows the original Final Girl shouldn’t have had to sand off her edges to stay alive. The New Final Girl is not a virginal survivor but an intentional fighter who asserts her right to exist despite perceived moral flaws.(Photo by © Universal /Courtesy Everett Collection)In the 2019 sequel slasher&nbsp;Happy Death Day 2U, Tree Gelbman (Jessica Rothe) finds herself once again stuck in the murderous time loop of the first film. Over and over, she relives the same day, and it ends when she is brutally murdered by a serial killer known as Babyface. In the first film, the culprit is Tree’s sorority sister and roommate Lori (Ruby Modine). The two women are both having an affair with the same married professor, and Lori’s jealousy puts Tree in her crosshairs. In the sequel, Babyface is none other than the philandering professor himself, trying to eliminate any evidence of his transgressions.What makes Tree’s Final Girl status so interesting is that she begins the story as one of the “immoral women” who would usually die in a thriller. Tree is, by all accounts, a typical sorority mean girl. When we meet her, she is recovering from a night of partying and on her way to meet the professor she’s carrying on with. And in fact, she does die, over and over again, punished for her ruthlessness, immorality, and general misbehavior. But through the mechanics of the film itself, she evolves into a New Final Girl through sheer determination.&nbsp;(Photo by © Universal /Courtesy Everett Collection)In both films, Tree breaks her loop and returns to her life not by becoming more virtuous, but by becoming a more compassionate and considerate person. She improves and grows as a character – including ending her affair – not because those things make her unworthy of redemption, but because they are not the best choices for her as a person. She undergoes significant character growth without ever placing a moral frame on her sexuality or femininity. And through each of the infinite deaths it takes her to get there, she plots and schemes to find her killer and thwart them, determined to prevent her eventual death and save herself.&nbsp;Tree is a novel subversion of the trope because it’s her death itself that furthers her character growth. Several times, she intentionally kills herself in service of a larger goal; sometimes to gather more information about her situation and sometimes to undo the murders of other characters. As a result, her deaths then become an intentional sacrifice that signals her increasing virtue, instead of confirming its absence. It’s a large departure from the way the original Final Girls functioned in films like these.(Photo by © Universal/courtesy Everett Collection)Similarly, the evolution of&nbsp;Halloween’s Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) into a New Final Girl in the film’s 2018 sequel of the same name is particularly notable because the character’s first iteration was in many ways the definitive final girl – most other examples are direct descendants of her legacy. In the first film, Strode is left as the sole survivor of the serial killer Michael Myers’ murder spree – the only young woman in the film who chose to abstain from the usual vices. Her survival largely conformed to expectations for women in horror at the time, and helped to cement the trope in the genre.But in the film’s most recent sequel – which retcons several that had come before –Laurie is now an older woman, driven to extremes by her fixation on stopping Myers’ return. In the 40 years since the events of the first film, Laurie has grown into an obsessive, battle-worn veteran of the war in her own mind.&nbsp;She may not be having sex or doing drugs, but she’s far from the pure, “likable” babysitter we met decades earlier. She is convinced that Myers will return and has devoted her life to preparing for that eventuality. In the process she has lost custody of her daughter and become estranged from her daughter’s family. She is perceived as a lonely old woman too traumatized by her past to move on.&nbsp;(Photo by © Universal/courtesy Everett Collection)Of course, Myers does eventually return. But this time Laurie is ready for him, having rigged her entire house to trap and kill him. Whereas in 1978 she was permitted to survive by virtue of her moral purity, in 2018 she fights like hell for that survival, taking active steps to make sure that Myers can no longer victimize her. She takes the lead in tracking Myers down and trapping him on her home turf. After spending years contemplating and preparing for the return of his torment, Laurie has transformed herself into the Ultimate Final Girl through sheer force of will. She has no intention of being defeated yet again.Critically, Laurie must also protect her daughter Karen (Judy Greer) and granddaughter Allyson (Virginia Gardener) this time around, folding them into a generational legacy of victimization and defense. When the threat they have dismissed for so long reveals itself to be real, they join forces with Laurie to fight and eliminate it – Myers is now a specter that haunts them all, the source of their estrangement and the origin of their familial trauma. Defeating Myers together connects the women as Final Girls of a new generation, forcing them all to overlook their own and each other’s flaws in order to face the embodiment of their fractured relationships. Laurie leads the charge, but her family takes up her mantle.&nbsp;This isn’t to say that the old trope never survives. In fact, Allyson’s best friend Vicky is killed during a babysitting job soon after letting her wayward boyfriend into the house. It wouldn’t be a stretch to interpret her death as the same kind of stark moral judgement that historically happened in slasher films. This is especially true given the contrast with Allyson’s own encounter with Myers. After her boyfriend’s best friend inappropriately propositions her, he is immediately murdered while she survives. His overeager instinct to breach her consent should absolutely have been corrected, but death is a disproportionate response. The message couldn’t be clearer: all sexual impulses exist along the same punishable continuum, regardless of how welcome they might be to the participants involved.&nbsp;(Photo by © Neon /Courtesy Everett Collection)One of the&nbsp;starkest examples of this shift in recent years is 2018’s&nbsp;Assassination Nation,&nbsp;which explored the trope in thrilling style. Set in conservative Salem, the movie focuses on a group of teen girls who find themselves at the center of a small-town lynch mob when they are blamed for the release of the community’s private information. The girls are not guilty of the mass doxing, but their reputations as “loose women” make them ideal targets for the ire and anger of the town’s men and boys.&nbsp;The girls — Lily (Odessa Young), Sarah (Suki Waterhouse), Bex (Hari Nef), and Em (Abra) –&nbsp;are known at their high school for their skimpy outfits, their questionable choices in boys, and their perceived promiscuity. They are open about and proud of their burgeoning sexuality and enjoy exploring their relationships to the men in their lives. Lily is dating an abusive high school boy and carrying on an illicit affair with a married neighbor. Bex is trans and keeping her relationship with the popular football player a secret at his request. Sarah and Em are living with their mother Nance, who is implied to be operating a brothel out of her home.&nbsp;When the&nbsp;community&nbsp;devolves into ultraviolence, the citizens hunt the girls across the town, determined to punish them for being forced to confront their own once-private sexual shames. As the balance of power shifts, the horror genre tropes follow in quick succession. From a coordinated home invasion to a horde of masked killers to&nbsp;the use of guns and baseballs bats — the most American of weapons&nbsp;—&nbsp;the girls suddenly find themselves in the middle of their very own slasher film.(Photo by © Neon /Courtesy Everett Collection)At another time, all four of these women would be fated to die before the credits rolled. Their proximity to vice marks them as fallen women, and only the morally pure survive the transformative power of abject terror. But as New Final Girls, all four of them not only survive but continue on to restore order to the town. The girls rescue each other from the outsized violence the men are trying to inflict on them (including an attempted rape and hanging) and take up arms to defend themselves both literally and in abstract. The film ends as they deliver a call to action to the town’s girls, surrounded by bodies and covered in glitter, both claiming the righteousness of their femininity and rejecting the ubiquity of patriarchal terror. Through female solidarity they all survive and mete out the violence necessary to do so.&nbsp;Assassination&nbsp;Nation&nbsp;is unique in that the girls are explicitly targeted because of their sexuality – usually, this aspect of the genre is left as subtext. But here, the trope is almost deconstructed by bringing both the reasons for their attack and subsequent defense to the surface. They become New Final Girls because, given the plot constraints, their only options are to transform themselves or die.&nbsp;(Photo by © Universal Pictures / courtesy Everett Collection)The New Final Girl is a natural evolution of the original trope. Stories are becoming more egalitarian, and with that comes a necessary examination of the moral dimension of the traditional way women are depicted on film. But in the end, all these Final Girls aren’t as different from each other as we might think. The virtuous distinction that we make between them is largely based on an old patriarchal frame that divides women into Madonnas and Whores, then kills the whores. Part of making the genre more progressive – or dare I say&nbsp;feminist –&nbsp;is rejecting that binary entirely.Teenaged Laurie Strode and college-aged Tree Gelbman might have led different lives and made different choices, but when it came down to it, they both survived because they resolved to fight and refused to die. The haunting specter of violent masculinity came for all the women mentioned here, and they all triumphed, even under the restrictive gaze of a society that expects feminine perfection. But no matter how stark the contrast may be, these changes are progressive strides that honor the history of the slasher genre in inventive ways while bringing them into the contemporary moment. The Final Girl survived, but the New Final Girl thrives, and she’s ready to fight again another day.Follow Catherine Young on Twitter @battymamzelle","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"biography","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"what-happened-to-cinemas-virginal-final-girl"},{"id":"47612093121710","title":"The 21 Masters Of Horror Shaping the Genre Right Now","content":"Newsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})The 21 Masters Of Horror Shaping the Genre Right NowAri Aster, Jordan Peele, Jennifer Kent, Guillermo del Toro, James Wan, and more directors and directing pairs fueling the horror genre's continued resurgence.by April Wolfe | July 6, 2019 |  CommentsIn the 1970s and 1980s, a horror renaissance rocked the film industry, riding on the wave of George Romero’s 1969 low-budget zombie breakout Night of the Living Dead. There was a general feeling that something special was happening, where even directors as esteemed as Stanley Kubrick, Nicolas Roeg, and Peter Medak were flocking to the genre, while others more dedicated to horror, like Tobe Hooper, John Carpenter, and Wes Craven were pushing the goal posts for scares. Even though the enthusiasm for innovative horror waned somewhat in the past couple of decades, with notable exceptions from the likes of Craven and newcomers like James Wan, the special feeling of a “movement” in horror seems to have finally returned, and with it a new class of the Masters of Horror who will lead us through the dark.Whittling this list to 21 was a near-impossible task when you’ve got so many visionary filmmakers working in the genre, including queen Karyn Kusama (The Invitation), the Soska sisters (Rabid), Julia Ducournau (Raw), Coralie Fargeat (Revenge), Hélène Cattet and Bruno Forzani (Amer), Chelsea Stardust (Satanic Panic), Ana Asensio (Most Beautiful Island), Nia DaCosta (the upcoming Candyman), Na Hong-jin (The Wailing), Ti West (The Innkeepers), Jorge Michel Grau (We Are What We Are), Jennifer Wexler (The Ranger), Joko Anwar (Satan’s Slaves), Mattie Do (Dearest Sister), Gigi Guerrero (Culture Shock), Xander Robin (Are We Not Cats), and Demian Rugna (Terrified). (That’s not to mention producers like Jason Blum, dedicating their professional lives&nbsp;to scaring us stupid; but we’re limiting this roll call to directors, though some of those produce, as you’ll see. )The list goes on and on, but here’s 21 that have made our blood pump and eyes pop recently, and are pushing the genre forward with every new work they make.Ari Aster(Photo by James Minchin /© A24 /Courtesy Everett Collection)Ari Aster, much like George Romero, did not see himself as a horror director before his breakout debut. Hereditary, starring Toni Collette in an awards-worthy performance, is a family drama that plays out like one long exhilarating gasp for breath. Aster’s follow-up, Midsommar digs around in the same psychological playground, though this time covering the dissolution of a romantic relationship. Both films recategorize the meaning of “scare,” as Aster mines the terror of simply being uncomfortable with other people to a nearly wacky psycho-comedy effect.Jordan Peele(Photo by Claudette Barius / © Universal)What else is there to say about Jordan Peele? He single-handedly proved that black people want to see themselves in horror films and that other people all over the world would like to see it too. His films stray so far from what many would deem commercially acceptable — a lengthy monologue about inequality delivered amongst a bunch of rabbits in a kind of magical basement world? And yet his stories are compelling because they’re unlike anything else in theaters, their cinematic influences evident but not overbearing. Peele’s making horror weird again, and he’s making it matter.Jennifer Kent(Photo by ©IFC Midnight/Courtesy Everett Collection)When Jennifer Kent’s debut horror The Babadook shocked audiences, the potential for horror to mine desperate grief came into 20/20 view. Not only that, but distinctly down-and-dirty, terrible, feminine grief. It’s not unusual for horror films to star women — this has been a defining characteristic of the genre — but it was unusual to see a heroine slowly morph into a highly relatable villain in such a visceral manner. In her newest film The Nightingale, Kent continues to push her heroines past a point of likeability with an eye on doing away with the “strong woman” trope that has rendered so many female characters into caricatures of femininity.Mike Flanagan(Photo by Justin M. Lubin/© Universal Pictures /Courtesy Everett Collection)Mike Flanagan has toiled in the genre fields for almost two decades, writing, directing, and editing his own films, which included Ghosts of Hamilton Street, Absentia, Oculus, and Hush, before he got his name-making box office hit, Ouija: Origin of Evil. Flanagan has a rare ability to please mainstream audiences while still pushing boundaries of horror, as he did with the wildly popular Haunting of Hill House Netflix series, which, among other cool tricks, hid a number of ghosts in the frame. That kind of subtle innovation comes from a filmmaker who’s familiar with all tools at their disposal, and his adaptation of a sequel to The Shining, Doctor Sleep, is much anticipated for that reason.Issa LopezMexican director Issa Lopez made a name for herself in her native country by directing a series of comic films, but her debut horror film Tigers Are Not Afraid&nbsp;(trailer above) couldn’t have been a bigger departure from her earlier career. Filled with wonder and grit and meaningful insights into childhood, trauma, and the human soul in the harshest environment imaginable, the film has been racking up fans and awards long before its U.S. release on Shudder. Guillermo del Toro luckily saw the film and immediately signed up to produce her next movies, so this Master in the making is already well on her way.Guillermo del Toro(Photo by Kerry Hayes/©Universal Pictures/Courtesy Everett Collection)Speaking of Guillermo del Toro, it’s difficult to overstate how much of a boon for horror this visionary director has been, but del Toro was pioneering new directions for horror years before it came back in fashion. From Cronos and The Devil’s Backbone all the way up to Pan’s Labyrinth and the slept-on Crimson Peak, del Toro’s body of work feels so ingrained in the culture that it’s almost easy to take him for granted. Not to mention that he’s spent a great deal of time championing the newer generation of horror directors like Issa Lopez, Scott Cooper, and André Øvredal, producing double the number of films he directs himself. He is, for all intents and purposes, the godfather of the new Masters of Horror.Isa Mazzei &amp; Daniel Goldhaber(Photo by © Netflix)This pair of collaborators burst on the scene with last year’s Netflix horror hit, Cam&nbsp;(pictured above),&nbsp;about a cam girl sex worker whose identity is stolen and used against her. In a novel twist, the film was also respectful of women, Johns, and sex workers, never resorting to staid clichés, signaling that the pair could inclusively expand the frontiers of horror. Announcements for their next project with Blumhouse have been thin, but the film is certainly driven by women, and they’ll also be wading into TV horror with a segment for Quibi’s new 50 States of Fear.Pascal Laugier(Photo by ©Weinstein Company/Courtesy Everett Collection)Martyrs&nbsp;(pictured above) is not what many would call an easy film to watch. But Pascal Laugier’s most notorious feature is quite masterful. A story that opens like a revenge flick but closes with a hammer-to-the-nose of philosophical insights into perceived womanhood and spirituality, Martyrs follows in the New French Extremity footsteps of Claire Denis’ Trouble Every Day. After Martyrs, Laugier tried his hand at American horror with Jessica Biel starrer The Tall Man, but returned to his roots in 2018’s Incident in a Ghostland. Laugier shows that gore with a brain is on the menu for horror fans.Andy Muschietti(Photo by Brooke Palmer/© Warner Bros. /Courtesy Everett Collection)In 2013, Argentine director Andy Muschietti had an international hit on his hands with Mamá, about a young couple who take in their two young nieces but find that a malicious supernatural entity has decided they’re her next victims of a haunting. The film starred Jessica Chastain, setting up Muschietti’s desire to make genre but with actors of high esteem attached, which led to his re-envisioning Stephen King’s It in a two-movie release, vaunted for its playful but serious take on the story. Next up, Muschietti’s going the monster route with an adaptation of Hajime Isayama’s Attack on Titan, and is rumored to be directing DC’s The Flash.Kiyoshi Kurosawa(Photo by © Kimstim Films / courtesy Everett Collection)Kiyoshi Kurosawa is not a newcomer by any means. He’s been working steadily in genre and outside of it since the 1980s, as a critic, commercial artist, and a creative filmmaker. In 2001, he released his most well-known cult film Pulse, but his recent return to genre suggests he’s not quite finished being a Master. In 2016, he released Creepy, a thrilling hardboiled mystery, which he then followed up with Before We Vanish, which is an alien invasion story equal parts horror and humor that opens with a risky, bloody bang.Nicolas Pesce(Photo by © Magnet Releasing /Courtesy Everett Collection)The Eyes of My Mother&nbsp;(pictured above), Nicolas Pesce’s debut feature, bucks so many contemporary trends of horror, shot in black and white like a high-art film but with the creeping childishness of Tobe Hooper. He followed that up with a Cronenberg Crash-style film called Piercing that turns a sex-torture story into a screwball comedy of errors and power dynamics. Pesce’s films explore loneliness and connection with wry humor, and yet somehow it’s his visual style, evocative of classic films filled with texture and tactile pleasantness like every object has meaning and purpose, that make him a new Master.Anna Biller(Photo by © Oscilloscope / courtesy Everett Collection)Anna Biller’s version of horror feels akin to classic fairy tales. They are rife with artifice yet also completely honest. Focused on sex and sexuality but coy and childlike. There is the sense that the director is telling the story of the world as it is while simultaneously wishing the world to be different. Viva is more an off-kilter soapy drama, while her film The Love Witch&nbsp;(pictured above) more fully embodies horror. Rumor has it she’s been shopping another horror story based on the Bluebeard tale, but be patient for her next one: Biller’s obsessive about costuming, locations, and production design, and makes most everything herself, which is a time-consuming act but is ultimately the key to her success as a modern Master.Agnieszka Smoczynska(Photo by ©Janus Films)Half the fun of Agnieszka Smoczyńska’s debut feature The Lure&nbsp;(pictured above) is describing it for those who don’t know: a gritty, glittery Polish mermaid horror disco musical. The film was a time capsule of Cold War-era dancing clubs, mixed with classic fairy tales and contemporary rage-filled feminism. Music that’s as catchy as it is dark and an almost surreal, theatrical production design set The Lure apart, earning it an almost instant Criterion release. Her follow-up, Fugue, looks inward for a more cerebral melodrama of psychological terror, with the kind of innovative camera work and sensitivity that display Smoczynska’s ability to play with mind as well as body in her horror.Peter Strickland(Photo by © A24)Peter Strickland digested decades of Italian gore and giallo films, then washed it down the exploitation work of Jess Franco and spit out such atmospheric insta-classics as Berberian Sound Studio and The Duke of Burgundy. His newest film In Fabric&nbsp;(poster above) had so much hype and magic behind it that A24 quickly snapped it up out of the festivals. Both eerie and ethereal, In Fabric tells the story of a murderous red dress; like a chilling version of The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants, this thing will fit everyone but also kill them. And like his predecessors, Strickland squeezes every inch of terror out of sound design and trippy, mirrored effects, perfectly marrying the past with the present.Ana Lily Amirpour(Photo by ©Kino Lorber)Ana Lily Amirpour’s low-budget indie hit A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night&nbsp;(pictured above) thrilled for its simple but fully realized black-and-white graphic novel aesthetics. It’s not every filmmaker whose first film creates some of the most memorable iconography in recent horror film history, but Amirpour’s vision of a young woman gliding on a skateboard with her veil flowing behind her struck a chord for women, a seeming statement about feminine violence and traditional values butting up against Western ideals. Her follow-up The Bad Batch was a sunny apocalyptic trip through the desert, but in the meantime she directed a beloved episode of the new Twilight Zone and has been attached to the remake of Cliffhanger.Babak Anvari(Photo by Kit Fraser / © Vertical Entertainment / courtesy Everett Collection)Babak Anvari’s Under the Shadow&nbsp;(pictured above) broke new ground in folk horror and is a rare Certified Fresh at 99%. In it, he exploited the tale of jinn, those malevolent spirits of Islamic mythology, but grounded the story in the very real cultural conflict of the Iran-Iraq war in the 1980s, as told through a belabored mother who’d much rather finish her medical degree than stay at home with the young daughter who acts almost like an anchor to a more traditional life. Vivid and tense, the film found an international audience, leading to his newest release, an American production called Wounds and a new television series titled North American Lake Monsters, where Anvari can further dig into local lore.David F. Sandberg(Photo by Justin Lubin. ©Warner Bros.)David F. Sandberg’s short “Lights Out” terrified audiences internationally with a simple light trick that harkened back to the early days of horror. That short, made for nothing and starring his charismatic wife Lotta Losten, was then developed into a feature starring Teresa Palmer. James Wan continued to help Sandberg develop his career, giving him a spot in The Conjuring franchise, directing Annabelle: Creation. Sandberg has temporarily waded into superheroes with the lighthearted Shazam!, but he’s stated he’s looking forward to coming back to horror real soon, hopefully utilizing the same creative low-budget ideas that gave him his big break.James Wan(Photo by Michael Tackett/©Warner Bros. Pictures/courtesy Everett Collection)Speaking of James Wan, no Masters of Horror list would be complete without the Aussie who harnessed the powers of surprise and low budgets to flip the entire industry on its head with the Saw and Insidious franchises, and then again with The Conjuring. He’s the pop filmmaker of our time, delivering the kind of popcorn fare that actually brings people to the theater, a rare feat. Like his Mexican counterpart Guillermo del Toro, Wan is also producing others’ work at a breakneck pace, passing the torch to his longtime collaborator Leigh Whannell, and Patrick Brice, Akela Cooper, and Michael Chaves.Kevin Kölsch and Dennis Widmyer(Photo by Kerry Hayes / © Paramount / courtesy Everett Collection)Starry Eyes wasn’t Kevin Kölsch and Dennis Widmyer’s first feature, but it was the one that got them long applause at SXSW and a whole lot of horror cred with its black comic take on the entertainment industry, imagining the casting couch as a place to reap souls for Satan. Alex Essoe’s performance as a desperate starlet was one for the history books. At times gruesome and wacky, the film got them the gig remaking Pet Sematary and working on the Scream TV series.Robert Eggers(Photo by ©A24)Robert Eggers may be known for The VVitch, but he might also be known for his obsessively detailed nature, which had him mastering settler’s English for the script and getting the period details correct down to the tiniest nib, likely from his time as a production and costume designer in theater and film. Like Kubrick before him, Eggers is intent on crafting worlds, and his newest film The Lighthouse&nbsp;(pictured above), though more horror-adjacent than his debut, is just as meticulous, digging again into hysteria and how isolation and harsh environments can unravel the mind.Sophia Takal(Photo by . © Oscilloscope / courtesy Everett Collection)Sophia Takal’s trajectory into horror began with low-budget psychological romps through feminine hysteria, in both Green and then her more defined follow-up Always Shine&nbsp;(pictured above), which pitted two young actresses against one another in a remote Big Sur cabin. Her episode of Into the Dark marked an entry into the world of slashers, marrying the cerebral with the bloody physical, and her next film, a remake of the very first slasher, Black Christmas [disclosure: the author of this article is the co-writer of this film], will test that marriage and the viability of slashers in general in this day and age.Don’t see our favorite horror filmmaker above?

Bruce Almighty or Little Nicky? The Man on the Moon or The Wedding Singer? We crunch the numbers to find the answer.by RT Staff | February 12, 2020 |  CommentsAt first glance, pitting Jim Carrey against Adam Sandler may feel a bit like an arbitrary choice, but the two of them have a lot in common. Both got their start in Hollywood on sketch comedy shows (In Living Color for Carrey,&nbsp;Saturday Night Live for Sandler), both enjoyed career highs and a ubiquitous big-screen presence during the 1990s, and both have proven they can handle more dramatic material when the circumstances are right. But on top of all that, both actors have also recently experienced a pop culture resurgence, with Sandler turning in an award-winning performance in the Safdie brothers’&nbsp;Uncut Gems and Carrey not only premiering the second season of his acclaimed HBO series&nbsp;Kidding, but also set to open a major film in one of his most anticipated recent roles as the one and only Dr. Robotnik in&nbsp;Sonic the Hedgehog. Each of them has experienced some intense career highs and lows, and we decided to take a look at their box office earnings, their Tomatomater resumes, and some other fun criteria to decide who is the ultimate funny man.

But&nbsp;that wasn’t the only big/shocking/delightful news of the morning, depending on your perspective. Academy voters proved once again they still have the capacity to&nbsp;deliver a bombshell or two, serving out snubs and surprises in nearly every category – bestowing love on some films we never saw coming (hello,&nbsp;Buster Scruggs) while ignoring other movies that were considered sure things as late in the game as Monday afternoon. Here’s our breakdown of the biggest snubs and surprises of the 2019 Oscar Nominations.SNUB:&nbsp;A Star Is Born (2018)  90% Nominated for Eight Awards, But Bradley Cooper Misses Out for Director(Photo by @ Warner Bros. Pictures)A Star Is Born&nbsp;earned plenty of love from the Academy on Tuesday, but Bradley Cooper missed out on a nomination for Best Director. That category was&nbsp;one of the morning’s most surprising, with Yorgos Lanthimos (The Favourite) and&nbsp;Pawel Pawlikowski (Cold War) getting in ahead of Cooper and Ryan Coogler. (More on Pawlikowski below.) Don’t cry too hard for Cooper, though: He is individually nominated for Best Actor, Best Adapted Screenplay, and for Best Song.SURPRISE:&nbsp;Black Panther (2018)  96%&nbsp;Becomes First Superhero Movie Ever to be Nominated for Best Picture(Photo by © Marvel / © Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures)It was not totally unexpected, but it was never a sure thing either: This morning, Marvel Studios’ Black Panther became the first ever superhero movie to be nominated for Best Picture. The timing is auspicious, with the announcement coming 10 years after The Dark Knight&nbsp;was&nbsp;snubbed in the category, a move&nbsp;that prompted the Academy to widen its Best Picture nominations pool to a potential 10 movies. The movie scored a total of seven nominations, but failed to land a nomination for Best Director for Ryan Coogler. The film also failed to score a nomination for Best Visual Effects, where Christopher Robin scored a surprise nod.SURPRISE AND SNUB:&nbsp;Willem Dafoe Beats Out Ethan Hawke for Best Actor Nomination(Photo by @ A24)For those of us at RT HQ, this one hurt. Ethan Hawke was never a lock for a Best Actor nomination for his incredible portrayal of a priest in crisis in First Reformed, but there was always a chance. He had done well with critics’ groups, and his performance was that good. But our hopes were dashed Tuesday morning when his name wasn’t called. His snub did allow for one of the bigger surprises of the nominations: Willem Dafoe picking up a nomination for his role as artist Vincent van Gogh in Julian Schnabel’s At Eternity’s Gate. (If there was going to be a surprise, we thought it might come in the form of&nbsp;BlacKkKlansman‘s John David Washington, whose co-star Adam Driver did get a nomination for Best Supporting actor.)SNUB: Eighth Grade (2018)  99% And&nbsp;Crazy Rich Asians (2018)  91% Land Zero Nominations(Photo by @ A24)No original screenplay nomination for Eighth Grade&nbsp;writer-director&nbsp;Bo Burnham. No Best Actress nomination for Elsie Fisher. Nada. Many probably saw this coming, though. The film is high up on our Awards Leaderboard, but many of its awards have been for first-time directing or breakthrough performance, categories that have no equivalents at the Oscars. Still, it was a surprise to see the 99% Certified Fresh film get zero love on Tuesday morning. Meanwhile,&nbsp;Crazy Rich Asians, an outside chance at Best Supporting Actress and Best Adapted Screenplay, also failed to make the grade.SURPRISE:&nbsp;Marina de Tavira Is Nominated for Best Supporting Actress for&nbsp;Roma (2018)  95%(Photo by Carlos Somonte / © Netflix / courtesy Everett Collection)The open fifth slot in the Best Supporting Actress category –&nbsp;Amy Adams, Regina King, Emma Stone, and Rachel Weisz were all considered locks –&nbsp;always had the potential to surprise. Many were expecting Emily Blunt to squeeze in for&nbsp;A Quiet Place&nbsp;or Claire Foy to be recognized for&nbsp;First Man; few were expecting&nbsp;Roma’s Marina de Tavira to edge both actresses out. In the film, De Tavira plays Señora Sofia, whose complex relationship with her house keeper centers the film –&nbsp;and who has some memorable scrapes in the family car.SNUB:&nbsp;Timothée Chalamet Gets No Love for&nbsp;Beautiful Boy (2018)  68%(Photo by @ Amazon Studios)Though the film didn’t exactly light up the Tomatometer, critics agreed that Timothée Chalamet’s performance as a young man struggling with addiction in Beautiful Boy was something of a revelation; for the “diner scene” alone many thought he was a shoe-in for a Best Supporting Actor nomination. In the end, Academy voters went with Sam Rockwell and his portrayal of former president George W. Bush in Adam McKay’s Vice. Rockwell won the category last year for Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri.SURPRISE:&nbsp;Coen Bros.’&nbsp;The Ballad of Buster Scruggs (2018)  89%&nbsp;Lands Three Nominations(Photo by © Netflix / courtesy Everett Collection)We’ll be honest, we had not predicted a single nomination for the Coen Bros.’ episodic Netflix Western. And yet the film managed to score noms for Best Original Screenplay, Best Costume Design, and for Best Song for perhaps the most Western-sounding ditty ever written, “When a Cowboy Trades His Spurs for Wings.” The film sits Certified Fresh at 92% on the Tomatometer.SNUB:&nbsp;Justin Hurwitz Loses Out on Best Score Nomination for&nbsp;First Man (2018)  87%(Photo by @ Universal Pictures)Frequent Damien Chazelle collaborator Justin Hurwitz may have won the Golden Globe for Best Original score just weeks ago, but his work went unrecognized by the Academy Tuesday morning. Marco Beltrami, who was also up for a Golden Globe for his score for A Quiet Place, also failed to make the Oscar cut. Instead, If Beale Street Could Talk composer Nicholas Britell and BlacKkKlansman’s Terence Blanchard joined Golden Globe nominees Alexandre Desplat (Isle of Dogs), Ludwig Goransson (Black Panther), and Marc Shaiman (Mary Poppins Returns) in the Oscars category.SURPRISE: Germany’s&nbsp;Never Look Away (2019)  77%&nbsp;Beats Out South Korea’s&nbsp;Burning (Beoning) (2018)  95%&nbsp;for a Foreign Language Slot(Photo by Caleb Deschanel / © Sony Picture Classes )Director Chang-Dong Lee’s Burning is one of 2018’s most acclaimed films, Certified Fresh at 95%, and has been generating buzz on the festival circuit for months (many even hoped for a surprise Best Supporting Actor nomination for Steven Yeun). On Tuesday morning, though, Lee’s film missed out on a slot in the Best Foreign Language Film category, with director Florian Henckel von Donnersmark’s Never Look Away, representing Germany, sneaking in as a surprise contender. Never Look Away, which sits at 81% on the Tomatometer, is a sweeping epic that tracks 30 years of the life of a great artist who is loosely based on German abstract artist Gerhard Richter; the movie also surprised in the Best Cinematography category, picking up a nomination for Caleb Deschanel’s work.SURPRISE: First-time actress Yalitza Aparicio Becomes Second Mexican Woman to be Nominated for Best Actress(Photo by @ Netflix)The Cinderella story continues for Roma star Yalitza Aparicio, who this morning became just the second Mexican woman ever to be nominated for Best Actress (Selma Hayek was the first, nominated for 2002’s&nbsp;Frida). Aparicio got the coveted fifth slot in the Best Actress category over some tough competition, including Emily Blunt and Nicole Kidman, who were both snubbed for their work in Mary Poppins Returns and Destroyer respectively.SNUB: Not a Lovely Day for Year’s Highest-Earning, Best-Reviewed Documentary, Won't You Be My Neighbor? (2018)  97%(Photo by Jim Judkis/© Focus Features/)What does a documentary need to do to get an Oscar nomination? That’s what the makers of Mr. Rogers bio-documentary Won’t You Be My Neighbor? must be asking themselves this morning after their film –&nbsp;the highest-grossing and best-reviewed documentary of the year –&nbsp;failed to be nominated in the Best Documentary category. The filmmakers shouldn’t be too distraught, though: it remains the most awarded documentary of the season according to our Awards Leaderboard.SURPRISE: Poland’s Cold War (Zimna wojna) (2018)  92% Nominated Three Times(Photo by © Amazon Studios)Many thought that two black-and-white foreign-language epics would be too many for the Academy to recognize, and that with Roma sucking up all the oxygen in the room, Pawel Pawlikowski’s Cold War&nbsp;would have to settle for a Foreign Language nomination. It was surprising then when on Tuesday morning Pawlikowski was nominated for Best Director and Lukasz Zal was nominated for Best Cinematography. Pawlikowski’s nomination shut out a number of big-name contenders, including Ryan Coogler (Black Panther), Bradley Cooper (A Star Is Born), and Barry Jenkins (If Beale Street Could Talk).SNUB: Toni Collette’s Hereditary (2018)  89% Performance Goes Unrecognized, Again(Photo by @ A24)Yes, we know it was never going to happen –&nbsp;but that doesn’t make it fair.

You feel the fun, the joy, the wonder. And sometimes the shattering terror. The monsters you had imagined creeping the corners of your mind or darkened bedrooms prowled in full horror on the screen. The awful, awe-inspiring power of witnessing something frightening can reverberate for decades. So in the spirit of Halloween, we asked 12 Tomatometer-approved critics to tell us about the&nbsp;movie scenes they watched as children that scarred them for life. Here are their answers.What movie scenes scared the s–t out of you as a kid? Tell us in the comments.&nbsp;Black Christmas (1974)  71%(Photo by Warner Bros.)The scene: The killer gives our final girl the evil eyeThe scare:&nbsp;The climactic scare in this groundbreaking slasher is really the culmination of a series of scares that assault the senses, beginning with the panicky moment when the police call college student Jess to reveal that the shrieking, barely human obscene phone calls to her sorority house have been COMING FROM INSIDE THE HOUSE! Then, there’s her nerve-wracking decision to employ “horror victim logic” and venture upstairs to check on her sleeping (read: dead) friends rather than heading out the front door. And when she enters the bedroom to find her deceased sorority sisters, the sight of the killer’s rabid, maniacal eyeball peering through the crack in the door as he whispers to her “Don’t you tell what we did!” is the stuff of nightmares. This was one of the first horror movies that drew me into the genre as a kid and made me appreciate the power of fright, and after seeing it, I understood why people would want to dream of a white Christmas. – Mark H. Harris, BlackHorrorMovies.comE.T. The Extra-Terrestrial (1982)  98%(Photo by Universal)The scene: E.T. is dyingThe scare:&nbsp;Easily the most horrific visual I’ve had seared into my brain involves E.T. when he’s sick. He’s scary enough as-is, and once his skin turns papery white and blotchy, he looks like a diseased liver stretched over a child-sized nightmare. I’ll take Sadako, It, or Chucky over E.T. any day, yikes. – Li Lai, Mediaversity ReviewsThe Exorcism of Emily Rose (2005)  44%(Photo by Screen Gems/courtesy Everett Collection)The scene: In the barnThe scare:&nbsp;I was 11 when The Exorcism of Emily Rose&nbsp;was released in September 2005. I remember a friend of mine talking about it, mentioning how she had seen it in theaters that weekend. My exposure to the horror genre was pretty much non-existent at that point, so perhaps Emily Rose&nbsp;was the first of the genre I had ever seen. Needless to say, it ruined my life. Now scared of sleeping in the darkness of my own bedroom, I slept on the floor of my mom’s. This lasted for quite some time, maybe a year, which resulted in me having to see a therapist.&nbsp;The scene that scarred me&nbsp;the most is definitely the barn scene. I remember it vividly. Emily, possessed, is growling, screaming in tongues, flailing her arms, and looking upon Father Moore with blackened eyes. Father Moore is commanding the demon inside Emily to say its name, but there isn’t just one demon:&nbsp;there are six. “We are the ones who dwell within,” they say, as they begin to state their names, with actress Jennifer Carpenter using a different tone and language for each: Cain, Nero, Judas, Legion, Belial, and Lucifer. When she says “Lucifer,” it’s particularly frightening, as a faint light flickers in her eyes. The eyes of an animal peering at you through the dark. – Sara Clements, @mildredsfierceGhostbusters (1984 Original) (1984)  97%(Photo by Columbia Pictures)The scene: Quiet in the libraryThe scare:&nbsp;Ghostbusters might be a definitive comedy classic, but the ghostly librarian is the stuff of nightmares. At least it was for me as a child. The dark, maze-like rows of bookshelves and eerie quiet was atmospheric enough. Even more so when the books and index cards moved on their own accord. But there was no mentally preparing for the ghastly wrath of the librarian. I screamed along with Peter, Ray, and Egon. Still to this day, I’m petrified to make even a peep when stepping foot inside a library. – Meagan Navarro, @HauntedMegThe Great Mouse Detective (1986)  80%(Photo by Walt Disney Pictures)The scene: Fidget kidnaps OliviaThe scare:&nbsp;An animated Sherlock Holmes-esque detective story starring a mouse is not something that instantly screams “horror.” But The Great Mouse Detective&nbsp;knows how to build a mystery and a tense atmosphere, culminating in the terrifying scene where tiny little Olivia (also a mouse) finds herself drawn to a toy baby crib. As ominous yet playful music builds up to a big reveal, Olivia approaches the crib and pulls on the cover to reveal an evil and scary bat that takes her for a hostage just as the music changes to resemble the&nbsp;screeches from the shower scene from Psycho. – Rafael Motamayor, @rafaelmotamayorJaws (1975)  98%(Photo by Universal)The scene: The head in the boatThe scare:&nbsp;The day I saw Jaws&nbsp;on VHS in my dad’s basement, I had spent the previous week convincing myself I would be terrified. All the stories from its theatrical run talked about audiences fainting, and I was sure I would freak out. Well, the self-hypnotism worked: When Hooper goes underwater and the head pokes out from the bite in the boat, I remember practically vomiting in fear. For a month afterwards I was terrified of any water, even my morning shower. I was convinced the shark would come out of the spout to attack me! Summer vacations in the East Coast of Canada where I learned to swim had the same murky salt water as Amity Island, and I’d look out convinced I’d see the dorsal coming my way. – Jason Gorber, @filmfest_caA Nightmare on Elm Street 4: The Dream Master (1988)  52%(Photo by New Line Cinema/courtesy Everett Collection)The scene: Joey’s aquatic demiseThe scare:&nbsp;My first experience with the A Nightmare on Elm Street franchise was flipping through channels on TV and landing upon this scene. I was too young to watch a Nightmare film but also old enough to be fascinated by the mystique and terror surrounding them. Watching Freddy manipulate Joey and then burst through the bed had an indelible effect on me. It was my first experience with a horror movie and the terror it elicited was the foundation upon which my love of the genre was built. 1…2… Freddy’s coming for you… – Jonathan Barkan, @JonathanBarkanThe Others (2001)  83%(Photo by Dimension Films/Courtesy Everett Collection)The scene: The face behind the veilThe scare:&nbsp;The scene where Grace (Nicole Kidman) interrupts her daughter Anne playing with toys while her head&nbsp;is obscured by a veil, only for Grace to then see a withered elderly face staring back at her from beneath the&nbsp;sheet, left me traumatized for nights afterward. I didn’t look at curtains or any kind of hanging fabric in the same way for a while after that. The mixture of youthful innocence with the complete opposite end of the human life cycle was such an unsettling union for me and it still is. – Lewis Knight, @ThatsOurLewisPet Sematary (1989)  51%(Photo by Paramount Pictures)The scene: A tendon momentThe scare:&nbsp;Pet Sematary confronts death and explores grief in ways I just wasn’t used to given my identity in a culture that isn’t necessarily afraid of it. But while there are many scenes that make that film an annual rewatch for me, the Achilles tendon scene is in fact THE scene that affected me the most as a child. Hiding under the bed, a reanimated Gage slices Jud’s Achilles tendon as he approaches. You can see the deep wound and Jud’s ankle split in detail as he falls. That one scene made me long -ump to the bed for months. And after rewatches, it still makes me shiver as I get ready to go to sleep. – Kate Sanchez, @ohmymithrandirPoltergeist (1982)  86%(Photo by MGM/courtesy Everett Collection)The scene: Suburban invasionsThe scare:&nbsp;The Freeling family always reminded me a bit of my own – the suburban surroundings, the copious amounts of Star Wars toys that littered their home – and that made Poltergeist, despite all of the supernatural shenanigans, all too real for me. When that tree attacks Bobby, or when the skeletons emerge from their pool, as a young man, I felt like any of that could happen to me. Just the mere mention of the film’s title was enough to send shivers down my spine until I was a teenager. To this day, if I have it on too late at night, I have second thoughts about heading down to the basement. – Mike Vanderbilt, Daily GrindhouseReturn to Oz (1985)  54%(Photo by Walt Disney Pictures)The scene: A hallway of headsThe scare:&nbsp;The unofficial sequel to MGM’s Wizard of Oz, Walter Murch’s Return&nbsp;is a far cry from the brightly-colored 1939 musical. Not only does it have a much darker and fantastical narrative, this scene perfectly encapsulates why the film is the stuff of nightmares. In a bid to avoid being decapitated, Dorothy (Fairuza Balk) has to steal the Powder of Life from Princess Mombi (Jean Marsh) to escape. Unfortunately, she has to walk almost silently through a hallway of sleeping heads – and in full view of them – to get the powder. For extra pressure, it is placed inconveniently next to Mombi’s (real) head. Combined with David Shire’s powerful score, the slow-brewing tension from Dorothy’s delicate approach is blown apart by the ensuing screeching of multiple heads, not to mention being chased by a headless body. The whole sequence is terrifying as an adult but it’s horrifyingly out of place in a kid’s film – which is why it scars you for life. – Katie Smith-Wong, @guitargalchinaThe Shining (1980)  84%(Photo by Warner Bros.)The scene: The woman in the bathroomThe scare:&nbsp;I refused to take a bath for a week. When I was seven, my father – much to the protestations of my mother – let me watch Stanley Kubrick’s The Shining. When Jack Nicholson walks into that lime-green bathroom only to find the decrepit, rotting ghoul of an elderly woman cackling at him after he danced with and kissed her younger specter, I leapt as high as her laugh, and haven’t come down since. – Robert Daniels, @812filmreviewsLike this?

Some have already left their mark — see Black Panther‘s Dora Milaje — and a ton more are set to make an impact from this month through summer blockbuster season and right up to Christmas. We’ve got more women suiting up in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, including the Wasp and our first look at Captain Marvel. And women getting their hands on the kind of action roles that used to go&nbsp;mostly&nbsp;to the boys, going to battle in movies like&nbsp;Predator&nbsp;and&nbsp;Annihilation. And we’ve got Bryce Dallas Howard finally kicking those damn heels aside. These female heroes are smart, courageous, and they kick serious ass. We can’t wait to see them at the movies.Katharine Graham (Meryl Streep) in The Post (2018)  88%(Photo by Niko Tavernise. TM and copyright © 20th Century Fox Film Corp. All rights reserved /Courtesy Everett Collection)Released January 12She may not fly or wear a cape but Meryl Streep’s Katharine Graham is a kind of journalistic superhero in Spielberg’s The Post. Facing off against backward-looking suits (blam!) and patronizing advisers (kapow!), her decision to publish the Pentagon Papers stories is a move for the history books. Literally. Meryl hasn’t looked this tough battling bad guys since The River Wild.Watch TrailerMary (Taraji P. Henson) in Proud Mary (2018)  25%(Photo by Dana Starbard/© Screen Gems/ courtesy Everett Collection)Released January 12OK, so the 26% Rotten movie that Mary found herself in was a bit of a letdown, especially after trailers that promised serious badassness and one of the coolest posters we’ve seen in a while. It was ultimately more drama than action flick. But Taraji P. Henson’s hitwoman still managed to throw down thrillingly, and the actress showed a steeliness and charisma that has us crossing our fingers for a (much better and more action-packed) sequel.Watch TrailerHamilton (Gugu Mbatha-Raw) in The Cloverfield Paradox (2018)  21%(Photo by Scott Garfield /© Netflix)Released on Netflix February 4There were few bright spots in this hyped-up Netflix fizzer, and one of them was Gugu Mbatha-Raw as Hamilton. In a better film, this tough, quick-thinking space-traveler might have been a new generation’s Ripley, or at least landed somewhere on par with Mary Elizabeth Winstead’s gutsy Michelle from 10 Cloverfield Lane. If only she’d been given something to fight against other than the laws of logic.Watch VideoThe Dora Milaje (Danai Gurira, Florence Kasumba, and more) in Black Panther (2018)  96%(Photo by © Marvel / © Walt Disney Studios Motion Picture)Released February 16These king protectors are already the year’s fiercest on-screen fighters and are going to seriously own the cosplay circuit come summer. Danai Gurira out-Michonnes herself as the general, Okoye, and demonstrates amazing wig-as-weaponry skills, while Florence Kasumba adds to her comic-book icon credentials (that’s her as one of Wonder Woman’s Amazons over in the DC Universe). After their reception in Black Panther, we can just hear the Infinity War&nbsp;editors hard at work cutting in more Okoye screen time.Watch TrailerLena (Natalie Portman) in Annihilation (2018)  88%(Photo by © Paramount Pictures/courtesy Everett Collection)Released February 23We could have included any of the women who bravely head into the Shimmer, a world in which… let’s avoid any spoilers and just say weird s— happens. But it’s Lena who is our focus throughout the critically lauded sci-fi flick, and the person who comes equipped with military training (helpful when Portman is called upon to fire weapons that are almost as big as she is). Add this to a long list of action-icon roles for the Oscar-winning actress, which kicked off when she was just a tween in Léon.Watch TrailerDominika Egorova (Jennifer Lawrence) in Red Sparrow (2018)  45%(Photo by Murray Close. TM and © Copyright Twentieth Century Fox)Released March 2From Mockingjay to Sparrow. Jennifer Lawrence reteamed with directed Frances Lawrence, who helmed her last three outings as Katniss Everdeen, to play this ballerina-turned spy. While the movie didn’t, erm, catch fire (it’s currently Rotten at 49%), critics and audiences singled out Lawrence for giving cinema another formidable, don’t-even-try-to-eff-with-me female lead.Watch TrailerMeg Murry (Storm Reid) in A Wrinkle in Time (2018)  42%(Photo by Atsushi Nishijima /© Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures /Courtesy Everett Collection)Released March 9The critics may be split on Ava DuVernay’s ambitious family fantasy flick — responses range from “beautiful and gripping” to “stiff” — but almost everyone who’s weighed in so far&nbsp;has said that Storm Reid soars as Meg Murry, the little girl whose search for her father centers the movie. Reid gives a star-making performance as the smart, resourceful, time-traveling teen who seems set to inspire a slew of moviegoers this March.Watch TrailerLara Croft&nbsp;(Alicia Vikander) in Tomb Raider (2018)  52%(Photo by Graham Bartholomew /© Warner Bros.)Released March 16Lara Croft has been one of the defining female action heroines of our time — first in video games, then on screen. This time she’s on a mission to unlock the mystery of her long-lost father, and she comes in the form of Oscar-winner Alicia Vikander. No word on how the film stacks up against earlier efforts to bring Croft to the big screen, but trailers and clips suggest plenty of kicking, jumping, and raiding of tombs.Watch TrailerAmari Namani (Cailee Spaeny) and Jules Reyes (Adria Arjona) in Pacific Rim Uprising (2018)  42%(Photo by Phillip Faraone/Getty Images for Marie Claire and Matt Winkelmeyer/Getty Images for GQ)Released March 23With the original Pacific Rim, Guillermo del Toro gave us a female action star to root for in Rinko Kikuchi’s Mako Mori, who could monster-bash with the best of them. With the sequel, we get at least two women suiting up to fight the Kaiju threat. Spaeny, who plays a scrappy Rey-like character, is new to our screens, while some might recognize Arjona from the second season of True Detective.Watch TrailerArt3mis (Olivia Cooke)&nbsp;in Ready Player One (2018)  72%(Photo by Jaap Buitendijk /© Warner Bros. Pictures/Courtesy Everett Collection )Released March 30Even some mega fans of Ernest Cline’s book admit that Parzival’s fixation on Art3mis,&nbsp;along with her overall character arc, has… let’s just say,&nbsp;some issues. But we’re putting our bets on some tweaks having been made to make this champion gunter more than just gamer boy’s trophy. And with the talented Olivia Cooke donning the OASIS headset,&nbsp;we’re making that bet a big one.Watch TrailerBlack Widow (Scarlett Johansson), Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen), Okoye (Danai Gurira), Gamora (Zoe Saldana), Captain Marvel (Brie Larson), Valkyrie (Tessa Thompson), and Nebula (Karen Gillan) in Avengers: Infinity War (2018)  85%Joel MearesReleased April 27You know who doesn’t need fancy shields, iron suits, or magic hammers to take on Thanos? These women.Watch TrailerRuth Bader Ginsburg in RBG (2018)  93%(Photo by Allison Shelley/Getty Images)Released May 4The notorious RBG finally gets a documentary. The film, directed by&nbsp;Betsy West&nbsp;and&nbsp;Julie Cohen, was a breakout at Sundance this year, and traces the 84-year-old Supreme Court Justice’s decades-long career fighting injustice with a weapon as tough as any slab of vibranium: that incredible RBG mind.Shaun Russell&nbsp;(Gabrielle Union) in Breaking In (2018)  27%(Photo by © Universal Pictures)Released May 11“You broke into the wrong house,” says Gabrielle Union’s Shaun Russell in the trailer for Breaking In&nbsp;— and she’s not playing. Russell is a mom of two kids forced to fight back after a band of men break into the (very) high-tech house she’s staying in and take her children hostage. Cue the weaponized wine stem! Think Kevin McCallister meets Sarah Connor and you get the idea.Watch TrailerDomino (Zazie Beetz) in Deadpool 2 (2018)  84%(Photo by © 2018 TWENTIETH CENTURY FOX)Released May 18The Merc with a Mouth’s much-loved frenemy made her comic-book debut in X-Force #8, though she had appeared (in a form assumed by Copycat) earlier. Confusing? Kinda, but don’t stress: All you need to know is that she has a very cool power, is played by Atlanta’s scene-stealing Zazie Beetz, and the publicity image of her lying on a Deadpool rug is already iconic.Watch TrailerQi’Ra (Emilia Clarke) in Solo: A Star Wars Story (2018)  69%(Photo by © Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures )Released May 25Not a whole lot is known about Emilia Clarke’s Qi’Ra, but if she follows in the footsteps of recent British brunettes in Star Wars movies, it’s a safe bet she knows her way around a blaster. We do know that she grew up with Han, a detail that Clarke — who’s racked up action cred playing both Sarah Connor and Daenerys Targaryen — revealed to Entertainment Weekly. “If you have got a really glamorous lady in a really sordid environment, you kind of know that maybe the glamor is hiding a few rough roads,” she added.Watch TrailerDebbie Ocean (Sandra Bullock) and her crew in Ocean's 8 (2018)  69%(Photo by © Warner Bros. Pictures/Village Roadshow Pictures/Photo by Barry Wetcher)Released June 8Danny Ocean’s sister, Debbie (Sandra Bullock), enlists an army of A-listers to pull off a heist at the Met Ball. Cate Blanchett, Helena Bonham Carter, Sarah Paulson, Mindy Kaling, Rihanna, Akwafina, and Anne Hathaway&nbsp;make up the rest of the crew — and your new #squadgoals.Watch TrailerHelen Parr/Elastigirl (Holly Hunter) in Incredibles 2 (2018)  93%(Photo by © Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures)Released June 15To go by the first trailer for Incredibles 2, Helen Parr has stepped well away from the kitchen. That’s her riding a train and chasing down a baddie on a motorbike while Mr. Elastigirl — sorry, Mr.&nbsp;Incredible&nbsp;— is stuck at home looking after a multitalented Jack-Jack.Watch TrailerClaire Dearing (Bryce Dallas Howard)&nbsp;in Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom (2018)  47%(Photo by Chuck Zlotnick/©Universal Pictures/courtesy Everett Collection)Released June 22Those heels that had everyone up in arms three years ago? They’ve been fed to raptors. Bryce Dallas Howard’s Claire Dearing returns for round two on Isla Nublar firing rifles, riding jeeps, and — crucially — wearing a sensible pair of boots.&nbsp;Watch TrailerHope van Dyne/The Wasp&nbsp;(Evangeline Lilly in Ant-Man and the Wasp (2018)  87%(Photo by © Marvel / © Walt Disney Studios Motion Picture)Released July 6Wings and blasters: Evangeline Lilly’s Wasp is not just a partner to Ant-Man, she’s an upgrade. And if the trailer is anything to go by, she might have the movie’s best scene (riding on a knife’s edge is a singular talent). The Wasp and Ant-Man face off against a female villain this time, with Hannah John-Kamen playing Ghost.Watch TrailerCasey Bracket&nbsp;(Olivia Munn) in The Predator (2018)  33%(Photo by Emma McIntyre/Getty Images for Turner)Released September 14Olivia Munn, who was criminally underused in X-Men: Apocalypse, plays a scientist in director Shane Black’s Predator reboot, but that doesn’t mean she won’t be getting in on the alien-fighting action. The actress told&nbsp;Men’s Fitness&nbsp;that Bracket “knows how to use a weapon… I didn’t want her to be a soldier, but there’s no reason why she wouldn’t know how. Shane and I were on the same page about that immediately.”Laurie Strode&nbsp;(Jamie Lee Curtis) in Halloween (2018)  79%(Photo by Andrew Eccles/Universal Pictures)Released October 19The original scream queen — or, if you’re a purist, the daughter of the woman who rightly holds that title — returns to face her knife-wielding brother one more time. This new Halloween movie ignores all of the sequels, including the one in which Laurie was killed. Judy Greer will join Curtis as Karen Strode, presumably the daughter of slasherdom’s ultimate final girl. No doubt she’s inherited mom’s wire-hanger skills.Jean Grey&nbsp;(Sophie Turner) in Dark Phoenix (2019)  22%Joel MearesReleased November 2Fans of the X-Men comics and animated series will finally get what they’ve been waiting for: a treatment of the Dark Phoenix saga that doesn’t take a dump over all of their hopes and expectations. At least, that’s what we’re hoping for as Game of Thrones’ Sophie Turner steps into the role of Jean Grey and her destructive alter-ego, Dark Phoenix.&nbsp;Mary Poppins&nbsp;(Emily Blunt) in Mary Poppins Returns (2018)  80%(Photo by © Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures)Released December 25So, she doesn’t kick ass so much as she she kicks common colds,&nbsp;but we’re still pumped to see the return of the magical nanny to the big screen. Some of Emily Blunt’s best work — including the Certified Fresh&nbsp;Sicario,&nbsp;Looper,&nbsp;and&nbsp;Edge of Tomorrow&nbsp;— has&nbsp;made her something of a latter-day Linda Hamilton, and we think she might bring a bit of steel, along with sugar, to the role.Watch Trailer","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"Travel, Broadway","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"female-heroes-kicking-ass-at-the-movies-in-2018"},{"id":"47612138125495","title":"How Does Disney’s Fox Acquisition Affect Marvel?","content":"Newsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})How Does Disney's Fox Acquisition Affect Marvel?The massive merger is now official: Find out where Deadpool, Wolverine, the Defenders, the New Mutants, and others stand in the new world order.by Erik Amaya | March 20, 2019 |  Comments(Photo by © Marvel / © Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures /Courtesy Everett Collection)After the nearly two years of corporate courtship, a rival suitor in the form of Comcast, and a long stroll through regulatory scrutiny, The Walt Disney Company’s acquisition of nearly all of 21st Century Fox’s media holdings closed at 12:02am EDT Wednesday night. The roughly $70 billion deal changes the landscape of media in several drastic ways. For starters, there are now only five major movie studios, with analysts predicting there will be five to seven fewer major releases in a given year from now on. Additionally, Disney now own tons more popular intellectual property, including Star Wars, Alien, The X-Files, Avatar, and, of course, the Marvel Comics characters.Until Wednesday, that last asset existed in a split state. Two of Marvel’s high-profile properties — the X-Men and the Fantastic Four — have been under Fox’s control since the mid-1990s. According to the terms of the deal Marvel Comics made during a particularly bad financial time, Fox would control the media destinies of both properties in perpetuity as long as it continued to make and develop films based on the characters. From the moment Disney’s acquisition of Fox was announced, fans assumed those properties would end up part of Marvel Studios’ wide range of characters, which appears to be the correct assumption; Marvel Studios president Kevin Feige confirmed that the company will now have access to the characters previously held by Fox.Now that Disney’s Marvel and Fox’s Marvel are one entity, what will that joined vision of the Marvel Cinematic Universe look like and how soon will it happen? Here are six answers to questions you may be asking about Marvel’s role in Disney’s Fox acquisition.RELATED:&nbsp;5 Big Questions About Marvel’s Future in the Disney-Fox Merger Answered7 Ways TV and Streaming Fans Win with the Disney-Fox Deal1. How soon will Wolverine show up in the Marvel Cinematic Universe?(Photo by 20th Century Fox)Throughout 2018, people including Feige insisted Marvel could not even begin to cook up ideas for the X-Men or Fantastic Four until the deal for the merger officially closed. There was also some talk about keeping the Fox-controlled Marvel assets separate, but that notion was later dismissed by Disney CEO Bob Iger.“There shouldn’t be two Marvels,” he&nbsp;said back in September.Since we previously assumed a lingering Fox contingent might delay Marvel Studios’ control of the characters, we counted out an X-Men stinger in Avengers: Endgame. Instead, we predicted Logan’s adamantium claws might appear in a 2021 mid-credits stinger scene. Now, we think it is possible — though still highly unlikely — the characters might be referenced in a singular image or a word. (It would have to be something easily shot in the next week or two as the studio could not use any of the characters or iconography until now.)But even if Marvel manages to add a Fantastic Four or X-Men tease to Endgame, that stinger moment is all we will see of the characters for some time. Marvel Studios’ 2020 output inches closer to production even if the company declines to reveal their schedule until after Endgame’s release. At this point, we know The Eternals, Black Widow, Shang-Chi, and sequels for Doctor Strange and Black Panther are in the pipeline. Presumably, three of those projects will fill the 2020 release dates. Of course, the studio has altered its plan before, bumping Black Panther, Captain Marvel, and a proposed Inhumans film to secure a place for Spider-Man: Homecoming. With that in mind, it is possible the first Marvel Studios X-Men or Fantastic Four film could happen in 2021, particularly if Feige ever gets back to Legion’s Noah Hawley about his Doctor Doom script.2. Will Dark Phoenix&nbsp;and New Mutants Still Be Released?While Dark Phoenix will hit theaters this June, the fate of New Mutants is more tenuous. Though still slated for an August 2 release, the film’s planned 2018 reshoots (that would change more than 50 percent of the film and introduce a new character to the story) reportedly never took place and are no longer scheduled to occur.Until the deal closed, Fox had to abide by its original agreement with Marvel Entertainment and release X-Men films at regular intervals. It also had to plan for a future in which it and Disney remained separate entities just in case the deal fell through or was delayed beyond the summer. Around this time last year, both films were pushed back to accommodate reshoots. But considering New Mutants’ additional photography never took place, it is fair to wonder if Fox delayed both films to save on development costs for other X-Men projects Marvel may eventually cancel. There is plenty to suggest this was the case and it may lead to New Mutants losing its theatrical release.3. What Other Marvel Films Did Fox Have In Development?(Photo by Mary Evans/Twentieth Century Fox / Marvel Comics/Ronald Grant/Everett Collection)Under the spirit of “business as usual” in the event the deal fell through, Fox planned to expand its output of Marvel-based films to three projects per year. The plan included more X-Men sequels while branching out with lesser known characters.One project centering on fan-favorite mutant Kitty Pryde was announced and would see&nbsp;Deadpool director Tim Miller returning to the X-fold. Said to be based on Uncanny X-Men #143, the film would focus on Kitty’s struggle against a N’Garai demon while spending a lonely Christmas night in the X-Mansion. Comic-book writer Brian Michael Bendis was said to be adapting the issue into a feature script for Miller. Neither has commented on the project’s prospects.Though little has been said since word first broke about the project, James Franco was set to star in a film focusing on X-Factor favorite Jamie Madrox, a.k.a. The Multiple Man. Franco’s real-life troubles may have sent this one to the back-burner, but considering X-Men characters must now compete with Shang-Chi and The Eternals for one of Marvel Studios’ coveted release dates, expect any solo X-Men outings to be a late 2020s development. Channing Tatum’s long-delayed Gambit film is also more than likely kaput.As we mentioned above, Noah Hawley signed on to develop a feature film for the greatest of Marvel villains, Doctor Doom. Recently, the Legion&nbsp;FX series executive producer revealed Feige asked about the draft he completed some time ago. Unfortunately, Hawley has not heard from the Marvel Studios boss since. But since we all want Doom to face off against the heroes, we hope this one works out.Finally, X-Force, the Deadpool 2 spin-off, was expected to begin shooting in late 2018 under the direction of Bad Times at the El Royale’s Drew Goddard. With cast members like Josh Brolin, Zazie Beetz, and Ryan Reynolds reprising their Deadpool 2 roles, it seemed set to become the last Fox-produced X-Men film. Sadly, Goddard refused to comment on the project following news of the acquisition’s imminent closure. And with X-Force co-creator Rob Liefeld openly discussing the film’s demise on Twitter, we’re going to assume this one is also toast.4. What About Deadpool 3?Feels like the first day of ‘Pool. pic.twitter.com/QVy8fCxgqr— Ryan Reynolds (@VancityReynolds) March 19, 2019As Reynolds once joked, they may skip the third film entirely and go straight to Deadpool 4 or 5. The actor, who co-wrote the sequel with Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick, also said the narrative weight of taking everything away from the character in order to build him up again will only lead to diminishing returns. In light of that, he offered the possibility of playing Deadpool as a supporting character in films like X-Force. Reese and Wernick, meanwhile, have said they’d love to team Deadpool up with Spider-Man — a pairing so popular it had its own comic book.It is possible Reynolds was just cushioning himself should Marvel Studios choose not to continue with his vision of Deadpool — it is a PG-13 production house, after all — but it may also be a savvy ploy to negotiate with the company for a sweet multi-picture contract in which Deadpool shows up, does something wacky, and disappears again. It is certainly possible to tone down some of Wade Wilson’s antics for the MCU, which is what the Christmas release of a PG-13 Deadpool 2 called Once Upon a Deadpool proved.Meanwhile, Iger once told investors it is possible to carve out an R-rated niche for Marvel to allow for more Deadpool movies. On Tuesday, Reynolds posted a photo of Deadpool wearing Mickey ears and riding a school bus to celebrate the acquisition. What it means for the future is anyone’s guess.5. Will Galactus Be the Phase 4 Big Bad?(Photo by Marvel)After Thanos presumably gets his comeuppance in Avengers: Endgame, will Marvel Studios sow the seeds of another intergalactic Big Bad? If they attempt such a thing, Fantastic Four antagonist Galactus would be of a size and shape worthy to follow Thanos — even his headgear is more thrilling! But that is assuming Phase 4 will have a Big Bad. And come to think of it, the term “Phase 4” rarely comes up in Feige’s comments these days.It took three phases and 22 films — now known as The Infinity Saga — to get to Thanos, even if he was introduced in the first Avengers film. So Phase 4, if we’re still using that term, may just see the regrouping of the heroes who survive Endgame and the introduction of the Eternals and Shang-Chi. If that is the case, the new big bad would be introduced in a potential fifth Avengers film in, say, 2022 or wherever Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 ends up on the schedule. It would also provide ample time for Feige to plan the integration of the X-Men and the Fantastic Four into the MCU. And what better way to introduce Marvel’s first family than by the Avengers searching for them ahead of Galactus’s arrival? (We’re maybe getting carried away here, but we’re damn excited.)Of course, we are assuming the next few years of MCU storytelling will use the same momentum as Phases 1-3. But considering Marvel Comics has been using the same narrative conventions in its event crossover comics for the last few decades — to say nothing of the financial rewards the studio established by using the technique — it seems a safe bet that Captain Marvel, Ant-Man, Spider-Man, Doctor Strange, Black Panther, the Guardians, the X-Men, and the Fantastic Four will unite to face some universe-shattering threat 22 films from now, if not sooner.6. What of the Defenders and The Gifted?(Photo by Sarah Shatz/Netflix)Turning our attention to television, the Fox acquisition comes at an odd time for Marvel’s live-action initiatives. On ABC, Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. was renewed for a seventh season well ahead of its season 6 debut this summer. Cloak &amp; Dagger returns to Freeform in a few weeks, and reports indicate Runaways’&nbsp;second season was successful enough at Hulu for a third year to be all but a certainty. But over on Netflix, all of the Marvel shows were quickly cancelled following the debuts of their most recent seasons (except for Jessica Jones, which was cancelled ahead of its still-unscheduled season 3 debut). And from the way Netflix structures its deals, it will be some time before any of those characters can resurface on Disney platforms like Hulu (which the company now has a 60 percent stake in) or Disney+.Meanwhile, the new Disney streaming platform indicates Iger’s desire for a single Marvel may not be in the cards just yet. Disney+’s Marvel television series will be produced by Marvel Studios, while all the television efforts to date are works of Marvel Entertainment. Yes, there is a difference, as the former is a division of The Walt Disney Studio, while the latter is a wholly-owned subsidiary of The Walt Disney Company. In short: Disney operates two Marvel companies and, sometimes, their interests do not align. This is ultimately why the Defenders did not make cameos in Avengers: Infinity War and why the final seasons of their shows saw no one turning to dust.From the Fox standpoint, the acquisition offered an incentive to end Legion after three seasons on FX. While Hawley recently said he always saw the program as a three-year story, the changing nature of Marvel TV no doubt helped the executives OK the idea of ending it now. Meanwhile, The Gifted’s future on the Fox broadcast network remains up in the air. The network — which was retained by newly minted Fox Corp. — plans to hold onto several popular series now owned by Disney (which acquired&nbsp;Fox’s TV studio branch as well),&nbsp;including&nbsp;The Simpsons. But The Gifted is not exactly popular. Also, there is no telling how it may interfere with Marvel Entertainment’s plans going forward or Marvel Studios’ long-term goals.Fox later answered the media attention around the completion of the acquistion with a trailer:In the meantime, Hulu and Marvel Entertainment announced an initiative to create four animated series for the platform, potentially leading to a stronger relationship between the two branches of the Disney empire. As it happens, Disney wants Marvel content to stay in house, so Disney brands like ABC, Disney+, Freeform, and Hulu are the places you will see future Marvel TV shows. Additionally, the newly acquired FX networks may prove a good outlet as well for projects more in the vein of Legion. Maybe the long-lost New Warriors will find a home on one of those channels.Like this?

It’s always a tricky proposition to try and guess who’s going to win, but we here at Rotten Tomatoes have crunched the numbers, weighed the intangibles, and held lively discussions to determine who we think will come out on top.&nbsp;Read on for our full list of Oscar predictions,&nbsp;and let us know if you feel differently about any of them. Then, you can also pop over to our audience poll to see what fellow movie fans think will win, and you can even download your own RT Oscar ballot to keep score on the big night!Best Picture:&nbsp;Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri (2017)  90%(Photo by Merrick Morton /Fox Searchlight Pictures)A couple of months&nbsp;ago, we would have told you that the Best Picture&nbsp;category was still too close to call. Suddenly, though, Martin McDonagh’s&nbsp;pitch black comedy picked up a lot of steam, winning top honors at the Golden Globes and the BAFTAs, while stars Frances McDormand and Sam Rockwell earned accolade after accolade along the way. With all of that in mind, we think&nbsp;Three Billboards will likely prevail over its competition.Best Director:&nbsp;Guillermo del Toro,&nbsp;The Shape of Water (2017)  92%(Photo by Kerry Hayes /Fox Searchlight Pictures)It took deep passion and a lifelong obsession and empathy for movie monsters to make a love story like this work. And with Martin McDonagh not nominated in this category, here’s a fine opportunity to award a Best Director statue to del Toro over his Best Picture loss.Best Actor: Gary Oldman,&nbsp;Darkest Hour (2017)  84%(Photo by Jack English/Focus Features)Industry favorite Oldman&nbsp;completely&nbsp;transformed into British Prime Minister Winston Churchill for his role in&nbsp;Darkest Hour. Previously nominated in the same category for 2011’s&nbsp;Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy, he fully inhabits the stooped, gruff Churchill, who struggles with a decision that will literally determine the fate of England and the rest of Europe, perhaps even the world: whether to negotiate with Adolf Hitler or continue the fight&nbsp;— each at a terrible price.Best Actress: Frances McDormand,&nbsp;Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri (2017)  90%(Photo by Fox Searchlight Pictures)Got enough money to buy three billboards in Times Square, New York? Then bet it all on McDormand, the prohibitive favorite. She took out the SAG. She took out the Golden Globe (in the drama category). She took out the Oscar back in 1997 for Fargo. And she delivers a fierce performance in the most serious, emotionally draining role of the bunch. Only two questions remain: Will there be enough space on that stacked mantle for her 2018 trophy? And just how awesome will her speech be.Best Supporting Actor: Sam Rockwell,&nbsp;Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri (2017)  90%(Photo by Merrick Morton/Fox Searchlight Pictures)No matter where you stand on the character — the small-town cop’s journey from repugnant racist to near-hero has riled some viewers — there’s no doubting the impact of Rockwell’s performance. Any thought that Willem Dafoe would prove a neck-and-neck rival has long been buried under a pile of Golden Globes, SAGS, and BAFTAs all bearing the Moon star’s name.Best Supporting Actress: Allison Janney, I, Tonya (2018)  90%(Photo by 30West)Best Supporting Actress is truly Janney’s to lose. She’s been dominating the awards circuit for her portrayal as Tonya Harding’s loveless, abusive, bird-shouldered mother in a role that was literally written for her.Best Original Screenplay:&nbsp;Get Out (2017)  98%(Photo by Universal Pictures)Get Out has proven it has steam. Jordan Peele’s hit has won most of the major awards in this category, and as rumors swirl that older academy voters aren’t even considering it for Best Picture, this seems like a (well deserved) consolation prize.Best Adapted Screenplay:&nbsp;Call Me by Your Name (2018)  94%(Photo by Sony Pictures Classics)The year’s big kids are playing in the Original Screenplay category (where Three Billboards, Get Out, and Lady Bird will duke it out) leaving James Ivory with a fairly clear path to victory for his much-lauded take on André Aciman’s novel. It will be the 89-year-old’s first Oscar victory — ever. Ivory received directing nods for Merchant-Ivory classics The Remains of the Day, Howards End, and A Room with a View, but he never won, and this is his first nomination for writing.Best Animated Feature: Coco (2017)  97%(Photo by Walt Disney Studios)This one is easy. You’d be pretty hard-pressed to&nbsp;find someone who doesn’t like Coco.Best Foreign Language Film: The Square (2017)  85%(Photo by Magnolia Pictures)The Square may have the lowest Tomatometer score of any of the nominees in the category (still a not-too-shabby 82%), and some of the smart money is on the dazzling A Fantastic Woman, but hear us out. The Square has earned multiple Film Critics groups awards, contains one of 2017’s most memorable scenes, was seen by a decent thwack of people (it made almost $1.5 million during its theatrical run) and co-stars a couple of Americans with whom Academy members are familiar. We’re calling an upset.Best Documentary Feature: Faces Places (Visages, villages) (2017)  99%(Photo by Cohen Media Group)With its investigation into Russian sports doping, Icarus&nbsp;is a heavy hitter in this category, as is Last Man in Aleppo, a look at recovery missions in war-torn Syria. Our favorite, though, is Faces Places, the charming collaboration between French New Wave godmother Agnès Varda and photographer/artist JR that weaves a rich tapestry of fading working-class life in the French countryside. Also, we’d love to see a repeat of Varda’s&nbsp;acceptance&nbsp;dance moves&nbsp;from the Governors Awards.Best Cinematography:&nbsp;Blade Runner 2049 (2017)  88%(Photo by Stephen Vaughan/Warner Bros.)We’re predicting a lot of “it’s time” prizes, and there’s nothing more timeist than Roger Deakins’ previous 13 nominations without a single win. Though there’s a lot of CGI in Blade Runner 2049, think about Jared Leto’s wooden sanctuary with reflective water or Harrison Ford’s Vegas stronghold as the intimate areas blessed with Deakins’ trademark splash of hue and color.Best Film Editing:&nbsp;Dunkirk (2017)  92%(Photo by Warner Bros.)While&nbsp;Baby Driver certainly makes splashy use of editing, we think Christopher Nolan’s war epic will take the crown simply because its entire narrative structure absolutely hinges on its ability to transition between concurrent storylines seamlessly. Nolan is no stranger to creative storytelling devices, and his considerable skill has never been employed more poignantly than here.Best Production Design:&nbsp;Blade Runner 2049 (2017)  88%(Photo by Warner Bros.)Bigger is better this year. This is a movie where every room and location had to be imagined to exist 32 years in the future, but from the vantage point of a dystopian 1981. The sets feel lived-in with bleak purpose and history, the city skylines rising mystic and ominous.Best Costume Design:&nbsp;Phantom Thread (2018)  91%(Photo by Focus Features)The film, starring Daniel Day-Lewis as a renowned dressmaker in&nbsp;1950s&nbsp;London,&nbsp;has fashion at its very core. Costume designer Mark Bridges, who previously won an Oscar for his work on 2011’s&nbsp;The Artist&nbsp;and was also nominated for 2014 drama&nbsp;Inherent Vice, here evokes the most glamorous work of fashion icon, 35-time Oscar nominee, and eight-time winner Edith Head.Best Original Score:&nbsp;The Shape of Water (2017)  92%(Photo by Fox Searchlight Pictures)A great musical score can often go unnoticed because it blends so seamlessly into its film, and there are certainly a couple of nominees in this category this might apply to. That said, Alexandre Desplat’s enchanting music, magical with a hint of a sinister streak, goes a long way in making&nbsp;The Shape of Water feel like the quietly haunting fairy tale that it is.Best Original Song: “This Is Me” – The Greatest Showman (2017)  57%(Photo by Niko Tavernise/20th Century Fox Film Corp.)We love “Remember Me” and “Mystery of Love” just as much as the next person with even a modicum of taste. But we aren’t arguing with your mom’s Spotify play count.Best Visual Effects:&nbsp;Blade Runner 2049 (2017)  88%(Photo by Warner Bros.)With the series frequently and purposely bereft of emotion, a lot of watching Blade Runner is simply luxuriating in its world. The visual effects take us there, and make something as simple as a three-way sex scene with an android, an imprinted human, and a bounty hunter a thing of beauty.Best Makeup &amp; Hairstyling:&nbsp;Darkest Hour (2017)  84%(Photo by Jack English/Focus Features)Darkest Hour&nbsp;impressed for its thorough and seamless transformation of its lead, Gary Oldman, into&nbsp;British Prime Minister Winston Churchill. This is the third nomination for Kazuhiro Tsuji and first for David Malinowski and Lucy Sibbick.Best Sound Mixing:&nbsp;Dunkirk (2017)  92%(Photo by Melinda Sue Gordon/Warner Bros.)Some will be quick to point out&nbsp;Baby Driver‘s clever use of gunfire and windshield wipers to keep time with the action onscreen, but&nbsp;Dunkirk relies so heavily on sound to immerse audiences in the thick of&nbsp;battle that we find it difficult to imagine it will be beat. Plus, war movies traditionally do very well in the sound categories, and we’re expecting that to be the case here.Best Sound Editing:&nbsp;Dunkirk (2017)  92%(Photo by Melinda Sue Gordon/Warner Bros.)Having said all that about sound mixing, it’s worth noting that&nbsp;Dunkirk‘s supervising sound editor, Richard King, went to great lengths to create the aural experience of the film. How great, you ask? He interviewed actual veterans to gain insight into what they heard on the battlefield. He researched and rebuilt from scratch one of the famous German dive-bombing sirens — which don’t exist anywhere any more — to capture its signature wail. This all may not be immediately apparent, but the overall effect of King’s work is a rich soundscape that plays a huge part in the film.Best Short Film (Animated):&nbsp;Dear Basketball (2017)  69%(Photo by ShortsTV)Look, we’re not saying Dear Basketball is the best entry in this category — the handmade wonder Negative Space&nbsp;seems to be the favorite in terms of cinematic quality. That said, you probably shouldn’t underestimate the sheer number of nostalgic Lakers fans in the academy.Best Short Film (Live Action): DeKalb Elementary (2017)  92%(Photo by ShortsTV)Riveting, tense, and powerfully acted, DeKalb Elementary&nbsp;would be a good bet to win this category in any year. However, in the midst of a national debate about gun violence, the film — based upon a real-life school shooting incident — is an absolute lock.Best Documentary (Short Subject): Heroin(e) (2017)  100%A hopeful film about a heartbreaking subject, Heroin(e)&nbsp;is the tale of three strong women fighting the scourge of opioid abuse in Huntington, WV. It’s also on Netflix, which means it’s readily available for Academy voters to watch.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"Oscars","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"rotten-tomatoes-predicts-the-oscars-2018"},{"id":"47612204800202","title":"Oscar Nominations 2019: Full List of Nominated Films, Actors, Directors, and Filmmakers","content":"Newsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Oscar Nominations 2019: Full List of Nominated Films, Actors, Directors, and FilmmakersRoma and The Favourite lead the nominees, with A Star Is Born, Vice, and Black Panther close behind.by RT Staff | January 22, 2019 |  CommentsThe 2019 Oscar nominees were announced Tuesday morning by actors&nbsp;Kumail Nanjiani&nbsp;and&nbsp;Tracee Ellis Ross, and the race for gold at the Academy Awards is officially on.&nbsp;Roma and The Favourite lead the pack with 10 nominations each, including Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Screenplay.

Either way, it’s clear the closing moments of Spider-Man: Far From Home&nbsp;matter in the world of Morbius and, at least to our eyes, that probably direct tie to the MCU late in the trailer means Sony will finally make good on its plan to do a film about the Sinister Six, an idea the studio postponed when The Amazing Spider-Man 2 underperformed.So let’s take a look at this latest wrinkle in the Sony Spider-Verse and what these call-outs in the Morbius trailer mean for the studio’s emerging superhero world.The Benefits of A&nbsp;Spider-Verse(Photo by Sony Pictures)If taken at face value, the post-credits stinger at the end of 2018’s&nbsp;Venom&nbsp;that introduced a preview scene from Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse&nbsp;(“Meanwhile, in another universe…”)&nbsp;implied that the two films took place in the same multiverse.&nbsp;The latter film then introduced audiences&nbsp;to the notion of multiple realities where a panoply of Spider-people (many of them alternative versions of Peter Parker) take center stage to defend their world — or corner of Queens — from threats small and large.As a science-fiction concept, multiverses are a wonderful device. They allow you to keep all your work as “true” in a canonical sense while also allowing you ways to change up those ideas or revise key components. And considering the Spider-Man seen in Far From Home and the other Marvel Studios films&nbsp;(played by Tom Holland) is Sony’s third attempt at Peter Parker, a multiverse is the best way to tell continuity-conscious viewers that all of the films are valid, even if they don’t tell the same story.Of course, you could always do what the Bond films did for decades and ignore such concerns entirely. But that’s beside the point.In terms of Sony’s most recent attempt to launch its own cinematic universe and continue their relationship with Marvel Studios, the Spider-Verse allows them almost absolute freedom. Venom can exist as a standalone movie, or it can easily fit into a world where Peter and Eddie Brock (Tom Hardy) crossed paths at one time — there are those oblique references to Eddie’s problems in New York, after all. Morbius, meanwhile, is equally free to name-check Eddie or ignore him in favor of clear ties to the MCU Spider-Man and his current troubles. At this point, what is “true” between the three films is open to conjecture. Morbius could be a secret MCU film or it could be the first look at a Sony’s plans for Peter after he leaves the MCU in a couple of years.Granted, this all presumes Micheal Keaton is indeed playing Adrian Toomes (a.k.a. the Vulture from Spider-Man: Homecoming) in Morbius.Venom’s Success and the Old Sinister Six Plan(Photo by Sony Pictures Entertainment)Thanks in part to its success, many have forgotten just how risky Venom was when it released. Launching a film centered on a prominent superhero antagonist had never been pulled off before. And let’s face it, Venom‘s cheesy tone — while highly entertaining at times — still left some people feeling like the experiment didn’t work. But for Sony, Venom’s worldwide box-office take was all the proof it needed to say it could make Spider-Man movies as strong and as successful as Marvel.And, as it happens, the film’s success also proved the studio’s plan for films featuring the foes of Spider-Man —&nbsp;a plan born in the&nbsp;wake of 2012’s&nbsp;The&nbsp;Amazing Spider-Man&nbsp;— was also viable.As the story goes, from 2012 onward,&nbsp;Sony began toying with films based around the Green Goblin, Doctor Octopus, the Vulture, Kraven the Hunter, Sandman, and Mysterio. And just like Marvel’s Avengers, the leads of the six films would join forces in Sinister Six — a film based on the villains’ coalition in the Spider-Man comics. The group first joined forces in 1964’s The Amazing Spider-Man Annual #1 and would eventually see characters like Hobgoblin, Shocker, Lizard, Venom, Electro, and others subbing in for one or more of the original group. The Sinister Six also, on occasion, expanded to seven, 12, and even&nbsp;66 members — which is when Morbius finally became part of the team.(Photo by Sony Pictures)Sometime in 2014, The Cabin the Woods‘ Drew Goddard submitted a Sinister Six script draft to Sony, with then-president Amy Pascal telling reporters she was waiting for Goddard — who would later be attached to 20th Century Fox’s planned X-Force film — to direct the picture. Much of the characters’ iconic gear made its debut in a brief scene in&nbsp;The Amazing Spider-Man 2, although it was said Goddard’s Sinister Six was meant to feature the classic line-up with Doc Ock as their leader. The script was also said to feature the characters redeeming themselves, but for some of them, fighting Spider-Man is part of their nature. By this point, the plan changed from making six individual films to spinning off Sinister Six‘s well-received characters into their own films.Then The Amazing Spider-Man 2 failed to meet expectations, unfortunately, and garnered a reputation as a dud. Sony’s plan was put on hold, but one film in its “foes of Spider-Man” concept went forward: Venom. And even though Sony reached a point where it felt better off working with Marvel Studios, it never completely abandoned Sinister Six or its own series of films.Silver &amp; Black&nbsp;and Other Tales of the Spider-Verse(Photo by Sony Pictures Entertainment)Even as Spider-Man made his way to Captain America: Civil War&nbsp;and Spider-Man: Homecoming, Sony let some of their Spider-Man film concepts simmer. One of these was Silver &amp; Black. Intended to feature sometimes friends of Spider-Man, namely Black Cat (a cat burglar) and Silver Sable (an amoral mercenary), the crew included Cloak &amp; Dagger&nbsp;pilot director Gina Prince-Bythewood and writers like&nbsp;Westworld‘s Lisa Joy, Marvel Comics’ Christopher Yost, and&nbsp;Captain Marvel‘s Geneva Robertson-Dworet (alongside writer Lindsey Beer). Reportedly, the film would have taken some cues from Homecoming, but a creative impasse led to it being cancelled in 2018, and the lead characters split into their own projects. Presumably, the individual&nbsp;Black Cat and Silver Sable films are still in development and may flesh out the emerging Spider-Verse with more allies for Peter to call upon when he inevitably faces the Sinister Six.But here’s where things get interesting. As recently as 2018, Goddard said it was likely Sony would eventually use his script as a basis for Sinister Six, which means the studio has a sense of direction even as it substitutes Morbius (Jared Leto) for, say, Mysterio (who is presumably dead in both the MCU and the Spider-Verse). And from the Morbius trailer, it definitely feels like there is momentum toward an Avengers-style film focusing on the villains — an idea&nbsp;strong enough that it’s surprising Marvel or Warner Bros. didn’t think of it first.Besides Sinister Six and the Black Cat and Silver Sable films, Sony is also developing a movie based on Madame Web. Created by Denny O’Neil and artist John Romita Jr., the character was introduced in The Amazing Spider-Man #210 as a blind and paralyzed precognitive mutant who used a sophisticated web-themed mobility device to get around and offer Spider-Man a heads-up on various crimes and misdeeds. Writers Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless took on the task of writing the script in September of 2019, but little has been heard from the project since. The same is true for Silk, based on the Spider-Man character created by Dan Slott and Umberto Ramos. Featuring a Korean-American protagonist with Spider-powers and a love of gadgets, the project seemingly has not moved forward since 2018.As early as 2017, Sony was toying with the idea of a film centering on Kraven the Hunter. Born Sergei Kravinoff to Russian aristocrats, the big game hunter came to New York in The Amazing Spider-Man #15 to assist his half brother, the Chameleon, in taking down the webhead. It went poorly, but Kraven walked away from the encounter believing Spider-Man to be the most dangerous game. He would return time and again to hunt Peter. As of August 2018, the film was in some active development with writer Richard Wenk reportedly on board to write the script, but as with the other projects, it’s unclear if it will be ready for production anytime soon.That said, intrepid internet sleuths noticed “Kraven” stamped onto signage on the Morbius set — both on a delivery truck and as the name of a ballet company.And not to be forgotten, Sony is working on a sequel to 2018’s Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse. Presumably, the film will take place on the same Earth where Peter Parker is dead and Miles Morales (Shameik Moore) has taken his place. But it’s also possible the series’ established fun with different realities may allow a member of the live-action Sony world to meet Miles. That film is currently scheduled for release on April 8th 2022.The Shape Of The Spider-Verse(Photo by ©Columbia Pictures/©Marvel Studios)With all of this information, we begin to see a picture of a Spider-Verse with the MCU Peter Parker at the center of it. It all begins with Morbius, which establishes a live-action Spider-Verse world in which Peter is wanted for Mysterio’s murder, as indicated by some graffiti art in the trailer. The title character goes on his journey of self-discovery and, at some point, gets recruited by Adrian Toomes — who serves as an antagonist to Nick Fury. If the film is successful commercially and critically, it’s easy to imagine Toomes returning at the end of Venom 2 to recruit Eddie or Carnage (Woody Harrelson).In this set-up, Sony acknowledges the events of the two MCU Spider-Man films while also establishing their own continuity. It creates a situation in which characters can talk about Peter without him being on camera, which, as seen in films like The Third Man, can build effective anticipation.Where Sony goes from there all depends on Morbius. If it’s a smash hit, one could easily see Kraven the Hunter rushing into production. Perhaps Madame Web or Silk follows it while Spider-Man finishes his commitments in the MCU — namely a third solo film and an appearance in an Avengers-style team-up movie. Presumably, the latter would act as a send-off to Peter and Tom Holland in the MCU, who would immediately resurface in the next convenient Spider-Verse film and then in Sinister Six, where he is, oddly enough, the antagonist. But one imagines Black Cat, Silver Sable, Madame Web, and Silk will help him establish a team of his own.And, amazingly, the whole thing would be viable. So far, only Disney has pulled off sustained cinematic universes with Star Wars and Marvel — arguably, Warner Bros. may have done it as well,&nbsp;though the DC film universe keeps getting rebooted. By embracing all of its messy development, Sony may be in the best position to plan and execute a six-film meta-arc. The results could be quite exciting.Well, assuming Morbius works, of course.Like this?

Pictures, Sony Pictures Classics, and Netflix)“Know Your Critic” is a column in which we interview Tomatometer-approved critics about their screening and reviewing habits, pet peeves, and personal favorites.Amélie is the film Carlos Aguilar has seen more than any other – and he never would’ve seen it, if not for a critic who endorsed the film on television when he was a kid.“When it first was released, I was still living in Mexico City and I was very young, maybe 11 or 12,” he told Rotten Tomatoes in an interview. Horacio Villalobos was a film critic on TV at the time, and Aguilar watched his program “religiously.”“He talked about this French movie that he really loved and that was only playing in a few theaters in Mexico City. It was because he recommended it very passionately that my mom took me to see Amélie,” Aguilar said. “It wouldn’t have been on my radar if that critic hadn’t recommended it.”Now, Aguilar is a film&nbsp;critic&nbsp;and&nbsp;writer himself, with work published&nbsp;in the Los Angeles Times, TheWrap, and Remezcla. His&nbsp;reviews appear on Rotten Tomatoes alongside those of critics he admires – such as&nbsp;Justin Chang of the LA Times, Eric Kohn of IndieWire, and Claudia Puig, President of the Los Angeles Film Critics Association. He admires both their writing and their commitment to supporting up-and-coming critics.“That’s usually what connects great writers – they tend to be also great people outside of the writing,” Aguilar said.” They want more diverse voices to be part of the conversation. It’s not only about them, but about bringing in others and growing the field.”Carlos Aguilar is a freelance critic and film writer based in Los Angeles, CA.What’s your favorite childhood film?I was always very much an animation, Disney kid. I remember loving The Little Mermaid&nbsp;and Beauty and the Beast and those classic Disney films. Those were the ones that I watched as a kid. Now, I know that they’re considered bad, but the Batman movies from the ’90s – I think it was Batman Forever and Batman and Robin.&nbsp;I was big on those movies. Re-watching them now, it’s cringe-y – but back when I was a kid, I loved those movies.What do you think is the biggest misconception about critics?That we like to antagonize the general public. I feel like audiences sometimes feel like there are movies “for” critics and movies “for” audiences, which is completely a lie because critics are themselves part of the audience.Sometimes the figure of the critic has been seen as an intellectual, unapproachable and pretentious person that only likes a certain type of movie. That’s what some people in the audience see as a critic. They feel like if a critic likes a certain type of movie, that that’s not what the audience would like – that divide between the audience and the critic is the big misconception.There’s critics that like all types of film and not all critics like the same type of thing or agree on the same thing or disagree on the same things. The misconception is that people believe that the critics are looking for the films that audiences are not going to like and that we want to go against the grain or against popular taste.What’s your favorite classic film?There’s a Mexican film called&nbsp;Macario&nbsp;from 1960. It’s black and white and it was the first movie from Mexico that was nominated for the Oscar for best foreign language film. We have this beautiful cinematographer, Gabriel Figueroa, who’s one of Mexico’s most beloved, admired cinematographers from that era. It’s like if I can describe it in simple terms, it’s like&nbsp;A Christmas Carol&nbsp;that’s set in Mexican colonial times on the eve of Day of the Dead.(Photo by Sony Pictures Classics)What’s Rotten thing you love?Pedro Almodóvar’s&nbsp;I’m So Excited&nbsp;– in Spanish it’s&nbsp;Los Amantes Pasajeros. It’s generally considered one of his worst, at least in recent years. But I remember watching it and finding it hilarious and engaging.I don’t want to say that the reason is entirely because there’s things that get lost in translation, but… There’s a lot of phrases there that are just hilarious and I also admire that it’s a movie that takes place entirely on a plane… it’s over the top and it’s raunchy. The things that you love in an Almodóvar, but in a more absurd way.It doesn’t always work, and perhaps there’s many reasons why people don’t find it an artistic accomplishment, but I always have fun quoting lines from it or re-watching it.What do you consider required viewing?I think I’m going to say Krzysztof Kieślowski’s The Decalogue, which is this 10-part series of 1-hour films or episodes that were made for Polish television in the late 1980s. Each of them deals in a very abstract way with one of the 10 Commandments…Just the fact that he was able to create 10 stand-alone pieces of cinema that somehow relate to each other in ways that are not obvious and that have this moral ambiguity… All of them are very subdued and written in a way that doesn’t have easy answers. It’s not black and white.You saw 40 films at Sundance this year. What is your personal record for the most movies you’ve watched in a day?I definitely don’t recommend it, but at Sundance I saw five films in a row one day this year. To me, that’s a test of endurance. But also, for you to watch that many films consecutively at a festival, the stars have to align. The times have to be right – you have to be at the right place, the shuttles have to be on time.What are you most proud of in your career so far?Honestly, that I’m still doing it. It’s not a flashy, glamorous profession as some may think, especially if you’re a freelancer like myself. It’s always a constant battle to get work, to get access, to make a living writing.In my particular case, being an immigrant, being a DACA recipient, oftentimes people in my circumstances or from my background don’t see themselves in careers like film criticism – which is so far-fetched, so unreachable to work in a field that is often seen to be reserved for a certain type of person with a certain type of education. For me to be here, to have a voice in this industry, I feel like I’m very proud that somehow… if someone can feel that if I’m doing it, they can also be doing it. I feel like that’s always a victory.Do you have any advice for critics who are still finding their voice?I think that opening up yourself to watching movies that you assume you’re not going to like is a good way to see what your taste is, see what it is that you really react to. What are the things that you find yourself not liking or liking about a certain movie? I feel like that really opens up your cinematic taste buds. It just gives you a wider palette of the things you’ve seen.Is there an up-and-coming critic that you want people to check out?Yeah, there is a young Latina critic. Her name is&nbsp;Kristen Huizar. She won the&nbsp;LAFCA Ruth Batchelor Scholarship, which is a scholarship that the Los Angeles Film Critics Association (LAFCA) gives to young critics from underrepresented backgrounds. She’s in LA and she’s an artist and a writer and reviews films and talks about films from a unique perspective as a Latina woman in LA… I think she mentions often that she uses public transportation, and doesn’t have the LA experience that often gets represented on screen or in the writing.(Photo by Netflix)How has the digital landscape influenced your criticism?It’s definitely the only way that many of us can write today. Most outlets only exist digitally today and because of that, when we get to write something for print, it’s become a big event or a landmark to get something in print because that’s so rare. I do feel that without the digital publishing and digital outlets, most of us wouldn’t be writing today – especially people from underrepresented backgrounds.What’s the hardest review you’ve ever written?I wrote this review-essay for IndieWire on how Roma was an interesting experience for me because I’m someone that was born in Mexico City, but left young and hasn’t been able to return in over half my life.It was my own memories and seeing the city that my mom left, seeing when she was young. Also, thinking about the fact that I haven’t been there in so long that it’s probably a different city today. It was a strange exercise in seeing the same city where I grew up in from a different perspective and being reminded of the people that you leave behind, the memories that you carry with you. That was challenging to write, to relate those emotions to the film and to express that through that lens.Is there someone in your life who isn’t a critic whose opinion you admire?My mom’s opinion when it comes to movies or art in general really matters to me. I remember when I was a kid, she would be very interested in watching Akira Kurosawa and Ingmar Bergman and a lot of international cinema. My mother has a grade-school education. She didn’t go to college. She didn’t even finish high school, but she was always very interested in culture and the arts.To me, she’s always been an example of the fact that just because you’re not an intellectual or someone that went to a private school or has a degree, doesn’t mean that you cannot be inspired or moved by all types of films.Carlos Aguilar is a film critic and writer based in Los Angeles.

With the next big Marvel movie —&nbsp;Black Widow —&nbsp;now delayed until November 6, effectively&nbsp;creating a domino effect and pushing back all other planned entries, fans are free to catch up on all the movies as they self-quarantine at home. But what are those unsung — or underappreciated — movies in the franchise?We asked staff members here at RT what they thought were the most underrated MCU movies, and a handful responded with some interesting selections. We should clarify that this isn’t simply a list of the worst-reviewed movies in the franchise with arguments amounting to, “It’s secretly good!” The five choices below represent films that either never managed to gain the kind of fanbase that others did, or irked audiences in one way or another, or became lost in the shadows of even bigger entries. Read on for the five most underrated MCU movies according to RT staff, and then vote in the poll below for which one you think deserves more love than it gets!Thor (2011)  77%When Thor was announced and Kenneth Branagh was tapped to direct it, many were more than little a skeptical. Branagh, who was best known for Shakespearean adaptations like Hamlet, Henry V, and Much Ado About Nothing, had never helmed a middle-range budgeted film, let alone a $150 million CGI-heavy fantasy flick for the Marvel Cinematic Universe. However, that inspired albeit risky choice in the director’s chair is why the film is better than it’s often credited to be. In truth, Thor set a formula that would be repeated by many of the most beloved superhero films yet to come. Logan, Ant-Man, and Captain America: The Winter Soldier all borrowed from the blueprint set by Thor and thrived because of it. Thor proved that the heart of every successful superhero film had to be story and theme, and the superhero part is less important.Logan is a western but with superheroes; Ant-Man is a heist movie with superhero tech; and Captain America: The Winter Solider is a spy thriller with some really super soldiers. This is why Thor sticks out and feels slightly out of place with early MCU films — and why it’s often dismissed as mediocre. Up to that point, putting Robert Downey Jr. in a suit or making Edward Norton go green was all the audience needed. Thor gave us more,&nbsp;including the pitch-perfect casting of Chris Hemsworth as the God of Thunder himself, Anthony Hopkins as Odin, Natalie Portman as Jane, and one of the best villains ever, Tom Hiddleston as Loki. You can’t get actors of that pedigree without a director like Branagh, who understood the film was, in fact, a Shakespearean drama more akin to Hamlet than Iron Man. Secret parentage, a path to succession, and a spoiled little prince in need of redemption sound more like an episode of The Tudors than a comic book movie, but a comic book movie it is, and one that deserves our respect. – Jacqueline ColeyCaptain America: The First Avenger (2011)  80%Like Thor, this isn’t your typical superhero movie, and that’s why it’s so great. It doesn’t have supersuits or alien invaders, or even cell phones. It’s an origin story of a good man becoming a great hero.&nbsp;The film feels like one of the old Hollywood serials that would have been popular during the era in which the film itself is set, which is part of its charm, and it celebrates the campiness of the Cap comics while also embracing the heart. We get to see a scrawny Steve Rogers turn into the mighty Captain America (with some not-so-bad CGI), some fun action sequences, a lot of Bucky bromance, a little Peggy romance (Agent Carter is the most underrated hero), and of course, the origins of one of the best MCU lines ever, “I can do this all day.” And if we hadn’t seen how it all began, there’s no way we would have been as invested in his character — one of the linchpins of the entire franchise —&nbsp; or as touched when he made his bittersweet exit. – Jennifer JevonsIron Man 3 (2013)  79%Yes, we’re going there. And yes, we’re going to… deep breath… defend its take on the Mandarin. Iron Man 3 may only be the third-best threequel in the MCU – how could it compete with Ragnarok and Civil War? – but it’s never deserved the fury with which some fans greeted it back in 2013, nor the indifference with which many reflect on it today. Indeed, it belongs in the upper tiers of any fair MCU ranking for a whole host of reasons. First up, it&nbsp;continued arguably the most creatively rich trend in the franchise: the risky hiring of unique, auteur-type directors, not necessarily tested in the superhero genre, to helm these things. Without Shane “Kiss Kiss Bang Bang” Black putting his mark on Iron Man, you don’t get Taika Waititi’s take on Thor, James Gunn’s Galaxy, or Chloe Zhao helming The Eternals. In other words, you don’t get the current all-Fresh-no-Rotten, genre-bending shape of the MCU. Black made the film the most distinctive MCU offering up to that point, infusing it with many of his ticks and trademarks: a Christmas setting – yes, Iron Man 3 is a Christmas movie and we think we just won the argument right there – plus plenty of rapid-fire dialogue and some clever voice over. And he did it all while delivering some of the MCU’s best bang-bang set pieces, including the breathtaking destruction of Tony Stark’s home.Now, to address the simpering, British elephant in the room: Black and co.’s treatment of the Mandarin is, far from a crime against the character’s comic-book legacy, one of the best surprises Marvel has ever given us on screen. Precisely because it is that: a genuine, refreshing, hilarious surprise. After the battering we’d all received from The Avengers, and a string of grandiose to tedious villains (remember Malekith? Neither do we), the Mandarin bait-and-switch is an ingenious subversion, and one that showed a $200 million blockbuster from Disney and Marvel could still&nbsp;mess with our expectations. Oh, and Sir Ben Kingsley is great. So, yes, we get it: It wasn’t the Mandarin you wanted, but it was the Mandarin – and Iron Man 3 was the film – the MCU needed. And it’s time the movie was shown a bit more respect. – Joel MearesAvengers: Age of Ultron (2015)  76%We already made a case here for why&nbsp;Avengers: Age of Ultron&nbsp;could be the most important movie in the MCU, but allow us to reiterate. While it sports one of the lower Tomatometer scores in the MCU and it’s frequently cited as something of a disappointment in the franchise, it also happens to be the foundation upon which the latter half of the Infinity Saga is built. This is the film that sowed the seeds of Bruce Banner assuming some control over the Hulk, a story arc that came to full fruition in&nbsp;Endgame. It’s also when the meet-cute between the two halves of&nbsp;WandaVision took place, as well as the first indication that Cap might be worthy to wield Mjolnir, a throwaway sight gag that would later pay off in a major way. We meet Hawkeye’s family, see visions of potential futures that hint at the events of Infinity War and&nbsp;Thor: Ragnarok, and get a few pointedly ominous lines (“That’s the endgame”). But perhaps the most crucial development in&nbsp;Age of Ultron is the rift that begins to develop between Tony Stark and Steve Rogers as they argue over ideology and literally come to blows over the creation of Vision. The cracks in their relationship would grow into giant fault lines when the final confrontation between the Avengers and Ultron here later ultimately leads to the events of&nbsp;Captain America: Civil War, and that division, in part, is what allows Thanos to succeed in his plan to the extent that he does. So while it may not be the most beloved film in the MCU,&nbsp;Age of Ultron absolutely deserves more respect than it regularly gets, even if only because it represents a crucial turning point in the Infinity Saga. –&nbsp;Jacqueline ColeyAvengers: Infinity War (2018)  85%It’s true that Avengers: Infinity War was a huge box office winner and a hit with critics, but its success was largely trumped by the film it served to set up, and we think its reputation deserves better than that. In Infinity War, we finally meet the big baddie of all the MCU villains. While Thanos’ goal — to wipe out half the galaxy — doesn’t appear to be so different from that of any other major villain, he believes he’s saving the galaxy by destroying it, and he dispatches anyone who dares to stand in his way as a mere casualty in his “quest for good.” One of the overlooked strengths of Infinity War is that you walk in already knowing and loving the Avengers, but it’s Thanos you spend the most time with. He’s an unknown quantity, and that uncertainty immediately makes you afraid for the lives of your favorite heroes, because you don’t know exactly what this purple villain is capable of.In Infinity War, Thanos&nbsp;experiences something that’s usually reserved for heroes: a moment of personal sacrifice. From Tony in New York to Groot in the Dark Aster, our heroes have found themselves making choices that could end their own lives in order to save others, and Infinity War subverts this trope in an unexpected way. Throughout the film, the Avengers spend a lot of time telling each other to protect the Infinity Stones — and Earth — at all costs, but their initial unwillingness to accept loss of life in exchange for Thanos’ defeat limits their ability to effectively fight the Mad Titan. We’re left seeing them unable to come to grips with whether their choice was really for the greater good — or if it was for themselves. Meanwhile, unlike our heroes, Thanos makes the painful decision to sacrifice a life — that of his daughter Gamora — to obtain the Soul Stone. By the end, Infinity War leaves viewers debating whether the Avengers should have traded lives for the sake of the universe. That’s not how a Marvel movie “should” end. Yes, it’s a setup for Endgame, but it has prescience — and for a blockbuster studio film, it’s a hell of an ending to chew on. – Daisy Gonzalez!function(e,t,n){var s=e.getElementsByTagName(t)[0];e.getElementById(n)||((t=e.createElement(t)).id=n,t.src=\"https://embed.ex.co/sdk.js\",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s))}(document,\"script\",\"playbuzz-sdk\")","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"Exclusive, new, NBC, singing, movies, MSNBC, movies, archives, OWN, of","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"what-is-the-most-underrated-mcu-movie"},{"id":"47612178124996","title":"The Sights and Sounds of Golden Globes Weekend","content":"Trophy Talkvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})The Sights and Sounds of Golden Globes WeekendTaika Waititi, Laura Dern, Brad Pitt, Rian Johnson, and other Oscar hopefuls turn out for all the fun on Golden Globes Weekend.by Jacqueline Coley | January 8, 2020 |  Comments(Photo by Courtesy of Getty Images for AFI)Golden Globes are slightly dubious as a barometer for predicting&nbsp;the Academy Awards. Thanks to&nbsp;some stellar research over at FiveThirtyEight, we know that the Golden Globes are right about 50% of the time&nbsp;predicting the Oscar Best Picture winner, though in the last 20 years, that number has slipped to about 35%. This, however, does not mean last weekend wasn’t filled with moments that might tip the hat as to whom will be nominated for Oscars (or perhaps even take home a statue).&nbsp;Nestled right in the midst of nominations voting, Globes weekend and the subsequent events that surround it mirror the “eclectic and ever raucous” vibe that Best Supporting Actor frontrunner Brad Pitt&nbsp;spoke of&nbsp;in his Globes acceptance speech. This past weekend, Rotten Tomatoes Editor Jacqueline Coley was&nbsp;out and about&nbsp;to report back on the sights, sounds, and takeaways from&nbsp;events including the Hollywood Bonghive meetup and the glitzy post-globes parties.The Stars and Diamonds Glitter in Palm Springs(Photo by Rich Fury/Getty Images)The first event of the weekend was the Palms Springs Gala, where Oscar hopefuls can schmooze with the retired AMPAS voters who&nbsp;live in the tropical&nbsp;community, just&nbsp;an hour south of Los Angeles. Dressed to the nines in colorful gowns and lots of jewels, Palms Springs attendees watched stars Jennifer Lopez,&nbsp;Joaquin Phoenix,&nbsp;Martin Scorsese,&nbsp;Charlize Theron, and&nbsp; Renée Zellweger accept various honors in the opening night presentation. However, it was Little Women&nbsp;director Greta Gerwig who won the night with her heartfelt speech for Director honoree Quentin Tarantino. “[He] makes movies as if movies could save the world,” she said while introducing him, adding, “Movies can kill Hitler, free slaves, and give Sharon Tate one more summer… He makes movies like movies themselves matter.” This was a big moment for Tarantino, who had received flack earlier in the year&nbsp;regarding&nbsp;his lack of dialogue for star Margot Robbie. Tapping Gerwig — arguably the most noteworthy female director in the awards conversation this year — to present him with the award and speak so positively on his behalf was a smart play for the Once Upon a Time in Hollywood&nbsp;director. It’s just too bad she couldn’t pinch-hit for his awkward Golden Globes acceptance speech on Sunday, as well.The Stars’ Favorite Stop for Weekend Lunching with AFI(Photo by Courtesy of Jacqueline Coley)There is no way to put this delicately so we’ll just say it — campaigning for an Oscar is torturous. Stars have to clear their calendars for two to three months to shake hands and make speeches.&nbsp;They go through the arduous exercise of doing hours of press, taking selfies, and smiling through it all, with very little to no chance of actually winning any awards. Cocktail parties, posh dinners, and award shows may sound like a fun time, but doing anything every day for two months will lose its novelty quickly. This is why the AFI luncheon on the Friday before the Globes is such a welcome moment for most Oscar hopefuls. Each year, AFI selects 10 films and 10 television shows from the previous year (and a couple of specialty honors if they find international entries of merit) and gather the principal players together for a relaxed lunch with limited press just to celebrate their achievements. The lack of press and potential voters and the fact everyone in the room is already previously announced as a winner removes most of the anxiety that comes with other events. This is why everyone from Brad Pitt to Kevin Feige call the event their favorite moment of the season.This year, we watched Pitt chat it up with Bong Joon-ho and the cast of Parasite as he repeatedly gushed about how he “loved the film.” We also spotted Rian Johnson, who was&nbsp;honored for Knives Out, chatting with his Star Wars: The Last Jedi&nbsp;co-star Laura Dern, who was being feted for her work in Noah Baumbach’s&nbsp;Marriage Story and Greta Gerwig’s&nbsp;Little Women. Robert De Niro (Joker, The Irishman), Harvey Keitel (Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, The Irishman), Scarlett Johansson (Jojo Rabbit, Marriage Story), Sam Rockwell (Richard Jewell, Jojo Rabbit), and Leonardo DiCaprio (Once Upon A Time in Hollywood, produced Richard Jewell) were all involved with more than one honoree. We asked Dern about how she split her loyalties, and she&nbsp;joked she was a bit like the young boy at the center of the&nbsp;divorce drama&nbsp;in Marriage Story: “They are like my parents. I love them both. I don’t pick sides.”Though there is a “no campaigning” mantra in effect at the AFI, there’s nothing to say attendees can’t steer voices and eyes to films they favor, and this year featured an excellent example of tongue-in-cheek campaigning. Former AFI honoree Mel Brooks kicked off the festivities with a benediction, during which he&nbsp;raved about&nbsp;his favorite film of the year — the Hitler anti-war satire Jojo Rabbit: “It’s really a terrific, eloquent, and beautiful picture,” he said, adding jokingly that writer/director Taika Watiti “did not ask my permission to use Hitler” — a hilarious reference to&nbsp;Brooks’ Hitler satire&nbsp;The Producers.A Party with ParasiteIf we were ever unsure of Bong Joon-ho’s effect on the Hollywood community, the party hosted by Guillermo del Toro at the Sunset Tower answered all of those questions. After being fawned over by just about everyone at the AFI Luncheon, Team Parasite was greeted by the rest of Hollywood that evening. Edgar Wright, Rian Johnson, Leonardo DiCaprio, Laura Dern, Keegan-Michael Key, Noah Baumbach, Jay Roach, Miranda July, and Natasha Lyonne — some of whom left their own&nbsp;For Your Consideration&nbsp;events to make a trek to the West Hollywood celebration — all made time to pay their respects that night. Having so many A-listers and Academy voters as confirmed members of the Bonghive&nbsp;– Bong’s online fanbase –&nbsp;a Best Picture nomination this coming Monday looks more and more like an inevitability.Brunching with the Indie CrowdParasite Dir. Bong Joon Ho chats w/ The Farewell star Zhao Shuzen (Photo by Courtesy of Jacqueline Coley)On Saturday, Film Independent had the Indie Spirit Awards’ annual nominees brunch, where they handed out $125,000 to filmmakers Kelly Reichardt, Mollye Asher,&nbsp;Rashaad Ernesto Green, and Nadia Shihab. We also spotted Last Black Man in San Francisco&nbsp;director Joe Talbot, who was up for one of the Indie Spirit specialty prizes that were handed out during Saturday’s fete by Alfre Woodard and Crazy Rich Asians&nbsp;director John Chu. When we asked Chu about his upcoming film with Hamilton creator Lin-Manuel Miranda, In The Heights, he simply smiled and said, “He can’t wait for people to see it.” As was the case on Friday, Parasite director Bong Joon-Ho was again so mobbed by well-wishers he barely had time to sit down.After the Globes…(Photo by Courtesy of Netflix)After the Globes, the most raucous party was&nbsp;– as it has been for the past few years&nbsp;– the Netflix party. Tiffany Haddish, who presented at the ceremony, put on an impromptu freestyle at the end of the night, shortly after Brad Pitt, Eddie Murphy, Ava DuVernay, Taika Waititi, and numerous Netflix stars danced the night away to pop hits. At the Instyle/Warner Bros. do, their elevator glam shot was a frequent stop for celebs, and&nbsp;The Farewell&nbsp;helmer Lulu Wang paired up with Rita Wilson for a hilarious shoot sporting a&nbsp;– yes, it’s legal in California&nbsp;– blunt, courtesy of Snoop Dogg. Though the Netflix party was the spot be, it was slightly a somber affair at the start, due to the fact the streamer only took home two prizes out of 17 nominations. In contrast, the NBC celebration was a joyous time after two surprise wins for their World War I “one-shot” epic 1917. This is welcome news for Universal Studios, who are likely still smarting after the vicious&nbsp;– though at times bemused&nbsp;– reception to Cats. The wins at the globes could propel the film, which opens wide in theaters this weekend, to box office domination over January, and if awards keep tallying up on our Awards Leaderboard, perhaps a Best Picture win as well.The Academy Awards are broadcast February 9, 8 pm EST/5 pm PST, on ABC.Like this?

Olivia Colman! –&nbsp;and history in the making at the 91st Academy Awards.by Jacqueline Coley and Joel Meares | February 24, 2019 |  CommentsWhat the 91st Academy Awards&nbsp;lacked in hosts, it certainly made up for in surprises – at least at the tail-end of the night. (Yes, your ears and eyes were working: that was&nbsp;Julia Roberts naming&nbsp;Green Book&nbsp;as Best Picture and not&nbsp;Roma.)&nbsp;It was also a night for history to be made, with the likes of Spike Lee winning his first Oscar, and Ruth E. Carter and Hannah Beachler becoming the first African Americans to win awards for Costume and Production Design, respectively.&nbsp;Read on for our picks of the night’s biggest moments, and check out our full list of the&nbsp;2019 Oscar winners.Adam Lambert and Queen Open the Show(Photo by Ethan Miller/Getty Images)Queen biopic Bohemian Rhapsody may be lowest on the Tomatometer among the Best Picture nominees, but the band was top of the night. Joined by Adam Lambert, Queen opened the show performing “We Will Rock You” and then “We Are the Champions,” forcing all actors caught on camera to rock out enthusiastically/awkwardly (Javier Bardem for the win).Fey, Rudolph, Poehler Show they Would Have Made the Perfect HostsSome viewers got their hopes up that perhaps we would get hosts after all when Tina Fey, Maya Rudolph, and Amy Poehler entered the stage following a montage of moments from the year in film. And while they did not stick around to guide us through the night, their introduction to the Best Supporting Actress showed the Academy might be wise to let them next year. Particular highlights: Rudolph’s sultry “Wakanda plans you got later?” to Chadwick Boseman, and her perfect Gaga wail.Regina King Wins Best Supporting Actress for&nbsp;If Beale Street Could Talk (2019)  95%If Beale Street Could Talk co-star Regina King was named Best Supporting Actress, and –&nbsp;after an assist getting to the stage from Captain American himself –&nbsp;delivered a heartfelt speech, celebrating her mother, who accompanied her to the awards. “I’m an example of what it looks like when support and love is poured into someone,” said a teary King. She is the first winner in any acting category to win the Oscar without being nominated for a SAG or BAFTA since Marcia Gay Harden in 2000.Brian Tyree Henry and Melissa McCarthy Wear All the CostumesBrian Tyree Henry (If Beale Street Could Talk, Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse) and Melissa McCarthy (Can You Ever Forgive Me?) introduced the Best Costume Category wearing outfits inspired by all five nominees. We will never forget the image of McCarthy opening the envelope with a rabbit puppet.Ruth E. Carter and Hannah Beachler Make History With Wins for Black Panther (2018)  96%Black Panther costumer Ruth E. Carter became the first Black woman to win an Oscar for Best Costume Design, beating out favorite Sandy Powell who was nominated twice for Mary Poppins Returns and The Favourite. The 30-year veteran began her acceptance speech by thanking fellow nominee Spike Lee; the BlacKkKlansman director gave Carter her first job on School Daze, and they later collaborated for her Oscar-nominated work on Malcolm X. Next up was the award for Best Production Design, and in back-to-back historic Black Panther wins, Hannah Beachler became the first Black woman to win for Production Design. The production designer behind Beyonce’s Lemonade and all of director Ryan Coogler’s&nbsp;movies gave an emotional speech&nbsp;during which she thanked Coogler for believing in her.Mahershala Ali Wins Second Best Supporting Actor Oscar for&nbsp;Green Book (2018)  77%Some pundits thought Can You Ever Forgive Me?&nbsp;co-star&nbsp;Richard E. Grant was set to cause an upset here, but favorite Mahershala Ali took home the prize for his portrayal of pianist Don Shirley. The win makes Ali only the second ever Black actor to win two acting Oscars (the other being Denzel Washington). Ali dedicated his award to his grandmother, “who has been in my ear my entire life telling me, if at first I don’t succeed, try, try again.”Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper Generate Jackson-Ally Magic with “Shallow”(Photo by Kevin Winter/Getty Images)They didn’t even need an intro… The Best Song favorites performed the final song of the night, semi-recreating A Star Is Born’s memorable concert scene: camera lingering behind them, epic build,&nbsp;that&nbsp;wail.&nbsp;“Shallow” –&nbsp;of course –&nbsp;went on to win Best Song.Spike Lee – Finally&nbsp;– Wins His First OscarBOOM-SHAKA-LACKA! Spike Lee won his first competitive Oscar after five nominations. (He was awarded an honorary Oscar in 2016). Accepting the Best Adapted Screenplay award for BlacKkKlansman – along with Kevin Willmott, David Rabinowitz, and Charlie Wachtel – the Brooklyn native stayed on brand: bombastic and honest. During his speech, he drew attention to the date of his historic win, 400 years almost to the day since the first slaves arrived in the United States. In February, Black History Month, the country’s most celebrated Black filmmaker was handed the award from Brie Larson and his longtime friend Samuel L. Jackson. It is the third year in a row that a Black writer has won for screenwriting: Jordan Peele won Best Original Screenplay for Get Out&nbsp;last year and Barry Jenkins won Best Adapted Screenplay in 2017 for Moonlight.A Best Actress Mega SurpriseThe Oscars proved it still has the capacity to surprise, saving one of the biggest shocks of the night to almost the very end: The Favourite star&nbsp;Olivia Colman upset favorite Glenn Close in the Best Actress category. Less of a shock: Colman gave arguably the best — and funniest — speech of the night, opening with “It’s genuinely quite stressful” and ending by simply exclaiming, “Lady Gaga!”Alfonso Cuarón Continues Hot Streak for Mexican DirectorsAlfonso Cuarón’s win for Best Director means that Mexican directors have won the category five times since 2014: Alejandro González Iñárritu for Birdman and The Revenant, Guillermo del Toro for The Shape of Water, and Cuarón for Gravity and, now, Roma.Green Book (2018)  77% Beats Out Favorite&nbsp;Roma to&nbsp;Win Best PictureIf the Best Actress win was one of the biggest wins of the night, it’s closest competition was in the Best Picture category, where Green Book won ahead of favorite Roma. Some pundits had a feeling this could happen, particularly given the Oscars’ preferential voting system, but it was inconceivable to others that any film could stand in the way of Cuarón’s masterpiece. Netflix will have to wait another year, at least, before it can take the top honor.Thumbnail image courtesy&nbsp;Kevin Winter/Getty ImagesWhat were your biggest highlights of the night?

And that’s not even counting the&nbsp;cast of&nbsp;Crazy Rich Asians, which included newcomers Henry Golding and Awkwafina. Young stars&nbsp;Thomasin McKenzie, Geraline Viswanathan, and Isabela Moner&nbsp;also made their big screen debuts in dramas, comedies, and action films this year,&nbsp;proving their acting chops&nbsp;alongside&nbsp;their veteran co-stars.Check out our list of this year’s 10 breakout stars below.Thomasin McKenzie&nbsp;— Leave No Trace (2018)  100%(Photo by Scott Green/Bleecker Street Media)In the criminally under-seen film Leave No Trace, McKenzie stars as Tom, the teenage daughter of a war veteran (Ben Foster). They live in an Oregon park quietly but illegally. Even though they’re suited for life off the grid, when they are discovered and forced into society against their will, the cracks in their plan (and themselves) begin to show. Director Debra Granik captures lush scenery that perfectly reflects the rich inner landscape of McKenzie’s Tom. Her quiet strength, mirrored by the mighty oaks she often stands next to, heightens every moment and leads to a heartbreaking climax.Other roles: The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies (Astrid), Lucy Lewis Can’t LoseAwkwafina —&nbsp;Ocean's 8 (2018)  69%, Crazy Rich Asians (2018)  91%(Photo by Warner Bros. Pictures)Hollywood finally caught up to Awkwafina (real name: Nora Lum), whose hip hop song “My Vag” lit up on YouTube in 2012. Her sense of humor electrified two films this year, the first of which was Ocean’s 8, where she starred as street hustler Constance, whose fast-talking and faster hands make her the perfect addition to Sandra Bullock and Cate Blanchett’s team. In Crazy Rich Asians, she plays Peik Lin, who keeps designer duds in her trunk just in case a fancy party invitation derails her plan to “hang out at FedEx or something.”Other Roles: Storks (Quail), TawkZazie Beetz — Deadpool 2 (2018)  84%(Photo by Joe Lederer/20th Century Fox)The role of lucky risk-taker Domino was a juicy one that had comic book lovers praying filmmakers would attempt it for the sequel. When they cast Beetz, fans of Atlanta knew that she could hold her own against the sharp-as-a-tack Ryan Reynolds as Deadpool. Deftly handling stunts and wisecracks alongside him, Beetz left a memorable mark on superhero movies. Lucky for us, she has a three-picture deal with Fox, which makes the possibility of a spot in an X-Force or Deadpool 3 movie imminent.Other Roles: Slice (Astrid), Geostorm (Dana)Lewis Pullman —&nbsp;The Strangers: Prey At Night (2018)  40%,&nbsp;Bad Times at the El Royale (2018)  74%(Photo by Kimberley French/20th Century Fox Film Corp.)Everyone and everything at the El Royale motel has a secret. Pullman plays desk clerk Lewis with a vague shiver, like a Chihuahua in the mountains without a sweater. During the film, he endures abuse from the guests, both literally while getting dragged around, and figuratively with requests for rooms in the wrong wing. When his secret is revealed, the film and his place in it take a turn that culminates in a surprising, poignant end. His other role as the capable, spirited Luke in The Strangers: Prey at Night has less nuance but no less excitement — plus one of the more memorable sequences of the year set to “Total Eclipse of the Heart.”Other Roles: Battle of the Sexes (Larry Riggs), Lean on Pete (Dallas)Noah Centineo —&nbsp;To All the Boys I've Loved Before (2018)  96%(Photo by Netflix)Netflix made huge strides in the romantic comedy game this year, with one of the most memorable entries being Lana Condor and Centineo’s To All the Boys I’ve Loved Before. The role of Peter could have easily been the “cute and charming guy that’s been there all along” of many films past, but the springy script and Centineo’s bright-eyed performance make it one of the most swoon-worthy and surprising of the genre. Plus, it’s&nbsp;all the more fun to watch his and Condor’s publicity tour for the movie, an adorable act that they should definitely take on the road.Other Roles: Sierra Burgess is a Loser (Jamey), The Fosters (Jesus)Cynthia Erivo —&nbsp;Widows (2018)  91%,&nbsp;Bad Times at the El Royale (2018)  74%(Photo by Merrick Morton/20th Century Fox)Erivo’s role in Widows as Belle, a scrappy, intelligent single mom, helped me research my way into knowing more about her accomplishments on Broadway (acknowledged by a 2016 Tony win). One of my few criticisms about the film was that it left me pining for more Erivo. I got my wish when Bad Times at the El Royale was released, and Erivo’s singing and double-crossing as Darlene was center stage and filled my tank, her sharp, complicated, grounded work in the film helping anchor a bonkers story. Hopefully my tank will remain full enough to coast into 2019, when she plays Harriet Tubman in Harriet.Henry Golding —&nbsp;Crazy Rich Asians (2018)  91%,&nbsp;A Simple Favor (2018)  84%(Photo by Sanja Bucko/Warner Bros.)Golding plays either the husband or the husband-to-be in both films, but he’s so much more than just a handsome accessory on women’s arms. Coming from the world of TV, hosting everything from variety shows to documentaries, Golding knows how to connect with audiences and pull them right in to whatever he’s inviting them to watch. As Nick, the son of an insanely wealthy family in Crazy Rich Asians, he deftly navigates between the two women at odds in his life. In A Simple Favor, his intriguing, secretive Sean heavily contributes to a story shrouded in mystery.Geraldine Viswanathan — Blockers (2018)  84%,&nbsp;The Package (2018)  42%(Photo by Quantrell D. Colbert/Universal Pictures)Both of these films are part of the modern wave of coming of age films, and Viswanathan represents everything they’re doing right. In Blockers as Kayla, the daughter of John Cena, she has the cunning and sex drive to rival that of any of the famous male cinematic horn dogs to come before her. Her turn as Becky in The Package is in the same neighborhood — she’s crush-worthy, but more than just eye candy for the main character. She’s persistent, inventive, and hilarious. With actresses like her seeing this kind of success early on in these kind of genre-bending films, it bodes well for the future of Hollywood.Other Roles: Nippers of Dead Bird Bay, EMO the Musical (Jamali)Isabela Moner — Sicario: Day of the Soldado (2018)  63%,&nbsp;Instant Family (2018)  81%(Photo by Richard Foreman Jr./Columbia Pictures)When your primary activity is wandering around a desert as a hostage or getting adopted by strangers, it could be easy to be a passenger in someone else’s journey. But when you’re as charismatic and interesting as Isabela Moner, you don’t need to worry. Both Isabel in Soldado and Lizzy in Instant&nbsp;Family are headstrong girls who stand 20 feet tall and hold their own against all the veterans alongside them. When you add in perfect amounts of vulnerability and toughness, you’ve got an actress worthy of Dora the Explorer, which is a movie I’m actually excited for now.Other Roles: The Nut Job 2: Nutty by Nature (Heather), Transformers: The Last Knight (Izabella)Brian Tyree Henry —&nbsp;Widows (2018)  91%,&nbsp;If Beale Street Could Talk (2019)  95%, Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse (2018)  97%(Photo by FX)Henry is in eight projects this year alone; it’s impossible to ignore him at this point. While it’s hard to imagine him having a better year in terms of volume, if his current incredible work is any indication, he’s only going to get better and better as time goes on. Don’t sleep on this man. From his role as a corrupt politician in Widows to an ex-con in Beale Street, Henry can do anything believably, which means lots more opportunities to shatter audience’s expectations and bring new things to whatever form he chooses to participate in.Other Roles: Atlanta&nbsp;(Alfred), White Boy Rick (Detective Jackson), Hotel Artemis (Honolulu), Family (Pete), Irreplaceable You (Benji),&nbsp;Vice Principals (Tavis Brown), Crown Heights (Clayton “Massup” Benton)","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"movies, play, aapi, CBS, Mindy, Opinion, live, japanese, Character, color, Kaling, Interview, TV","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"10-breakout-stars-of-2018"},{"id":"47612304624856","title":"BAFTA Nominations 2016","content":"Newsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})BAFTA Nominations 2016by RT Staff | January 8, 2016 |  CommentsThe EE British Academy Film Award nominations were announced this Friday by Stephen Fry and Gugu Mbatha-Raw.

Avengers: Endgame&nbsp;officially became the number 1 movie of all time, globally, when Disney and Marvel Studios re-released the film with a tiny amount of fan-baiting new footage (it was a gamble that paid off, as it was looking like the movie might not be able to catch previous number 1,&nbsp;Avatar,&nbsp;despite a record-shattering opening weekend box office). Meanwhile, the Mouse House’s live-action remake of&nbsp;The Lion King&nbsp;– or “computer-animated remake,” depending on which side of the argument you’re sitting on – entered the top 10 highest-grossing films of all time at number 7.Simba’s kingly box office performance as well as a stellar result for Frozen II&nbsp;means that Disney now occupies six of the&nbsp;10 top box office rankings of all time worldwide.&nbsp;Toy Story&nbsp;4&nbsp;and&nbsp;Captain Marvel&nbsp;gave Disney even more reason to celebrate last year as they entered the top 50, and the year ended on a high note for the studio, with&nbsp;Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker&nbsp;joining the list, even if the final(?) Skywalker film&nbsp;– which has now passed $1 billion globally – underperformed expectations. Meanwhile, also in 2019, Sony released its highest-grossing film to date,&nbsp;Spider-Man: Far From Home, which entered the top 25.Perhaps biggest box office surprise&nbsp;of 2019 – and maybe even its biggest box office story – was the phenomenal success of Warner Bros.’ R-rated&nbsp;Joker, the standalone DC film starring Joaquin Phoenix that is currently at number 31 on this list, having surpassed Aladdin,&nbsp;The Dark Knight,&nbsp;Jurassic Park,&nbsp;The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey, and&nbsp;Rogue One.What does 2020 have in store? While there are no&nbsp;Avengers&nbsp;movies or any&nbsp;Star Wars&nbsp;films hitting theaters, the MCU carries on (Black Widow,&nbsp;The Eternals) and DC is throwing a bunch of potentially huge properties our way, including&nbsp;Wonder Woman 1984. Originals could also break through, with Christopher Nolan’s&nbsp;Tenet and Denis Villeneuve’s&nbsp;Dune&nbsp;eyed as major contenders to make a box office dent. We’ll update as the year’s films start to make their appearances on this list.For the list below, we’ve included global box office performance, as well as domestic, and release date. We included dollars earned in re-releases, and in each of our descriptions, we look at where the film stood record-wise at the time of its run, and dive into things like critical and audience reception.&nbsp;We’ll be here to track the progress of new blockbusters and regularly update this list of top box office performers. So keep your eyes here, and check in with our weekly weekend box office wraps.&nbsp;&nbsp;1. $2.798 Billion&nbsp;Avengers: Endgame (2019)  94%Domestic: $858.4 million (including re-releases)Release date: April 26, 2019The journey that began in 2008 with Iron Man&nbsp;was coming to an end – at least for some of the characters in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Audiences that had been holding their breath for an entire year after perhaps the biggest cliffhanger since&nbsp;Empire Strikes Back&nbsp;could not wait to buy their tickets&nbsp;– and did they ever buy those tickets&nbsp;when they finally could. Opening weekend for Avengers: Endgame in April 2019&nbsp;surpassed Infinity War’s year-long record by nearly $100 million. In just eight days, the film had grossed a half-billion domestically. On day 10 it was over $621 million. One by one the records&nbsp;fell, leading many to ignore the words “if” and “can” and focus instead on “when” Avatar’s previous record ($2.787 billion) as the highest-grossing movie would fall. But Endgame&nbsp;began to show signs early in its run that its impressive sprinting start might not be enough for it to ultimately come out ahead of James Cameron’s epic; it only had the second-biggest second weekend ever and the fourth-best third weekend. In the era of the modern blockbuster, even a record-breaker can be front-loaded and only spend three weeks atop the charts. It really all came down to a final dash near the finish line. After just six weeks of release,&nbsp;Endgame&nbsp;was&nbsp;about&nbsp;$73 million away from dethroning&nbsp;Avatar – substantial ground to make up. But then Marvel and Disney re-released the film on June 28 with new goodies over its end credits. And then, over the weekend of July 19, 2019 – its 13th week of release – when another Disney release would begin its run for the top 10 all-time earners (hello, Lion King),&nbsp;Endgame&nbsp;squeaked ahead. It may not have been able to&nbsp;catch The Force Awakens for the all-time domestic leader, but by the time summer was over, it would pull in front of Avatar and become the king of the world (sorry, James).2. $2.790 Billion&nbsp;Avatar (2009)  82%Domestic: $760.5 million (including re-releases)Release date: December 18, 2009The world had to wait some 12 years for James Cameron to follow up the biggest film of all-time with what would become the new biggest film of all time. Nobody believed he was going to surpass Titanic’s numbers with this tale of an alien planet and the paraplegic Marine who teams up with its inhabitants in the battle for Unobtanium. But he did. At the peak of a 3-D reemergence, aided by the filmmaker’s usual technological gamesmanship (and higher ticket prices), Avatar‘s&nbsp;seven straight weekends at number 1 led to over $595 million at the North American box office. Then, two days later on Feb. 2, 2010, its 47th day of release,&nbsp;the movie became the highest domestic earner ever. Avatar held that record for five years and eleven months and&nbsp;went on to become the only film ever to earn $2 billion outside of the U.S. and Canada, making it the world’s highest grosser at the time.&nbsp;It held onto its impressive global&nbsp;record for nearly 10 years. Until Avengers: Endgame.3. $2.194 Billion&nbsp;Titanic (1997)  89%Domestic: $659.4 million (including re-releases)Release date: December 19, 1997James Cameron makes expensive movies. The Abyss, Terminator 2, and True Lies were all the most expensive movies of their time upon release. In 1997, Cameron&nbsp;blew out the budget again and this time there was worry he may have gone too far. Though delayed from July until December,&nbsp;Titanic nevertheless became a global phenomenon the likes of which the box office had never seen at the time. After 15 straight weeks at number 1, 14 Oscar nominations and 11 statuettes, Titanic, its stars and its song were ingrained in the hearts and tear ducts of the world, and the movie would hold the all-time box office record for 12 years – until Cameron would eclipse himself once again with Avatar.4. $2.068 Billion&nbsp;Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens (2015)  93%Domestic: $936.7 millionRelease date: December 18, 2015Twelve years after the completion of the Star Wars&nbsp;prequel trilogy, J.J. Abrams was tasked with making&nbsp;Episode VII – a monumental undertaking, and a risky one. Were people still&nbsp;interested after the prequels? Were they burnt out? The approach was to mix the old and the new, and it worked.&nbsp;Abrams gave a&nbsp;brand-new cast of characters the&nbsp;chance to interact with the original trio of Luke, Han, and Leia, and generations of fans were so ready for the adventure that&nbsp;they&nbsp;gave&nbsp;the film the highest opening weekend in history ($247.9 million). In just under three weeks, The Force Awakens became the all-time domestic champion, passing Avatar and joining the $2 billion club&nbsp;within&nbsp;54 days. It still remains the highest-grossing domestic release of all time.5. $2.048 Billion&nbsp;Avengers: Infinity War (2018)  85%Domestic: $678.8 millionRelease date: April 27, 2018Just shy of 10 years since it began, the Marvel Cinematic Universe gathered nearly every one of its characters for a galaxy-wide showdown with&nbsp;the series’ Big Bad,&nbsp;Thanos.&nbsp;The movie featured&nbsp;one of the gutsiest cliffhangers in any franchise’s history, leaving audiences to wait in shock for an entire year to discover how Phase 3 of the epic series would end. The film bested The Force Awakens’ three-day opening weekend record with $257.6 million, and hit the $2 billion mark in 48 days. Domestically, it would ultimately come up just short of&nbsp;Black Panther, which was&nbsp;released two&nbsp;months prior.Check out the latest Weekend Box Office Results6. $1.670 Billion&nbsp;Jurassic World (2015)  71%Domestic: $652.3 millionRelease date: June 12, 2015Twenty-two years after Steven Spielberg’s Jurassic Park&nbsp;became the Jaws for a new generation, it was time for that generation’s kids to have their own version of dinosaur mayhem. The second-best–reviewed film in the Jurassic&nbsp;series&nbsp;(72% on the Tomatometer vs. the original’s 91%), Jurassic World&nbsp;trampled a competitive summer full of Avengers, Minions, and inner feelings, and became just the third film since Titanic in 1998 to pass $600 million in domestic box office.7. $1.657 Billion&nbsp;The Lion King (2019)  52%Domestic: $543.6 millionRelease date: July 19, 2019Having found success with&nbsp;its&nbsp;live-action re-imaginings of&nbsp;The Jungle Book&nbsp;and&nbsp;Beauty and the Beast, Disney tripled down in 2019 with three “new” remakes.&nbsp;Dumbo&nbsp;was a bit of a bust,&nbsp;Aladdin&nbsp;was a success, but&nbsp;The Lion King&nbsp;truly&nbsp;roared. That made sense given that the 1994 original, at the time, was one of the studio’s most successful films in the middle of&nbsp;its&nbsp;rebirth, and director Jon Favreau’s CGI-fueled version traced it for a new generation. The result is the highest-grossing domestic release to receive a Rotten score on the Tomatometer, at 53%. But its $191 million opening was the eighth highest of all time and it became the 14th film to pass a half-billion domestically and just the ninth film to rack up $1 billion overseas.8. $1.519 Billion&nbsp;Marvel's The Avengers (2012)  91%Domestic: $623.4 millionRelease date: May 4, 2012Want proof that Avengers work best together? Consider that the first combined outing for Iron Man, Thor, and Captain America bested the $1.4 billion that their origin stories had made combined. Five films into the MCU&nbsp;(including Edward Norton’s The Incredible Hulk), the team was finally assembled for a singular battle against Loki and his inherited army. Joss Whedon’s&nbsp;movie became the first ever to make over $200 million in a single weekend and was Marvel’s first entry into the&nbsp;Billion Dollar Club, which&nbsp;had just 12 members at the time.9. $1.515 Billion&nbsp;Furious 7 (2015)  82%Domestic: $353 millionRelease date: April 3, 2015What started out as a Point Break derivative – with cars! – became one of the unlikeliest mega franchises ever. Vin Diesel’s return in the series’ fourth film is what really got the&nbsp;Fast and Furious&nbsp;franchise engines revving, and Dwayne Johnson’s addition in the fifth film added some humor and helped get the critics on board. But it was the full embrace of the series’ now-signature bombast, as well as the untimely death of Paul Walker, that brought the combo of curiosity and tribute that helped make James Wan’s&nbsp;Furious 7&nbsp;the franchise’s most successful entry. It hit with audiences –&nbsp;the opening weekend haul of&nbsp;$147 million was almost $50 million more than any previous entry – as well as with critics (it’s the highest-rated movie in the series at 81% on the Tomatameter).10. $1.448 Billion&nbsp;Frozen II (2019)  78%Domestic: $477 millionRelease date: November 22, 2019When a film becomes not just a global phenomenon but the highest-grossing film in your canon of animated entertainment, a sequel is inevitable. While not quite as well-received as the first film critically (77% vs. 90% on the Tomatometer),&nbsp;Frozen II&nbsp;virtually demanded that parents bring their children for a second adventure. It began with the third-highest opening weekend for an animated film (after Pixar sequels&nbsp;Incredibles 2&nbsp;and&nbsp;Finding Dory) – $130.26 million – and then became the highest-grossing film over the five-day Thanksgiving holiday, which was all the more impressive given it had opened the prior weekend. In its fourth weekend of release, it became Disney’s sixth billion-dollar film of 2019, pushing&nbsp;Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle&nbsp;out of the Top 50 on the same weekend that its sequel&nbsp;The Next Level&nbsp;opened.&nbsp;Now, the movie has overtaken the original&nbsp;Frozen&nbsp;to become the highest-grossing animated film of all time.11. $1.402 Billion&nbsp;Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015)  76%Domestic: $459 millionRelease date: May 1, 2015If any film in the top 10 could be considered both a success and a disappointment it would be Joss Whedon’s Avengers sequel. Coming up shy of the first film’s record-breaking opening weekend – note that it was still&nbsp;the second-best opening of all time when it was released – the movie never matched its predecessor in&nbsp;dollars or affection. With a 75% Tomatometer rating, it doesn’t even rank among the top 10 Tomatometer scores of the MCU – though we think there’s a case to be made for reassessing its virtues – and it lost the summer of 2015 to the dinosaurs of Jurassic World. Still, it was just the 16th film ever to cross the $400 million line domestically in its initial run.12. $1.347 Billion&nbsp;Black Panther (2018)  96%Domestic: $700.1 millionRelease date: February 16, 2018After an introduction in Captain America: Civil War, T’Challa got his own film in February of 2019. Audiences were hungry for&nbsp;representation on screen&nbsp;and looking for a thrilling re-introduction to the character, and in Ryan Coogler’s action-packed, beautiful-looking epic, they got both. The movie became the fifth film in history to have a $200 million opening weekend, and just the third film ever to gross over $700 million in North America, outlasting even Avengers: Infinity War that summer. Why isn’t it even higher&nbsp;in the list? Because it remains the only post-Avengers film in the MCU to make less money internationally than domestically.13. $1.342 Billion&nbsp;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - Part 2 (2011)  96%Domestic: $381.2 millionRelease date: July 15, 2011Fans of J.K. Rowling’s fantasy series got to see its characters (and the actors who played them) grow up in front of their eyes. The culmination of the journey that began in 2001 also ushered in a new trend of splitting&nbsp;final chapters in halves. The back half of the Potter&nbsp;finale&nbsp;set the new record for an opening weekend at the time with $169.1 million, and its $960 million international haul ranked only behind Avatar and Titanic. By the end of its run, the eight Harry Potter&nbsp;had films grossed a combined $7.72 billion.14. $1.333 Billion&nbsp;Star Wars: The Last Jedi (2017)  90%Domestic: $620.2 millionRelease date: December 15, 2017One of the more controversial entries in the Star Wars series – don’t get&nbsp;anyone started on the casino planet sequence! – Rian Johnson’s&nbsp;The Last Jedi&nbsp;took the standard dip that had afflicted other middle films in the franchise. The Empire Strikes Back made 31.9% less than A New Hope,&nbsp;Attack of the Clones made 34.6% less than The Phantom Menace, and The Last Jedi fell 33.8% off The Force Awakens. Still, Johnson’s film joined Episodes IV, V, and VII in the 90%+ realm on the Tomatometer and may end up being the ultimate bridge to the next generation of Star Wars fans.15. $1.308 Billion&nbsp;Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom (2018)  47%Domestic: $417.7 millionRelease date: June 22, 2018J.A. Bayona’s follow-up to Colin Trevorrow’s continuation of Steven Spielberg’s series received the weakest Tomatometer score of the franchise to date (48%) and, following the path of many “second” entries in franchises (even if it’s technically the fifth), dropped 36% from Jurassic World&nbsp;in overall domestic box office. But it was still good enough for 23rd all-time in North America and 13th in overseas dollars. It was also the second-highest-grossing domestic film of the 2018 summer season, behind the #17 film on this list.16. $1.281 Billion&nbsp;Frozen (2013)  90%Domestic: $400.7 millionRelease date: November 22, 2013The Oscar-winning song that has tortured parents for nearly a decade&nbsp;was just part of what made&nbsp;Frozen the highest-grossing animated film in history. The story of two sisters searching for happily-ever-after with each other rather than the standard gentlemen suitors also won the Oscar for Best Animated Feature and bested 2012’s Ice Age: Continental Drift for the highest international haul for an animated film ever ($875.7 million compared to $715.9 million), a record it holds to this day despite challenges from&nbsp;Minions and Incredibles&nbsp;2. (If you consider&nbsp;the new&nbsp;Lion King&nbsp;animated though, this is one&nbsp;crown&nbsp;the Arendelle princesses no longer wear.)17. $1.264 Billion&nbsp;Beauty and the Beast (2017)  71%Domestic: $504 millionRelease date: March 17, 2017Speaking of Disney soundtracks, it was the 2017 live-action redo and not the Best Picture-nominated animated&nbsp;Beauty and the Beast&nbsp;from 1991 that really broke the bank and&nbsp;remains in&nbsp;the record books. Bill Condon’s version of the tale as old as 1991, starring Emma Watson, was not the first of Disney’s splashy re-imaginings,&nbsp;but it certainly was the most successful at the time, becoming the seventh film to cross a half-billion in North America and the 16th to pass three-quarters of a billion overseas.18. $1.243 Billion&nbsp;Incredibles 2 (2018)  93%Domestic: $608.6 millionRelease date: June 15, 2018Brad Bird’s The Incredibles debuted a full four years before the MCU began, a time when the Pixar brand was as close to a guarantee of success (and quality) as the industry had. Fourteen years later and deep into the superhero cinematic explosion, Bird’s sequel more than doubled the original’s box office and became the highest-grossing animated film ever at the domestic box office. It was the ninth film to cross the $600 million mark in North America and remains in the top 10 all-time earners domestically.Check out the latest&nbsp;Weekend Box Office Results19. $1.236 Billion&nbsp;The Fate of the Furious (2017)  67%Domestic: $226 millionRelease date: April 14, 2017A half-billion dollars was put into the production of the seventh and eighth chapters of this franchise and they made a combined $2.75 billion globally. F. Gary Gray’s film was a bit of a comedown from the highs of James Wan’s&nbsp;Furious 7. It even fell behind the sixth&nbsp;Furious&nbsp;film domestically, but did incredibly well abroad: it was the sixth&nbsp;film ever to make a cool billion outside the&nbsp;U.S. and Canada alone. Though&nbsp;still Fresh (67% on the Tomatometer), it was the lowest-scored Fast and Furious&nbsp;movie&nbsp;among critics since the fourth film.20. $1.215 Billion&nbsp;Iron Man 3 (2013)  79%Domestic: $409 millionRelease date: May 3, 2017The first Marvel film released following the massive success of Joss Whedon’s The Avengers was also the most successful of the individual Iron Man films. Robert Downey Jr.’s Kiss Kiss Bang Bang director, Shane Black, took over for Jon Favreau and put a twist on some comic-book lore in ways that still draws out disappointment from some fans. The general moviegoing public ate it up, though. Iron Man 3&nbsp;was&nbsp;just the 13th film to reach $400 million domestic in its initial run, and is the highest-grossing non-Avengers film in the MCU overseas with over $805 million. (And, if you are are keeping track, it is the 12th Disney property in the&nbsp;top 20.)21. $1.159 Billion&nbsp;Minions (2015)  55%Domestic: $336 millionRelease date: July 10, 2015After two successful Despicable Me&nbsp;films it was time to give Gru’s kooky supporting&nbsp;yellow folk their own story. Smart move.&nbsp;Minions&nbsp;had the&nbsp;largest opening for Illumination Entertainment ever, earning $115.7 million on its first weekend. Though it came up shy domestically of Despicable Me 2 ($336 million vs. $368 million) it can still boast the second-best overseas return for any animated film ($823.4 million), behind only Disney’s Frozen, and stands as the company’s biggest global success to date.22. $1.153 Billion&nbsp;Captain America: Civil War (2016)  90%Domestic: $408.1 millionRelease date: May 6, 2016It was not officially an Avengers film, but&nbsp;Civil War may as well have been. Thor and Hulk were AWOL, sure, but Spider-Man received his welcomed introduction into the MCU, as did&nbsp;Black Panther.&nbsp;The movie’s run kicked off with the fifth-highest opening in history, earning $179.1 million on opening weekend (that’s now the 11th-highest opening). Another $745 million internationally made this the fourth MCU film to reach $1 billion. Another fun fact: Anthony and Joe Russo are one of only two filmmakers/filmmaking pairs on this list to have three films in the&nbsp;top 5023. $1.148 Billion&nbsp;Aquaman (2018)  65%Domestic: $335.1 millionRelease date: December 21, 2018How could the DCEU get to $1 billion?&nbsp;Adding Batman into their Superman storyline couldn’t do it. Wonder Woman’s solid domestic numbers were nearly matched internationally, but even those figures came up short of Suicide Squad – and the goal.&nbsp;It&nbsp;would take&nbsp;Aquaman to crack the&nbsp;$1 billion mark for the DC Extended Universe. James Wan’s second billion-dollar film on the list may have had the second-smallest opening weekend of the Universe, but its prolonged success&nbsp;through the holiday season and beyond – the movie&nbsp;made nearly five-times its opening – was greater than any DC property since Tim Burton’s Batman in 1989.24. $1.142 Billion&nbsp;The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (2003)  93%Domestic: $377.8 millionRelease date: December 17, 2003Peter Jackson’s (first) epic trilogy unfolded over three straight holiday seasons and its finale was rewarded in every fashion:&nbsp;Return of the King&nbsp;historically won all 11 Oscars that it was nominated for, including Best Picture and Best Director;&nbsp;it was one of the best-reviewed films of the year (Certified Fresh at 93%);&nbsp;and&nbsp;it&nbsp;became the fourth-highest domestic grosser of all time behind just&nbsp;Titanic,&nbsp;The Phantom Menace,&nbsp;and Sam Raimi’s first&nbsp;Spider-Man&nbsp;film. It was no slacker overseas, either: When&nbsp;Return&nbsp;finished its run, only&nbsp;Titanic&nbsp;had a greater number outside of the U.S. and Canada.25. $1.132 Billion&nbsp;Spider-Man: Far From Home (2019)  90%Domestic: $390.5 millionRelease date: July 2, 2019No wonder Disney and Sony made up: 2019’s&nbsp;Spider-Man: Far From Home, which might have been the end of their association had they&nbsp;not moved past their impasse,&nbsp;is&nbsp;Sony’s highest-grossing film of all time. Six of the studio’s eight highest-grossing films ever have involved Spider-Man (or Venom), but this was the first Sony flick to cross the $1 billion&nbsp;line, and&nbsp;the ninth film in the MCU to do it. (Spider-Man appeared in four of the MCU’s other members of the $1 Billion Club). It was also the fifth stand-alone Spider-Man film (live-action or animated) to register at 90% or higher on the Tomatometer – critics love their web-slinger.26. $1.128 Billion&nbsp;Captain Marvel (2019)  79%Domestic: $426.8 millionRelease date: March 8, 2019After getting tag-teased at the end of&nbsp;Infinity War, Brie Larson’s Carol Danvers made her&nbsp;debut in the MCU as the universe’s first headlining female superhero in 2019’s&nbsp;Captain Marvel. Outgrossing DC’s&nbsp;Wonder Woman&nbsp;around the world and at home, the breakthrough film was&nbsp;embraced by critics&nbsp;(though its Certified Fresh score of 78% ranks 18th out of&nbsp;the MCU’s&nbsp;23 films). The space epic was only one of two films in 2018-19 to spend 10 straight weeks in the&nbsp;top 10 (the other being&nbsp;Black Panther), and was the seventh MCU film to reach $1 billion at the box office globally.27. $1.124 Billion&nbsp;Transformers: Dark of the Moon (2011)  35%Domestic: $352.4 millionRelease date: June 29, 2011The only Transformers sequel under the direction of Michael Bay to rank higher than 20% on the Tomatometer (a whopping 35%!) is not the series’ biggest domestic or international earner. But combined it remains the champion overall in worldwide gross (and bonus for the studio: it had one of the series’ lowest budgets). Only the final Harry Potter chapter could beat it in the summer of 2011, when they were the only films to&nbsp;pass $300 million domestic.28. $1.109 Billion&nbsp;Skyfall (2012)  92%Domestic: $304.4 millionRelease date: November 9, 2012The James Bond&nbsp;franchise got a boost with Pierce Brosnan and an even larger one with Daniel Craig. But there was no bigger boost to&nbsp;the long-running franchise than Craig’s Skyfall,&nbsp;the first film to cross $300 million domestically and $1 billion globally.&nbsp;A series that has existed for 50-plus years is going to get a little help from inflation –&nbsp;Goldfinger, Thunderball, and You Only Live Twice would have been $300 million grossers today – but we’re not doing inflation here. Skyfall&nbsp;was also a gold standard&nbsp;for Bond beyond the box office: It stands amongst the series’&nbsp;top five scores on the Tomatometer, Certified Fresh at 92%.29. $1.104 Billion&nbsp;Transformers: Age of Extinction (2014)  17%Domestic: $245.4 millionRelease date: June 27, 2014The Transformers series was beginning to show its age in North America in 2014, but around the world it was more popular than ever. Shia LaBeouf was replaced&nbsp;with Mark Wahlberg as the franchise’s central hero, and the fourth film from Michael Bay approached a near three-hour running time at 165 minutes. But even as it dipped below $300 million for the first time at home, its $858 million international haul was still the&nbsp;sixth-highest total&nbsp;for any movie outside the U.S. and Canada at the time. (It is now 16th.) Bay’s fifth film of the franchise, The Last Knight,&nbsp;fell 47% in overall domestic and nearly 45% internationally. At 18% on the Tomatometer,&nbsp;Age of Extinction has the lowest Tomatometer score of the&nbsp;top 50 biggest films at the worldwide box office.30. $1.081 Billion&nbsp;The Dark Knight Rises (2012)  87%Domestic: $448.1 millionRelease date: July 20, 2012The conclusion of Christopher Nolan’s Batman trilogy gave us Bane, Catwoman, and even a surprise along the way. By the end of that summer only four films had grossed more domestically in their initial runs than&nbsp;The Dark Knight Rises:&nbsp;Avatar, Titanic, The Dark Knight,&nbsp;and Marvel’s The Avengers, which was the only film to eclipse Rises&nbsp;in all of 2012. When all was said and done, Nolan’s trilogy had grossed over $2.46 billion worldwide.Check out the latest&nbsp;Weekend Box Office Results31. $1.074 billionJoker (2019)  68%Domestic: $335 millionRelease date:&nbsp;October 3, 2019The director of&nbsp;The Hangover&nbsp;films wanted to make an origin story out of Batman’s most infamous nemesis. The project was met with skepticism, and then it began a run on the festival circuit. Venice awarded the film its&nbsp;top prize in the Golden Lion; some&nbsp;critics were hailing it a masterpiece. Though its Tomatometer score is among the lower scores in the Top 50 (69%), Todd Phillips’&nbsp;Joker&nbsp;had the highest-opening ever in the month of October (passing the previous years’&nbsp;Venom) and ultimately became the&nbsp;highest-grossing film ever released in that month in North America, surpassing Alfonso Cuaron’s&nbsp;Gravity&nbsp;domestically. The film has just taken over&nbsp;Pirates of the Caribbean:&nbsp;On Stranger Tides,&nbsp;Jurassic Park,&nbsp;Finding Dory,&nbsp;The Phantom Menace,&nbsp;Aladdin, and&nbsp;Warner Bros’&nbsp;The Dark Knight&nbsp;on this list, and&nbsp;also earns a place as one of its&nbsp;most profitable films of all time.32. $1.073 Billion&nbsp;Toy Story 4 (2019)  97%Domestic: $433.9 millionRelease date: June 21, 2019When the fourth entry of Pixar’s signature series opened to “only” $120 million, many labeled it “a disappointment.”&nbsp;Some had expected&nbsp;Toy Story 4&nbsp;to have the studio’s biggest opening ever, and the film was then written off – by some – as part of a string of failed sequels in the summer of 2019. Well, Woody and the gang proved them all wrong. The movie went on to outgross the third film by over $12 million domestically. Even if it came up a bit short internationally, it still became the fourth billion-dollar grosser in Pixar’s history and their third-highest–grossing film overall.33. $1.073 Billion&nbsp;Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker (2019)  51%Domestic: $514.7 millionRelease date:&nbsp;December 20, 2019The final chapter of the Skywalker saga may have broken the trend set by the other third entries in the franchise’s trilogies (each outgrossed the middle episodes), but it will become record that we may never see broken again. During the week of January 12, 2020, it became the seventh&nbsp;film released by Disney in 2019 to break&nbsp;the $1 billion barrier – it reached that marker in 28 days, whereas&nbsp;The Last Jedi&nbsp;did it in less than three weeks. That will be remembered far longer than having the 12th-highest opening of all-time –&nbsp;The Force Awakens&nbsp;and&nbsp;The Last Jedi&nbsp;were numbers one and two until&nbsp;Avengers: Infinity War&nbsp;opened – or that it had one of the lowest Tomatometer scores among the nine films. Nevertheless, it puts a capper on a nine-episode series from 1977-2019 that grossed (with re-releases) a collective $8.71 billion.34. $1.067 Billion&nbsp;Toy Story 3 (2010)  98%Domestic: $415 millionRelease date: June 18, 2010We all assumed it was the end for Woody, Buzz, and all their toy friends – that bittersweet&nbsp;finish was just so perfect. The series would have gone out with a box-office bang, too. The first summer release for the Toy Story&nbsp;franchise&nbsp;turned into the first $100 million opening weekend for Pixar as well as&nbsp;the studio’s&nbsp;first $400 domestic tally and first worldwide haul of $1 billion. For almost two years it was the second-highest–grossing domestic release in Disney’s history; by 2019 it was 16th.35. $1.066 Billion&nbsp;Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest (2006)  53%Domestic: $423.3 millionRelease date: July 7, 2006Everyone mocked the concept of Disney turning one of their classic rides into a feature-length film. Well, some $300 million and an Oscar nomination for Johnny Depp’s portrayal of Captain Jack Sparrow later, we were looking at a franchise with a modicum of respect. At least, for a little while. Critics went from disdain for the concept before the first film was released to disdain for its epic-length and earnestness in the space of just two films,&nbsp;with the original movie’s score of 79% dropping to 53% on the Tomatometer for the sequel.&nbsp;But audiences went the other direction, giving Dead Man’s Chest&nbsp;a 38.6% boost in domestic&nbsp;earnings and an 84.2% boost internationally. It was Disney’s first $100-plus million opening ($135 million to be precise), and the studio has had 20 more since then. From 2006 until Toy Story 3 was released in 2010, Dead Man’s Chest&nbsp;was the highest-grossing domestic release in Disney’s history.36. $1.056 Billion&nbsp;Rogue One: A Star Wars Story (2016)  84%Domestic: $532.2 millionRelease date: December 16, 2016A year after J.J. Abrams launched the record-breaking continuation of George Lucas’ Skywalker saga, audiences were given a go-between tale to help fill in the gaps that led to the destruction of the first Death Star. The Magnificent Seven-like story was an instant favorite for some and an average side-trip for others. It became just the seventh film to clear a half-billion dollars in domestic box office. A nearly-equal international haul filled in the other half needed for Rogue One to join the $1 Billion Club,&nbsp;a goal that&nbsp;Solo: A Star Wars Story came up more than $600 million short of.37. $1.051 Billion&nbsp;Aladdin (2019)  57%Domestic: $355.6 millionRelease date: May 24, 2019Aladdin&nbsp;wasn’t always a sure bet:&nbsp;A blue Will Smith was mocked in early reveals of his Genie character and Tim Burton’s live-action&nbsp;Dumbo&nbsp;proved to be a bust just two months before Aladdin‘s release. But Guy Ritchie’s new version of the beloved 1992 animated film took advantage of other 2019 summer&nbsp;under-performers like&nbsp;Godzilla: King of the Monsters,&nbsp;Dark Phoenix,&nbsp;and&nbsp;Men In Black International,&nbsp;gobbling them all up and staying in the top five at the box office for seven straight weeks. Its international haul was only $70 million less than 2017’s&nbsp;Beauty and the Beast, and was even higher than several films above it on this list including&nbsp;Black Panther,&nbsp;Incredibles 2, and&nbsp;numbers 29-32.38. $1.046 Billion&nbsp;Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides (2011)  33%Domestic: $241.1 millionRelease date: May 20, 2011After Gore Verbinski’s Pirates trilogy grossed a combined $2.68 billion worldwide, Disney and Jerry Bruckheimer were not about to let the series sail into the sunset.&nbsp;The third film’s bloated length of 168 mins was roundly criticized (its Tomatometer score is just 45%),&nbsp;and this fourth film&nbsp;fared even worse with reviewers (33%), but it did the job at the box office. Domestic audiences showed up for the revamped outing with Jack Sparrow, just not in the expected droves, and a mammoth international total ($804.6 million)&nbsp;kept Stranger Tides&nbsp;in the record books.39. $1.035 Billion&nbsp;Despicable Me 3 (2017)  58%Domestic: $264.6 millionRelease date: June 30, 2017Though the third film in the Despicable Me&nbsp;franchise made just $13 million more than the original at the domestic box office, internationally the Despicable Me films had a 164% increase from the first film ($543.1 million) to the third ($1.035 billion). Released in 4,529 theaters, Gru’s third chapter did manage to have the largest launch in film history in North America until Avengers: Endgame came along. Four other films during the summer of 2019 also exceeded its one-time-record theater count.40. $1.032 Billion&nbsp;Jurassic Park (1993)  91%Domestic: $402.8 million (including re-releases)Release date: June 11, 1993Before James Cameron owned the top two spots in all-time domestic box office (for a period), it was Steven Spielberg who had pulled off that feat. His adaptation of Michael Crichton’s novel,&nbsp;Jurassic Park, was a return to the revered popcorn blockbusters he made his name on and it replaced the previous year’s&nbsp;Batman Returns&nbsp;as the top opener ever with $47 million and went on to gross over $357 million that summer.&nbsp;That was just a couple million dollars shy&nbsp;of his 1982 classic,&nbsp;E.T., but re-releases in 2-D and 3-D over the years have put the film over $400 million domestic and $1 billion worldwide.41. $1.029 Billion&nbsp;Finding Dory (2016)  94%Domestic: $486.3 millionRelease date: June 17, 2016Thirteen years after Finding Nemo became Pixar’s first $300 million domestic grosser and its biggest hit, the sequel focusing on Ellen Degeneres’ beloved memory-challenged sidekick reclaimed the throne, becoming again the animation house’s highest domestic grosser ever.&nbsp;The movie bested&nbsp;Toy Story 3 by over $71 million at home – even if it came up a bit short of that film internationally – and showed Pixar’s sequel business was really starting to thrive.42. $1.027 Billion&nbsp;Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace (1999)  52%Domestic: $474.5 million (including re-releases)Release date: May 19, 1999George Lucas returned to the director’s chair after&nbsp;more than two decades&nbsp;to give fans what they thought they wanted 16 years after the release of Return of the Jedi. Fans certainly turned over their money but many left with&nbsp;a sense of disappointment that would help taint the prequel trilogy for decades to come. Phantom Menace&nbsp;was the highest-grossing film domestically to earn a Rotten score&nbsp;55% (until 2019’s The Lion King came along). The $431 million earned in its initial run was enough to make it second only to Titanic all-time in North America; it took re-releases to push it over $1 billion globally. In 1999, it was the first film to clear $100 million in five days, beating the previous record holder,&nbsp;The Lost World: Jurassic Park, which earned&nbsp;$98.6 million in the same amount of time.43. $1.026 Billion&nbsp;Alice in Wonderland (2010)  51%Domestic: $334.2 millionRelease date: March 5, 2010Among the first five attempts Disney had made to bring its classic&nbsp;cartoons to life by 2010, Tim Burton’s Alice In Wonderland was by far the most successful. Its $116.1 million start was the sixth-largest movie opening ever at the time and the second-highest for Disney behind the second Pirates film. It was Burton’s seventh collaboration with Johnny Depp and the director has not had a film gross as much domestically in total as Alice made in its first three days since – not even with his attempt to replicate the success with Dumbo in 2019, which grossed a total of $114.7 million. But back in 2010, only Avatar, Titanic, and The Return of the King&nbsp;had made more money outside of North America than Alice did.44. $1.024 Billion&nbsp;Zootopia (2016)  98%Domestic: $341.3 millionRelease date: March 4, 2016To this day,&nbsp;Zootopia remains the second-highest–grossing animated Disney film not connected with Pixar. Since Frozen spent 16 straight weeks in the top 10, only three films have come as close, with 13 straight weeks in that top 10:&nbsp;Black Panther, La La Land, and yes,&nbsp;&nbsp;Zootopia. Its $682 million overseas is the sixth-best ever for an animated film, the second-best for any Disney animated film, Pixar or otherwise. Also, it is just one of four films on this list to receive a Tomatometer score of 97%.Check out the latest&nbsp;Weekend Box Office Results45. $1.017 Billion&nbsp;The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey (2012)  64%Domestic: $303 millionRelease date: December 14, 2012Almost a decade after wrapping up his landmark&nbsp;Lord of the Rings&nbsp;trilogy, Peter Jackson returned to the world of J.R.R. Tolkien to give audiences the Bilbo Baggins tale. A planned two-parter turned into a full-blown trilogy and critics were feeling the bloat: While Jackson’s&nbsp;Lord of the Rings films all scored over 90% on the Tomatometer, the Hobbit films never rose above 74%, with the first film right in the middle with 64%. Audiences were not tired just yet, though, even if this was the last of the Middle-earth series to hit $300 million domestic and $1 billion worldwide. On the glass-half-full side, Jackson’s first four Tolkien films grossed a combined $3.938 billion globally.46. $1.005 Billion&nbsp;The Dark Knight (2008)  94%Domestic: $535.2 millionRelease date: July 18, 2008The untimely passing of Heath Ledger in January 2008 was a gut punch, but it made anticipation for what would become his iconic, Oscar-winning portrayal of Batman’s arch-nemesis, the Joker, even more feverish. It was the central piece of what is considered one of the greatest comic-book films ever made. The movie’s $158 million opening weekend broke the previous record-holder, Spider-Man 3, by&nbsp;more than $7 million, and Dark Knight&nbsp;held the&nbsp;record for nearly three years to the day until the final Harry Potter chapter was released. The opening is still 17th all-time and the movie’s domestic total haul is the 12th-highest ever.47. $978.1 Million&nbsp;Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone (2001)  81%Domestic: $318 millionRelease date: November 16, 2001Four years after the publication of J.K. Rowling’s first Harry Potter book, Chris Columbus brought it to the big screen and its legions of fans turned up in record numbers. A $90.2 million opening weekend crushed the previous title holder from four years earlier, The Lost World: Jurassic Park, by over $18 million. The Sorcerer’s Stone‘s&nbsp;final domestic total ranked sixth all-time behind the initial runs of Titanic, The Phantom Menace, E.T., Jurassic Park, and Forrest Gump. That total remained the highest of the series until Deathly Hallows: Part 2&nbsp;in 2011.48. $976.9 Million&nbsp;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - Part 2 (2011)  96%Domestic: $296 millionRelease date:&nbsp;November 17, 2010If Quentin Tarantino could do it, why not Harry Potter? Warner Bros. tried to maximize their profits by splitting J.K. Rowling’s final book into two films. The first 150 minutes missed&nbsp;getting close to the $300&nbsp;million mark, perhaps as some fans figured they could catch up on home video just before&nbsp;Part 2&nbsp;hit theaters the following summer. Still, only five films had done better than its $125 million opening (The Dark Knight,&nbsp;Spider-Man 3,&nbsp;The Twilight Saga: New Moon,&nbsp;Dead Man’s Chest,&nbsp;Iron Man 2).&nbsp;The combined power of the&nbsp;Deathly Hallows&nbsp;resulted in $677.1 million domestic and $2.3 billion worldwide alone (but together.)49. $970.8 Million&nbsp;Despicable Me 2 (2013)  75%Domestic: $368.1 millionRelease date: July 3, 2013Despicable Me was a surprise hit in 2010,&nbsp;announcing the arrival of Illumination Entertainment as a major player in the animation game.&nbsp;So, after&nbsp;the losses of Hop and the decent success of Dr. Seuss’ The Lorax, the studio doubled down on their biggest&nbsp;hit and struck gold. Another $325,000 and the film would be&nbsp;its highest domestic grosser instead of The Secret Life of Pets, which, along with Minions, would follow Despicable Me 2&nbsp;with $100-plus million openings. By the end of that summer, the only animated film to have grossed more money worldwide was Toy Story 3. Also if you had guessed earlier that maybe Steven Spielberg or George Lucas were the other director/s – along with the Russo Bros. and their ilk – with a trifecta on this list, you would have been wrong, because the correct answer is Pierre Coffin, who directed (or co-directed) all three Despicable Me films, as well as Minions.50. $968.5 Million&nbsp;The Lion King (1994)  93%Domestic: $422.8 millionRelease date: June 15, 1994For 25 years, this film has remained relevant in pop culture through an acclaimed&nbsp;stage show, direct-to-video sequels, spinoffs, television series, and that mammoth re-imagination. The original Lion King&nbsp;was the second-highest–grossing film of 1994 behind Forrest Gump, which was – at the time – third only to&nbsp;the initial runs of E.T. and Jurassic Park at the all-time domestic box office. That made The Lion King the fourth highest-grossing film ever (not counting re-releases) and the number 1 domestic animated release of all time, a title it held for nine years until Finding Nemo.Like this?

That is increasingly becoming more interesting. From Danai Gurira’s fierce Okoye tossing her wig so that she can better fight the enemy in Black Panther to Gal Gadot’s Diana Prince not thinking twice about entering No Man’s Land in Wonder Woman (or just some sassy lip service from old Hollywood greats like Mae West and Katharine Hepburn), there are quite a few moments of women in film that make us say “f–k yeah.” So we rounded up a few of our favorites for this list.A+ innuendo in I'm No Angel (1933)  91%With her sultry purrs, swaying hips, and mastery of the double entendre, Mae West could easily take up 90-percent of the spots on this list. But the sheer moxie of her role in 1933’s I’m No Angel is an inspiration to us all. “When I’m good, I’m very good, but when I’m bad, I’m better,” she flaunts to Cary Grant’s wealthy Jack Clayton in director Wesley Ruggles’ salty romp. Here’s hoping&nbsp;HBO is still working on that biopic about West because the world needs her right now.Catching a lift in It Happened One Night (1934)  99%Never underestimate the cunning of a determined heiress. In this famous hitchhiking scene from director Frank Capra’s screwball comedy, Claudette Colbert’s headstrong Ellie Andrews shows Clark Gable’s washed-up reporter Peter Warne a much more effective way to stop traffic than the old waving thumb routine. The film – the first of three movies to win all of the five major Academy Awards – is adored by cinephiles and continues to be celebrated in current popular culture (perhaps you might remember it referenced in the modern-day cinematic classic, Sex and the City 2?).Putting your ex in his place in The Philadelphia Story (1940)  100%Many old Hollywood films suffer from the virgin vs. temptress depiction of women, but Katharine Hepburn was not typically one for such simplicities. This film was&nbsp;her first big hit and the one that cemented the public’s knowledge of her unmistakable&nbsp;mid-Atlantic accent. “Dexter, would you mind doing something for me? Get the heck out of here,” she demands as shuts down her ex-husband, played by Cary Grant, who is intruding upon the celebration for her upcoming second marriage. (Because this is a 1940 romantic comedy, he will also become her new husband by the time the credits roll.)Tell us how you really feel in Kiss Me Kate (1953)  91%This film adaptation of the Cole Porter play (itself an adaptation of William Shakespeare’s The Taming of the Shrew) was a celebration of female independence disguised as a cheery musical comedy. Take, for example, the bluntly titled solo “I Hate Men,” which is meant to represent one character’s complete and total side-eye to the concept of courtship. Lines like, “of all the types I’ve ever met within our democracy / I hate the most the athlete with his manner bold and brassy!” make it seem like not much has changed since the show hit Broadway in 1948 and then, eventually, theaters in 1953.Don’t judge a book by its cover in Gentlemen Prefer Blondes (1953)  98%Never judge a movie by its title and never underestimate the craftiness of a buxom bombshell. There are so many great moments in director Howard Hawks’ musical comedy, but we love the way that Marilyn Monroe’s showgirl, Lorelei Lee, doesn’t raise her voice an octave above her trademark whisper when she tells off her intended’s disrespectful father, who dismisses her as another gold-digger. “Don’t you know that a man being rich is like a girl being pretty?,” she says. “You wouldn’t marry a girl just because she’s pretty, but my goodness, doesn’t it help?” Well, we do all lose our charms in the end …Never bow down to tyrants in The King and I (1956)  96%It takes a lot of gumption to stand up to the King of Siam. After all, all you risk losing is a little self respect (and balance) if you agree to squat lower than his height whilst wearing a hoop skirt. But Anna (Deborah Kerr) did it, and she got through to the hard-headed monarch played by Yul Brynner. It eventually led to some pretty remarkable dancing and romance (with a clear understanding that this kind of thing can happen, of course).Empathy doesn’t mean “kiss me” in Funny Face (1957)  87%A #MeToo moment long before the hashtag went mainstream, Audrey Hepburn’s bookshop owner and budding philosopher Jo Stockton is quite clear that teaching Fred Astaire’s older fashion photographer, Dick Avery, about empathy doesn’t mean that she wants to be kissed – “by you or anyone else.” They do lock lips at the end of the Stanley Donen-directed film, but by then it’s a mutually agreed-upon action.A dance for independence in West Side Story (1961)  91%With a flash of fuchsia ruffles and some fancy footwork, Rita Moreno’s Anita and her gal pals offer a piece of hope during the dance number for Leonard Bernstein and Stephen Sondheim’s song “America” in directors Robert Wise and Jerome Robbins’ 1957 film adaptation of the popular musical. This moment isn’t just for immigrants to this country with dreams of success (or just having your own washing machine); it symbolizes the ability to stand up to the bothersome men who might be holding you back.Reveling in being a bad girl in Bonnie and Clyde (1967)  88%So much of the legacy of outlaw Bonnie Parker is tied up in Faye Dunaway’s Oscar-nominated depiction of her in director Arthur Penn’s 1967 film: A bored young girl from a nowhere town who jumps at a chance to break from the rulebook that fate set out for her — even if it means going whole hog into a life of crime. The way she taunts this power and revels in the danger of it by telling Michael J. Pollard’s C.W. Moss that “we rob banks” is so brazenly anti-heroine that it makes even the most stringent pearl-clutchers pause and consider adding some excitement to their lives.Enacting vigilante justice in Coffy (1973)  79%Maybe the world needs more vigilantes like Pam Grier’s eponymous crime fighter in writer-director Jack Hill’s 1973 blaxploitation film. A nurse who is sick of seeing her neighborhood (and, specifically, her own sister) destroyed by drug use, Coffy goes rogue to take down any and all responsible parties – especially the ones who double-cross her. Car-jacking, faking a drug-induced stupor, and the killing of corrupt cops ensue.Not quivering in the face of death in Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope (1977)  92%Carrie Fisher’s Leia Organa may be a princess, but she for sure isn’t a damsel waiting to be rescued. In the first few minutes alone of the 1977&nbsp;Star Wars movie, A New Hope, she acts quickly to hide the blue prints for the Death Star space station, is so over the threat of an uber-villain like Darth Vader, and mouths off to Grand Moff Tarkin (Peter Cushing), even though she seems headed for certain death. Luke Skywalker and Han Solo could never.Standing up for what’s right in Norma Rae (1979)  89%Sometimes all it takes is one woman who is willing to risk it all. Sally Field’s Oscar-winning turn in the role inspired by union activist Crystal Lee Sutton brought increased public attention to the need for safe and healthy working conditions. In the film’s stressful climax, we see her strongly and silently stand on her work table and hold up a sign with a single, solitary message: UNION. It works, even if she is hauled off to jail.Putting your pervy boss on blast in 9 to 5 (1980)  83%With&nbsp;all the workplace revenge fantasies about lecherous bosses that have been made, we really could just name director Colin Higgins’ seminal film and be done with it. But let’s concentrate on Dolly Parton’s fed-up Doralee Rhodes. Sick of being sexually harassed and gossiped about by her boss, Franklin Hart, Jr. (Dabney Coleman), she takes advantage of his current moment of immobility (he’s been kidnapped and tied up) to make him think she’s willing to change him from a “rooster to a hen in one shot” of her gun.Creating quite a headache in The Terminator (1984)  100%Apparently messing with fate is just asking to get your head squashed. By the end of director James Cameron’s first Terminator movie, Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) has embraced her inner badass and is ready to finish the job that resistance fighter Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn) was sent from the future to do: Take down the killer robot played by Arnold Schwarzenegger and save humankind. How does she do this when pipe bombs aren’t enough? Flattening its head in a hydraulic press and uttering one obvious-but-mighty catchphrase (“you’re terminated, f—er!”).Calling out women who don’t help other women in The Color Purple (1985)  81%There is so much pain and suffering in director Steven Spielberg’s 1985 period drama (and Alice Walker’s novel, which serves as its basis), but the idea of a woman encouraging a man to abuse another woman? That is squashed in one wrenching scene. “All my life I had to fight … but I ain’t never thought I’d have to fight in my own house!,” the hardened Sofia (Oprah Winfrey) challenges her step mother-in-law Celie (Whoopi Goldberg), who had herself become weak and submissive after a lifetime of abuse.Telling a boyfriend that you’re smart enough to do it on your own in The Last Dragon (1985)  58%There comes a time when a woman can no longer handle the put-downs and harassments; a moment when she (hopefully) dares to prove her naysayers wrong and that she can (and will) amount to something without them. For Angela Viracco (Faith Prince), that moment came when she accepted that her lousy, kidnapping crook of a boyfriend Eddie (Chris Murney) was more interested in his own ego than her feelings. She calls him a “misguided … asshole” before walking out for “elocution class.”Fighting a queen in Aliens (1986)  97%“Get away from her, you bitch!” The phrase that will be forever associated with Alien franchise star Sigourney Weaver also works for so many of us who have never had the pleasure of battling an alien queen while wearing an exo-suit (try it the next time you’re at a club, a grocery store, or a dog park when someone gets inappropriately close to your friend). To her credit, Weaver has said that she thinks she got the line in one take. You better just start dealing with it, Hudson.Defending your grouchiness in Steel Magnolias (1989)  68%Burned out by life and distrustful of everyone and everything? Shirley MacLaine’s Ouiser understands. At this point in director Herbert Ross’ 1989 film adaptation of Robert Harling’s play, Ouiser has zero qualms about telling Julia Roberts’ Shelby that, in no uncertain terms, she does not want to be fixed up with some seemingly kind-hearted widower. Don’t take it personally, though. As Ouiser says, “I’m not crazy. I’ve just been in a very bad mood for 40 years.”Having no time for street slang in Boyz n the Hood (1991)  94%Even though Murray (Donald Faison) would eventually school Dionne (Stacey Dash) about the cultural significance of street slang in Clueless, Regina King has zero time for the vernacular in her breakout role as Shalika in director John Singleton’s 1991 coming-of-age dramedy Boyz n the Hood. As she blatantly puts it during a party, she “ain’t no ho.” All the respect for my future Oscar winner.Being the purr-fect villainess in Batman Returns (1992)  80%Meow. The battle of wits between Batman (Michael Keaton) and the Penguin (Danny DeVito) was getting kind of droll before Michelle Pfeiffer’s Catwoman Simone Bileses her way into it in all her red-lipsticked glory. They would also soon learn that she’d turned the department store behind them into a powder keg (after lassoing guns out of the hands of two underpaid night security guards). Because that’s how you make an entrance.Fighting back in What's Love Got To Do With It? (1993)  97%Domestic abuse is so often a hidden crime, and it’s not something we should celebrate. But Tina Turner’s brave admittance of her own suffering (and Angela Bassett’s Oscar-nominated depiction of it in director Brian Gibson’s 1993 biopic) did wonders for mainstreaming a previously taboo topic. The scene where she fights in a limo, after so many people ignored her pain because of Ike Turner’s power, resonated with an unfortunate&nbsp;number of audience members.Taking a stab at the Final Girl trope in Scream (1996)  79%The ’90s ultimate Final Girl, played by Neve Campbell, finally puts an end to Billy (Skeet Ulrich) and Stu’s (Matthew Lillard) murder spree when she shoots the former square between the eyes. Warned that the killer always comes back, our heroine – who would go on to survive three more movies and a total of seven killers overall – pulls the trigger and declares, “Not in my movie.” Sidney Prescott: Breaking horror-movie rules since 1996.Declaring that no one owns you in The First Wives Club (1996)  50%Female empowerment sing-alongs are a trope in and of themselves. But a group of middle-aged women played by Bette Midler, Diane Keaton, and Goldie Hawn who have been wronged by love and life rocking out in three-part harmony to a Lesley Gore staple in matching white suits? Yes, we would very much like to be invited to that party. We promise not to tell them what to do, what to say, and we will certainly not put them on display.Saving humankind in The Fifth Element (1997)  71%In the future, combat is still clearly required to survive. Milla Jovovich’s Leeloo, a humanoid reconstructed by scientists in 2263 from remaining cells in a sarcophagus, isn’t always sure if she likes people and the harm that they’ve done to the planet, but she is quite good at protecting us – especially when the bad guys come at her. She also made a collection of ‘90s mall rats (well, me) want red hair and white midriff tops.Defying gender stereotypes in Mulan (1998)  86%Disney heroine Mulan (who is voiced by Ming-Na Wen) accomplishes quite a feat in directors Barry Cook and Tony Bancroft’s 1998 animated hit. Not only is she brave enough to masquerade as a man and enlist in the Chinese army in the name of sparing her father, a great warrior who is now in weakened health, but she and her trusty sidekicks are able to save the emperor from a bloody attack by the Huns – and get the entire city to put sexism aside and bow down to her.Defying the laws of physics in The Matrix (1999)  88%Before Gal Gadot’s Wonder Woman entered No Man’s Land or Jennifer Lawrence’s Katniss Everdeen braced for the Hunger Games arenas, Carrie-Anne Moss’ Trinity was bending the rules of time and space without breaking a sweat in her Latex for the Wachowskis’ cyber-punk dystopian thriller. She came with quite an introduction, after all. In the beginning few moments of the first Matrix, we see her sail onto rooftops, take down a fleet of police officers and stare death in the face as she gets out just in time. A role model to us all.Daring an adult to cross you in Election (1999)  92%It’s easy to hate Tracy Flick (Reese Witherspoon) in writer-director Alexander Payne’s 1999 adaptation of novelist Tom Perrotta’s political farce. She is a Type-A grating perfectionist and, chances are, she reminds you of some obnoxious overachiever who went to your high school. But she deserves her success and, in a spectacular art of verbal emasculation during one scene, you can see why: Matthew Broderick’s otherwise beloved high school teacher, Jim McAllister, thinks he’s cornered her into admitting she destroyed a rival candidate’s election campaign posters while implying that his true frustration with her is that she had an affair with his married, adult friend. Tracy goes on the attack and you instantly end up rooting for her.Putting it all out on the table in Erin Brockovich (2000)  84%Much of the beginning of director Steven Soderbergh’s 2000 biopic sets up why polite society should hate Julia Roberts’ Oscar-winning portrayal of the eponymous heroine. She’s got kids from different dads, has street smarts instead of framed diplomas, and used to be a beauty queen (“Oh, the horror!” to all of the above). But Erin’s able to get answers that others can’t by playing up her other, ahem, assets. “They’re called boobs, Ed,” she smirks when her boss (Albert Finney) asks how she acquired such necessary and privileged information.Testing your skills&nbsp;in Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon (2001)  97%Even if martial arts isn’t your thing, it’s hard not to ignore the beauty in director Ang Lee’s Oscar-winning film. The 2000 movie is also a feminist mantra, as it concentrates on fighting techniques traditionally employed by women. No matter if you’re rooting for Michelle Yeoh’s skilled warrior or Zhang Ziyi’s governor’s daughter who secretly trained in the art of Wudang fighting, it is empowering to see them duel&nbsp;each other in one of the most thrilling sequences of the film, as it demonstrates exactly how deadly each of these ladies is.Dragging racers in The Fast and the Furious (2001)  53%Does Michelle Rodriguez’s Letty really look like someone who isn’t prepared to burn rubber in a drag race? Nope. And the opposing driver should have heeded her advice to “hit Hollywood Boulevard” if he was looking for a hook-up. All she was willing to offer him was an “adrenaline rush” and a chance to lose a chunk of change. She made good on both of those.Making a permanent mark on the legal profession in Legally Blonde (2001)  70%Reese Witherspoon’s pink-partial Elle Woods showed that one could care about the law and time-consuming hair and beauty regimens in director Robert Luketic’s brightly-colored comedy. All she had to do to get her client (Ali Larter) off the hook for murdering her husband is prove that the prosecution’s star witness’s alibi that she wasn’t around to see the gun go off was a bit frizzy at the ends (perms take a couple days without shampooing to set, don’t ya know?).Taking on an army of assassins in Kill Bill: Volume 1 (2003)  85%It’s complicated to watch the Kill Bill movies now, in the wake of star Uma Thurman’s allegations that Quentin Tarantino mistreated her on set. But, the writer-director’s 2003 ode to martial arts films still has a message about a woman’s revenge plot to take down her former colleagues and mentor/boss. The climax in the first movie happens after she murders a nemesis’ young protégé (after begging the girl to leave her be) and involves the epic, bloody slaying of a menagerie of swordfighters and knife throwers in suits. Hell hath no fury …Protecting those who can’t protect themselves in Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (2004)  90%While condoning violence should not be encouraged, it’s easy to understand why Hermione Granger (Emma Watson) felt the need to punch the “foul, loathsome, evil little cockroach” Draco Malfoy (Tom Felton) in the nose. The sniveling little rich brat had it coming; he’d just got an innocent hippogriff sentenced to death because he’d lied to his powerful father about why the animal attacked him.Cooking with fire&nbsp;in Hellboy (2004)  81%It’s not difficult to be badass when you possess the ability to control blue fire, and Selma Blair’s Liz Sherman from the&nbsp;Hellboy films proved more than once that she was a force to be reckoned with. Sure, she came close to burning down a hospital (not her fault, really), but who comes to Hellboy’s aid when he’s being overwhelmed by demon pups? Liz flames on and incinerates the beasties — and fries a few demon eggs in the process — proving that behind every good man (or Hellboy), there’s an equally good woman.Beating the system in The Hunger Games (2012)  84%The only true way to survive The Hunger Games’ eponymous cruel, futuristic gladiator arenas isn’t to kill a bunch of other teenagers – it’s to outsmart the people who forced you into them and then changed the rules at will so that the odds were never going to be in your favor. When killing her ally (and budding crush) Peeta (Josh Hutcherson) seems to be the only option for survival, Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) bets big and pivots to suggest a double suicide pact on national television. It works, and they’re safe – for a while.Defending yourself in Brave (2012)  78%Who says a princess has to have a suitor? Tearing her constricting dress, Merida (voiced by Kelly Macdonald) shows she’s a better shot than all of the “eligible” bachelors fighting for her hand in an archery contest. Much like her bouncy red curls that flow in all their glory, this medieval Scottish princess from directors Mark Andrews and Brenda Chapman’s 2012 animated Disney film cannot be contained.Unleashing your primal roar in Beasts of the Southern Wild (2012)  86%Sometimes the pressure is too much and you have to roar with all your might. This is especially true if you’re a little girl in the Louisiana bayou and you desperately want to please your father. Quvenzhané Wallis received an Oscar nomination for playing Hushpuppy, the six-year-old who is mighty enough to find her own means of survival as her world crumbles around her in director Benh Zeitlin’s 2012 drama.Taking a&nbsp; car chase up a notch in Mad Max: Fury Road (2015)  97%It’s one thing to kill your deranged, megalomaniac captor. It’s quite another to do it during a dusty, gritty car chase in a post-apocalyptic action film, like director George Miller’s 2015 OScar-winner. Here, Charlize Theron’s Imperator Furiosa finally destroys Hugh Keays-Byrne’s Immortan Joe after his years of abuse and horrendous crimes on her community, particularly the five women he’s kept for “breeding.”Being unafraid to talk about delicate matters in Hidden Figures (2017)  93%Katherine Johnson (Taraji P. Henson) was one of the smartest mathematicians at NASA. She knew she had to choose her words carefully when her boss, Kevin Costner’s Al Harrison, asked her why she kept disappearing during her shift in front of co-workers who didn’t really trust her that much already. The answer to her problem was a simple enough one; she just needed someone else to solve it – in the still-segregated building, she needed a lavatory she was allowed to use to be near her office. And she got it.Telling your boss to f-off in The Shape of Water (2017)  92%Timid-seeming Elisa (Sally Hawkins) gets “moments” aplenty in Guillermo del Toro’s Oscar-winning The Shape Of Water: a gorgeous dance sequence, a wonderfully matter-of-fact masturbation scene, a dreamy underwater awakening. But the one that had audiences cheering – and still does – is the scene in which she tells Michael Shannon’s cartoonishly awful Colonel Strickland “F–k you” in sign language.Rethinking your workwear in Atomic Blonde (2017)  78%As Charlize Theron’s MI6 field agent Lorraine Broughton deadpans to her interrogators in a debriefing, if she knew she’d be walking into a police ambush when she searched their dead colleague’s apartment, she would have “worn a different outfit.” Instead, she takes on a group of thugs like a real-life game of Whac-A-Mole – if, of course, that arcade game was traditionally played in over-the-knee black boots, a miniskirt, and a white trench coat.Deciding who you can trust in Star Wars: The Last Jedi (2017)  90%It isn’t so much that Daisy Ridley’s Rey is able to hold her own in a fight with armed guards after Adam Driver’s Kylo Ren chooses her over his master, Supreme Leader Snoke (Andy Serkis). Everyone knew that was coming. It’s when she realizes that Kylo still hasn’t come back to the light side of the Force and they battle for Anakin Skywalker’s lightsaber so hard that it splits in two that things really get interesting.Taking sibling rivalry to the next level in Thor: Ragnarok (2017)  93%Sometimes you want to emphasize with the villain – especially when she’s played with such vindictiveness as Cate Blanchett plays Thor’s big sister, Hela. And like so many other older siblings, she took away her brother’s favorite toy (his hammer!) when he refused to obey her. Sorry, Thor (Chris Hemsworth). You can’t win them all. But at least you still have chiseled arms and pretty blonde hair.Taking bullets for the team in Wonder Woman (2017)  93%Well, they did call it No Man’s Land. Gal Gadot’s Diana Prince doesn’t care that soldiers haven’t been able to get the Germans to retreat from this bloody war zone. She only cares that people are suffering and they need her help. The scene, which some called the best superhero moment of the year when director Patty Jenkins’ film came out in 2017, showed a fearless, determined heroine&nbsp;courageously throw herself into battle in the name of protecting the innocent.Having no time for Western beauty standards in Black Panther (2018)  96%Danai Gurira’s Okoye can fight in an evening gown, but in a major act of toppling the patriarchy she feels more comfortable going into battle without her wig. This no-nonsense moment is both practical (why hold onto anything that’s a liability when things are about to get real?) and also an educational tool to teach mass audiences a lesson about Black womens’ hair.Banding together in Avengers: Infinity War (2018)  85%Because one female superhero is great but three is even better, there’s this moment of comradery in Anthony and Joe Russo’s 2018 comic-book film: Danai Gurira’s Okoye had just gotten used to fighting with Scarlett Johansson’s Black Widow when Elizabeth Olsen’s Scarlet Witch descended from the skies to help them finish the fight. Okoye does ask an important question, though: “Why was she up there all this time?”Not throwing away your shot in The Favourite (2018)  93%Want to prove your loyalty? Then don’t allude to the things better left unsaid. Emma Stone’s Abigail learned this lesson well when she attempted to bond with her cousin, Sarah (Rachel Weisz) over some casual bird shooting in the lawn belonging to their mistress, Olivia Colman’s Queen Anne. Given Sarah’s not-so-veiled threats, perhaps Abigail should have waited to have this conversation at a place where firearms weren’t involved.Mastering the rules of the game in Crazy Rich Asians (2018)  91%The clacking of the mahjong tiles. The two random ladies who don’t appear to speak English. The unflinching courage of Constance Wu’s economics professor Rachel Chu in the face of her most fearsome adversary: Michelle Yeoh’s Eleanor Young, the stoic mother of her love, Nick (Henry Golding). This battle of wits at the end of director John M. Chu’s smash 2018 rom-com, Crazy Rich Asians, displays so much deep-seated aggression. But if you think this is about which side Henry will choose, you’re only seeing half the picture.Readying to make some noise in A Quiet Place (2018)  96%Lock and load. By the end of director John Krasinski’s 2018 horror film, Emily Blunt’s Evelyn Abbott has lost her husband, given birth in a tub as monsters stalked her, and just watched her deaf daughter’s hearing aid make another monster explode while also sending out the signal for more of them to come. No wonder she’s ready to take charge and survive.Having no mercy in Alita: Battle Angel (2019)  61%In this futuristic dystopia, there’s no room for love or mercy when you’re a Hunter-Warrior (or bounty hunter). So why should cyborg Alita (Rosa Salazar) show mercy to Jackie Earle Haley’s nefarious Grewishka when she finally gets the upper hand after he sliced up her body? As she tells him in director Robert Rodriguez’s 2019 action thriller, “F–k your mercy.”Like this?

SXSW or just “South By”) has grown to become one of the most celebrated pop culture events in the world, with its unparalleled mix of music, film, and digital media. It’s one of the best places to scope out both established artists and rising talents, as well as all kinds of innovations in interactive entertainment.In other words, it should be no surprise that some heavy hitters have graced the stages and screens in Austin, TX, and this is especially true of the film division. In the past 21 years, SXSW has served as the proving ground for up-and-coming filmmakers hoping to make a big splash, and it’s also played a big role in hyping up eventual cult classics and box office hits. With that in mind, and with SXSW 2019 kicking off this weekend, we decided to look back at some of the most memorable movie premieres that have happened at the festival during RT’s existence. Read on for a trip down memory lane at South By.Shotgun Freeway (1995) : A Documentary Hero&nbsp;Takes His First StepsDirector Morgan Neville didn’t even know that SXSW had a film festival component when he was looking to premiere his first documentary, a sometimes breezy and wistful look at an evolving Los Angeles through the lens of the people who shaped it. Variety’s review of the premiere decried the film’s listlessness and its “graceless and too abrupt” editing, the latter of which actually tapped into the associative, nonlinear style that would set Neville’s unorthodox documentarian work apart from the pack. Neville remembers the premiere as “low key” and intimate, surrounded by fellow “neophyte filmmakers” showing their wares. Shotgun Freeway was named runner up for Best Documentary Feature that year, and Neville would go on to win an Oscar (for&nbsp;20 Feet from Stardom)&nbsp;and an Emmy (for&nbsp;Best of Enemies) and then break box office records with his film Won’t You Be My Neighbor?.Four Letter Words (2000) : Director Sean Baker Makes His MarkSean Baker’s first feature followed a group of white suburban young men in a slice-of-life tale, showing the blunt inner workings of the male psyche. It’s not surprising that the town that embraced Slacker fell in love with Baker and his objective, almost journalistic film work. As Baker told SXSW World: “I might not have kept going if it wasn’t for SXSW.” Reviews for the low-budget gem weren’t necessarily glowing, but they hit on Baker’s strength of presenting a character’s world with honesty, a trait he would carry on as he delved into the lives of disparate women in the San Fernando Valley (Starlet), Chinese immigrants in New York (Take Out), a trans sex worker in L.A. (Tangerine),&nbsp;and single moms in Kissimmee (The Florida Project).(Photo by Thinkfilm courtesy Everett Collection)Spellbound (2002)  97%: A Documentary D-E-L-I-G-H-T&nbsp;(And Awards Contender)Director Jeffrey Blitz wasn’t even present for the first SXSW screening of his spelling bee documentary. Nervous, he’d taken a flight out from a commercial job and arrived outside the theater just as it was letting out. He told SXSW World: “I heard [people] raving about this spelling bee documentary they had just seen,” and thought it was a prank. Blitz’s first feature, Spellbound won the Documentary Feature Jury Award and became the festival’s first breakout hit, winning an Emmy and getting nominated for an Academy Award.Hellboy (2004)  81%: GDT Earns Thunderous Applause,&nbsp;Cements&nbsp;SXSW’s Midnight CredGuillermo del Toro had already directed cult classics Cronos, The Devil’s Backbone, and Blade II before he took aim at the film adaptation of Mike Mignola’s Hellboy comic. The unofficial midnight world premiere of the film brought del Toro, Mignola, and star Ron Perlman to Austin, and the ending credits were met with what the Austin Chronicle called “thunderous cheers.” The film became a box office success, grossing nearly $100 million and spawning a sequel, but it also sealed SXSW as a midnights-friendly destination.The Puffy Chair (2005)  77%: Enter the Duplass Bros.&nbsp;It’s difficult to overstate the impact the Duplass brothers had on both filmmaking and the film culture of SXSW. The Puffy Chair would mark their first feature, but the pair had already premiered a few of their shorts at the fest, creating a kind of community with like-minded filmmakers like Joe Swanberg and Andrew Bujalski, who premiered Kissing on the Mouth and Mutual Appreciation, respectively, alongside The Puffy Chair. From this year forward, SXSW was known as the place for Mumblecore, and the Duplass brothers would go on to bring their style to the mainstream.The Comedians of Comedy (2005)  44%: Open Mic Night With A Generation’s Defining ComicsFilm festivals haven’t always been receptive to comedy, especially if the film is a documentary about lesser-known comics popular only on the alt-comedy circuits. But director Michael Blieden found a home for his debut documentary feature with SXSW and brought Patton Oswalt, Zach Galifianakis, Maria Bamford, and Brian Posehn to the masses of Austin with a premiere that included live stand-up sets by the film’s subjects. The Austin Chronicle called the film “incisively bawdy,” and the well-received live performance set the stage for the massive influx of comedy acts that would flock to the festival every year. Oswalt, Galifianakis, Bamford, and Posehn became some of the defining comics of their generation.(Photo by Universal Pictures courtesy Everett Collection)Knocked Up (2007)  89%:&nbsp;Apatow Finds His Testing GroundJudd Apatow raked in the praise for his directorial debut, The 40-Year-Old Virgin, but the idea of a comedy with a runtime more than two hours long was still a novelty when his follow-up Knocked Up tested the waters in Austin at a sneak preview. Variety called it “uproarious,” and attendees noted the laughter was so loud in the theater that a good number of the punchlines couldn’t even be heard. Viewers of that preview wondered whether Paramount would cut the film down to under 90 minutes — nope! SXSW became Apatow’s proving ground that longer, more thoughtful comedy could play to wide audiences.Nights and Weekends (2008)  85%: Greta Gerwig Makes Her Directing DebutWith a budget of $15,000, Mumblecore comedy Nights and Weekends brought Joe Swanberg back to SXSW, but this time with a relatively unknown co-director/co-writer/co-star — Greta Gerwig. Swanberg and Gerwig had collaborated before on 2007’s Hannah Takes the Stairs, but this film would mark Gerwig’s directorial debut. Noel Murray at the AV Club said, “Swanberg and Gerwig also have a gift for constructing the kind of moments rarely seen in contemporary American independent film.” Gerwig had always intended to become a playwright, and though it would be another nine years before she would direct again (Lady Bird), that effort would earn her Oscar nominations for Best Original Screenplay and Best Director.Medicine for Melancholy (2008)  84%: Barry Jenkins, Before&nbsp;MoonlightSXSW was no stranger to the type of romantic verité filmmaking Austinite Richard Linklater revived from the Left Bank French New Wave with Before Sunrise. But Barry Jenkins’&nbsp;Medicine for Melancholy pried the genre from white hands and showed two African American characters talking from dawn ’til dusk about art, culture, and love. The film starred the unknown Wyatt Cenac and Tracey Heggins, but the buzz out of SXSW was enough to propel Medicine to multiple Indie Spirit Awards nominations, inspiring a generation of black filmmakers, including Justin Simien, Lena Waithe, Ava DuVernay, and Terence Nance.Tiny Furniture (2010)  80%: Lena Dunham Follows Up on the PromiseLena Dunham’s hour-long feature debut Creative Nonfiction showed so much promise at 2008’s SXSW that when she returned in 2010 with a proper full-length feature, Tiny Furniture, critics were already hip to the wünderkind’s comic sensibilities. The film took the top narrative feature prize, with Dunham accepting a breakout award for women directors, leading IFC Films to acquire and distribute Tiny Furniture. Dunham’s relationship with SXSW continues, and the fest has become a destination for young female auteurs, including Julia Hart, Stella Meghie, and Nijla Mu’min.(Photo by Liam Daniel/Screen Gems courtesy Everett Collection)Attack the Block (2011)  90%: Joe Cornish Earns Peter Jackson ComparisonsBy the time Joe Cornish premiered his feature debut, Attack the Block, SXSW programming had already become known for its Midnights section. Fans of director Edgar Wright knew the Shaun of the Dead helmer had executive produced for Cornish and packed the theater in anticipation of a Wright-anointed genre film, but the general reception was that Attack was so much better than they could even hope for. Writing for Cinemablend, Matt Patches called the film a throwback to early Peter Jackson and said audiences emitted an “audible, pleasantly shocked yelp” throughout the gory action sequences.Undefeated (2012)  96%: An Oscar Winner Starts Its JourneyDan Lindsay and TJ Martin knew they were “no-name directors” when they applied to SXSW with their documentary debut about a struggling Memphis football team. The Austin Chronicle said, “Undefeated&nbsp;isn’t just a great sports doc, it’s a great documentary. Period.” The directors credit the festival with helping the film sell for a seven-figure deal after an all-night auction, get distribution, and earn widespread acclaim, leading to their winning the Academy Award for Best Documentary. “That definitely changed our lives, and it all started at SXSW,” Lindsay and Martin told SXSW World.Bridesmaids (2011)  90%:&nbsp;A Work in Progress Works WondersPaul Feig had already made a name for himself acting in and directing numerous comedies, but when he brought his work-in-progress Bridesmaids to SXSW for a midnight premiere, he says not a single person in the audience knew anything about the film. On top of that, Kristen Wiig and Maya Rudolph weren’t completely known outside of their individual runs on SNL. But Feig said to SXSW World that when the audience burst into laughter that “it was possibly the greatest night of my career.” Bridesmaids introduced audiences to superstar Melissa McCarthy and raked in a whopping $288 million at the box office.Spring Breakers (2013)  67%: A24 Makes a Big Play&nbsp;&nbsp;At the SXSW world premiere of Harmony Korine’s teen day-glo crime thriller, only a few audience members squeamish from the provocateur’s film walked out, but those who stayed raucously applauded such an audacious movie. At the same time, fledgling distribution company A24 was trying to make a name for itself and saw the perfect opportunity in Korine. They purchased the film right out of the festival, marking themselves as a company to take a chance on artists and weirdos and bolstering SXSW as a destination for film acquisitions.(Photo by Cinedigm courtesy Everett Collection)Short Term 12 (2013)  98%: The Stars of Tomorrow in a Move That Sets the New StandardDirector Destin Daniel Cretton specifically aimed to finish his feature about a young staff worker in a residential treatment facility for the SXSW deadlines. Producer Asher Goldstein said it felt like the perfect “cultural fit” for this story about simple people trying to live their lives, starring a cast of complete then-unknowns, including Brie Larson, Stephanie Beatriz, Rami Malek, and Lakeith Stanfield. Before the film even premiered at SXSW, sales negotiations began, signaling Short Term 12 was something special. It won both the Grand Jury and Audience Award for Narrative Feature, and prompted The Atlantic in 2014 to ask “Who’s This Year’s Short Term 12?” at SXSW.The Invitation (2016)  89%: Karyn Kusama’s Thrilling ComebackDirector Karyn Kusama stripped her style down to its indie roots for her horror-thriller The Invitation. She’d faced an uphill battle with high-budget flops, like Aeon Flux and Jennifer’s Body, but burst back on the scene and out of director jail with a psychological stunner she filmed on a bare budget in a single location. Midnighter attendees of the premiere immediately buzzed about the film, with Justin Chang, writing for Variety, calling it a “perfectly pitched exercise in psychological dread.” The Invitation hit many best-of lists when it premiered theatrically, but Kusama credits SXSW with the relaunch of her career. “SXSW means discovery, it means surprise, and it means a jolt of energy, which was there in abundance for us,” she told SXSW World.Krisha (2016)  95%: Why You Stay for the Q&amp;ATrey Edward Shults’ short film Krisha won big at SXSW 2014. When he stretched that drama — about a woman who reconnects with her family over a disastrous Thanksgiving weekend — into a feature, Shults naturally wanted it to premiere at SXSW as well. For the Q&amp;A portion, Shults brought his stars, his real-life aunt Krisha Fairchild and mother Robyn Fairchild, for an intimate talk about family and filmmaking. “I’ve been a professional actor my whole life, but I had no ambition,” Krisha said, before crediting her nephew for sparking a creative flame in her. The film won the Grand Jury Prize for Narrative Filmmaking, and the audience went wild when Shults’ entire cast/family stormed the stage.Tower (2016)  99%: A Tense, Moving Hometown AchievementKeith Maitland is an Austin director whose films revolve around the people, places, and major events of Texas. His documentary Tower was based on a&nbsp;Texas Monthly story from Pamela Colloff, which walked people through the terrifying 96-minute ordeal of Charles Whitman climbing the UT Austin tower and opening fire on a campus of innocent people. The SXSW premiere was an emotional affair, with Eric Kohn of IndieWire saying that Tower “imbues the catastrophe with renewed urgency.” The film won both the Grand Jury Prize and Audience Award for Documentary Feature, and Maitland told SXSW World that “sharing this deeply emotional story here, where it happened, was one of the most cathartic cinematic experiences I’ve ever witnessed.”(Photo by Steve Dietl/Warner Bros.)Keanu (2016)  78%: Key and Peele Meet ExpectationsBefore there was&nbsp;Get Out, there was Peter Atencio’s crime comedy&nbsp;Keanu, co-written by Alex Rubens and Jordan Peele in his feature-writing debut. Some fans of the stars’ Comedy Central show&nbsp;Key &amp; Peele&nbsp;waited in line for three hours for the midnight premiere, and&nbsp;Peele and Keegan-Michael Key began throwing out stuffed cats to an audience dreading a time change and an hour lost the next morning. The reception to the film was only warm, but it was enough to propel Peele into writing his next feature, which would earn him an Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay.Most Beautiful Island (2017)  93%:&nbsp;An Ending for the Ages&nbsp;Ana Asencio’s gritty, spare, 80-minute thriller marked a wicked debut for the writer-director-producer-star, who’d spent a decade perfecting the script. And SXSW proved a perfect match for a 16 mm film about an immigrant woman caught in the most tragic day of her life. At the premiere, audiences gasped, shook by tension and an unnerving ending. Peter Goldwyn of Samuel Goldwyn Films snapped up the rights and said, “Most Beautiful Island is a memorable film, which captured hearts, minds, and the Grand Jury Prize at SXSW,” and although Asencio hasn’t released a follow-up yet, that ending she wrote earned a place on Vulture’s “100 Scares That Shaped Horror.”A Quiet Place (2018)  96%: Silence on Screen, Screams in the Theater as Box Office Monster Is BornJohn Krasinski’s horror debut earned what&nbsp;Variety writer&nbsp;Ramin Setoodeh called “enough shrieks inside the theater to please [the] director” at the film’s SXSW premiere. As Setoodeh pointed out, SXSW had become a proving ground for out-of-the-box studio releases, and the fanfare inside the theater that night signaled to Paramount Pictures they’d have a hit on their hands. Eric Kohn of IndieWire wrote that “the movie maintains a minimalist dread throughout, with every footstep or sudden move carrying the potential for instant death.” A Quiet Place went on to earn $340 million at the box office, making SXSW a reliable litmus test yet again.Like this?

Nelson), some of Hollywood’s funniest fellows trying to touch one another without permission (Tag, starring&nbsp;Ed Helms,&nbsp;Jeremy Renner, and Jon Hamm), and a remade blast from the blaxploitation past (Superfly, starring Trevor Jackson&nbsp;and Jason Mitchell).&nbsp;What are the critics saying?Incredibles 2 (2018)  93%If you’re going to try and follow up an acclaimed blockbuster, you might as well take your time getting the sequel right — and in animation, where time can stand still forever, you have the added benefit of not needing to rush your cast back in front of the camera. Still, after waiting nearly 15 years for a second installment of The Incredibles, fans can be forgiven a certain amount of impatience; while the creative teams at formerly franchise-averse Pixar dreamed up new stories for the characters in Toy Story, Cars, Finding Nemo, and Monsters Inc., the ability to return to theaters continued to elude the superpowered Parr family. All that waiting has finally paid off with Incredibles 2, which reunites the original voice cast for a new adventure serving up more of the domestic turmoil, superhero satire, and brilliantly animated action that made the first one such a hit. It’d be tough to improve on the original Incredibles, and critics say that while this sequel doesn’t quite pull off that feat, it comes impressively close, adding yet another acclaimed entry to Pixar’s already estimable filmography. If you were a kid when The Incredibles&nbsp;came out, you might have kids of your own now — and like all the best stuff the studio has put out, the whole family can look forward to enjoying Incredibles 2.Tag (2018)  56%On one hand, it’s easy to believe Hollywood has long since exhausted most of the reasonable possibilities for comedy that exist in movies about grown men acting like boys. On the other, when you’ve got the Wall Street Journal writing about a real-life group of guys who take a month off every year to continue the game of tag they’ve been playing since they were kids, well, it’s awfully hard to resist the temptation to turn that into a film. Enter the descriptively titled Tag, starring Hannibal Buress, Jon Hamm, Ed Helms, Jake Johnson, and Jeremy Renner as the fellows in question — a talented bunch whose commitment to the story was reflected in the set injury Renner sustained, breaking both of his arms and necessitating some last-minute CGI limb replacements in post-production. It would be wonderful to report that Renner’s suffering came in service of one of the year’s best-reviewed action comedies; alas, the truth is that critics are kinda meh on Tag, which reviews describe as funny and engaging in fits and starts, but ultimately not consistent or committed enough to fully deliver on its premise. Still, this is one talented cast, and even the critical pans say the movie isn’t without its moments, so if you’re in the mood for some arrested development laughs, you may want to check your local listings.Superfly (2018)  51%Released in 1972, the original Superfly&nbsp;helped lead the blaxploitation wave with a thoughtful Harlem-set drama about a drug dealer looking for one last big score; the movie’s trappings may look somewhat dated today, but thanks to Ron O’Neal‘s performance as main character Youngblood Priest — not to mention a killer Curtis Mayfield soundtrack — it still feels fresh. It’s easy to understand why music video veteran Director X wanted to take a shot at updating the story, and its themes are just as relevant as they were more than 45 years ago; unfortunately, critics say those themes have mostly been lost in this new version, which is far more focused on style than substance. Starring Trevor Jackson as Priest, the 2018 edition moves the action to Atlanta, but the basic contours of the story remain the same — which is part of why a number of reviews have outlined pundits’ disappointment with the lost social subtext. This Superfly&nbsp;will make its fortune by and by, thanks to Director X’s way with an artfully arranged scene or set piece, but as is so often the case with remakes, the original still reigns supreme.What’s New on TVThe Bold Type: Season 2 (2018)  100%The Bold Type presents an aspirational yet refreshingly realistic portrait of young women’s careers, friendships and love lives in a big city.Strange Angel: Season 1 (2018)  71%A beautiful slow burn, Strange Angel shoots for the stars, but gets a little lost in its own orbit.Also&nbsp;Opening This Week In Limited Release Eating Animals (2018) , a documentary about the commercial factory farming industry and its various impacts, is at 100%. A Skin So Soft (Ta peau si lisse) (2018) , a documentary look at the lives and gym habits of six bodybuilders, is at 100%. The Year of Spectacular Men (2018) , a coming of age drama directed by Lea Thompson and starring her daughters Zoey and Madelyn Deutch (the latter of whom wrote the screenplay), is at 80%. Gabriel and the Mountain (Gabriel e a montanha) (2018) , about a young man who sets out to travel the world before beginning college, is at 75%. Five Seasons: The Gardens Of Piet Oudolf (2018) , a documentary about the aesthetics and public works of the titular plantsman, is at 71%. The Yellow Birds (2018) , an Iraq War drama led by Alden Ehrenreich and Tye Sheridan, is at 44%. Loving Pablo (2018) , starring Javier Bardem and Penélope Cruz in a biopic about the love between drug kingpin Pablo Escobar and journalist Virginia Vallejo, is at 35%.

So Far!From Thanos's first appearance and the Avengers' first team-up to a heartbreaking dusting and a grand, boozy arrival, these 21 moments have defined the Marvel Cinematic Universe.by Erik Amaya | April 22, 2019 |  CommentsIn 2019, Rotten Tomatoes turns 21, and to mark the occasion we’re celebrating with a series of features that look back at the brightest moments on screen of the past two decades – and one year – and the things that have us excited for the future.The Marvel Cinematic Universe has redefined the way viewers approach big budget, tentpole releases. Smartly adapting a philosophy which worked well in the comics, it created a living, breathing world for its inhabitants to populate, meet up, and fight common enemies in. It also created an unprecedented sense of momentum by constantly teasing the Next Big Thing – a tactic also borrowed from Marvel Comics’ event storylines crossing into various titles like X-Men and Thor. While the MCU may have only existed for roughly half of Rotten Tomatoes lifespan, it has created its fare share of memorable moments across 21 films – soon to be 22 with this week’s release of Avengers: Endgame. With that in mind, we present the 21 MCU moments we can never forget.Of course, narrowing down the list to just 21 was a challenge – there have been, after all, 21 films in the MCU so far, most of which are filled with dozens of memorable moments. We tried to choose those that&nbsp;were not just memorable, but which also showed how the MCU was working differently than other franchises – surprise twists and scenes that pushed the universe in different directions – and we tried to share the love among the different titles. Sacrifices had to be made:&nbsp;How could&nbsp;we&nbsp;not include Thor’s extraordinary arrival in Wakanda? Or Okoye’s wig-snatching excellence? Or Gamora’s heartbreaking moment in&nbsp;Infinity War? That’s what the comments section is for: so have at us down there, and let us know what moments you think should have made the list.Spoiler Warning: Key plot details about nearly every MCU movie follow. So, if you don’t wanna know what happened, don’t read on.&nbsp;21. Peter Discovers Liz’s Father Is The Vulture in Spider-Man: Homecoming (2017)  92%In a film brimming with great moments for both Spider-Man and Peter Parker (both Tom Holland), the moment Peter arrives for his date with Liz (Laura Harrier) only to discover The Vulture (Michael Keaton) is her father&nbsp;is probably our favorite. It is the most unexpected revelation in the film and gives it a whole new energy as Peter and Spidey’s storylines collide, leaving the viewers with a sense anything could happen from that point forward.20. Agent Coulson Takes One For The Team in&nbsp;Marvel's The Avengers (2012)  91%(Photo by Zade Rosenthal/©Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures/courtesy Everett Collection)The impact of this moment may be dulled now that Coulson (Clark Gregg) has been leading S.H.I.E.L.D. on television for the last five years, but it was the most heart-wrenching reversal in the Marvel Cinematic Universe’s first team-up movie. Without his sacrifice, the Avengers never would’ve got their act together. So though he ultimately survived, the films still honor his encounter with Loki by keeping his second life secret from the team.19. Carol Takes Full Possession Of Her Powers&nbsp;in&nbsp;Captain Marvel (2019)  79%(Photo by @ Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures)In a film&nbsp;that reverses the traditional superhero origin arc, Carol (Brie Larson) discovers the power was within her all along. Casting off the limiter tech the Kree told her was the source of her abilities, she literately ignites with power. For anyone who grew up told their innate skills were personality flaws, the moment resonates and sets Carol apart as one of the mightiest – if not the mightiest – Avenger.18. Captain America Fights Hydra Agents In An Elevator&nbsp;Captain America: The Winter Soldier (2014)  90%(Photo by ©Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures/courtesy Everett Collection)Marvel knew they had a winner in this scene, and it featured heavily in the trailers.&nbsp;While&nbsp;the fight is one of the most accomplished in any of the Marvel movies, it continues to resonate because Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) gave the Hydra agents a choice. For all the impressive battle choreography we’ve seen, the scene is still about Steve’s inherent sense of goodness and fair play. Well, and that he can survive a multi-story fall.17. “I’m Mary Poppins, Y’all!”: Yondu Becomes A Guardian in&nbsp;Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 (2017)  85%(Photo by @ Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures)Yondu (Michael Rooker) was always a charismatic character, but he wasn’t really a Guardian until this ultimate quip toward the end of Vol. 2. Utilizing some of that powerful Disney corporate synergy, it also marks the moment the character chose a side and fully committed to defending Peter Quill (Chris Pratt). Combined with his presence in the big Guardian group shot a few moments later and some thoughtful words with Peter, it makes his death all the more bittersweet.16. Valkyrie Swaggers – And Staggers – Into Fans’ Hearts in&nbsp;Thor: Ragnarok (2017)  93%(Photo by @ Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures, @ Marvel)Few people get to make an entrance like Valkyrie (Tessa Thompson). Long separated from her Asgardian sisters following their climatic battle with Hela (Cate Blanchett), she finds herself part of Sakaar’s strange society. And she survives with an unusual swagger which set plenty of fans’ hearts aflutter.&nbsp;When she steps off of her ship,&nbsp;tipsy and fierce at once, she’s approachable, flawed, strong, and freakin’ awesome. No wonder she’s joining the&nbsp;Endgame.15. Baby Groot Dances in&nbsp;Guardians of the Galaxy (2014)  92%(Photo by @ Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures, @ Marvel)While the first Guardians was filled with unexpectedly endearing moments, none were more unexpected than Baby Groot jamming to The Jackson 5’s “I Want You Back.” In fact, it was so unexpected, Disney failed to produce a line of Baby Groot merchandise timed with the film’s premiere, leaving resourceful fans and Etsy shops to initially fill the gap. It is a testament to the sort of magic Marvel and its creative partners can pull off and the best emblem of the way Guardians resonated with viewers.14. Doctor Strange Outsmarts Dormammu&nbsp;in&nbsp;Doctor Strange (2016)  89%(Photo by @ Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures, @ Marvel)If there is one long-standing criticism of Marvel movies, it is their habit of pitting the heroes against dark mirror versions of themselves – particularly in their origin movies.&nbsp;Doctor Strange confronted this critique by having Stephen Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) lock his ultimate adversary – the trans-dimensional death cloud Dormammu – in a time loop and bargaining with the entity to spare the Earth. That clever and innovative resolution is one we never stop citing as an MCU highlight.13. T’Challa Fails Killmonger’s Challenge At The Waterfall in&nbsp;Black Panther (2018)  96%(Photo by Matt Kennedy /© Marvel / © Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures)Black Panther is something of a romp in its first half. Like other Marvel films, it is filled with quips, good-natured ribbing, and a really fun car chase. But then comes this moment when everything turns. Killmonger (Michael B. Jordan) trounces T’Challa (Chadwick Boseman) and asks the crowd watching on, “Is this your king?” It is both an indictment of our enjoyment of the king’s superhero antics and of his rule, taking the film in a new direction.12. Luis Tells A Story&nbsp;in&nbsp;Ant-Man (2015)  83%(Photo by @ Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures, @ Marvel)Luis (Michael Peña) is a neo-cubist kind of guy. It is that sort of detail which makes Luis’s tendency to tell long-winded stories a delight. Between Peña’s ability to deliver the dialogue and actors like Anthony Mackie and Stan Lee learning to copy his cadence in expertly shot quick-cut flashbacks accompanying his stories, it is no wonder fans would like to see him recap the entire MCU from Iron Man to Infinity War.11. Hulk Smash in&nbsp;Marvel's The Avengers (2012)  91% and&nbsp;Thor: Ragnarok (2017)  93%(Photo by @ Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures, @ Marvel)Pick your moment: The Hulk (Mark Ruffalo) punching Thor after they defeat the Chitauri ship. The Hulk turning Loki into a rag doll as he smacks him into the Stark Tower floor. The Hulk&nbsp;fighting Fenris on, over, and below the remains of the Bifrost. Even Loki’s panic when he realizes Sakaar’s champion is the Hulk. Sure, they are all punchlines – literally in some cases – but they all honor the character’s immense strength in ways no movie devoted to the Hulk by himself ever quite accomplished.10. Stan Lee Revealed As A Watcher in&nbsp;Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 (2017)  85%(Photo by Gabriel Olsen/Getty Images)While all of the late Stan Lee’s cameos are memorable, we chose to single out this goofball Vol. 2 moment because it gives all of his scenes a context. Lee’s appearances – like the Hugh Hefner analogue in Iron Man, the postal worker looking for “Tony Stank” in Captain America: Civil War, and the school bus driver in Avengers: Infinity War – are all manifestations of a Watcher – cosmic entities who literally watch events unfold across the universe without interfering. It gives each jokey walk-on an added meaning and heartwarming meaning.9. Okoye, Scarlet Witch, and Black Widow Team Up in&nbsp;Avengers: Infinity War (2018)  85%(Photo by @ Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures, @ Marvel)In terms of iconic and surprising team-ups, we often think of key male combos like Thor and Rocket, but&nbsp;Infinity War&nbsp;features a&nbsp;killer battle between Proxima Midnight (Carrie Coon) and the combined might of Okoye (Danai Gurira), Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen), and Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson). All fight fiercely, but it’s Nat’s declaration “she’s not alone” when Proxima first threatens Wanda that keeps this epic Wakanda battle in our minds.8. The Berlin Airport Battle in&nbsp;Captain America: Civil War (2016)  90%(Photo by @ Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures, @ Marvel)A good Marvel team-up generally sees the heroes fight among themselves before joining forces against a common foe. And in the larger MCU Infinity Saga, this is that moment. Filled with amazing action, great jokes, and Peter Parker’s debut as the MCU Spider-Man, it is the most memorable Marvel fight yet committed to screen. Sure, it brings the movie to a halt, but it is worth it just to see Peter inadvertently age-shame the rest of the Avengers.7. Thanos Smiles in&nbsp;Marvel's The Avengers (2012)  91%(Photo by @ Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures, @ Marvel)Few mid-credit stingers have a lasting impact like Thanos’s (Josh Brolin) first MCU appearance. Initially there to “court Death,” his smile was the first indication that Marvel Studios would seriously attempt a long-term event storyline. It was such an unusual idea, many expected him to be the villain in the second Avengers movie. But his smile also created a sense of momentum which ultimately made Infinity War the most anticipated of Avengers stories. (Until Endgame, of course.) Note: The above image shows Thanos in&nbsp;Guardians, not&nbsp;The Avengers.6. “I Could Do This All Day”&nbsp;in&nbsp;Captain America: The First Avenger (2011)  80% and&nbsp;Captain America: Civil War (2016)  90%(Photo by @ Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures, @ Marvel)The MCU heroes are not big on catchphrases, but if Steve has one, it is “I could do this all day.” As seen in The First Avenger, it is his response to a bully who would like nothing more than to see the 98-pound Steve yield in a New York alley. It is also his response to the Red Skull’s (Hugo Weaving) taunting some time later, proving Steve will never bend to a bully. Sadly, the line took on a new meaning in Civil War, when he used it against friend Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.), who was now, in his eyes, the bully.5. “Bury Me In The Ocean”: Killmonger’s Final Request in&nbsp;Black Panther (2018)  96%Joel MearesBlack Panther&nbsp;eventually turns Killmonger into a dark mirror version of T’Challa – which, as we’ve mentioned, is a well-worn MCU trope – but it does it in the service of something so powerful, raw, and genuinely startling for&nbsp;any&nbsp;film that it deserves special recognition. A defeated Killmonger refuses aid, but makes one request: “Bury me in the ocean with my ancestors that jumped from the ships, because they knew death was better than bondage.” That statement, and the history bursting from it, leaves all who hear it shaken to their core.4. “Mr. Stark, I Don’t Feel So Good”: Peter Parker Turns To Dust in&nbsp;Avengers: Infinity War (2018)  85%(Photo by © Marvel / © Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures)Every loss in Infinity War hits people differently, but none captured the collective feels of fans quite like Peter’s final moment with Tony. It all begins with that line just above, and some fans have theorized that his spider-sense gave him early warning about his own demise, making the scene all the more wrenching upon second viewing. Additionally, it is the ultimate expression of Tony’s failure. He spent whole movies trying to save the world in general and Peter in particular. Even when Peter inevitably returns, we expect this scene will always make people cry.3. “I’m Here To Talk To You About The Avengers Initiative”: Nick Fury Makes His Debut in&nbsp;Iron Man (2008)  94%(Photo by © Marvel / © Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures)Earlier, we mentioned Marvel Studios’ facility with generating interest in the Next Big Thing. And this is how it began: with Samuel L. Jackson making a 30-second cameo for those who thought to sit through Iron Man’s end credits. His few lines of dialogue proved to be a mission statement no one would expect – or believe – would lead to a sprawling portfolio of film franchises.2. “I Am Iron Man”: Tony Stark Reveals His Identity in&nbsp;Iron Man (2008)  94%(Photo by © Marvel / © Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures)But before that larger world could exist, Iron Man had to score the goal by doing something no other marquee cinematic superhero had ever done before: reveal himself to the world. While the films of their Distinguished Competition made duality and secret identities key plot points, Marvel tossed it all aside after one film. It was a bold choice at the time, but now it seems so natural that we sometimes forget to refer to Tony, Steve, or Nat by their superhero code names. Engendering that sort of familiarity makes this a key moment in MCU history.1. The Avengers Assemble in&nbsp;Marvel's The Avengers (2012)  91%And yet, if there is one most memorable and most defining moment, it is the pan across a destroyed New York street revealing the Avengers assembled for the first time in common purpose. The entire film – and the five films preceding it – lead up to this moment in which six superheroes (three of whom already starred in their own films) shared the screen and proved this crazy idea of an interconnected lattice work of film franchises could work. It also helps that it is a kick-ass shot uniting the film’s key theme with all of the expectations outside of the narrative. The Avengers can work together, and so can all these stars and different interests. We wouldn’t be at Endgame without this memorable moment.Like this?

The streaming service has also ordered second seasons of its series Impulse, Step Up: High Water, and Ryan Hansen Solves Crimes on Television.In the wake of that success, both critics, and TV fans are&nbsp;curious about what YouTube Premium will offer next. Can YouTube compete with streaming heavy hitters Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon? What about traditional TV networks?Susanne Daniels, global head of original content for YouTube,&nbsp;took Rotten Tomatoes through 11 of&nbsp;the streamer’s upcoming releases to see if any of them has the potential to&nbsp;be the next Cobra Kai. Considering&nbsp;YouTube&nbsp;has 50 original shows, movies, international productions, and specials on the docket — and that’s just what’s been announced — chances are high that at least one of these series or films could be the next Certified Fresh sensation.WEIRD CITY(Photo by ABC/Craig Sjodin)Talent: Creators Jordan Peele and Charlie Sanders; stars Ed O’Neil, Michael Cera, Rosario Dawson, Laura Burton, Sara Gilbert, Dylan O’Brien, Laverne Cox,&nbsp;LeVar Burton, and more.What It’s About:&nbsp;The series&nbsp;began as Jordan Peele’s Twisted Ass Anthology, but the title Weird City is more accurate because the anthology stories all take place in the same city. The city of Weird has a little bit of crossover between residents and some Easter eggs for attentive viewers.Chances It’ll Be&nbsp;a Certified Fresh Hit: If each episode is a mini Get Out, then that’s highly likely. Daniels said Weird City straddles the line between comedy and drama, which worked well for Peele’s movie.“Weird City has a dramatic element to it too,” she said. “It’s not laugh-out-loud comedy like The Big Bang Theory where you know you’re going to get jokes every minute. It’s just eccentric tales.”ON BECOMING A GOD IN CENTRAL FLORIDA(Photo by FX)Talent: Producers George Clooney and Grant Heslov; stars Kirsten Dunst&nbsp;(pictured above in FX’s Fargo); and creators Robert Funke and Matt Lusky.What It’s About:&nbsp;Krystall Gill (Dunst) is a water park employee in the ’90s who is trying to infiltrate Founders American Merchandise, a pyramid scheme that destroyed her family.Chances It’ll Be&nbsp;a Certified Fresh Hit: It might give some viewers and critics pause that AMC passed on Becoming a God, but it wasn’t a quality issue&nbsp;— it was a scheduling one. And AMC’s scheduling conflicts are YouTube’s gain.“I just thought it was a unique world and an exploration of something I haven’t seen before on television,” Daniels said. “We made the deal for the script, and then we went to Kirsten Dunst and told her what we’re doing with YouTube Premium and were able to make a deal with her.”ORIGINTalent:&nbsp;Stars Tom Felton, Natalia Tena, Sen Mitsuji, Nora Arnezeder, Fraser JamesWhat It’s About: A group of strangers awaken from hypersleep on the spaceship Origin and have to figure out what happened and how to get to their destination — if they can survive the biggest danger facing them: each other.&nbsp;Every&nbsp;hour will see flashbacks that reveal what led each character to the Origin. You’ll have to wait until episode 8 for the story of&nbsp;Harry Potter star Felton.“No one tells each other what they’ve done because they’ve all done something terrible,” Felton said. “Everyone’s reluctant to volunteer the reasons why they did [what they did]. Some people are actually protecting that with their lives. For [my character] Logan, it builds up that there would be a very violent and vicious reason for him to make this switch, but actually it’s a very sweet one.”Chances It’ll Be a Certified Fresh Hit:&nbsp;This is a show that is decidedly not for kids — you get to hear Draco Malfoy use the F word, after all. Plus, with Felton and fellow Harry Potter alum Tena (also Game of Thrones) in the cast, they’ve got the fantasy fans on lock. Felton, however, doesn’t think their series is rooted in fantasy at all.“I don’t see this as really slipping into the fantasy realm because it is such a likely scenario that we could probably face in the next 50 to 100 years,” he said. “Space travel is already a thing but the idea of colonization and starting a new life is a very conceivable idea and very appealing I think for a lot of people.”ROBERT DOWNEY JR. NONFICTION SERIES(Photo by ©Marvel/©Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures)Talent: Susan and Robert Downey Jr.&nbsp;and real-life scientistsWhat It’s About: Robert Downey Jr. (pictured above in Avengers: Infinity War) will host this look at artificial intelligence, which Daniels described as “an exploration of all things A.I. today and where A.I.’s taking us in the future.” Filming has already begin.Chances It’ll Be&nbsp;a Certified Fresh Hit: Iron Man himself explaining real-life Stark technology sounds like a winner. (Doctor Strange not included.)Champaign, ILL(Photo by Mark Davis/Getty Images)Talent: Stars&nbsp;Jay Pharoah, Adam Pally, Sam RichardsonWhat It’s About:&nbsp;A sitcom about a rapper and his entourage — after the rapper’s not famous anymore. “This one’s broad and big and loud and fun,” Daniels revealed.Chances It’ll Be&nbsp;a Certified Fresh Hit:&nbsp;At first glance, the star of Happy Endings and the guy who did Will Smith and Denzel Washington&nbsp;impressions on SNL don’t necessarily seem like a comedy match.“That was my concern when we were casting them,” Daniels shared — but this odd couple works. “They’re funny together. They have very different character trajectories. The differences in the actors work for the characters that they’re playing. Their different energies seem to play off well against each other.”THE EDGE OF SEVENTEENTalent: Writer/director Kelly Fremon CraigWhat It’s About: A spin-off of Craig’s own movie&nbsp;that starred Hailee Steinfeld as a teenager coping with high school and her family. Craig is developing the series, it’ll be a little bit of time before information about the new characters is revealed.Chances It’ll Be A Certified Fresh Hit: Well, Buffy, the Vampire Slayer&nbsp;is Fresh at 81%&nbsp;compared to the movie’s 33%&nbsp;Rotten score. YouTube’s own Impulse has a perfect 100% on nine reviews, though the movie it was based on, Jumper, is Rotten at 16%. The Edge of Seventeen is fresh at 95%, so Craig only has her own work to live up to.“What I’ve found is that the director has spent a lot of time thinking about that movie and living with that movie, living with the concept and the characters,” Daniels said. “Bringing all that thought and creativity and passion for the project into the series. Things they didn’t get to do with the movie now they get to do with the series. I think that helps bring these kinds of projects to life.”THE LOU PEARLMAN PROJECT(Photo by YouTube Premium)Talent: Executive producers&nbsp;Lance Bass, Craig PiligianWhat It’s About: Lou Pearlman gave the world *NSYNC and the Backstreet Boys, but he also took millions in his Ponzi schemes. He died while serving a 25-year prison sentence for his crimes. This documentary follows the rise and fall of the late Svengali.Chances It’ll Be a Certified Fresh Hit: Whether it’s Fresh or not, Daniels can confirm you’ll see a lot of classic boy-and moments. If you need to see more, you can go down the rabbit hole of YouTube clips like she did.“That was the impact the documentary had on me,” Daniels said. “My one note was: I need more footage of the bands in the movie. You’re really reminded of how huge those bands were at the time and how passionate their fans were. Then there’s this dark side from the creator of these bands, and the fraud, the wool he was pulling over everyone’s eyes. It ends up being a very sad story in many ways.”VIPER CLUB(Photo by YouTube Premium)Talent: Stars&nbsp;Susan Sarandon, Matt Bomer, Lola Kirke, Edie Falco;&nbsp;writers Maryam Keshavarz and Jonathan Mastro; director&nbsp;Maryam KeshavarzWhat It’s About: This feature film was developed by YouTube (unlike another feature,&nbsp;Bodied, which&nbsp;was acquired). When an ER nurse and single mom’s journalist son is kidnapped by ISIS, she can’t afford the ransom, but goes to great lengths to get the money.Chances It’ll Be&nbsp;a Certified Fresh Hit:&nbsp;Find out what critics said&nbsp;after&nbsp;Viper Club‘s premiere at the 2018 Toronto International Film Festival.WILL SMITH: THE JUMPTalent: Will SmithWhat It’s About:&nbsp;On his 50th birthday, September 25, Smith&nbsp;has accepted a challenge from one of his fans to bungee jump from a helicopter over the Grand Canyon, Big Willie style!Chances It’ll Be&nbsp;a Certified Fresh Hit:&nbsp;There may not be enough reviews of a live streaming event to certify The Jump on the Tomatometer, but that’s not&nbsp;why Smith is doing it anyway. This&nbsp;is a way to engage his millions of fans.KAT &amp; JUNE THINK STUFFTalent: Stars&nbsp;Tenea Intriago, Alexia Dox; creator Mackenzie YeagerWhat It’s About:&nbsp;Kat (Intriago) and June (Dox) become friends and the audience hears their hopes and fears out loud — with an emphasis on the fears.Chances It’ll Be A Certified Fresh Hit: Daniels said she developed Kat and June primarily for the same audience as their hit young adult series Foursome, so it’s up to the youth to decide. “We have a really robust Foursome audience on the platform, and we wanted to give them a new show,” Daniels said.WAYNE(Photo by YouTube Premium)Talent: Stars&nbsp;Mark McKenna, Ciara Bravo, Mike O’Malley, Dean WintersWhat It’s About: Described as a Dirty Harry in high school, Wayne (McKenna) goes looking for his late father’s stolen 1978 Trans Am.Chances It’ll Be&nbsp;a Certified Fresh Hit: Given YouTube’s ability to combine comedy and drama in Cobra Kai and teen drama with sci-fi in Impulse, the tricky combination of Wayne seems in good hands.“It has its funny moments,” Daniels said. “Particularly Wayne’s interaction with the principal, Mike O’Malley, is very funny. It’s pretty intense. It’s pretty hardcore exploration of a tougher life for a teen.”","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"Nominations, quibi, aliens, cars, screenings, Columbia, Carpet, Holidays, french, Election, drama, Premiere, The, Apple","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"youtube-originals-announced-in-production-and-coming-soon"},{"id":"47612434586868","title":"“Rotten Tomatoes Is Wrong” About… Star Wars: The Last Jedi","content":"RT Podcastvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})\"Rotten Tomatoes Is Wrong\" About...

And perhaps taking a cue from all-women film remakes like Ghostbusters and Ocean’s 8, there’s also a wave of shows being developed that reimagine a film or franchise with a female lead or all-women cast.Read on to find out which women-led television adaptations of films are coming down the pipeline, and what we know so far.​​HIDDEN FIGURES (Nat Geo)(Photo by 20th Century Fox)The original film: Hidden Figures (2017)  93%Based on the non-fiction book of the same name by Margot Lee Shetterly. The film, starring Taraji P. Henson, Octavia Spencer, and&nbsp;Janelle Monáe, was nominated for three Academy Awards in 2017, including Best Picture.Coming to TV: A scripted series&nbsp;based on the true story of the black female mathematicians who were instrumental to NASA during the Space Race.Everything we know so far about&nbsp;the show:&nbsp;The series is currently in development and will be executive produced by Peter Chernin and Jenno Topping, who executive produced the film.We’re guessing: If the series gets picked up to pilot, it will be a great opportunity for Nat Geo to continue to capitalize on scripted content, after its CEO announced the channel’s push towards scripted content in 2017. The movie’s recent success could draw in viewers, but the series could dig a little deeper into the characters’ backstories&nbsp;and not just remake the film over an extended episode order.FIRST WIVES CLUB (Paramount Network)(Photo by Paramount Pictures)The original film: The First Wives Club (1996)  50%Based on the 1992 best-selling novel of the same name by Olivia Goldsmith, the 1996 comedy starred Diane Keaton, Goldie Hawn, and Bette Midler, is considered a cult classic, and was adapted into a musical that played in San Diego in 2009 and Chicago in 2015.Coming to TV: A half-hour comedy based on the film about three New York City women seeking revenge on their ex-husbands who left them for younger women.Everything we know so far about&nbsp;the show: This remake was originally developed for TV Land, then was moved to Paramount Network (formerly Spike) when the new channel began to develop scripted content. The pilot, by Girls Trip co-writer Tracy Oliver, was greenlit by Paramount Network.We’re guessing: If Oliver stays on as showrunner, the series&nbsp;could become a surprise breakout comedy contender. Paramount Network, however,&nbsp;also developed an ill-fated&nbsp;and negatively received TV version of 1988 dark comedy&nbsp;Heathers, which has been postponed.A LEAGUE OF THEIR OWN (Amazon)(Photo by Columbia Pictures/courtesy Everett Collection)The original film: A League of Their Own (1992)  79%Directed by Penny Marshall, the 1992 film starred Geena Davis, Tom Hanks, Madonna, and Lori Petty. It was was the 10th highest-grossing film of that year and is currently preserved by the Library of Congress.Coming to TV: A scripted series based on the film about the World War II–era, All-American Girls Professional Baseball League. This is the second A League of Their Own television series, following the short-lived 1993 CBS series of the same name that lasted six episodes.Everything we know so far about&nbsp;the show:&nbsp;The series is currently in development with Mozart in the Jungle executive producer Will Graham and Broad City co-creator and star Abbi Jacobson on board as writers and executive producers. They’re currently negotiating for principal roles, so hopefully we’ll be hearing more about casting soon.We’re guessing: If the critical success and awards acclaim of Graham’s&nbsp;Mozart in the Jungle&nbsp;is any indication, the show will likely be a home-run for Amazon. And with Jacobson at bat as a potential showrunner, the series may lean more heavily on the film’s comedic aspects for a fresh, new take.HIGH FIDELITY&nbsp;(Disney’s unnamed streaming service)(Photo by Buena Vista)The original film: High Fidelity (2000)  91%Based on the 1995 novel of the same name by Nick Hornby, the 2000 film stars John Cusack as Chicago record store owner Rob Gordon, who seeks out his past relationships in order to find out why all his relationships go awry.Coming to TV: A romantic comedy with a female lead in place of Cusack’s Rob Gordon character, the series will follow the character as she recounts her past relationships in a mixtape-meets-diary style.Everything we know so far about&nbsp;the show:&nbsp;The series is one of the first projects to be announced for Disney’s upcoming on-demand streaming service, which will feature both pre-existing and original content. It will be written by writers-producers Veronica West and Sarah Kucserka, who are best known for their work on Ugly Betty. Scott Rosenberg, who co-wrote the 2000 film, is on board to produce as part of the Midnight Radio production team.We’re guessing:&nbsp;There’s currently an air of intrigue surrounding the mysterious, unnamed Disney streaming service. While many expect original content based on Disney’s many big-name&nbsp;acquisitions — like Star Wars and Marvel — a teen-friendly reboot of an R-rated romantic dramedy seems a little out of place. But with Ugly Betty’s writers tapped in for the project, the High Fidelity series may come as a welcome surprise.UNTITLED&nbsp;BAD BOYS SPIN-OFF&nbsp;(NBC)(Photo by Columbia/courtesy Everett Collection)The original films: Bad Boys (1995)  42%, Bad Boys II (2003)  23%The buddy cop comedy film series starred Will Smith&nbsp;as Det. Mike Lowrey and Martin Lawrence as Det. Marcus Burnett, narcotics detectives in the Miami Police Department. Despite&nbsp;their Rotten Tomatometer scores, both films were financial successes.Coming to TV: An untitled spin-off of the&nbsp;movie franchise, with Gabrielle Union reprising her role from Bad Boys II&nbsp;as Special Agent Syd Burnett, Burnett’s sister and Lowrey’s love interest. The series follows Burnett after leaving the DEA for the LAPD, where Nancy McKenna (Jessica Alba) is her partner.​​Everything we know so far about the show:&nbsp;The series is currently being written and executive produced for NBC by Brandon Sonnier and Brandon Margolis, who worked on The Blacklist. Jerry Bruckheimer, who executive produced the Bad Boys film franchise, is also set to executive produce the television series.​​We’re guessing: A network procedural starring Union and Alba will be sure to draw audiences and has the long-running potential of Bruckheimer’s ultra-successful CSI series.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"movies, archives, Music, Awards","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"women-lead-upcoming-movie-to-tv-adaptations"},{"id":"47612469290239","title":"On DVD This Week: King Arthur: Legend of the Sword, Snatched, and More","content":"RT on DVDvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})On DVD This Week: King Arthur: Legend of the Sword, Snatched, and Moreby Ryan Fujitani | August 7, 2017 |  CommentsOnly a handful of notable selections make their way home this week beginning with a pair of poorly received early summer films — an action fantasy and a female-driven comedy. After that, we’ve also got a couple of smaller films that might be more worth your time. Read on for the full list.Notes on Blindness (2016)  95%This documentary centers on writer John Hull, who gradually became totally blind and chronicled his experiences on audiocassette. Available only on DVD, it comes with three audio soundtracks for different viewing — or listening — experiences.Get it HereThe Exception (The Kaiser's Last Kiss) (2017)  73%Jai Courtney, Lily James, and Christopher Plummer star in this WWII romantic thriller about a German soldier who falls in love with a Jewish maid when he’s sent to investigate Kaiser Wilhelm II’s staff for spies. It comes with a commentary track and a 20-minute behind-the-scenes featurette.Get it Here,&nbsp;Stream it HereSnatched (2017)  36%Amy Schumer and Goldie Hawn star in this comedy about a mother and daughter who bond when they become kidnap victims while on vacation in Ecuador.

Over the last 15 years animators from all over the Latinx diaspora have emerged to tell stories in a variety of animated mediums: traditional 2D animation, 3D computer-generated graphics, stop-motion, rotoscoping, and beyond. And while many of their names aren’t as synonymous with animation as Disney, Miyazaki, or even Bakshi and Bluth, with such an abundance of talented creators in the game it’s high time more viewers became familiar with their work. That said, spoiler alert, there is a&nbsp;Disney film on this list. Gotta give props where they’re due.Like the Latinx diaspora itself, the movies on this list come from all over the world and tell all kinds of stories — from fantastical dreamland adventures, to horrifying stories of survival, to every coming-of-age beat in between — all styled to their creator’s unique visions. Some are geared toward children, others should never be viewed by a child. But they are all fantastic pieces of work that any animation (or movie) lover should know.Buñuel in the Labyrinth of the Turtles (Buñuel en el laberinto de las tortugas) (2019)  98%Country: SpainSet in the 1930s, Buñuel in the Labyrinth of the Turtles is a surreal journey through the making of director Luis Buñuel’s documentary Land Without Bread. Following the fallout of his first film, Buñuel is stranded without a project. When a bet backfires,&nbsp;he finds himself traveling with anthropologist Maurice Legenre through the Las Hurdes region of Spain, filming a documentary. Buñuel borrows from its titular director’s life and work, but is primarily based on Fermín Solis’ graphic novel Buñuel en el laberinto de las tortugas. It’s currently Certified Fresh, with many critics praising its innovative, surrealist imagery, and its ability to do a lot with very little. The Wrap’s&nbsp;Carlos Aguilar said: “The 2D animated rendering of the master filmmaker is more graphic interpretation than faithful portrait, perfect to cruise between reality and the anxiety-fueled nightmares that besiege his sleep.”The Wolf House (La casa lobo) (2018)  96%Country: Chile(Photo by Kimstim Films)An eerie stop-motion animation that will chill you to your bones, La Casa Lobo is not for the faint of heart. It tells the story of Maria, a woman who escapes a secretive German colony as she takes refuge in a house in southern Chile. Directors Jaoquín Cociña and Cristóbal León shot the film over five years, using 12 different locations in the process, including Casa Maauad in Mexico City, the National Museum of Fine Arts in Santiago, Chile, and Upstream Gallery in Amsterdam, Netherlands. All that globe-trotting seems to have paid off in terrifying dividends: Critics agree it’s a viewing experience like no other. La Casa Lobo is an instant folk-horror classic, a terrifying fairy tale bound to stick with you long after the credits roll.&nbsp;Olimpia (2018) Country: MexicoIn 1968, a coalition of students from across México came together to push for social and political change. This protest, known as the Mexican Movement of 1968 (Movimiento Estudiantil), provides the backdrop for Olimpia. The film follows three students at the Nacional Autónoma de México (UNAM) as the school is seized by the military following massive student-led unrest. It’s been hailed by critics for showing a new perspective on the events, drawing comparisons&nbsp;to 1968’s&nbsp;El Grito, the long-banned documentary that captured the protests as they unfolded. The outcome resulted in several high-profile massacres with a lasting impact on the country (as seen in Alfonso Cuarón’s Roma, set between 1970 and 1971), and Olimpia effectively re-creates the events which ignited the movement. The rotoscope effect adds a layer of reality to the proceedings, while simultaneously giving it an uncanny valley feel that amps up the tension. An important film about an important moment of time, Olimpia is a good starting place for anyone looking to learn more about the Movimiento Estudiantil.Coco (2017)  97%Country: USA(Photo by Pixar / courtesy Everett Collection)A celebration of music and country, Coco is widely known in the U.S. as an English-language film, but the Spanish-language version of the film is one of the few dubs that is widely beloved (next to the epic Spanish language dub of The Lion King, of course). Coco was the first film released by the studio to feature an exclusively Latinx cast, and cast members including Gael García Bernal, Alfonso Arua, Sofía Espinosa, Luis Valdez, and Carla Medina were able to reprise their roles for the dub. Doubly helpful was everyone doing their own singing.&nbsp;The radio version of main heartbreaker “Remember Me” was sung by Mexicana folk singer Natalia Lafourcade and US pop star Miguel, both of whom were already up to the task of singing en Español. Because the story already takes place in México and deals with culturally specific beliefs and celebrations, there’s little about the movie’s content that reads as&nbsp;phony, helping it become the highest-grossing original animated film in México. That, and releasing it just in time for Día de los Muertos. Whatever language you watch it in, Coco is a celebration of Mexican life, culture, and music that’s perfect for viewers of all ages.Birdboy: The Forgotten Children (Psiconautas, los niños olvidados) (2017)  94%Country: SpainBased on co-director Alberto Vázquez’ graphic novel, Birdboy takes place on an island devastated by a massive factory explosion that has left half its land toxic, the water fishless, and our hero Birdboy possessed by a demon. After spending years isolated from the rest of society, Birdboy’s life is forever changed when Dinki, a young mouse from an abusive home, finds him on her journey to freedom. Their attempts to escape the island are undermined by a ruthless police force determined to find and capture Birdboy — dead or alive. You know, just your basic coming-of-age story that tackles ecological disaster, drug abuse, and the dangers of religious extremism. The 2016 Best Animated Feature winner at the Goya Awards (and a Rotten Tomatoes off-the-radar staff pick), Birdboy was hailed by critics as an oddball triumph, heavily praised for its striking animation — at once whimsical and terrifying — and ability to find hope inside its dark world. If the themes didn’t make it obvious, Birdboy is definitely not for younger viewers (though anyone old enough to Tweet is likely already familiar with the abject terror of living in a world on fire and may find it, sadly, #relatablecontent). Those equipped to wade into this dreary world may find themselves leaving with a little more hope than they ever could have imagined.Virus Tropical (2017)  78%Country: Colombia(Photo by Interior13 Cine)Virus Tropical is&nbsp;a black-and-white piece of animated perfection based on Colombian-Ecuadorian cartoonist Power Paola’s graphic memoirs of the same name. Paola, the youngest of three siblings and by far the strangest, can’t seem to figure out how to fit in a society that demands compliance. It’s an exploration of identity, a coming-of-age story rich with self discovery. The film’s animation is reminiscent of Marjane Satrapi’s Persepolis, sketchy in the best sense and full of imaginative imagery born of Paola’s particular worldview. It’s a joyous, melancholy ode to growing up and learning how to be yourself against all odds.&nbsp;Underdogs (Metegol) (2015)  67%Country: Argentina(Photo by TWC / courtesy Everett Collection)Football (or, as Ted Lasso would call it, soccer) fans will find much to like in Metegol, a charming 3D animated feature known in the U.S. as Underdogs.&nbsp;The film follows Amadeo and his beloved foosball table, whose figurines have suddenly come to life. Together, they must defeat an evil bully who is determined to destroy them. Though director Juan José Campanella is better known for his live-action filmography, which includes The Secret in Their Eyes and several episodes of AMC’s outstanding Halt and Catch Fire, he works well in the animated space. The camera work is fluid, and though it has some of the shortcomings of lower-budgeted CGI, it’s never distracting to the story. It’s geared toward younger audiences, but it moves quickly enough, and once the jokes start rolling even viewers may find themselves chuckling along.Wrinkles (2014)  93%Country: Spain(Photo by GKids / courtesy Everett Collection)Most animated features feel like they’re geared towards young people, and it’s even rarer to find animated films that take on the complexities of aging. Writer Paco Roca’s Arrugas (adapted from his comic book of the same name) explores the lives of elderly people living in a retirement home. As newly admitted Emilio becomes acquainted with his new surroundings via his charming roommate Miguel (who may or may not be a bit of a kleptomaniac), it dawns on Emilio that he is not simply here because he is old; he has early onset Alzhemiers. The recipient of the 2014 Goya Award for Best Animated Feature, Arrugas doesn’t sugarcoat much, which can make it a bit difficult to watch.&nbsp;But with a charming cast of characters, warm humor, and endless insight, it’s a bittersweet meditation on life and love. Unfortunately the original version of the film isn’t currently streaming in the U.S., but if you’re curious you may be able to find the English dub, which features Martin Sheen and George Coe in the lead roles.&nbsp;Anina (2013) Country: Uruguay/Colombia(Photo by 3GTG )Anina, adapted from a novel by Sergio López Suárez, tells the story of young Anina Yatay Salas, the girl with the triple palindrome name (thanks, dad). After a fateful sandwich-related mishap, Anina and her arch nemesis, Yisel, receive a punishment so strange it nearly breaks Anina’s wild spirit. It was submitted as Uruguay’s entry for Best Foreign Language film for the 86th Academy Awards, and though it wasn’t nominated, remains a lovely feat of 2D animation from director Alfredo Soderguit.Chico &amp; Rita (2012)  87%Country: Spain/UK(Photo by GKIDS)Chico &amp; Rita has more than enough music and energy to keep you dancing long into the night. It tells the tale of the titular Cuban musicians whose passion for their craft is matched only by their love and adoration for one another. Winner of the Goya Award for Best Animated Film, Chico &amp; Rita’s unique animation style flows as freely as the jazz music at its center. Each frame seems to dance to the beat, the camera pushing and pulling as fluidly as it would in any live-action film.&nbsp;It’s truly a wonder to watch unfold, which is probably why — in addition to being the first Spanish language title ever to receive a nomination for Best Animated Feature at the 84th Academy Awards — Chico &amp; Rita is currently Certified Fresh. Una carta épica de amor a Cuba y su música, Chico &amp; Rita is one for the ages.&nbsp;Gordo, calvo y bajito (2012) Country: ColombiaWe all get a little insecure sometimes. In Carlos Osuna’s Gordo, calvo, y bajito, Antonio Farfan firmly believes all the misfortunes of his life can be traced back to three things: He is fat, he is bald, and he is short. When a fatter, shorter, balder man arrives at his office, Antonio must face the facts: Maybe the problem isn’t his looks after all. Maybe it’s him. It’s a moving film,&nbsp;with&nbsp; simple rotoscoped animation capturing Antonio’s mental gymnastics as he attempts to unlearn everything he knows about himself and become the person he was always meant to be.Nocturna (2007) Country: Spain/France(Photo by GKIDS)When the stars start disappearing, orphan Tim must find a way to save them, lest he and all of Nocturna be forever stuck in the dark. Nocturna’s animation is gorgeous, a spiraling dreamland that recalls the beauty of Van Gogh’s “Starry Night,” but with computer-generated graphics. Though the story is aimed squarely at young viewers, this timeless tale of courage in the face of adversity and finding light in the dark will resonate with audiences of all ages.&nbsp;A visual feast filled with fantastic characters and brought to life by an impressive voice cast, including Imanol Arias, Nocturna&nbsp;is well worth a watch.Fierro (Martín Fierro, la película) (2007) Country: ArgentinaDirector’s Liliana Romero and Norman Ruiz’ Fierro is an animated adaptation of José Hernández’ epic poem, Martín Fierro, an important cultural touchstone figure for Argentina. It&nbsp;begins with young Fierro living with his&nbsp;family on&nbsp;their ranch, whose existence is upended when he is drafted to protect the Argentine border from Indigenous hostiles. When Fierro becomes disillusioned with his position, he defects and joins the Indigenous cause in a story of corruption, freedom, and justice. The characters in the film were all designed by Roberto Fontanarrosa, an Argentinian cartoonist and writer who sadly died before the film’s release. The film’s 2D animation is Newgrounds-esque,&nbsp;which&nbsp;works well for Fontanarrosa’s characters. The static backgrounds (often simply of expansive sky) add a sense of space and place to the provincial setting, and a surreal quality to Fierro’s moments of introspection. It’s a fitting adaptation that lives up to both its source material and the late cartoonist who helped create it.Una Película de Huevos (2006) Country: MexicoYou have to crack a few eggs to make an omelette, but what if the egg had a say in becoming breakfast? That’s the dilemma for Toto, a&nbsp;talking egg who is snatched from his hen-mother just moments after being laid to be processed as food. After being sold to a household with a very egg-hungry cat, Toto is determined to get back to his mother with the help of some friends, and become the rooster he was meant to be. Una pelicula de huevos was the first feature from Mexican animation studio Huevocartoon Producciones, and was so well received in Mexico it still holds its place as the 10th highest-grossing film produced in the country. Though it never received a theatrical release in the U.S., it hatched two sequels (including 2015’s Huevos: Little Rooster’s Egg-cellent Adventure) and even spawned a video game. The animation is fairly simple (think WB Saturday morning Cartoons in their heyday — not the most exciting, but it gets the job done), so the real draw is&nbsp;the&nbsp;humor. The film is an extension of shorts created by Rodolfo Riva Palacio and Gábriel Riva Palacio, who also helm the feature. Though the feature-length version’s humor is toned down for younger audiences, there are still traces of the short’s double entendres.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"TV, Warner, Netflix, 2016, Video, monsters, Rocketman, Marvel, Drama","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"spanish-language-animated-movies"},{"id":"47612451539193","title":"2018 BAFTA Nominations Announced","content":"Newsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})2018 BAFTA Nominations AnnouncedThe Shape of Water leads with 12 nominations.by RT Staff | January 9, 2018 |  CommentsThe EE British Academy Film Award nominations for 2018 were announced this morning on a press conference streamed live on Facebook.

Guillermo del Toro’s sci-fi romance The Shape of Water led all films with an impressive 13 nominations, including Best Picture, Best Actress for star Sally Hawkins, and Best Director for del Toro himself. Greta Gerwig’s semi-autobiographical coming-of-age story Lady Bird also earned a Best Picture nod, and Gerwig’s own nomination for Best Director made her just the fifth female in Oscar history to achieve the distinction. Likewise, Jordan Peele established a milestone of his own when his film Get Out earned Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Screenplay nominations — only the third time in history a filmmaker has achieved that with a debut feature, and the first time ever for an African-American.

ThompsonThe helmer on piecing together a crazy life.by Joe Utichi | December 19, 2008 |  CommentsDocumentarian Alex Gibney, whose last film Taxi to the Dark Side was an Oscar winner about US army torture practices in Guantanamo Bay, Afghanistan and Iraq, returns to screens this week with a new feature about the life and times of Hunter S. Thompson. The noted but controversial journalist, who pioneered the Gonzo movement, died in 2005. He wrote the book that became the film Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, and the movie’s star, Johnny Depp, narrates passages from Thompson’s writing in the documentary. RT caught up with Gibney to learn more about the movie.Was there any hesitation from you about trying to explore the mind of a guy like this?Alex Gibney: Not really. One of the things I thought I could do that hadn’t been done — or at least hadn’t been done in a long time — is explore the work. That’s why I put Hunter at the center — he narrates the film himself. We put together a number of his words so that they would form a kind of narrative. That was important because he was this wild and crazy guy who was a drug-taking action hero, but I think we wouldn’t really care about him unless he’d been a really great writer.How much did you know of him beforehand? Did you have a chance to meet him?AG: I never met Hunter but I certainly knew of him and knew a lot of people who knew him. And I certainly knew the legend. What’s that line from The Man Who Shot Liberty Vallance? “When you have the truth and the legend, print the legend.” I had fun printing the truth and the legend, I think. I came from the outside so I had an advantage in some ways. I wasn’t allied with anybody, or part of any clique, so I could come in and ask a lot of questions and just say, “Tell me about him.” I found out a lot of stuff that I didn’t know.Is that part of the joy of being a documentarian; that you have the opportunity to explore?AG: Yeah, you get paid to learn — how good is that? I feel lucky in that sense — you wade into someone’s life and you get to learn a lot of stuff that you didn’t know before; that’s exciting. There’s something wonderful about the contradictions of everyday life that’s impossible to resist. I started out as a fiction filmmaker and may do some fiction films yet in the future, but I also see a lot of fiction films which look beautiful but seem dead. They don’t have that weird, quirky vitality that the best documentaries have. There’s something about that which I really like.Do you ever worry that you won’t be able to come out of the other side though? That the story you’re discovering doesn’t have an end?AG: I do, I always worry about structure and the end point. I haven’t a clue what the structure is going to be when I go in and it’s a terrible feeling. But if there’s one thing I’ve learned over time it’s that it will come. I think there’s always enough interesting about almost any subject that if you get stuck you can just take a turn into a different direction. There’s always something there, it just takes time to find it and then come back and structure it in a way so that it becomes a story. Even though I love documentaries, there are a lot whose structure is just too aimless for me — I like to construct documentaries in the cutting room so that they feel like movies and they have that sense of momentum.Presumably you can be a little less conventional when you’re working on a documentary about someone like Hunter.AG: I think the whole life of Hunter S. Thompson, and his art, is “don’t be afraid to mess around.” Gonzo journalism is gonzo. The name comes from a Hammond organ tune from James Booker and it’s just got a weird, funky vibe that’s wacky. You never know quite what to expect from the song. That’s the way Hunter’s writing was and that’s what I hope comes across in the film, too.As familiar as Fear and Loathing is, the film is the most interesting when it’s sharing the lesser known details of Hunter’s life.AG: Right, it was fun to really dig at the stuff that I didn’t know much about. The letters are fantastic and we included some bits and pieces from manuscripts that are yet to be published, including a full book he wrote on the NRA. In the book, Hunter ends up being too intense for the National Rifle Association. He terrified them because he walked into the offices with a gun and started shooting things and they were like, “No! Anything but guns!”What surprised you most about him?AG: I think what surprised me most was learning from people who knew him that he had very high highs and very low lows. He had a manic side but he also had a cruel and vicious side. That’s, I think, one of the reasons he was so good at championing and chronicling the American character, which is so deeply contradictory between this great sense of idealism and possibility and this dark, brooding violent streak — what Hunter called fear and loathing. That was interesting to me, there was something in his personality that may have allowed him to channel the larger character of the American character.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"Globe, rotten, sports, the, comedy, cults, Wars, 93rd, Avengers, BBC, Grant, serial","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"rt-interview-director-alex-gibney-on-gonzo-the-life-and-work-of-dr-hunter-s-thompson"},{"id":"47612522398987","title":"Here Be Dragons!

And fans have been pretty vocal on their picks for the best of the 2010s, too: see their TV picks and movie picks. But what does the RT staff think were some of the best films and series of the last 10 years? We asked a number of staffers on our content team to pick one – yes, just one! – movie and TV show from the 2010s as their favorite. It didn’t necessarily need to be the best-reviewed (though all just happen to be Fresh) or the award-winningest, just the single thing they loved the most. Below, in the movie picks, you’ll&nbsp;find two groundbreaking superhero movies – one Marvel, one DC! – two off-beat vampire flicks, along&nbsp;with an era-defining action film and a period piece to break the heart of anyone who lives far, far from home.If you had to pick just one favorite movie from the 2010s, what would it be? Let us know in the comments.&nbsp;Brooklyn (2015)  97%For me, Brooklyn is basically a perfect drama and the finest period piece we’ve had all decade. And while it kills me not to name Hereditary my favorite film of the decade (that underrated Toni Collette performance!), or to give the honor to Gone Girl (do thrillers come any better?), or Burning, Boyhood, Animal Kingdom, or Inside Out (Bing Bong!), no other film hit me square in the guts the way director John Crowley and writer Nick Hornby’s adaptation of Colm Toibin’s novel did. The story is incredibly simple: It’s 1951 and Ellis (Saoirse Ronan at her best) emigrates from Ireland to Brooklyn to find work; there she meets and marries a plumber, but finds her heart eventually pulled back towards her hometown across the ocean. Yet Brooklyn’s simplicity is its power – for anyone who’s moved away from home, and from family, and felt that same pull that Ellis feels, regardless of where you left and landed, it’s an incredibly moving watch.&nbsp;– Joel Meares, Editor-in-ChiefRecommended:&nbsp;The 200 Best Movies of the 2010sWonder Woman (2017)  93%Patty Jenkins’ Wonder Woman arrived at a time when women are standing up against injustices against our sex more than ever before. It’s nice to have a demigoddess-warrior on our side. The film’s arrival invigorated the dialogue, as well as longtime fans of the character, who made her first comic-book appearance in 1941. Though Wonder Woman (Gal Gadot) may not have been able to dodge rampant sexism, she became an idol to women of all ages by letting verbal barbs bounce off her while staying true to herself and charging into the fray with grace and kindness. Wonder Woman has so far earned $821.8 in the worldwide box office – not bad for a 78-year-old – and we can’t wait to see more in next decade’s Wonder Woman 1984 and beyond.&nbsp;– Debbie Day, Sr. TV EditorRecommended:&nbsp;The Best Superhero Movies of the 2010sDrive (2011)  93%Drive‘s neon, ’80s-inspired aesthetic may be everywhere now – highlighting the arthouse action-drama’s influence on pop culture since its release – but back in 2011 it was an utter revelation. Looking to the past as it careens headfirst into the future, the film’s pulsating synth score and eclectic, frequently electronic song choices, its taciturn getaway driver hero navigating love and a heist gone horribly awry, and director Nicholas Winding Refn‘s churning long takes built a primal, elemental mood. It’s been imitated, even by NWR himself, but never matched. Perhaps most admirable about Drive is that it’s a Los Angeles story not about fame or celebrity, but one that mythologizes the city’s day-to-day mood: Sitting behind the wheel in a hypnotized haze, dazed by the lights, where pop songs become your guardian angels in-between the violence and silence. –&nbsp;Alex Vo, EditorRecommended:&nbsp;All Ryan Gosling Movies, Ranked&nbsp;A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night (2014)  96%In the 2010s, everything old was new again. Not that that was necessarily a bad thing; some of my most pleasurable movie experiences of the decade (the new Star Wars movies, The Muppets, Beats, Rhymes &amp; Life: The Travels of A Tribe Called Quest) were like reunions with old friends. So when I saw A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night, I felt the shock of the new: Here was a film that felt like a visit to unexplored territory. Director Ana Lily Amirpour doesn’t hide her influences (Nosferatu, the films of Jim Jarmusch and Sergio Leone), but she creates a haunting, hypnotic mood that’s one of a kind. Set in Iran but made in California, boasting vivid black-and-white photography (any single frame is poster-worthy), it’s the tale of a lonely hipster vampire (played by Sheila Vand), swooping on a skateboard like a bat in flight, an avenging angel for a particularly grim town. (Prepare to jump when she first bares her fangs.) Beneath its cool veneer&nbsp;– and seriously, veneers don’t come much cooler than this – is the beating heart of the film: our heroine’s tentative romance with Arash (Arash Marandi), a James Dean-type with a troubled home life. (Their first meeting – he’s wobbling down the street, drunk and dressed like Dracula; she pushes him home on her skateboard – is both poignant and deadpan funny.) It’s probably the movie I’ve recommended the most over the past few years, mostly because there’s nothing else quite like it.&nbsp;–&nbsp;Tim Ryan, Review Curation ManagerRecommended:&nbsp;The 80 Essential Vampire MoviesMoonlight (2016)  98%Moonlight is a once-in-a-generation film. A masterpiece. And&nbsp;yes, we know the word is thrown around liberally, but in this case it is the only word that can aptly describe Barry Jenkins‘ sophomore work. Under his direction, from a screenplay he co-wrote, three actors masterfully embody Chiron, a young Black boy – and then man – from South Miami. The cinematography paints a color story that is as compelling as the narrative itself, with Nicholas Britell’s masterful score tailored to enrich every&nbsp;moment, and Moonlight’s delicate screenplay carefully masks its intentions for much of the runtime. The audience is halfway through the third act before it even reveals itself – this is not just a slice of life story about a young Black boy from the hood, this is a love story. Jenkins may have been robbed of his moment by the infamous envelope fiasco at the 2017 Oscars, but nothing can&nbsp;rob the film of its legacy as one of the best films of the decade – arguably, of all time. –&nbsp;Jacqueline Coley, EditorRecommended: The 200 Best LGBTQ Movies of All TimeFrank (2014)  92%Michael Fassbender took on a lot of roles this decade, but my favorite by far was in 2014’s Frank. Based on a newspaper article by Jon Ronson, Frank follows Jon (Domhnall Gleeson), an aspiring musician scraping songs together in a small town in England. After witnessing a tragic scene at the beach, Jon meets Don (Scoot McNairy), who invites him to come play with his band, Soronpfbs, that night at a local club. Jon agrees, and quickly finds himself swept up in the off-kilter world of Don, Clara (a terrifically terrifying Maggie Gyllenhaal), and Frank, an eccentric musical genius who dons a paper-mâché head at all times. From recording an epic album to inadvertently (or perhaps all too intentionally) destroying the first thing he has ever truly come to love, Jon finds himself the villain of his own story and must figure out how to make things right. What makes Frank so effective is the way it portrays the creative process – at once rationality and utter insanity – and the bonds forged in those moments of pure creation. And through it all, Frank&nbsp;is confident and complicated and utterly compelling, thanks to Fassbender’s masterful performance. His physicality conveys much, but his voice does a lot of the heavy lifting, taking Frank from childlike wonder to sage wisdom and powerful force of nature with ease. The music, written by Irish musician Stephen Rennicks, is the perfect blend of avant-garde and earwormy. It’s a beautifully bittersweet film worth checking out, but fair warning: it doesn’t make great family holiday viewing (sorry, mom).&nbsp;– Haña Lucero-Colin, Review Curation ManagerRecommended:&nbsp;The 50 Best Comedies of the 2010sAvengers: Infinity War (2018)  85%When I’m tasked with picking a favorite movie within any criteria, I naturally gravitate towards something I deem a little more unknown or under-appreciated. On my shortlist I had things like Stephen Chow’s artful Journey to the West, action-packed horror Train to Busan, and heartbreaking Bolivian drama Tu Me Manques, and yet I picked Avengers: Infinity War. Here’s why. Infinity War is one of the few superhero movies I occasionally revisit just to be delighted by its impressive accomplishments. In a little bit over 150 minutes of runtime, the Russo brothers brought together 10 years of stories with a multitude of characters into what became arguably the biggest event movie ever, when combined with its second and final part. It successfully delivers in excitement and cohesiveness, and makes history with the biggest movie cliffhanger of the decade. Sure, Endgame is great, but Infinity War is to the MCU what Empire Strikes Back was to Star Wars. – Julio De Oliveira, Director of Production&nbsp;Recommended:&nbsp;All MCU Movies, Ranked by TomatometerHell or High Water (2016)  96%David Mackenzie’s Hell or High Water is one of my favorite movies of the decade, and to me transcends the limits of what most think a western or heist film should be. This refreshingly honest tale about two estranged brothers played by the charming Chris Pine and the never-better Ben Foster has left a lasting impact on me after years of forgettable reboots, remakes, and re-imaginings have faded away. The poignant portrayal of the brothers’ relationship is set against the backdrop of a Recession-hit East Texas, where they team up in true Robin Hood style to steal from the small-town banks that are foreclosing on their family’s farm. In pursuit are two no-nonsense Texas Rangers – played by Jeff Bridges, who inhabits the role like a well-worn pair of cowboy boots, and&nbsp;Gil Birmingham&nbsp;– who just want to shut the brothers down before someone inevitably gets hurt. In lesser hands, this premise could have come across as a preachy political sermon, but thankfully, writer Taylor Sheridan (Oscar nominated for this screenplay) has no interest in playing the blame game, only in depicting what he calls “the death of a way of life” in a land where everything will either bite you or stick or you or sting you.&nbsp;– Jennifer Jevons, Sr. Social Media StrategistRecommended:&nbsp;Taylor Sheridan’s Five Favorite FilmsOnly Lovers Left Alive (2014)  86%I probably became a Jim Jarmusch fan when I randomly caught Night on Earth on cable as a teenager during the mid-’90s and instantly fell in love with it. And when I say I’m a fan, I mean that, while his films can be a little hit-or-miss for me, there is a certain mood – let’s call it a sort of romantic melancholy – his work evokes that always hits me where it counts. The first film he directed in the 2010s, Only Lovers Left Alive, ratchets that mood up to 11 and sustains it through a leisurely, dreamlike love story… about bloodsuckers. Tom Hiddleston and Tilda Swinton are magnetic as Adam and Eve, a pair of centuries-old married vampires who live halfway across the world from each other but reunite when one of them, the brooding musician Adam, becomes despondent and suicidal. It’s a mostly quiet, contemplative film that finds its two stars cruising the streets of a decrepit Detroit in the middle of the night and languishing in a Victorian house littered with antiques, vintage musical instruments, and outdated recording equipment, all set to an ethereal soundtrack composed by Jarmusch himself. But it’s also full of clever little touches that reference the history between Adam and Eve, and it features an outstanding supporting cast that includes John Hurt, Mia Wasikowska, Anton Yelchin, and Jeffrey Wright. The 2010s boasted a lot of fantastic releases, but this is the film that touched me in the most personal way, even if O negative isn’t my drink of choice. –&nbsp;Ryan Fujitani, Sr. EditorLike this?

For&nbsp;this special video series, which we’ve been publishing over the last four months, we spoke to the actors and filmmakers who made those moments happen, revealing behind-the-scenes details about how the moments came to be and diving deep into why they’ve stuck with us for so long.&nbsp;You’ll find big ’90s twists –&nbsp;yep, he sees dead people –&nbsp;as well as super-recent cliffhangers, like Thanos’s universe-halving Snap. There are laughs (The 40-Year-Old Virgin, Elf, Bridesmaids) and romance (The Notebook, Spider-Man) and more than a few scares (The Blair Witch Project, 28 Days Later…). But which moment is the single most memorable of the last 21 years? Well, that’s where you come in. We’re asking you to watch the below videos and then vote on your favorite movie moment of the last two decades (and a bit).Voting is open now&nbsp;and runs until midnight Friday August 16 and we will announce the winner on August 19. Fans get a single vote – so choose wisely – and moments are listed in the order they were published over the past few months, most often to tie in with anniversaries and relevant occasions.Take me to the voting!“Remember Me!?” from&nbsp;Mad Max: Fury Road (2015)  97%Director George Miller:&nbsp;“It’s a moment by the way, I think, is available only to her. I don’t think any other character could have done it. I remember the line. I remember Charlize on that day said that she wanted to say the line. It wasn’t a written line. She said, ‘Look, I feel like I really want to say it. OK by you?’ I said, ‘Great.’ It just hit a sweet spot in amongst that action, and it was a little pause before the brutality of the moment and the continuation of the action that was to come.”Read director George Miller’s full interview about the “Remember me!?” moment.The Snap from&nbsp;Avengers: Infinity War (2018)  85%Co-director Joe Russo:&nbsp;“Anth and I, through our entire experience at Marvel, always tried to make very disruptive choices with each film. The end of&nbsp;Winter Solider, good guys and the bad guys, we flip everything on its head. In&nbsp;Civil War&nbsp;we divorce the Avengers. With&nbsp;Infinity War&nbsp;we knew we wanted to make a strong narrative choice. There’s an adage where you write yourself into a corner, and you try to figure out how to get out. That usually creates really dramatic moments for the audience. There’s no bigger way to write ourselves into a corner than killing half the characters.”Read directors Joe and Anthony Russo’s full interview about the moment Thanos devastates the universe.Satine’s Entrance&nbsp;from&nbsp;Moulin Rouge! (2001)  76%Director Baz Luhrmann: “I thought, wouldn’t it be great if we put her in a circus trapeze and we did a trapeze number, but we’ll have to have a stunt person. But Nicole being Nicole was like, ‘No way.’ So she trained with a circus person for a good, I would say, two weeks to do that number and when you see her swing around that’s her. It’s her all the way through that footage. She’s on the trapeze, she’s being swung around, she comes down, she falls into all those guys. So she was 100% stunt-free on that moment.”Read director Baz Luhrmann and production and costume designer Catherine Martin’s full interview about Satine’s big moment.The Joker&nbsp;from&nbsp;The Dark Knight (2008)  94%Makeup artist John Caglione Jr.: “Heath [Ledger] was great in the chair. Special actors like Heath – and my experience with Al Pacino over the years – these actors help you relax so that you can bring your game… I always got the feeling that [Heath] had already worked it out in his head, from what I remember. He knew where he was going. Early on, in first meeting Heath and playing around with the makeup, he already kind of had it all figured out. It was my job to just basically gild the lily and try to catch up with him, really. That’s what I felt.”Read makeup artist&nbsp;John Caglione Jr. and&nbsp;marketing company 42 Entertainment CEO Susan Bonds’&nbsp;full interview about&nbsp;this&nbsp;iconic take on the Joker.Heather’s Confessional&nbsp;from&nbsp;The Blair Witch Project (1999)  86%Co-writer and co-director Eduardo Sánchez:&nbsp;“The direction was: You’re not going to make it out of here. This is like an internal monologue. We were directing these actors to almost be like their conscience speaking to them. For Heather, it’s like, ‘You’re responsible for this. You’re the one who brought them out here. You didn’t heed the warnings. You knew this is dangerous and you brought these guys out here. Say your goodbyes. If you want to apologize to people, apologize to people, just basically say goodbye.’ We called it a confessional, your last confessional before you’re going. You’re not going to get out, and hopefully, somebody will find these tapes and will be able to tell your story, but tell your mom goodbye, and tell your family goodbye.”Read&nbsp;writer-directors Eduardo&nbsp;Sánchez and Daniel Myrick’s full interview about&nbsp;Heather’s confessional.The Upside-Down Kiss from&nbsp;Spider-Man (2002)  90%Director Sam Raimi: “In the rain while he was doing the scene, I remember, he was slightly drowning because he couldn’t wipe his nose and the water was falling down into his upside-down nose, into his nostrils. So he was kinda drowning, and the only way he could breathe was through his mouth. It doesn’t look un-pleasurable, but I think it must’ve been.”Read Sam Raimi and stunt coordinator Jeff Habberstad’s full interview about&nbsp;the upside-down kiss.London is Deserted&nbsp;from&nbsp;28 Days Later (2003)  87%Director Danny Boyle:&nbsp;“One of the technical advantages of using these smaller cameras is that you could shoot a location, not multiple times, but you could shoot it from multiple viewpoints simultaneously. Cillian was in no rush, he could just walk across. But you don’t get much time at these locations free of people even at four o’clock in the morning when we shot. So what happened was we hired a lot of students, because they’re cheap, to be our traffic marshals.”Read Danny Boyle’s full interview about creating an eerily deserted London for the opening moments.A Kiss in the Rain&nbsp;from&nbsp;The Notebook (2004)  53%Director Nick Cassavetes:&nbsp;“There was something built up between these two kids, and it has nothing to do with directing. Because when we turned the cameras on, the scene was like: He’s mad at her, she’s mad at him, and then he says that he wrote her every day, and that’s the key that unlocks the door. And when that door got unlocked, I didn’t need to direct&nbsp;nothing. They wound up together for many years after the movie, which is…I don’t know if I’m proud of it, but I think it’s fantastic that they found each other like that. And I think that was the moment, because they weren’t together before that kiss. But they were together after that kiss, so maybe that was one of the deciding moments.”Read Nick Cassavetes’ full interview about the kiss in the rain moment.Crossing the Edmund Pettus Bridge from&nbsp;Selma (2014)  99%Representative John Lewis:&nbsp;“I truly believe that Oprah, Ava, and the staff working on the film sought my involvement because they knew my history. Selma represented an attempt to redeem the soul of America, to help us move closer to the participation of all people in the political process. This film can educate and inform the mind of hundreds and thousands of young people around America and around the world.”Read Representative John Lewis and actor Stephan James’s&nbsp;full interview about&nbsp;the final bridge-crossing moment.“Cars don’t fly!” from&nbsp;Furious 7 (2015)  82%Actor Vin Diesel:&nbsp;“And it was that moment where we realized that&nbsp;Fast and Furious&nbsp;didn’t need to be restricted in any way. That we were so thorough about story and character, and it’s so much a tale of brotherhood and family, right, that we were allowed these kind of outrageous and fantasy-filled moments, and flying through the air was playing to that. Flying from building to building was playing to that. It was one of those solutions to the riddle, or answers to the riddle, ‘How do we one-up the spectacle of each film?’”Read Vin Diesel’s&nbsp;full interview about&nbsp;the skyscraper-jump moment.Juan teaches Chiron to Swim in&nbsp;Moonlight (2016)  98%Cinematographer James Laxton:&nbsp;“When Barry alerted us to the storm approaching, we gathered our equipment together as quickly as possible, ran out into the water, and in some respects… I don’t want to say&nbsp;improvised, because what is in the script is on camera, if not in the exact way it was depicted. But we had a lot more shots in our shot list, and [were going to be] much more organized about capturing it.&nbsp;We had to really get out there and… let Mahershala as Juan guide this young man, and [have] me out in the water, as well, trying to capture this swimming lesson as it came. It [was shot] almost like a documentary, less so like a film in some respects. Sometimes your reaction to moments is as good as a well detailed plan might be. Sometimes it’s even better.”Read James Laxton’s&nbsp;full interview about&nbsp;the swimming lesson moment.Carl and Ellie in the Opening&nbsp;of&nbsp;Up (2009)  98%Director Pete Docter:&nbsp;“There’s one moment in that montage where Ellie has to go to the doctor and it’s implied that they can’t have children for whatever reason. That raised some eyebrows even here at work as we were developing the film. So, we did experiment with taking it out. And we thought, ‘Well, maybe [the sequence] could still work [without it] because there’s some really charming stuff.’ But the strange thing was, not only did we not feel the emotion as strongly in that one little sequence, but as we watched the rest of the film the whole film lost a little bit. I can’t really fully explain that other than to say it was a real dark, low moment for them that I think made that relationship feel more real. The sort of pain and loss of that situation bonded those characters together and made you empathize more with them.”Read&nbsp;Pete Docter’s&nbsp;full interview about Up‘s&nbsp;opening sequence.Gollum Talks to Smeagol&nbsp;from&nbsp;The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers (2002)  95%Actor&nbsp;Andy Serkis:&nbsp;“I’d never considered myself a voice actor, just a regular actor, and I had to kind of think my way into it. I started to work on this notion that he’s called Gollum because of the way he sounds – and what would make his voice sound like that? I started to think about constriction of the throat, and as I was doing that, I was actually fortunate enough to witness my cat throwing up a fur ball. It suddenly gave me this idea that the whole physicality of the role would be determined by this force within, which is kind of built out of guilt and torment – this involuntary physical action is what caused this sound coming out of his mouth. The cat throwing up a fur ball is actually what generated the idea for this involuntary spewing out of words.”Read Andy Serkis’s full interview about the Gollum-Smeagol moment.The Bridesmaids get Food Poisoning&nbsp;from&nbsp;Bridesmaids (2011)  90%Co-Writer Annie Mumolo:&nbsp;“We [originally] had a fantasy sequence where they go into the dress shop, and Kristen’s character tries on this dress and she has this fantasy that when she wears this dress, she’s all of a sudden in a castle. And all the men at the wedding are fawning over her. There’s so many of them wanting her so badly [that] just to escape from the castle she goes running out into this field and runs into the forest. And she naturally sees Christian Bale there, who’s chopping wood without a shirt on. And they end up on a bearskin rug, and he was combing her hair, and it was this expansive sequence of her little love affair with Christian Bale. In the meantime, [back in the real world] Helen gets the women to get the dress she wants because Annie is caught up in her fantasy. So that was the original [scene]. And then I think Judd said at one point we’ll never get Christian Bale to do this. And then we tried to put in Matt Damon and then we’re like, ‘As if we’re going to get Matt Damon to do this.’ He was concerned we weren’t going to get anybody to do it. And also he felt it needed harder comedy there, rather than what we had. So, we sadly let that go. We did not want to let that go. We loved that sequence.”Read&nbsp;Annie Mumolo and director Paul Feig’s full interview about the food-poisoning moment.Harry Potter and Lord Voldemort Duel from&nbsp;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - Part 2 (2011)  96%Director David Yates:&nbsp;“Harry sort of carries the spirit of Voldemort, in part, and they have this unity, and I had this idea that Harry and Voldemort are at the top of a school tower, and as they confronted each other… Dan would grab Ralph, and actually pull him off this tower, and they would apparate around the school together, and as they apparated around the school together, we’d explore this weird visual synthesis that exists between the two of them, and they’d eventually tumble down into the courtyard.”Read David Yates’ full interview about the confrontation between Harry and Voldemort.Avengers Assemble in New York&nbsp;from&nbsp;Marvel's The Avengers (2012)  91%Marvel Studios President Kevin Feige:&nbsp;“The moment I realized that this could be an iconic moment, not just for the MCU, but for these kind of films, was on the mix stage. When the effects were final and when Alan Silvestri’s amazing score was coming in, and the timing, and the experience of watching the whole movie up to that point… That[‘s when] I got chills and I realized Joss had pulled it off.”Read Kevin Feige’s full interview about the Avengers Assemble&nbsp;moment.The government lobby scene from&nbsp;The Matrix (1999)  88%Stunt double Chad Stahelski:&nbsp;“So Keanu and I both had to back up to our number one marks and pretty much try to do all the choreography and the one-handed cartwheel and all the shooting with your eyes closed. Because once the squibs started going off, you couldn’t see anything. You had to count your steps and kinda go into it. And I remember looking at him and going ‘Uh, OK, this could be a little tricky.’ And he’s like ‘Eh, OK.’ And he nailed it first take. So that was pretty cool.”Read Chad Stahelski’s full interview about the&nbsp;government lobby&nbsp;moment.“I See Dead People”&nbsp;from&nbsp;The Sixth Sense (1999)  86%Actor Haley Joel Osment:&nbsp;“There was an even-more morbid element to that scene that actually ended up getting cut out: When I tell Bruce my secret, [at] the last shot of the scene they pull back from my bed and you look out the window where you can see another entire wing of the hospital and in every window there is a person with some horrible injury or someone who’s gone pale because, you know, being in a hospital is a pretty heavy place for a ghost to linger around in this world. So, you pull back and you see all these people lined up on the other side of the frame.”Read Haley Joel Osment’s full interview about the “I see dead people” moment.The Chest-Waxing Scene&nbsp;from&nbsp;The 40 Year Old Virgin (2005)  85%Writer-director&nbsp;Judd Apatow:&nbsp;“I basically set up four cameras and we had some basic beats we wanted to hit. We knew that we had to get Steve’s real reactions, so we shot it like a documentary. We wrote out tons of curses, because we did plan the main joke to be that he would just curse right into her face. And we also made lists of words that weren’t real curses that sounded like curses. That’s how we got to Steve screaming ‘Kelly Clarkson!’ Off to the side, Seth Rogen had made this enormous list of curses, and I would just yell them out to Steve, and each time they ripped the hair off of something he would scream out one of the curses.”Read Judd Apatow’s full interview about the chest-waxing moment.“No Man’s Land” from&nbsp;Wonder Woman (2017)  93%Director Patty Jenkins:&nbsp;“I think that the biggest reason I was obsessed with [the scene] was really from a character place. From Diana’s point of view, it is: What is the birth of a superhero? Just like Superman pulling his shirt open the first time and revealing the ‘S,’ these are definitive, incredible moments, and so I knew that Wonder Woman needed an incredible moment and because we were doing her origin story, it really needed to be the moment that she made the decision to go from being a younger person who was hopeful and idealistic to one who decides to be a hero despite knowing more.

A man without a country in this strange land finally getting to see someone he knows really well – it would just be the most jubilant reaction ever.

Hit-Girl? Logan? We counted the curses, marked down the impalings, and we're crowning a motherf--king champ.by Mark Hofmeyer | May 17, 2018 |  CommentsAnticipation for Deadpool 2 is huge — very, f—ing huge. So f—ing huge, in fact, that Rotten Tomatoes readers voted it their most anticipated movie of the summer. It’s already Certified Fresh, too. (We hope that won’t go to DP’s head, but we’re not optimistic.) Part of the reason for that excitement? That blast of fresh air that was the first Deadpool, which introduced the “merc with a mouth” in a blaze of f-bombs, filthy jokes and broken fourth walls, and earned audience and critical adulation — the movie sits at 85% on the Tomatometer.It’s easy to forget that before Deadpool was calling people “s–t-spackled-Muppet-farts” and stuffing cigarette lighters into henchmen’s mouths, there were other R-rated superhero movies that featured over-the-top violence and delightfully controversial profanity. Remember the broody Crow? Or The Punisher —&nbsp;and Punisher: War Zone (don’t worry, neither do we). Or Kick-Ass’ Hit-Girl?How does Deadpool stack up against other foul-mouthed superheroes? We’re taking an MPAA-inspired approach, looking first at Strong Language, then at Strong Violence (we even calculated, or guesstimated, the amount of blood each “hero” spilled), and finally giving each of our heroes a&nbsp;Classification for their un-angelic ways.&nbsp;To keep things fair, we didn’t include data from any sequels or prequels or reboots (Wolverine makes this whole thing complicated), as Deadpool only has one film — until this Friday. So, let the potty-mouthed battle royale begin.Deadpool (Ryan Reynolds) in&nbsp;Deadpool (2016)  85%STRONG LANGUAGE?Total Profanities from Deadpool in Deadpool: 95 (that’s 42 f–ks, 26 s–ts, and 27 other colorful words — including three instances of “balls”)Best Line: “You only work for that s—t-spackled-Muppet-fart.”Deadpool features a deluge of inspired profanity (144 swear-y words in total). That may seem excessive, but when compared to Martin Scorsese’s The Wolf of Wall Street or Kevin Smith’s Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back (817 f-bombs between the two of them), you realize it’s not close to breaking any records. Some 95 of the movie’s profanities fly right out of our antihero’s mouth, and most are carefully crafted —&nbsp;Deadpool is the king of inspired wordplay and, if an f-bomb isn’t needed, he’s happy to let a pop culture reference or the word “avocado” carry the weight of the humor. Reynolds, alongside writers Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick (“the real heroes”), turned swearing into an art-form, and because of their efforts, we now have at-the-ready phrases like “British s–tstick” and “crime-fighting s–t swizzler,” should we ever need them.STRONG VIOLENCE?Pints of Blood Spilled: 30.Craziest Moment: A henchman hits a billboard and literally explodes like a blood-filled balloon.The violence in&nbsp;Deadpool&nbsp;isn’t as creative as the profanity, and mostly revolves around headshots, impalings, and more headshots. Deadpool is at its best when&nbsp;its lead&nbsp;is about to smoosh a henchman with a Zamboni, or when he uses dead henchmen to spell out “Francis.” Deadpool kills 42 people, which seems like a lot, but not so much when you look at other death-happy comic adaptations: See 2008’s&nbsp;Punisher: Warzone (87) or&nbsp;Blade&nbsp;(65). If it weren’t for Deadpool’s play-by-plays and his reactions during the carnage, the violence might even come across as slightly stock.Classification: The Deadpool creators knew their merc had a mouth, and allowed him to use it to turn swearing into an art form.Hit-Girl (Chloë Grace-Moretz) in&nbsp;Kick-Ass (2010)  76%STRONG LANGUAGE?&nbsp;Total profanities from Hit-Girl in&nbsp;Kick-Ass: 8 (that’s 2 f–ks, 1 c-bomb, and 5 other swear-y words — we’re counting “douche”)Best Line: “OK, you c—ts: Let’s see what you can do now.”Kick-Ass&nbsp;director Matthew Vaughn is a master provocateur who kicked off his directing career with the incredibly swear-y&nbsp;Layer Cake&nbsp;(210 f-bombs!) and moved onto the equally shocking&nbsp;Kick-Ass&nbsp;and&nbsp;Kingsman: The Secret Service, both of which included multiple moments that split audiences into two camps: He Went Too Far and We Want More. The Too Far camp will point out that having then 11-year-old Chloë&nbsp;Grace Moretz uttering the eight profanities that Hit-Girl unleashes in the film is “morally reprehensible,” as Roger Ebert wrote upon the film’s release. Hearing the tween Moretz saying words like “c–t” and “f–k” was certainly jarring, but more jarring — in retrospect — was her blunt deployment of the word “gay” in regards to the ineffective taser that Kick-Ass uses.STRONG VIOLENCE?Pints of Blood Spilled: 13.5.Craziest Moment: Hit-Girl makes a henchman shoot himself in the head with his own weapon.It’s crazy to think that the majority of the controversy surrounding Hit-Girl centered on her eight curse words and not the 41 people she kills. We first see what she’s capable of when she saves Kick-Ass from drug dealers in a close-quarters battle that features cheeky music, hacked-off legs, back slashes, and a woman being impaled with two blades as she is trying to run away. Hit-Girl is a murderous force of nature who enjoys close-up gun fights and stabbing her foes with tailored knives and spears to inflict maximum damage. The violence is insanely stylized, but not overly bloody — CGI does the majority of the blood work, which keeps the gore to a minimum. That’s a good thing, because if blood was allowed to spurt freely,&nbsp;Kick-Ass&nbsp;would’ve looked a lot like&nbsp;Evil Dead&nbsp;or&nbsp;Dead Alive.Classification:&nbsp;Hit-Girl’s eight word shock-and-awe blitzkrieg of offensiveness was wildly successful and got&nbsp;Kick-Ass&nbsp;tons of press, and a Certified Fresh Tomatometer score of 75%. “Gleeful profanity” says the Critics Consensus, while, as noted, some outliers found it all a bit “morally reprehensible.”Logan (Hugh Jackman)&nbsp;in&nbsp;Logan (2017)  93%(Photo by © 20th Century Fox Film Corp. )STRONG LANGUAGE?Total profanities from Logan in Logan: 47 (that’s 22 f–ks, 21 s–ts, and 4 more swear-y words, including one “dick”)Best Line: “Bad s–t happens to people I care about.”No gratuitous and overly clever potty-mouthing here — for Wolverine, it’s about character. Logan has seen a lot of s—t, and he vents his frustration by dropping f-bombs when his car won’t start or letting loose a quick “s—t” when a gang of mercenaries are laying waste to his home. It’s a bit of a shock to hear one of our favorite PG-13 heroes let her rip, but don’t forget that in X-Men: First Class he dropped a perfect “go f—k yourself” —&nbsp;the dude’s been mastering the one-off f-bomb for well over 60 years. The most impressive aspect of Logan, though, when it comes to the rude and crude, is that Professor X is the one who unleashes the most wonderfully blunt and curse-stuffed one-liners. Some of the best cinematic moments of 2017 involved Patrick Stewart unleashing gems like “I’m f–king 90” and “F–k off Logan” in his trademark baritone.STRONG VIOLENCE?Pints of Blood Spilled: 23.Craziest Moment: Logan uppercuts a henchman, claws unsheathed, and we actually see the blade go through&nbsp;the bad guy’s mouth and into his brain.Terrible things happen when two angry men (both played by Hugh Jackman) with adamantium claws are given a reason to start murdering people (45 people to be exact). The violence in&nbsp;Logan&nbsp;is close-quartered and dirty, because Logan and X-24 don’t use guns and need to be&nbsp;near their opponents to slice them in half. Their rages lead to severed limbs, decapitated heads, and so many puncture wounds it’s easy to lose count (though we didn’t, promise). Fans loved seeing Hugh Jackman receive a proper send-off in an R-rated movie — now the world knows what his claws can do without the PG-13 restrictions.Classification: The f—king awesome script was nominated for Best Adapted Screenplay at this year’s Academy Awards — and helped earn the movie a 93% on the Tomatometer.Blade (Wesley Snipes)&nbsp;in&nbsp;Blade (1998)  55%STRONG LANGUAGE?Total Blade Profanities from Blade in Blade: 5 (that’s 3 f–ks and 2 other swear-y words, including an “ass”)Best Line: “Some motherf—ers always trying to ice skate uphill.”Blade left the majority of the swearing to the villainous yuppie vampires and his assistant Whistler (Kris Kristofferson), which was a shrewd move, because when he did drop an f-bomb, it hit like a stake — or sword — to the heart. When Wesley Snipes swears in Blade, so sparingly, it just confirms&nbsp;the character&nbsp;is cooler everyone else — look at the time he turns to a security guard who just shot him and says “motherf—er are you out of your damn mind?” Also, kudos to Snipes for unironically unleashing one of the oddest f-bombs in vampire movie history&nbsp;— just try to get the image of ice skating uphill out of your head.STRONG VIOLENCE?Pints of Blood Spilled: 33 (and 32 pounds of ash).Craziest Moment: Blade rips a security guard’s throat out.The fight choreography in&nbsp;Blade&nbsp;is a&nbsp;marvel&nbsp;to behold (see what we did there?). It works because Snipes has the martial arts chops, and because a dedicated group of stuntmen allowed him to beat the crap out of them. Generous guys. The fights in the first&nbsp;Blade&nbsp;might be the best in comic book history (except perhaps for&nbsp;Blade 2), and the camera lingers appreciatively on the choreography — no quick-cut cheating here. Bloodwise, you don’t get much: that’s because the bad guys turn to ash when slain. However, gorehounds should note that there is a ridiculously awesome&nbsp;Roadhouse-esque throat rip, and three vampires literally explode, which boosts the blood count to a respectable total.Classification:&nbsp;Not super bloody for a movie about bloodsuckers, but Wesley Snipes found a great showcase for his martial arts skills and&nbsp;Blade&nbsp;is great because of it. Plus, keeping&nbsp;Blade’s f-bombs to a minimum meant that when they eventually came —&nbsp;ICE-SKATING UPHILL! — they landed like a perfectly executed triple axel.AND THE MOTHERF–KING WINNER IS…Don’t throw us at a billboard or anything guys, but it’s a motherf—ing draw. Deadpool swears the most, and Blade is the deadliest, but after looking at all four movies and the foul-mouthed heroes at their centers, it’s impossible to pick a winner. Each character had their moment to shine and none of them disappointed, so we’ve created five awards.Most Deadly: BladeMost Profane: DeadpoolMost Shocking: Hit-GirlMost Violent: LoganBiggest Loser: HenchmenLet us know your favorite R-rated comic book movies and moments in the comment section!","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"Shudder, classics, school, Guide, APB, dark, Walt, Song, Wars, Funimation, leads, Association, series","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"r-rated-superheroes-battle-royale-who-is-the-foulest-a-kicker-of-all"},{"id":"47612590221594","title":"50 Movies & TV Shows to Netflix and Chill with This Valentine’s Day","content":"Newsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})50 Movies &amp; TV Shows to Netflix and Chill with This Valentine's Dayby RT Staff | February 7, 2018 |  CommentsYou’ve had your Valentine’s Day&nbsp;dinner, shared some chocolate-dipped delights, and exchanged presents.

When does it take place? Is it a sequel or a spinoff, or both? We break down the details.by Eric Alt | June 24, 2020 |  CommentsZombie movies, like zombies themselves, always seem to be on the verge of a sluggish, protracted death only for a new filmmaker to come along and revitalize them yet again. Such was the case with Korean director Yeon Sang-ho’s 2016 film Train to Busan, which took its elevator pitch premise (“Zombies on a train!”) and turned it into a stylish, pulse-pounding, heartfelt thriller.Four years on, Yeon is ready to return with a film that — as you can see from its title — is more than just Train 2. Here’s what we know about Train to Busan Presents: Peninsula so far.There Won’t Be a Zombie Seok-woo(Photo by ©Well Go USA Entertainment)As you can probably guess from its Fast &amp; Furious Presents: Hobbs &amp; Shaw-like title, Peninsula will be set in the same world as the original movie, but isn’t a traditional sequel. Unfortunately, that means the hero of Train to Busan – Yoo Gong’s Seok-woo – really did sacrifice himself to save his daughter and won’t be returning either as one of the undead or as a bit of “Surprise! He survived!” plot trickery. Yeon has confirmed that Peninsula follows a wholly separate cast of new characters.The Title Refers to Korea Itself(Photo by ©Well Go USA)In some early interviews, director Yeon explained that in the new film, which is set four years after the original, all government authority in North and South Korea has been decimated, and there’s nothing really left to identify it as the civilizations they once were. So it’s no longer “Korea,” it’s simply “the peninsula.”Yeon Is Going Big(Photo by ©Well Go USA)While the claustrophobia of Train to Busan was a huge reason for its being so terrifyingly effective, Peninsula is aiming for a much larger scale (Yeon has been quoted saying that the scale of Peninsula will make Busan look like a tiny, indie film by comparison).The New Lead is From Busan, but Not From&nbsp;Busan(Photo by ©Well Go USA)Actor Gang Dong-won, who was supposed to make his Hollywood debut in 2019 in a currently shelved Simon West disaster film called&nbsp;Tsunami LA, actually hails from Busan, South Korea in real life (but was not in the first film in this series). In Peninsula, Dong-won plays Jung Seok, a soldier who managed to escape from the “peninsula” only to be ordered to return along with a new group of soldiers on a mysterious retrieval mission.It’s Less Sociological Study, More&nbsp;Mad Max(Photo by ©Well Go USA)The original movie featured a cross section of South Korean society, from workaholic salary-man Seok-woo to arrogant and selfish COO Yon-suk to a PTSD-ridden homeless man, all having their everyday lives thrown into chaos when the zombies appear. Yeon has cited films like Land of the Dead, The Road, The Road Warrior, and Mad Max: Beyond Thunderdome as main influences on Peninsula, which would indicate a more post-apocalyptic action flick than just zombie invasion horror.And We Mean a Lot more&nbsp;Mad Max, as in “Zombie Thunderdome”(Photo by ©Well Go USA)One of the first stills released from Peninsula appears to show some kind of fighting arena where survivors are thrown into the octagon against zombies, and the first trailer includes footage that backs up this idea. This also tracks with Yeon’s claims that he is exploring a world in ruin, where society has broken down and there are new, more savage, rules at play. Jung Seok and his fellow soldiers will find their mission jeopardized when they discover a group of survivors in this savage world trying to get off the peninsula.Peninsula Might Feel Timely, but It Won’t Address the Origin of the Zombie VirusPeninsula was in the works before the COVID-19 pandemic shut down the world, but Yeon claims that people are now seeing the sort of selfishness that leads to the tragedy he explored in Busan. He has teased that any origin or explanation for what caused the zombie outbreak would be fodder for another film. That said,&nbsp;Peninsula&nbsp;is technically the third film in the franchise; Yeon started his career as an animator, and in fact planned on making Train to Busan as an animated film until a producer encouraged him to consider live action. However,&nbsp;Yeon had done an animated film called Seoul Station that was made before Busan but released after, serving as a prequel to that film.Train to Busan Presents: Peninsula&nbsp;does not have an official release date in the US yet, but is expected sometime in Summer 2020.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"all-time, Watching, new, elevated, Hulu, international, stoner, Winter, furious, Star, classics, drama, Broadway","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"everything-we-know-about-train-to-busan-presents-peninsula"},{"id":"47612572954902","title":"Gotham Awards 2016 Winners Announced: Moonlight Is Best Feature","content":"Newsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Gotham Awards 2016 Winners Announced: Moonlight Is Best Featureby RT Staff | November 28, 2016 |  CommentsThe IFP Gotham Awards took place tonight at Cipriani Wall Street in New York City, celebrating the biggest accomplishments of the independent filmmaking community in 2016.

While it’s difficult to say whether this will ultimately have a substantial impact on this year’s winners, it was still something we had to consider when we put our heads together and attempted to figure out who would walk away with trophies this weekend.&nbsp;Last year we were 16/24, and there are some tough categories this year, so we’re keeping our fingers crossed! See&nbsp;below to read through our full list of Oscar predictions.Best Picture:&nbsp;La La Land (2016)  91%Since Damien Chazelle’s love letter to Los Angeles hit the festival circuit last Fall, plenty of pundits have been predicting this as not simply a contender, but the favorite to win Sunday’s big prize.&nbsp; Yes, there’s been a backlash, and Moonlight seems to be gaining some late-race momentum, but in the end, La La Land will take Best Picture.Best Director:&nbsp;Damien Chazelle,&nbsp;La La Land (2016)  91%Photo by Alberto E. Rodriguez / Getty Images for DGAThere’s a chance this year that we’ll see a split between the awards for Directing and Best Picture, but if that happens, it will only be because Moonlight takes Best Picture. La La Land&nbsp;expertly balances big dance numbers and smaller character moments, and we think that will propel Damien Chazelle into the win here.Best Actor: Denzel Washington,&nbsp;Fences (2016)  92%Denzel is our late-breaking favorite here, most notably winning Best Actor at this years’ SAG Awards. The acting branch of the Academy is the largest branch, and we predict that SAG win will match up with an Oscar win on Sunday night.Best Actress: Emma Stone,&nbsp;La La Land (2016)  91%This is another category where we think the recent SAG winner will strike gold again on Oscar night. Stone puts in a terrific performance that’s going to resonate with any Academy member that’s endured a painful audition process.Best Supporting Actor: Mahershala Ali,&nbsp;Moonlight (2016)  98%Mahershala Ali is a strong favorite in this category. Dev Patel is close, but Ali has won a dozen other awards (according to our leaderboard), and we think the streak will continue on Oscar night.Best Supporting Actress: Viola Davis, Fences (2016)  92%If there’s one “gimme” for the night, it’s this one. You can argue that it’s not exactly a supporting role, but that doesn’t matter. Viola Davis is going to walk with this one.Best Original Screenplay:&nbsp;Manchester by the Sea (2016)  96%We’ve predicted that Kenneth Lonergan’s film will get mostly shut out in various categories on Sunday night, but we think this is the one race that it’s mostly likely to win. The other nominees are strong contenders, but we think Manchester by the Sea will take home this one (and only this one).Best Adapted Screenplay:&nbsp;Moonlight (2016)  98%Barry Jenkins did some impressive work adapting Tarell Alvin McCraney’s play into a film, most notably rearranging the structure into a more linear story and letting relatively sparse dialogue have dramatic impact. We think the voters will notice too, and that Jenkins can count on at least one award of his own on Sunday night.Best Animated Feature: Zootopia (2016)  98%This isn’t a lock, but Zootopia arguably has the broadest appeal of all the movies in the category. The strongest challenger here is Kubo, but we think Zootopia will still win.Best Foreign Language Film: The Salesman (Forushande) (2017)  96%Asghar Farhadi has previously won this same award for A Separation in 2011, and we think he’ll win again this year.Best Documentary Feature: O.J.: Made in America (2016)  100%This is another category with some great contenders, but we think O.J.: Made in America will be the ultimate winner, narrowly edging out 13th and I Am Not Your Negro.Best Cinematography:&nbsp;La La Land (2016)  91%There was a lot of disagreement in the Tomatoplex over this category. Each of the nominees had their champions on the RT team, but after thinking about the dance numbers, especially the opening number on the freeway, most of our votes went to La La Land.Best Film Editing:&nbsp;Arrival (2016)  94%We think Arrival takes this one largely due to how it deftly moves through various times in Louise’s life, and how that jumping around is the key to understanding the movie.Best Production Design:&nbsp;Hail, Caesar! (2016)  85%This Coen brothers farce recreated 50s-era Tinseltown with such flair that we think it’s going to resonate with Academy members more than the other nominees.Best Costume Design:&nbsp;Jackie (2016)  87%So many of the reviews for this movie mention how the film really nailed Jackie’s look and style. We think that Academy voters will have noticed that too.Best Original Score:&nbsp;La La Land (2016)  91%The Oscar for music has to go to the musical this year right? We’ll frankly be shocked if this doesn’t happen.Best Original Song: “City of Stars,” La La Land (2016)  91%Although there’s a risk that the two songs from La La Land will sabotage each others’ chances, we’re still pretty sure that “City of Stars” will be the winner here.Best Visual Effects:&nbsp;The Jungle Book (2016)  94%This category caused a lot of disagreement in the Tomatoplex. A lot of us really think that Doctor Strange could take this one, but more of us think that the seamless mix of CGI and practical effects in The Jungle Book will get the most votes.Best Makeup &amp; Hairstyling:&nbsp;Suicide Squad (2016)  26%In spite of the Tomatometer, we think Suicide Squad will eke out a win over the other contenders here.Best Sound Mixing:&nbsp;Rogue One: A Star Wars Story (2016)  84%There’s a great mix of familiar and new audio elements in the Star Wars universe, and that’s going to help make Rogue One an Oscar winner on Sunday night.Best Sound Editing:&nbsp;Arrival (2016)  94%The various sounds created for this film that become such an essential part of the story are going to cement a win for Arrival.Best Animated Short:&nbsp;Piper (2016)  100%Believe it or not, Pixar hasn’t won an Oscar for Best Animated Short since For the Birds back in 2002. We think their latest avian adventure, the adorable Piper, will win the hearts of the Academy.Best Live Action Short: Enemies within (Ennemis intérieurs) (2016) The tense, topical Enemies Within (Ennemis Intérieurs) – about a French police officer interrogating an Algerian immigrant – touches on such hot-button issues as immigration, terrorism, and patriotism at a moment when tensions are rife across continents. Several of the Live Action shorts are lighter in tone, but Enemies Within feels particularly urgent.Best Documentary Short: The White Helmets (2016)  100%It’s not uncommon for the short docs to tackle heavy subject matter, but this year’s slate is especially heartbreaking, with three entries focusing on the Syrian Civil War. The White Helmets, which follows volunteer rescue workers operating in the war zone, has a power and immediacy that is certain to resonate with Academy voters.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"Grant, 2017, Marvel, News, independent, Films, aliens, spanish","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"rotten-tomatoes-predicts-the-oscars-2017"},{"id":"47612599368989","title":"10 Game-Changing Zombie Movies From the Last 10 Years","content":"Newsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})10 Game-Changing Zombie Movies From the Last 10 YearsThink the zombie genre's stale? Check out these brainy, gory, and super-original recent flicks that have pushed the genre forward.by Rafael Motamayor | October 31, 2019 |  Comments(Photo by © Saban Films)Every time a new zombie movie – or new season of The Walking Dead – comes out, cries of the death of creativity and the oversaturation of the genre start flooding in.Though the days of George A. Romero may be gone, the zombie sub-genre has never been as popular as it is now, with new projects coming out constantly. Some are bound to be less than stellar, but if you look hard enough you can still find innovative and unique zombie movies that remind you why we’re still so fascinated with the undead.To help you plan your Halloween watch-list with some spooky brain-eating ghouls that you may not have seen, we’ve put together a list highlighting 10 zombie movies from this decade that changed the game and showed there is still plenty of life left in the genre.One Cut of the Dead (Kamera o tomeru na!) (2019)  100%The Japanese horror-comedy sensation One Cut of the Dead is one of the biggest word-of-mouth phenomena since Paranormal Activity, picking up awards at every festival it played. Part zombie horror-comedy, part love letter to cinema and filmmakers in the same vein as Ed Wood, the film starts with a 30-minute one-take (hence the title) showing the making of an indie zombie film before evolving into a razor-sharp satire that puts everything that came before it in a new light. Critic Germain Lussier wrote for io9: “There are good movies, there are great movies, and then there are movies that deliver joy to every bone in your body. One Cut of the Dead is all of those and more.” You’ll want to gather as big a crowd as you can and see this movie at least twice to get all the little details that will have you laughing until your sides hurt.One Cut of the Dead is available on Shudder.Train to Busan (Busanhaeng) (2016)  94%A father boards a train with his daughter. What he and the other passengers don’t know is that the zombie apocalypse is breaking out right as the train leaves the station, with the last passenger on board being infected. Train to Busan is not only one hell of an impressive live-action debut for Yeon Sang-ho – it’s a fast-paced, action-packed horror film in a claustrophobic location – but also knows when to pull on your heart strings. This is not one of those horror shows where you’re just impatiently waiting for the characters to get the death they deserve, but one where you dread watching your favorite character bite the dust. Dork Shelf’s&nbsp;Jason Gorber writes: “Far more than just a series of slaughterings, the film transports its audience through an emotional voyage that provides some deadly fun with emotionally charged drama.”Train to Busan is available on Netflix.Anna and the Apocalypse (2018)  77%Sometimes all you need to know if a movie is for you is a description like “Scottish zombie Christmas high-school musical horror comedy.” Managing to not only be a funny and entertaining Halloween movie, but also a sweet and heartfelt Christmas movie, Anna And the Apocalypse has something for holiday fans of all stripes. With a cast that’s instantly likeable, joyous zombie gore, and a soundtrack you won’t get out of your head, this charming genre mash-up will sing and kill its way to your annual Christmas and Halloween watchlist. As Film School Rejects&nbsp;critic Rob Hunter puts it: “If you’re not smiling during this one, you’re probably an a**hole.”Anna And The Apocalypse is available to rent and purchase on VOD.Juan of the Dead (2012)  83%The zombie sub-genre has always been used for political commentary, from Romero’s Night of the Living Dead to Edgar Wright’s Shaun of the Dead. In 2012 we got a zombie film from an unlikely country that wasn’t just funny and gory, but a fantastic commentary on its complex politics: the Cuban zombie film Juan of the Dead. After Cuba is overrun with zombies, former petty thief Juan discovers he can make a decent living by starting a zombie-killing business. From there on, the film becomes a slapstick comedy with a big heart that also offers sharp insights into Cuban politics. J Hurtado wrote for ScreenAnarchy: “Polished and heartfelt, Juan brings a new voice in genre filmmaking from a land hamstrung by politics for decades.”Juan of the Dead is available on Shudder.Cargo (2018)  88%While many zombie films focus on an ensemble that has to face multitudes of flesh-eating ghouls, Yolanda Ramke and Ben Howling’s Cargo takes a more minimalistic approach. We follow Martin Freeman in what’s pretty much a one-man show as he has to take care of his infant child just as he discovers that he’s infected and has but a couple of days to live. Taking full advantage of its desolate and vast Australian setting and a career-redefining performance by Freeman, the movie manages to also offer riveting commentary on colonialism and even fracking. Cargo is a heartbreaking movie that will have you drowning in tears. Writing for Starburst, critic Paul Mount said: “It’s a movie about humanity, humility and determination when all is truly lost. It’s a tragic road movie with a wonderfully optimistic finale which will uplift you even as it tears you apart. Wonderful.”Cargo is available on Netflix.Overlord (2018)  81%What if, when American paratroopers dropped into France on the eve of D-Day, they not only found Nazis, but zombies? Overlord is a throwback to B-movies of old. It’s like a ‘50s horror comic book brought to life via a gritty, slow-burn war movie that turns into a sci-fi horror splatterfest. It’s a lot. The movie, produced by J.J. Abrams, is sure to please fans of Re-Animator and anyone looking for some loud, ridiculous. and blood-soaked fun. As critic Leigh Monson wrote for Birth.Movies.Death: “Overlord is a loud, intense, Nazi-punching good time.”Overlord is available to rent and purchase on VOD.Little Monsters (2019)  79%Many of us owe a lot of who are today to our teachers, and writer-director Abe Forsythe knows this. His zombie rom-com Little Monsters is a love letter to the great kindergarten teachers that keep us safe and teach us about the world, while at the same time delivering a raunchy, profane, gory, and all-out hilarious laugh fest that’s part R-rated horror-comedy and part The Magic Bus. Five years after winning her first Academy Award, Lupita Nyong’o shows she is a force to be reckoned with in one of the year’s standout roles (and combined with Us, further evidence she is a landmark scream queen). You’ll never listen to Taylor Swift the same way again. Collider’s critic Perri Nemiroff writes: “A delightfully crude, wild ride with a standout performance that continues to prove Lupita Nyong’o can do no wrong, and also serves as a nice reminder of the importance of a great teacher.”Little Monsters is available on Hulu.Ravenous (Les affamés) (2018)  88%This is the first zombie film to be made not just in Quebec, Canada, but in the state’s regional language of Quebecois. Ravenous takes an all-too-familiar story – the group of survivors assembling and looking for shelter while being picked off one by one –&nbsp;and punctuates it with innovative new ideas. For one thing, these zombies seemingly build structures and communicate with each other. The result is an original and nuanced zombie arthouse film that’s as visually stunning as it is full of dread. Critic Heather Wixson writes for Daily Dead: “For as much as Aubert relies on familiar tropes here, he also brings some unique twists to the table for Les Affamés, and I’d be interested to see whatever he does next.”Ravenous is available on Netflix.The Girl With All the Gifts (2017)  85%What if some kids could carry the zombie virus – and suffer from the craving for human flesh it inspires – but still remain seemingly regular kids? According to The Girl with All the Gifts, those kids would be kept in secret bunkers by the government and studied like lab rats. Aided by typically excellent work from Glenn Close and a breakthrough performance from newcomer Sennia Nanua, Gifts offers a captivating story of what it means to be human while still delivering the horror goods. Collider&nbsp;critic Haleigh Foutch writes: “The Girl with All the Gifts puts the audience back in touch with the scariest thing about zombies – that they are not monsters at all, just human beings altered by the unstoppable tide of nature’s will.”The Girl with All the Gifts is available to rent and purchase on VOD.Rampant (2018)  62%You’ve seen zombies in modern times and in WWII, but what about zombies in medieval Korea? If you’ve ever wanted to see Lord of the Rings-style epic battles with swords clashing and arrows flying over everyone’s head, but with flesh-eating zombies, Rampant is the film for you. With exquisite costume design and stunning choreography, this tale of a prodigal prince who must step up and defend his home from zombies is at times a prestige costume drama and at times a gorefest of biblical proportions. Houston Chronicle’s Cary Darling writes: “The swashbuckling, bloodthirsty South Korean film Rampant is a rollicking genre mash-up that’s what you might get if Hamlet were being chased by the undead for two hours.”Rampant is available on Netflix.Like this?

Or The Dark Knight's mysterious scavenger hunt? Or Deadpool just generally being Deadpool? There's a reason you do.by James Grebey | March 26, 2019 |  Comments(Photo by 20th Century Fox)Blockbuster movies cost a bunch of money to make – jaw-dropping special effects and big-name actors&nbsp;don’t come cheap. In order to make the expense worth it, movie studios need to pull out all the stops to get moviegoers to buy tickets once the film premieres, and that typically involves a killer marketing campaign. These days, slick trailers, along with all sorts of unique real-world stunts and marketing gimmicks,&nbsp;can be as much of a production as the final movie itself.These memorable marketing campaigns take different forms — sometimes it just takes a really well-done trailer and a memorable use of a song, as seen and heard in the trailer for Jordan Peele’s Us, which retools Luniz’s “I’ve Got 5 on It” in a deliciously creepy way. Other times movie marketers will stage mysterious real-world stunts to get excited fans involved. Whatever the method, a well-done marketing campaign for a well-done movie often means box office success.Here are 10 of the most memorable movie marketing campaigns we’ve seen.Jaws 2 (1978)  59% and&nbsp;Alien (1979)  98%(Photo by Universal Pictures/20th Century Fox Film Corp.)Studio: Universal Pictures / 20th Century FoxWhy you remember it: Because of two incredible taglines.Let’s kick things off with a tie, as both films are shining examples of an older era of promotion, before viral marketing was a thing. Jaws was the first blockbuster, but Jaws 2 was briefly the highest-grossing sequel of all time until Rocky II bested it the following year. Part of the film’s success likely has to do with one of the greatest taglines of all time — “Just when you thought it was safe to get back in the water” — the work of famed and innovative producer Andrew J. Kuehn.The following year, Alien came around with one of the other great taglines in movie history, “In space, no one can hear you scream.” Neither of these movies had real-world promotional activations, but they were united in memorable taglines that, thanks to their use of the second-person, made would-be viewers feel part of the cinematic horrors to come.Did it work?&nbsp;As mentioned, Jaws 2 was a huge success, pulling in $208 million. Alien’s box office figure is a little disputed, as some creative Hollywood accounting originally recorded the film as a loss for Fox, but it went on to spawn an iconic, acclaimed sci-fi horror series. And, of course, those two taglines are now forever seared into the public consciousness.Deadpool (2016)  85%&nbsp;Studio: 20th Century FoxWhy you remember it: Because Ryan Reynolds is Deadpool.Deadpool is known as the Merc with a Mouth, and the film’s promotional team sure did have a lot to say about the film. There was so much marketing, and all of it projected an irreverent, slightly naughty sense of fun. There were parody posters, custom emojis, a feud with Wolverine (and Hugh Jackman), a costume reveal via faux-nude spread, and a flaming bag of poop yule log, to name just a few campaign highlights. Then there was Reynolds, who, as the person most responsible for making Deadpool happen, projected his passion for the wise-cracking hero and modeled his own social presence after the Merc.Two years after Deadpool was released, Reynolds and the Fox marketing team went even harder with the promotion of Deadpool 2, taking over the DVD covers of other popular movies at Walmart and handling Stephen Colbert’s late-night monologue duties, before going further yet for in its meta promotion of Once Upon a Deadpool. The marketing behind the franchise is now officially one of the reasons we look forward to another Deadpool movie.Did it work?&nbsp;Deadpool made $785 million at the box office and became the highest-grossing R-rated film ever. Not bad for a superhero movie.The Social Network (2010)  96%&nbsp;Studio: Columbia PicturesWhy you remember it: Because “you don’t get to 500 million friends without making a few enemies.”David Fincher’s moody bio-pic about Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg is really an exceptional villain origin story, and the marketing for the film made that clear. The first trailer is scored to a haunting cover of Radiohead’s “Creep” as sung by a children’s choir, illustrating how there was something unsettling behind all this “friending.” Then there’s the poster, which features Mark Zuckerberg (Jesse Eisenberg) looking at the viewer from the shadows, his face obscured by the memorable and ominous tagline in a crisp Futura font. Both the “choral cover of pop song” and “poster with words on a face” would go on to be often-imitated promotional tropes, but they were just the Google Plus to The Social Network’s Facebook.Did it work?&nbsp;The Social Network made $224.9 million and was nominated for or won a host of major awards. Plus,&nbsp;Zuckerberg had some qualms with the movie – so that’s a success.Psycho (1960)  96%&nbsp;Studio: Paramount PicturesWhy you remember it: Because of the secrecy and Alfred Hitchcock’s suspenseful set tour.Modern moviegoers who were too young to remember seeing Psycho in theaters probably remember Hitchcock’s iconic slasher for the famous shower scene. Hitchcock knew that would be the case. Movie trailers weren’t what they were back then — the idea of multi-level movie marketing as we know it today didn’t really emerge until the late ’90s. But, Hitchcock was the master of suspense, and he knew how to get an audience shaking with curiosity and anticipation. The trailer for Psycho featured Hitchcock giving a tour of the Bates Motel, offering gory hints of what horrors might have happened there but stopping just short of giving anything away. That, along with a campaign to keep the shocking twist in the movie a secret – which went so far as preventing Paramount Studio execs from reading the script – had audiences eager to see what happened.Did it work?&nbsp;Psycho cost about $800,000 to make and made more than $40 million during its initial release — and this is in 1960s dollars! It was a huge hit, went on to enjoy multiple theatrical reissues, and is generally regarded as a landmark horror movie. So, yeah, Hitchcock’s a great tour guide.Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan (2006)  91%&nbsp;(Photo by @ 20th Century Fox)Studio: 20th Century FoxWhy you remember it: Because of Sacha Baron Cohen’s in-character interviews as Borat.It’s fitting that a movie that blurred the lines between comedy and documentary (not to mention acting and reality) would have a similarly meta promotional campaign. Borat wasn’t a new creation, as Cohen’s character had been on the Da Ali G Show for years, but he wasn’t widely known. That let Cohen dupe the movie’s subjects — as well as many would-be ticket-buyers – into thinking that this kooky Borat character might be on the level.Did it work?&nbsp;Borat made $262 million at the box office, much to Kazakhstan’s chagrin.Cloverfield (2008)  78%&nbsp;Studio: Paramount PicturesWhy you remember it: Because of all the rampant speculation about the top-secret mystery plot.A good marketing campaign doesn’t give everything away, it just teases some of the best stuff so that moviegoers are excited to see the rest. Cloverfield’s marketing was so memorable because it gave, well, essentially nothing away. The first trailer, which came by surprise ahead of Transformers screenings, didn’t even include the movie’s title or any plot details. This, along with some innovative virtual tie-ins (shout-out to MySpace), had fans wondering what it might be. A Lost movie? A Godzilla film? An anime adaptation? Something new?Did it work?&nbsp;Like The Blair Witch Project, which pioneered this type of hype-building mystery promotion, Cloverfield was a hit. The film made $170.8 million against a budget of $25 million, and spawned a whole franchise/”universe” of sci-fi films united mostly by viral marketing, though none were as successful as the original.Inception (2010)  87%&nbsp;(Photo by @ Warner Bros. Pictures)Studio: Warner Bros. PicturesWhy you remember it: Because of the spinning top mind-game (and the “BWWAAHHHH” sound).Warner Bros. spent $100 million to market Inception, an increasingly rare blockbuster that was wholly original, not a sequel nor an adaptation. To get people excited about an unknown quantity, the studio banked on Christopher Nolan’s post-Dark Knight appeal and made an online viral game involving the spinning top that diehard fans tried to solve. The game unlocked the official trailer, and that was a great piece of advertising too, in no small part because of the booming Inception sound that rightfully became a meme.Did it work?&nbsp;The marketing certainly planted the idea of going to see this movie in a lot of people’s’ heads, because Inception made $828.3 million at the box office.The Dark Knight (2008)  94%&nbsp;(Photo by @ 20th Century Fox)Studio: Warner Bros. PicturesWhy you remember it: Because you solved an interactive mystery across a virtual Gotham City, and Heath Ledger’s untimely death.The heroes of DC Comics save the day in fictional cities, like Metropolis. But, to promote the second (and best) of Christopher Nolan’s three Batman movies, the alternate reality game company 42 Entertainment made Gotham City real. Using websites like WhySoSerious.com, fake Gothamite newspapers, and Harvey Dent campaign materials, 42 Entertainment sent fans on a scavenger hunt all over the web and the physical United States — starting with San Diego’s Comic-Con, where one reward was the first image of the movie’s Joker. It gave fans a tantalizing glimpse of the drama to come, and let them feel like the Batman, the World’s Greatest Detective, himself. Add to that the tragedy of Heath Ledger’s untimely death ahead of the premiere of his incredible performance as the Joker, and you’ve got a super-powered level of expectations.Did it work?&nbsp;The Dark Knight made over $1 billion at the box office and was popular enough to change the way the Academy Awards work.Paranormal Activity (2009)  83%&nbsp;Studio: Paramount PicturesWhy you remember it: Because you had to demand it.Paranormal Activity was an extremely inexpensive movie, one that seemed destined for a modest indie release and perhaps a chance at becoming a cult classic. But, the marketing team at Paramount had the bright idea of democratizing horror.&nbsp;Trailers were released featuring night-vision footage of shocked and delighted viewing audiences and promising a scary theater experience; would-be moviegoers had to vote on a website, hoping that there would be enough fan demand for Paramount to bring the film to their city or town. The website, which was made with the user-driven event calendar company Eventful’s help, added a sense of urgency and participation in what otherwise might have just been an overlooked found-footage flick.Did it work?&nbsp;Paranormal Activity cost just $15,000 to make, and it made more than $193 million at the box office. It is, by most accounts, the most profitable movie ever made.The Blair Witch Project (1999)  86%&nbsp;Studio: Artisan EntertainmentWhy you remember it: Because you thought it was real.Without The Blair Witch Project’s marketing, there would be no Cloverfield, no Inception, and essentially no viral movie marketing as we know it today. In the early days of the internet, Artisan Entertainment’s scrappy online team created a website and surrounding hype campaign that&nbsp;claimed&nbsp;the story of the Blair Witch&nbsp;was true. There were interviews with the “missing” characters’ parents and backstories from investigators trying to solve this “true” story. In the real world, missing posters went up around colleges and at film festivals. Because of all the marketing, The Blair Witch Project wasn’t just a low-budget indie horror flick — it was a real, ongoing mystery. Moviegoers and internet users have gotten more media-savvy, so this feat likely won’t be equaled, but The Blair Witch Project was the perfect storm, a way to use technology, advertising, and psychology to turn “based upon a true story” into box office gold.Did it work?&nbsp;The Blair Witch Project made $248,639,099, which is more than 4,000 times what it cost to make the movie. Also, admit it — you thought, for a second, that it was a documentary.What were some of&nbsp;your favorite movie marketing campaigns? Let us know in the comments!Like this?

Chandor’s gritty crime drama and a Cannes-winning film starring Marion Cotillard. Then, we’ve got a few interesting selections you may not have had the chance to see in theaters. Read on for details:A Most Violent Year (2015) 90%Early on, A Most Violent Year was thought to be a contender for a handful of Academy Awards, due in large part to its pedigree, which included Oscar-nominated writer-director J.C. Chandor (Margin Call, All Is Lost) and a pair of fast-rising stars — Jessica Chastain and Oscar Isaac — who have amassed their own share of critical acclaim. Though the film ultimately didn’t net any nominations, critics still rated it Certified Fresh at 90 percent. The early ’80s-set thriller centers on an immigrant couple (Chastain and Isaac) who run a heating oil company and their attempts to make good on the American dream amid the rampant violent crime of New York City. It’s a heavy, slow burner of a drama full of strong performances — including supporting turns from David Oyelowo, Albert Brooks, and Alessandro Nivola — that probably deserves a watch.The Immigrant (2014) 87%Speaking of impressive casts, director James Gray lined up quite an ensemble for his own immigrant story, aptly titled The Immigrant. All three of his leads boast Academy Award nominations, and the film’s star, Marion Cotillard, earned a nod just this year for her work on Two Days, One Night. Cotillard plays Ewa Cybulski, a Polish immigrant who arrives at Ellis Island in 1921 and faces deportation, only to be saved by a charming schemer (Joaquin Phoenix) who forces her into prostitution. When the man’s magician cousin (Jeremy Renner) comes into her life, Ewa sees hope for the first time. Certified Fresh at 87 percent, The Immigrant won the Palmes d’Or at Cannes and earned praise for Cotillard’s performance, Gray’s sure-handed direction, and its stunning cinematography. If drama is your thing, this is a good week.&nbsp;ALSO AVAILABLE THIS WEEK:Happy Valley (2014) (88 percent), Amier Bar-Lev’s documentary profile of the football culture and recent controversy surrounding Penn State University.Killers (2014) (86 percent), a Japanese-Indonesian thriller about a serial killer and the journalist thousands of miles away he inspires to become a killer himself.The Voices (2015) (73 percent), starring Ryan Reynolds and Anna Kendrick in Marjane Satrapi’s (Persepolis) dark comedy about a seemingly normal man who suffers from hallucinations that influence him to kill.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"Premium","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"new-on-dvd-and-blu-ray-a-most-violent-year-the-immigrant-and-more"},{"id":"47612774342968","title":"10 Hidden Gems of The Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 Stars","content":"Newsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})10 Hidden Gems of The Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 Starsby Alex Vo and Ryan Fujitani | April 16, 2017 |  CommentsGuardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is fast approaching but did you know that its cast members have previously acted in other movies outside the franchise? And that some of them were good? We take the 10 biggest stars of Marvel’s intergalactic, planetary adventure and give you some Fresh and Certified Fresh movies of theirs that you may have missed. Put these on the mixtape!Chris Pratt&nbsp;(Peter Quill / Star-Lord)Film: Wanted&nbsp;(2008,  71%). This adaptation of the Mark Millar comic stars James McAvoy as an underachieving, over-medicated corporate drone who’s enlisted by the mysterious Angelina Jolie to join a secret fraternity of assassins, hone his hidden superhuman strength, and avenge his father’s murder.Role: A movie starring Angelina that made $350 million worldwide isn’t your normal “hidden gem,” but amidst the bullet curving and car chases it’s easy to forget Pratt’s role. He plays McAvoy’s delightful douchebag co-worker and memorably takes a keyboard to the face. Pratt essentially played the same dude in the first season of Parks &amp; Recreation&nbsp;before the character was re-written, turning him into a TV fan favorite and eventual legendary space outlaw.Watch TrailerZoe Saldana&nbsp;(Gamora)Film: Infinitely Polar Bear&nbsp;(2015,  82%).&nbsp;Sometimes when Mark Ruffalo gets mad, he turns into the green smashing Hulk. And sometimes he goes to the hospital and has his kids taken away from him, as in this bipolar disorder-addressing drama from Maya Forbes.Role: Saldana plays Ruffalo’s long-suffering wife, who moves herself and the kids into an apartment as her estranged husband gets help to get it together. Ruffalo puts in another of those highly-tuned sensitive performances, which Saldana matches scene for scene.Watch TrailerBradley Cooper&nbsp;(Rocket Raccoon)Film: The Midnight Meat Train&nbsp;(2008,  73%). The movie biz carves up another Clive Barker adaptation, this time telling the drenched tale of people getting butchered on a subway and the amateur photographer who makes it his quest to expose the truth.Role: Cooper plays the photographer, who becomes intensely obsessed with figuring out why the murders are taking place, at great risk to his health and relationship with his girlfriend. Studio politics effectively reduced this movie to being dumped directly to video, though it’s grown a small cult due to its unflinching gore and its mega-black ending.Watch TrailerMichael Rooker&nbsp;(Yondu)Film: Slither&nbsp;(2006,  86%).&nbsp;Guardians director James Gunn’s feature debut is a nasty little horror-comedy about a small town overcome by an alien parasite that begins its colonization of Earth by possessing a philandering car dealer. Before long, everyone’s pets are missing, the local livestock are turning up mutilated, and neighbor-on-neighbor violence is at an all-time high.Role: Rooker stars in Slither as Grant Grant, aka patient zero himself, the car dealer who becomes infected by an extraterrestrial slug and, in turn, whose mistress becomes the hive queen. The problem is, Grant still retains some of his human memories, and all of them lead back to his not-so-doting wife (Elizabeth Banks), who’s understandably less than thrilled to come home to a horribly disfigured man slowly transforming into a tentacled monster. It all amounts to a raucous mix of uncomfortable laughs and the ridiculous kind body horror that would make David Cronenberg proud.Watch TrailerKurt Russell&nbsp;(Ego)Film: Bone Tomahawk&nbsp;(2015,  91%).&nbsp;This surprisingly confident debut by writer/director S. Craig Zahler seamlessly introduces elements of horror into a deliberately paced Western about a local sheriff who leads a small party of gunslingers to face off against a tribe of ruthless cannibals after some of his townspeople are abducted.Role: Russell’s filmography is vast and varied, but this underseen thriller (and Tarantino’s The Hateful Eight, both from 2015) arguably makes the best use of his late-period gruffness and magnificent facial hair, and he is terrific as the sheriff who sacrifices everything for his town. The whole thing is a tightly wound slow build to a grisly, violent climax, and there are a few things in there you won’t be able to unsee.Watch TrailerBenicio Del Toro&nbsp;(The Collector)Film: Inherent Vice&nbsp;(2015,  73%).&nbsp;After the gold rush of the hippie era, reality and hard living sets in as 1970 rolls on in California. Perpetually stoned private dick Doc Sportello (Joaquin Phoenix) is hired to solve a beguiling case while avoiding the LAPD and a life of responsibility.Role:&nbsp;Del Toro plays Doc’s attorney and occasional informant Sauncho. He gives a classically mumbly Benicio performance, but attach that to the film’s outsized characters and byzantine plot and it all weaves into a piquant psychedelic tapestry.Watch TrailerNathan Fillion&nbsp;(Simon Williams)Film: Waitress&nbsp;(2007,  89%). Adrienne Shelly’s smart and heartfelt romantic comedy centers on an unhappily married waitress (Keri Russell) who dreams of opening her own bakery and finds something akin to hope when her unwanted pregnancy leads to an affair with her equally married new physician.Role: Having done some space swashbuckling of his own (on FOX’s TV series Firefly and its follow-up feature film Serenity), as well as co-starring in another gem on this list (Slither), Nathan Fillion brings his effortless charisma to this decidedly understated charmer as the aforementioned doctor, striking up such a natural chemistry with Keri Russell that, maybe just for a little while, infidelity doesn’t seem like such a bad thing after all.Watch TrailerGlenn Close&nbsp;(Nova Prime)Film: Reversal of Fortune&nbsp;(1990,  92%).&nbsp;In the famous murder case of 1990, Claus von Bulow stands on trial, accused of sending his wife into a diabetic coma after pumping her with an overdose of insulin.Role: Close plays Claus’ wife Sunny and spends the entire movie with her eyes closed and her tongue hanging out of her mouth. Just kidding, reverse that: there’s plenty of Close and Jeremy Irons going at it in a dramatic exploration of this tense marriage.Watch TrailerElizabeth Debicki&nbsp;(Ayesha)TV Series: The Man from U.N.C.L.E.&nbsp;(2015,  68%).&nbsp;Henry Cavill and Armie Hammer play American and Russian secret agents who begrudgingly join forces during the Cold War-era ’60s to track down a nuclear weapon in this Guy Ritchie adaptation of the classic TV series.Role: Debicki wears killer dresses and assembles even deadlier bombs as one of the two major villains in this movie, which is celebrated for its action scenes and quirky humor (at least for a movie with this many explosions), though it struggled at the box office.Watch TrailerSylvester Stallone&nbsp;(???)Film: Nighthawks&nbsp;(1981,  70%).&nbsp;Originally conceived as a third French Connection, the film deals with urban terrorism in New York as Rutger Hauer, in his first English role and one year before the legendary Blade Runner, runs New York through the wringer.Role: Stallone is an NYPD detective named Deke DaSilva, tasked with taking down the sadistic Hauer in a city still at the height of its grime and grit. The film was plagued with production problems and multi-hyphenate Stallone took over directing duties briefly.Watch Trailer","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"Tyler, Month, movies, CNN, Disney, nature, Apple, Pop, HBO, Podcast, Amazon, media, Christmas, on, First","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"10-hidden-gems-of-the-guardians-of-the-galaxy-vol-2-stars"},{"id":"47612783242553","title":"Awards Leaderboard: Top Movies of 2015","content":"Newsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Awards Leaderboard: Top Movies of 2015We help you keep track of the awards season 2015/2016.by RT Staff | December 17, 2015 |  CommentsFrom December through February, the best movies of 2015 are getting honored by critics, press, fans, and members of the film industry from all over.

Then we’ve got a few decent choices in the smaller releases, including Chris Rock’s Certified Fresh comedy and a couple of selections from the Criterion Collection. Read on for details:Annie (2014)  28%First it was a comic strip, then it was a musical, and then it was a film (twice), so it’s sort of understandable that the makers of 2014’s Annie — whose producers include such names as Will Smith and Jay-Z — would want to do things a little differently this time. Plus, they hired a few talented actors and the adorable star of Beasts of the Southern Wild to play the titular orphan. What could go wrong? A lot, according to the critics, who saddled the film with a 28 percent Tomatometer score for its reliance on clichés, syrupy sweetness, oddly staged musical numbers, and crass messaging. Quvenzhané Wallis is as charismatic as ever as the little girl who’s swept into the political machinations of wealthy mayoral candidate Benjamin Stacks (Jamie Foxx), who initially uses Annie for her PR value but ultimately falls for her charm. But essentially everything else about this production rubbed critics the wrong way, which renders this remake a missed opportunity.Exodus: Gods and Kings (2014)  28%Speaking of missed opportunities, who could have predicted a biblical epic directed by Ridley Scott and starring Christian Bale would have misfired as badly as Exodus: Gods and Kings did? Maybe people were burnt out on Old Testament stories by high profile directors, having already witnessed what Darren Aronofsky did with Noah back in March. Whatever the case, Scott’s retelling of Moses’ (Bale) journey was poorly received by both critics and audiences alike, earning a lukewarm box office total and earning a 28 percent score to match Annie‘s. Exodus has its moments, critics said, but the updated visual effects and few story embellishments (Moses as a sword-wielding general?) weren’t quite enough to erase memories of The Ten Commandments, and the newer film suffered from the comparison. For those who are interested, however, the Blu-ray release features a historical guide, a number of deleted or extended scenes, and few featurettes exclusive to the 3D release if you decide to go that route.Song of the Sea (2014)  98%Back in 2009, director Tomm Moore’s film The Secret of Kells earned an Oscar nod for Best Animated Feature, thanks to an enchanting mythological tale and its unique, hand-drawn art style. Earlier this year, he repeated the feat with Song of the Sea, which employed those same signature elements en route to an impressive Certified Fresh 98 percent on the Tomatometer and another Academy Award nomination. Song explores the Celtic myth of the selkie, a creature that takes the form of a seal underwater and that of a human on land, as told through the story of a young boy named Ben and his young sister Saoirse, who live in a lighthouse with their father. When Saoirse discovers a shell flute that plays a mystical tune, they learn a magical secret about their mother, who passed away years earlier. Song of the Sea is visually spectacular and rich in story, which makes it both an artful film and an excellent choice for family viewing.Penguins of Madagascar (2014)  72%DreamWorks Animation’s Madagascar franchise is one of the rare few that has gotten better with each installment, and it’s been so successful that a few of the side characters — The Penguins of Madagascar — got their own TV show on Nickelodeon. In 2014, those pesky penguins even got their own movie, and it turned out pretty good. Unrelated in plot to the TV series, Penguins of Madagascar follows Skipper, Kowalski, Rico and Private as they attempt to thwart the nefarious plans of Dr. Octavius Brine (John Malkovich), an octopus with an anti-penguin vendetta, after a dashing wolf (Benedict Cumberbatch) recruits them into his super-secret spy organization. Thanks to its vibrant colors, brisk pacing, and manic silliness, Penguins of Madagascar entertained most critics and earned a 72 percent on the Tomatometer. Its constant, frantic energy might be a bit too much for some adults to handle, but it’s harmless fun that will certainly keep the kids occupied for a while.&nbsp;ALSO AVAILABLE THIS WEEK: The Way He Looks (2014) (91 percent), a Brazilian coming-of-age story about the struggles of a blind teenager. Top Five (2014) (88 percent), Chris Rock’s Certified Fresh comedy about a comedian (Rock) who reflects on his life as he’s being interviewed by a journalist (Rosario Dawson).

It will also introduce a Silicon Valley where trade secrets are protected with ruthless efficiency. The program is the product of writer-director Alex Garland, who spent the last several years mapping out the limited series.As the director of Certified Fresh films&nbsp;Ex Machina, which he also wrote,&nbsp;and&nbsp;Annihilation — to say nothing of his screenplays for films like Sunshine&nbsp;— Garland&nbsp;has emerged as one of the major voices of 21st century science fiction film (and now television). And even though our world increasingly resembles the one theorized by the major science fiction films of the 20th century, Garland told Rotten Tomatoes the role of science fiction is “exactly” the same in the hyper-connected world of 2020 as it was 40 years ago and even earlier.(Photo by Miya Mizuno/FX)“It’s a very good, and actually quite comfortable, way of holding a mirror up to something which is contemporary. Because if you hold a mirror up exactly to the thing that is contemporary, people find themselves reacting to the argument that’s being made [as] they would if they were to find someone having argued about contemporary politics,” he said.Where more direct critiques of current issues may bristle against a viewer or reader’s established views, science fiction still offers a “gentler way into that argument” whether it is The Time Machine’s critique of Victorian values, Star Trek’s use of aliens to discuss race relations or the way Devs looks at the billionaire class.But do not expect the show to be a screed against tech giants who often seem to have more money than empathy. Instead, viewers will quickly find Forest (Nick Offerman) a disarming, human presence as he introduces Sergei (Karl Glusman) to the secretive Devs team within the show’s fictional tech company, Amaya. In fact, Garland said Offerman’s own natural warmth was key to making Forest work.“He also has something else which is something soulful, I think. You could even in some ways describe it as melancholic,” he added.Although, he said, that sense of melancholy was something Offerman found within Forest:&nbsp;“It felt like a perfect, natural fit. Nick is a kind man, and that kindness comes through in the character.”Granted, as viewers will quickly see, Forest’s warmth is tinged with a willingness to protect the secret of Devs at any cost.“And so, if you create a character who’s been extremely morally problematic and then you have a kind, and warm, and empathetic person carry that role, you get a sort of weird and interesting dissonance,” he said.That dissonance will certainly form one of the questions viewers of Devs will be asking by the end of its first hour.Another question to be asked: Is the universe deterministic? In that theory of existence, every action is prescribed, and a person’s choices are only an illusion. It is the model Forest himself espouses even as Sergei offers a multiversal answer — which allows for free will — to a problem his team addresses early in the series. Both concepts have been the playthings of science fiction for decades, but Devs makes them the purview of a tech company mindset that many will find quite familiar thanks to the ascent of Google and Apple. And though the ideas may become more approachable within the context of the series, Garland thinks most people react to the concepts in the same way.“[They] actually find it, firstly, preposterous, and, secondly, unsettling. They don’t like the idea of multiple universes, because it stops them having primacy. What the Many-Worlds Theory really does, it says that each of the universes that exist — if they do exist — essentially has equal status to all of the other ones. So, there isn’t a main universe and then a bunch of branches, there’s just a very large number of coexisting universes. And people tend not to like theories that make them too small, I suppose.”It is a reaction which speaks to one of the central conflicts in Devs: what Garland called “our intuitive sense in conflict with the data.”“Quite aside from Many-Worlds, the data makes it very clear the universe is absolutely massive; close to unimaginably huge. And that’s now beyond any real doubt, because it could be proven in various sorts of ways,” he said. “And that is in conflict with people’s own experience of the world, where they are much more at the center of the universe and occupying quite a big space within the universe. You know, then [there’s] their family, their friends, their job, and, in a way, the more they lose proximity with these bonds, the smaller they feel.”Nevertheless, Garland noted conversations moving from the possibility of a mulitverse where free will exists to a deterministic view where there is no choice elicits an equally strong emotional response.“If I have a conversation with people about free will, nobody likes the idea that they don’t have it. And it is completely in contradiction with our own sense — ‘But I absolutely, definitely have free will. I can feel it now,’ [they say], which is… again, it’s what people feel, but it may not be supported by the data.”That view, as espoused by Forest, leads Devs’ main character, Lily Chan (Sonoya Mizuno), onto her collision course with the warm and melancholy Amaya CEO. And while discussing Lilly’s actions would lead to a level of spoilers we definitely cannot reveal in this or any other reality, it did lead to another question the show presents: Do ethics exist in a deterministic universe?“I don’t personally think it takes ethics and morality out of the conversation, I just think it means you react differently to the state of affairs,” Garland said.(Photo by Miya Mizuno/FX)To illustrate morality in a deterministic universe,&nbsp;he used a 15-year-old boy mugging someone at knife point as an example. In a universe with free will, the boy’s punishment (provided he is caught) proceeds from the notion he is in absolute control of his choices.“If you take deterministic view, you might say, ‘Well, hang on a minute. Because this kid is a crystal meth addict, and both his parents were crystal meth addicts, and he was addicted by the time he was 12, and he was trapped in a world that had given him a very distorted sense of ethics, and, as well as that, a sense of desperation, and no home, that led ultimately to the mugging.’ Under those circumstances, punishing the kid makes much less sense. Rehabilitating a kid makes much more sense.”“What we do then is make sure that [the kid doesn’t] do it again,” Garland suggested. “So, that doesn’t remove the ethics, because you still don’t want the kid to mug anybody. It’s just more that you’re not punishing him for something that wasn’t his own decision.”Of course, Garland was quick to point out that while his example leads to a morality with more empathy and compassion, it also suggests atrocities are also unavoidable in a deterministic universe. “I don’t think anybody wants to let Adolf Hitler off the hook in the way that you might let a 15-year-old off the hook,” he quipped.Nonetheless, the morality of what Forest calls “tram lines” will no doubt feature in discussions of Devs when its full shape is revealed with the show’s finale six weeks from now.Part of that shape, though, is the modernist, mid-20th-century-style Amaya campus, shot partially at UC Santa Cruz and the University of Manchester. The style branches out of the campus and into the way much of the series is shot. To Garland, that style is a great container for science fiction stories because of its “utilitarian” essence.“By looking at the [modernist] structure, you understand something about why it was built and how it was built. It’s less concerned with the kind of a flamboyance that you might get in a Victorian or Edwardian period church, which is trying to proclaim something about itself, and is not exactly utilitarian. Or for that matter, elaborate science fiction citadels with gleaming spires or whatever it happens to be.” Instead, the modernist feel has “this sort of blunt quality that I like, it’s sort of arresting.”While Devs represents Garland’s first television work, he said he would consider telling other science fiction stories in the film format.“I personally cannot imagine how I would tell this particular story within two hours,” he said. “The things I wanted to do — or was hoping to do with the characters — and with the narrative, would have just felt incredibly crudely crunched together if it was two hours.”(Photo by Miya Mizuno/FX)But, he added, “there are other spaces” film offers even if there is the implicit expectation of action.“I think films often have to be a bit more ‘sugar rushing.’ Film is so much… I mean, it doesn’t have to be, but it tends to lean towards urgency and economy, and I guess that then leads people towards action sequences,” he explained.For Devs, he needed television’s acceptance of people “talking in rooms” to fully realize characters like Lilly, Forest, and Kenton (Zach Grenier), Amaya’s dedicated chief of security, to his satisfaction. At the same time he agreed “there are so many great science fiction films” and an idea more suited to film could appear at any moment. “It would certainly depend on the narrative,” he added.As for Devs narrative, Garland said he hoped to “give a very fair account of the world” within a science fiction context “by trying to be fair about the idea to do with physics that it contains, and also the way we interact with each other.” The series, in his mind, is really full of partnerships and “the sort of good people who love each other to one extent or another, as colleagues, or friends, or partners, or parents.”“Its intention is not to be removed, its attempt is to be connected, and I hope that’s ultimately how it comes across,” he added.For&nbsp;this writer, Devs definitely connected in no small part because of the weird synchronicity of sharing a last name with Forest’s company.“It must be kind of weird to see that suddenly you’re the head of the corporation that does quantum computing,” Garland quipped when he noted the connection.As it happens, the name was chosen because the girl who plays its enigmatic face is also named Amaya: Amaya Mizuno-Andre. Often Japanese in origin, the name also appears to enter the Romance languages from the Basque Country — though opinions do differ&nbsp;— where it translates from Euskera into English as “the beginning of the end” or simply “the end.”“Oh my God, that is hilarious!” Garland said upon hearing about the Basque origin. “That was completely unintentional.”Devs&nbsp;launches on Thursday, March 5&nbsp;on FX on Hulu.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"Kids, review, Hear, Pride, winner, The, Lucasfilm, Emmy","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"alex-garland-on-devs-free-will-and-science-fiction-television"},{"id":"47612808929597","title":"Writers Guild Awards 2016: Full Winners List","content":"Newsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Writers Guild Awards 2016: Full Winners Listby RT Staff | February 14, 2016 |  CommentsThe Writers Guild of America, West (WGAW) and the Writers Guild of America, East (WGAE) tonight announced the winners of the 2016 Writers Guild Awards for outstanding achievement in writing for film&nbsp;and&nbsp;television&nbsp;at concurrent ceremonies at the Hyatt Regency Century Plaza in Los Angeles and the Edison Ballroom in New York City.FILMOriginal ScreenplayBridge of Spies 90%Sicario 92%Spotlight 97%Straight Outta Compton 89%Trainwreck 84%Adapted ScreenplayThe Big Short 89%Carol 94%The Martian 91%Steve Jobs 85%Trumbo 75%Documentary ScreenplayBeing Canadian 33%Going Clear: Scientology and the Prison of Belief 95%Kurt Cobain: Montage Of Heck 97%Prophet's Prey 93%TELEVISIONDRAMA SERIESThe Americans 96%Better Call Saul 97%Game of Thrones 89%Mad Men 94%Mr. Robot 94%COMEDY SERIESBroad City 99%Silicon Valley 94%Transparent 90%Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt 96%Veep 93%NEW SERIESBetter Call Saul 97%Bloodline 62%The Last Man on Earth 85%Mr. Robot 94%Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt 96%LONG FORM ORIGINALAmerican Horror Story: Hotel 64%Flesh and Bone 59%Saints &amp; Strangers 80%Sons of Liberty 58%LONG FORM ADAPTEDFargo 93%The Red Tent 77%Show Me a Hero 96%ANIMATION“Gayle Makin’ Bob Sled”Bob's Burgers 91%“Halloween of Horror”The Simpsons 85%“Hank After Dark”BoJack Horseman 93%“Housetrap”Bob's Burgers 91%“Sky Police”The Simpsons 85%“Walking Big &amp; Tall”The Simpsons 85%EPISODIC DRAMA“Explosivos”Narcos 89%“International Assassin”The Leftovers 91%“Mind’s Eye”The Good Wife 93%“Mother’s Mercy”Game of Thrones 89%“Person to Person”Mad Men 94%“Uno”Better Call Saul 97%EPISODIC COMEDY“Alive in Tucson”The Last Man on Earth 85%“Connection Lost”Modern Family 85%“Joint Session”Veep 93%“Racegate”Maron 75%“Rock, Paper, Scissors, Gun”black-ish 92%“Sand Hill Shuffle”Silicon Valley 94%COMEDY / VARIETY (INCLUDING TALK) – SERIESConanThe Daily Show With Jon StewartThe Late Show With Stephen ColbertReal Time with Bill MaherThe Tonight Show Starring Jimmy FallonCOMEDY / VARIETY – SKETCH SERIESInside Amy Schumer 86%Key &amp; Peele 97%Saturday Night LiveSHORT FORM NEW MEDIA – ORIGINAL“Back to Reality” (Weight), Written by Daryn Strauss; weighttheseries.com“Born This Way” (Anyone But Me), Written by Susan Miller; hulu.comSHORT FORM NEW MEDIA – ADAPTED“Chapter Two: Phoebe” (Heroes Reborn: Dark Matters), Written by Zach Craley; nbc.com“Part 8” (Fear The Walking Dead: Flight 462), Written by L.

It’s a moment made even more bittersweet now that 20th Century Fox, the studio that has shepherded this Marvel franchise, has been acquired by Disney. Fox has a film library accumulated over 84 years as one of Hollywood’s majors, now finding a new home in the House of M(ouse).X-Men started in the tenuous superhero years between Batman &amp; Robin and the first Spider-Man. And though the mutants traded spandex costumes for leather (it was still practically the ’90s), the film still kept its outsider spirit, its theme of the status quo destroying the gifted, and the question of what happens when evolution disrupts a narrow-minded society. These concepts are some of the central bearings&nbsp;of science fiction, a genre Fox has had a storied history within, starting with black-and-white classic The Day the Earth Stood Still. Movies that followed, like Star Wars, Alien, Planet of the Apes, and Avatar, not only pressed up against the boundaries of sci-fi, but they shaped our pop culture as a whole.As the sun&nbsp;starts to set on a historic studio, we take one last look back on 20 of the most groundbreaking science fiction movies of 20th Century Fox.The Day the Earth Stood Still (1951)  95%(Photo by 20th Century Fox. /Courtesy of Everett Collection)Fox kicked off the creature feature trend of the 1950s with this actually reserved sci-fi parable of a visitor from beyond the stars named Klaatu with a draconian message to humanity: Shape up or face annihilation. To this end, Klaatu has brought his eye-blasting robot, Gort. Day the Earth Stood Still laid down the template for sci-fi combining fantastic visuals with social commentary, that would have immediate influence on ’50s pop achievements like the original Godzilla and The Twilight Zone, and then well into the future.Invaders from Mars (1953)  82%(Photo by 20th Century Fox. /Courtesy of Everett Collection)In the race to getting color on the silver screen, the sci-fi grand prix came down between Fox and Paramount. The latter was gearing up to release the Technicolor War of the Worlds in August 1953. Fox, rearing to beat Paramount to the punch, put out Invaders From Mars in April, thus holding the record for first color depiction of aliens in theaters. Texas Chain Saw Massacre&nbsp;helmer&nbsp;Tobe Hooper remade the movie in ’86, with a screenplay by Alien writer&nbsp;Dan O’Bannon.The Fly (1958)  95%(Photo by 20th Century Fox. /Courtesy of Everett Collection)As science fiction became mainstream product in the 1950s, it expanded audiences’ taste for harder, deliberately shocking material. Enter The Fly, which revolted crowds and critics with its nasty transformation effects, effectively capping the swinging creature-feature ’50s with a swat of brutality. David Cronenberg broke into the mainstream in the ’80s with his Jeff Goldblum-starring Fly remake of the ’80s, going full-bore on his trademark body horror and psychosexual obsession.Fantastic Voyage (1966)  91%(Photo by 20th Century Fox. /Courtesy of Everett Collection)With the ’60s, the sci-fi movie standard animorphed from atomic age monsters to epic and/or disaster expeditions, with Jules Verne the popular source author: 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea, Journey to the Center of the Earth, Master of the World, and Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea. Fantastic Voyage, though not a Verne story, took his sweeping style and turned it inwards, as a group of scientists shrink themselves down into a submersible to explore a human body. The rich concept has been done again many times over since, including 1987’s Innerspace, and in parodies in cartoons ranging from Family Guy to Futurama to The Magic School Bus.Planet of the Apes (1968)  86%(Photo by 20th Century Fox. /Courtesy of Everett Collection)First banana in the long-surviving series, with one of the most memorable and aped endings in history. Planet was the first sci-fi property to turn itself into a franchise in these pre-Star Wars years, with four direct sequels and several TV shows out by the mid-’70s. There was an unfortunate Tim Burton remake in 2001, before it was rebooted properly starting with 2011’s Rise of the Planet of the Apes, highlighting the series’&nbsp;enduring central theme of a three-way fight between man, science, and natural order.Zardoz (1974)  47%(Photo by 20th Century Fox. /Courtesy of Everett Collection)In the post-apocalyptic future, red leather daddy Zed (Sean Connery) boards a gun-vomiting floating head named Zardoz, who deposits him in a paradise estate known as The Vortex, whose immortal inhabitants have grown bored with life. In a kind of psychedelic Pygmalion, the immortals use crude dude Zed for their amusement, while he secretly seeks to unravel the mystery of Zardoz and The Vortex. Director John Boorman decided to use his post-Deliverance cred to deliver this ambitious and goofy misfire that must absolutely be seen to be believed. It’s a reminder of the special kind of big-budget tomfoolery major studios are capable of putting out if they just put their heads together.Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope (1977)  92%(Photo by 20th Century Fox. /Courtesy of Everett Collection)The most influential sci-fi trilogy in the galaxy. The first film,&nbsp;A New Hope, remains a perfect standalone distillation of the hero’s journey template. The Empire Strikes Back showed you can have an inconclusive AND downer ending, and still make money. And Return of the Jedi had Ewoks. Star Wars regenerated science fiction to appeal to the youngest crowd ever, hooking them with bright and poppy visuals, and all the merchandising you want to express that adoration. The Prequel and Sequel Trilogies have kept the Force alive, and with it tie-in video games, novels, comics, TV shows, and beyond.Alien (1979)  98%(Photo by 20th Century Fox. /Courtesy of Everett Collection)Ridley Scott took a haunted-house-in-space script and turned it into a grimy, claustrophobic experience in terror, launching a media empire — or infestation — of xenomorphs that have crossed over to comic books, video games, and even other venerable sci-fi properties like Predator and Judge Dredd. Not to mention granting us an eternally badass female protag in the form of Ripley. The first sequel helped launched the career of James Cameron, while the second nearly killed David Fincher’s. Scott would return to the Alien series decades later with Prometheus and Covenant.The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai (1984)  68%(Photo by 20th Century Fox. /Courtesy of Everett Collection)Another idiosyncratic sci-fi movie from Fox somewhat in the vein of Zardoz, but this time on purpose. Peter Weller stars as multi-hyphenate Buckaroo, whose résumé includes New Wave rock god, neurosurgeon, and inter-dimensional crash test dummy, and who must root out in-hiding spacemen here on Earth. This film’s sense of humor is so specific and quirky, one can’t help but think there’s no way the guy who directed it ever got the chance again. And, yep, this is W.D. Richter’s sole movie as director. And now it belongs to zany film audiences who in the years since have propped it up as the ultimate cult movie, whose influence pops in the most unlikely places — like The Life Aquatic‘s end credits, which pays tribute.Predator (1987)  81%(Photo by 20th Century Fox. /Courtesy of Everett Collection)Arnold Schwarzenegger had one of the most impressive hot streaks in the ’80s, and that includes rumble-in-the-jungle Predator. As military macho Dutch, he and his crew exterminate guerrillas in Central America before the real threat emerges: An outer-space hunter who stalks and skins its prey for sport, using invisible alien technology. Real honorable! Predator‘s minimal plot, maximum carnage remains a high point for a certain breed of ’80s filmmaking. Its sequels and Alien crossovers have kept the franchise in the conversation.The Abyss (1989)  89%(Photo by 20th Century Fox. /Courtesy of Everett Collection)After the grungy Terminator and action-focused Aliens, James Cameron finally came into his own with The Abyss, which for the first time carries everything you imagine when you think of the director’s movies: Enormous budget, ecological message, and cutting-edge technology. Like Blade Runner, this is a major studio sci-fi movie that doesn’t rely on poppy hooks, but instead slowly submerges the viewer with some big concepts and methodical pacing.Strange Days (1995)  63%(Photo by 20th Century Fox. /Courtesy of Everett Collection)Approaching something as momentous as the dawn of a new millennium takes a genre like science fiction to work through. Set during the final two days of 1999, Strange Days is a hard-boiled noir of parties, murder, and technology that can record and commodify memories and emotions. The film is a compelling document of ’90s progressive politics, advertising-induced cynicism, end-of-the-world race riots and relations, and the uneasy optimism of the future ahead.Independence Day (1996)  67%(Photo by 20th Century Fox. /Courtesy of Everett Collection)In 1996, nothing felt bigger than Independence Day. The plot of evil space invaders was already decades old at that point, but the casting of Will Smith as lead felt fresh and in-the-moment, along with eye-popping special effects and quick pacing made it an all-new experience. With a sequel 20 years later, Independence Day has also become a poster movie for one of the major overriding emotions of the 2010s: nostalgia.X-Men (2000)  82%(Photo by 20th Century Fox. /Courtesy of Everett Collection)Comic book superhero movies had already found recent success with the Batman and Superman movies, but the whole ensemble thing had yet to be done successfully on the big screen. Enter X-Men, who were a natural choice to give it a try, with their popularity rising through video games and the animated series, and whose outsider status among humans gave the movie the necessary subtext to attract any viewer who felt maligned in life. The series has since been infamously inconsistent, but the original, X2, First Class, Days of Future Past, and Logan remain must-watches in the genre.28 Days Later (2003)  87%(Photo by Fox Searchlight. /Courtesy of Everett Collection)Danny Boyle and writer Alex Garland suspected the time was right to bring back zombies into the zeitgeist. Choosing to forego soft voodooism or implied crashing satellites, 28 Days Later&nbsp;– which is technically a Fox Searchlight film – went directly into the science-fiction route starting with its opening scene, which sees group of environmental extremists free test monkeys infected with a highly contagious rage virus on an unsuspecting populace. Credit this one with making zombies cool with the kids again.Idiocracy (2006)  74%(Photo by 20th Century Fox. /Courtesy of Everett Collection)A literal average Joe is cryogenically frozen, only to be awakened well past his due date: 500 years into the future to be exact. The world has dumbed down to an alarming degree, with the nation on the brink of stupid disaster, and Joe suddenly finding himself the smartest man in the world. Though frequently set in the future, science fiction is a mirror that can reflect and warp our current selves, and to that end Idiocaracy is a resounding, hilarious success.Avatar (2009)  82%(Photo by 20th Century Fox. /Courtesy of Everett Collection)Pocahontas in space! Dances With Blue People! Sorry, Avatar can’t hear you over the $2.7 billion (in 2009 money!) we gave the studio. The long-developed James Cameron project transported audiences the world over to Pandora, a resplendent living word inhabited by the Na’vi, leonine blue creatures. As Pandora’s being invaded by Earth, a Na’vi warrior falls in love with one of the humans.Avatar remains the highest-grossing movie ever (a record once held by Cameron’s previous film, Titanic), and represents Fox’s final crowning achievement in the sci-fi genre.Chronicle (2012)  85%(Photo by 20th Century Fox. /Courtesy of Everett Collection)Combining sci-fi, found footage, and horror, Chronicle&nbsp;explores the lives of three teenagers who develop powers of telekinesis after being exposed to a mysterious crystal. The film’s explosive terror and slick editing made it an immediate hit, launching the careers of Dane DeHaan, Michael B. Jordan, and director Josh Trank, who later stumbled with the Fan4stic reboot.The Martian (2015)  91%(Photo by 20th Century Fox. /Courtesy of Everett Collection)Putting the science back in science fiction, The Martian stars Matt Damon as a NASA astronaut accidentally left behind on the red planet when his crew takes off during a sandstorm. As STEM fields increase in popularity across all genders, Ridley Scott’s Martian became the movie reference about the power of logic, science, and technology to overcome what look like insurmountable odds.Alita: Battle Angel (2019)  61%(Photo by Twentieth Century Fox Film Corp. /Courtesy of Everett Collection)Almost like destiny, the final movie released by 20th Century Fox as an independent studio is Alita: Battle Angel, the cyberpunk adaptation of the anime of almost the same name. And, naturally, James Cameron is here too! Like all of his movies, Cameron was talking about making a Battle Angel movie for a long time before it finally became reality, ultimately under the direction of Robert Rodriguez. Critics were lukewarm but most of the relatively scant audience who watched it fell in love with Alita, and the movie looks to be another cult classic in the making.Like this?

Liam Neeson’s latest thriller kicks things off, followed by a Jack Ryan reboot starring Chris Pine. Then we’ve got a Certified Fresh British comedy, an Oscar-nominated documentary, and a few smaller films. The big news is that HBO’s hit mystery series, True Detective, finally hits shelves this week, but there are also a couple of other notable choices on the small screen, including Neil deGrasse Tyson’s science series. Read on for details:Non-Stop 62%Liam Neeson takes his very particular set of skills aboard a transatlantic flight as US Air Marshal Bill Marks, who begins receiving mysterious text messages from an on-board terrorist who promises a passenger will die every 20 minutes if he isn’t paid $150 million; as Marks narrows down his suspects, a larger conspiracy reveals itself. Co-starring Julianne Moore, Anson Mount, and Scoot McNairy, Non-Stop fell just short of Fresh at 59% on the Tomatometer, with critics mostly intrigued by the film’s premise but somewhat dissatisfied with its execution and its improbable climax. The Blu-ray release includes the film on DVD and digital download, as well as a couple of short behind-the-scenes featurettes. This is pretty solid weekend rental if you weren’t willing to pay full price for a theater ticket.&nbsp;Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit 54%Chris Pine steps into the shoes formerly worn by Alec Baldwin, Harrison Ford, and Ben Affleck to portray Tom Clancy’s titular everyman operative in what essentially amounts to an origin story/reboot of the franchise. Upon recovering from a debilitating battle injury, US Marine Jack Ryan is recruited by the CIA to work as an undercover agent on Wall Street, surveying for potential crimes in the financial sector. When a Russian businessman’s accounts spark Ryan’s suspicion, he unwittingly becomes embroiled in an international terrorist plot. The first of the series not based on a Clancy novel, Shadow Recruit earned a mixed response from critics, who mostly found it a merely adequate action thriller that hit plenty of familiar notes and fell short of its predecessors (yes, even The Sum of All Fears). The Blu-ray combo pack includes a commentary track from director and co-star Kenneth Branagh, as well as a handful of deleted scenes, an alternate ending, and four featurettes ranging from 5 to 21 minutes long.&nbsp;Alan Partridge 86%Stateside audiences are probably unfamiliar with Alan Partridge (Steve Coogan), but folks across the pond know him from any number of media appearances and his BBC sitcom. In Alan Partridge, Coogan reprises his role as the egocentric radio dj and television presenter, whose radio station — under new corporate management — is taken hostage by a recently fired DJ; Alan finds himself at the center of the controversy when he is asked to play negotiator with his former colleague. Certified Fresh at 86%, Alan Partridge is a clever comedy that relies more on dry wit than laugh-out-loud moments, and while fans of the character will get the most out of it, it makes the most of Steve Coogan’s talents and should serve as a fun introduction for the uninitiated. Special features include a making-of doc, a commentary track with Coogan and writers Neil and Rob Gibbons, a slew of deleted scenes, and a blooper reel.The Missing Picture 99%Nominated earlier this year for Best Foreign Language Film, The Missing Picture — like last year’s similarly themed The Act of Killing — interprets an historical atrocity through the lens of art; whereas The Act of Killing utilized the medium of genre filmmaking, The Missing Picture tells parts of its story through clay dioramas and figurines. Cambodian director Rithy Panh intertwines these miniature scenes with stunning archival footage to retell the story of his family’s experiences during the genocidal reign of Pol Pot and the Khmer Rouge. Unique in its vision and presentation, The Missing Picture touched and captivated critics, who awarded it a Certified Fresh 99% on the Tomatometer. While a Blu-ray is already available in the UK, only a DVD will be coming out this week in the US, and it doesn’t look as though it carries any extras. Still, the film alone is worth a watch.True Detective – Season OneA huge hit for HBO this year, True Detective featured Woody Harrelson and Matthew McConaughey as a pair of former Louisiana police officers involved in a decades-old investigation. The show, produced as an anthology series made to focus on a different story each season, was characterized by occult themes, cryptic symbolism, and deep character development, all of which it accomplished in just eight episodes, enrapturing a rabid fanbase in the process. This first season notched a Certified Fresh 84% on the Tomatometer, thanks to powerful performances by its leads, creator Nic Pizzolatto’s writing, and Cary Joji Fukunaga’s strong directorial vision, and it’s available this week on DVD and Blu-ray. Special features on the latter include commentary tracks for two of the episodes, a 15-minute making-of doc, short behind-the-scenes featurettes for each episode, interviews with the cast and crew, and a pair of deleted scenes.Also available this week:Patrick: Evil Awakens (83%), a horror thriller about a nurse in a psychiatric hospital who comes under the spell of a braindead patient with psychic powers.A Short History of Decay (73%), starring Bryan Greenberg and Linda Lavin in a comedy about a struggling writer who moves home when his father falls ill.Godfrey Reggio’s Visitors (69%), a wordless documentary exploring the relationship between humanity and technology through images.Adult World (52%), starring Emma Roberts and John Cusack in a dramedy about a university grad and aspiring poet who stalks one of her idols.Atom Egoyan’s Devil’s Knot (24%), starring Colin Firth and Reese Witherspoon in a drama chronicling the events surrounding the West Memphis Three.Season one of Ray Donovan (76%), starring Liev Schreiber as the titular Los Angeles “fixer” who helps his rich clients deal with unsavory problems.Season one of Resurrection (52%), a supernatural mystery about a small town where dead residents return to their families.FOX’s much talked about Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey, with Neil deGrasse Tyson hosting a modern “reboot” of Carl Sagan’s groundbreaking science series.And lastly, two choices from The Criterion Collection: Douglas Sirk’s 1955 romance All That Heaven Allows (92%), starring Rock Hudson and Jane Wyman, and Michelangelo Antonioni’s L’Eclisse (88%), starring Alain Delon and Monica Vitti, both get new Blu-ray/DVD combo packs.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"theme, Purge, Comics, parents, Emmys, Kemper, Network, BBC, Premiere, school, miniseries, Month, Unbreakable, Winners","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"new-on-dvd-and-blu-ray-non-stop-jack-ryan-and-true-detective"},{"id":"47612869334347","title":"2015 Oscar Nominations","content":"var mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})2015 Oscar Nominationsby RT Staff | January 15, 2015 |  CommentsActor Chris Pine, Academy President Cheryl Boone Isaacs, and directors Alfonso Cuarón and J.J.

Following in Spidey’s spandex footsteps, a number of new and upcoming games have adopted similar approaches, cleverly expanding on existing universes rather than retreading them for the interactive entertainment medium.From blockbuster film franchises (Fast &amp; Furious) to streaming serial hits (Game of Thrones), more and more of our favorite fictional universes are offering fresh, original opportunities for fans to interact with their characters, live in their worlds, and even shape their stories.Whether you’re a gamepad-clutching Potter fan, a Ghostbusting smartphone geek, or a virtual reality enthusiast with a superhero complex, these 12 titles include some&nbsp;that should keep you busy between TV binge sessions and movie marathons this holiday season, a few great video games to give as gifts for Christmas, and&nbsp;others that you can look forward to in 2019.How to give mobile games as gifts: iOS | AndroidOut NowREIGNS: GAME OF THRONESDeveloper: NerialPublisher: Devolver DigitalSystems: iOS, Android, SteamRelease Date: Available nowGame of Thrones doesn’t return to HBO until next year, but winter has already come in the latest game based on the Seven Kingdoms-conquering series. Offering a fun twist on the high-fantasy franchise, Reigns: Game of Thrones puts players under the capes and crowns of would-be rulers — from Sansa and Tyrion to Cersei and Daenerys — and lets them live out potential alternate futures and fates based on Melisandre’s mysterious visions.GHOSTBUSTERS WORLDDeveloper: Next AgePublisher: FourThirtyThree Inc.Systems: iOS, AndroidRelease Date: Available nowA new take on the location-based, augmented-reality genre that saw millions of players capturing Pokemon in their local park, Ghostbusters World puts players behind a Proton Pack. Well, fans will actually wield their smartphones, but they’ll barely notice the difference once they’re using the smart-devices to suck up Slimer, battle the Stay-Puft Marshmallow Man in their backyard, and bust hundreds of other ghosts in real-world locations.THE EXORCIST: LEGION VRDeveloper: Wolf &amp; WoodPublisher: Fun TrainSystems: PlayStation VR, HTC Vive, Oculus RiftRelease Date: Available nowThanks to the immersion-cranking effects of virtual reality, The Exorcist: Legion VR subjects fans to scares more terrifying than those that defined the classic horror franchise. Beneath the reality-ratcheting headset, players assume the role of a demon-hunting detective who — over the course of five nerve-fraying episodes – explores creepy tombs, investigates ritualistic killings and, of course, raises a few crucifixes in the face of demonic possession.CREED: RISE TO GLORYDeveloper: SurviosPublisher: SurviosSystems: PlayStation VR, HTC Vive, Oculus RiftRelease Date: Available nowBased on the rejuvenated Rocky franchise, Creed: Rise to Glory isn’t just another mindless, button-mashing boxing game. Brought to face-pummeling life in virtual reality, the experience not only puts you in the gloves of Adonis Creed — while training with the Italian Stallion himself — but its physical gameplay offers a workout that’d make Ivan Drago break a sweat.MARVEL POWERS UNITED VRDeveloper: Sanzaru GamesPublisher: Oculus StudiosSystems: Oculus RiftRelease Date: Available nowMarvel fans who’ve dreamed of smashing foes from behind Hulk’s fists or webbing-up baddies with a flick of Spider-Man’s wrists will want to suit-up for Marvel Powers United VR. A fan-pleasing mix of virtual reality and Marvel’s massive roster of heroes and villains, the game lets players unleash all the powers and weapons — from Thor’s hammer and Cap’s shield to Deadpool’s katanas and Wolverine’s claws — from a first-person perspective that feels incredibly real inside the Oculus Rift headset.LEGO HARRY POTTER COLLECTIONDeveloper: TT GamesPublisher: Warner Bros. Interactive EntertainmentSystems: Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, PS4Release Date: Available nowWhether you’ve adventured through the LEGO Harry Potter games a hundred times or you’re a newcomer looking to bust some bricks in the Wizarding World, this definitive, remastered edition provides the absolute best way to kick Voldemort’s block-y butt. This Hagrid-sized compilation, which features both games and spans all eight films, includes enhanced graphics, environments, and visual effects, as well as a pair of magic-expanding DLC packs.Coming SoonSTAR TREK FLEET COMMANDDeveloper: DIGIT Game StudiosPublisher: Scopely/CBS InteractiveSystems: iOS, AndroidRelease Date: Nov. 29, 2018With Star Trek: Discovery prepping to beam up for its second season and Jean-Luc Picard’s return confirmed, there’s never been a better time to be a Trekkie. The fan service continues with Star Trek Fleet Command, a multiplayer mobile offering that combines role-playing elements and real-time battles to deliver story-driven, deep-space skirmishes that should please fans of any faction.FAST &amp; FURIOUS: TAKEDOWNDeveloper: SMG StudiosPublisher: Universal Games, Digital PlatformsSystems: iOS, AndroidRelease Date: Late 2018The next Fast &amp; Furious film has been delayed a year, but fans needn’t wait till 2020 to satisfy their need for speed. Fast &amp; Furious: Takedown puts players behind the wheel of 60-plus licensed rides, including favorites from the films — like Dom’s Dodge Charger and Hobbs’ tank-like truck — before letting them tear up the blacktop in missions guided by the movies’ popular cast of speed limit-breaking characters.CRIMINAL MINDS: THE MOBILE GAMEDeveloper: Blue GiraffePublisher: FTX GamesPlatforms: iOS, AndroidRelease Date: Late 2018This mobile-game take on the long-running CBS crime drama puts fans behind the case-cracking skills of a Behavioral Analysis Unit agent. Alongside favorite characters Rossi, Prentiss, Reid, J.J., Garcia, Lewis, Alvez, and Simmons, players race against the clock to profile suspects, analyze crime scenes, and follow the clues that’ll ultimately help the BAU team put the country’s most twisted criminal minds behind bars.Coming&nbsp;in 2019DRAGONS: TITAN UPRISINGDeveloper: LudiaPublisher: Universal Games, Digital PlatformsSystems: iOS, AndroidRelease Date: Early 2019Ahead of next year’s How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World&nbsp;from DreamWorks Animation, fans are invited to reunite with their favorite fire-breathers in a match-3 mobile offering based on the animated fantasy franchise. Titan Uprising puts a fresh spin on the popular genre, challenging players to build the ultimate team of winged creatures by hatching, nurturing, and creating powerful dragon hybrids to conquer nearly 800 puzzle battles.HARRY POTTER: WIZARDS UNITEDeveloper: WB Games, NianticPublisher: Warner Bros. Interactive EntertainmentSystems: iOS, AndroidRelease Date: 2019The clever folks behind the Pokemon GO phenomenon are applying their augmented-reality magic to a new, Wizarding World–themed take on the genre. Of course, it’s the fans who will be casting spells, as they wield their smart-devices like wands in the real/muggle world to interact with the Potterverse and its populace of menacing creatures and mysterious characters.LOONEY TUNES: WORLD OF MAYHEMDeveloper: Aquiris Game StudioPublisher: Scopely/Warner Bros. Interactive EntertainmentPlatforms: iOS, AndroidRelease Date: 2019With Space Jam 2 headed to the big screen, it’s the perfect time for Looney Tunes fans to reacquaint themselves with their favorite friends and foes from Warner Bros.’ stable of animated stars. Looney Tunes: World of Mayhem invites players to do just that, as they build a dream team of toon brawlers, from Yosemite Sam and Sylvester to Tweety and Taz, to take on opponents in epic, explosive, over-the-top displays of cartoon violence.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"Apple","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"tv-and-movie-tied-video-games-for-holidays"},{"id":"47612872479052","title":"18 Asian-American Movie and TV Milestones","content":"Newsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})18 Asian-American Movie and TV MilestonesThe moments big and small that paved the way for on-screen representation.by Alex Vo | August 14, 2018 |  CommentsAugust 2018 was a watershed month for Asian-American representation on screen. Crazy Rich Asians was the first Asian-American major studio release in 25 years, and broke box office records in theaters. (It also became one of the best-reviewed rom-coms ever.)Another Certified Fresh film that month, Searching. On streaming, Netflix’s To All The Boys I’ve Loved Before and Hulu’s Minding the Gap got up close and personal with the next generations. Meanwhile, Fresh Off the Boat (already a record-breaker for being an As-Am sitcom that wasn’t cancelled after one season) was priming for its prime time return, and Netflix was in the midst of its stand-up comedy insurgency with specials like Ali Wong: Hard Knock Wife. In the years since, we’ve seen the likes of Minari, Always Be My Maybe, and Driveways score with critics.Rotten Tomatoes looks at 18 movie and TV milestones that paved the way, some by pebble and some by bulldozer, for Asian-American representation.(Photo by New Yorker/courtesy Everett Collection)&nbsp;Chan Is Missing (1982)  96%The first Asian-American feature to get a national release and mainstream coverage, so we’ll start here. The title calls out the Charlie Chan detective caricature that was popular 100 years ago and inverts it: a guy named Chan is the one who’s nowhere to be found, and two friends poke around San Francisco looking for him. In a nod to Raymond Chandler, the mystery itself is unimportant; it’s about where the journey goes and what characters we meet along the way. A vibrant portrait of Chinatown life emerges through those characters and their varied, inconsistent descriptions of Chan. Writer-director Wayne Wang appears to be working two big ideas: the search for Chan is the search for Chinese identity in America, and that part of assimilation means disappearing into the diaspora.The Karate Kid (1984)  89%Cliches are like writers’ plutonium: blunt with potential power, and when handled improperly, liable to blow up in your face. But do it right, bring in something new, and there can be effective results. Asian-American Pat Morita takes on&nbsp;the cliche sensei&nbsp;role, but dollops of personal drama and backstory allow Morita to find and give his Mr. Miyagi a tempered gravitas, for which he was awarded a Best Supporting Actor Oscar nomination. Director John G. Avildsen, who did obvious wonders with Rocky, gives another improbable sports film that working class glow.Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II - The Secret of the Ooze (1991)  35%The story of Asian-Americans on-screen, and representation in general, is about the power of image. The less you see yourself on-screen, the more amplified the impact when you do. In this sequel to the surprisingly dark original, Leonardo and squad are joined by Pinoy Ernie Reyes Jr., a New York pizza delivery boy who uncovers their existence. Maybe it’s discordant to give this much importance to a movie that paid Vanilla Ice to talk, but if you were an Asian kid growing up in the ’90s, seeing big Ern’ cut it up alongside your favorite crime-fighting freaks of nature has a lasting effect. In fact, it’s still paying off with stuff like Reyes’ stunt role in the recent Uncharted fan&nbsp;film, starring Nathan Fillion and Stephen Lang.The Wedding Banquet (Xi yan) (1993)  96%Family comes up a lot in immigrant stories. When you&nbsp;arrive in a new country unannounced, it’s typically the only thing you have. The conservatism and hierarchy that makes up much of the Asian family structure smashing against American expression and individualism is fertile storytelling ground, and becomes the basis for Ang Lee’s comedy of manners. Winston Chao stars as a gay Taiwanese man who picks a fake wife to show off to his parents, but is happily involved with another man (Mitchell Lichtenstein). In a way, the paucity of Hollywood-standard movies in Asian-American cinema has allowed even more under-served viewpoints to flourish,&nbsp;with&nbsp;LGBTQ films (the recent Spa Night for example, which has a 95% on the Tomatometer) and women-led projects, which we’ll see start ramping up moving forward.(Photo by Buena Vista Pictures)&nbsp;The Joy Luck Club (1993)  86%This is the movie commentators are referring to when they say Crazy Rich Asians is the first major studio-produced Asian-American&nbsp;film in 25 years. Based on Amy Tan’s novel, this drama follows four Chinese women (Kieu Chinh, Tsai Chin, France Nuyen, Lisa Lu) who meet up to play mahjong and discuss and reflect on their relationships with their American daughters (Ming-Na Wen, Tamlyn Tomita, Lauren Tom, Rosalind Chao). It was an exploration of the gap between old-school values and new-world freedom, but on a budget and scale not seen up to that point.&nbsp;Joy Luck was a mild box office success, but it endures in conversation due to how vital and unique its remained until now, especially for movies starring women and told through the female perspective.ALL-AMERICAN GIRL (1994)Margaret Cho’s sitcom, the first to&nbsp;be led by an Asian-American woman, is set in history as a compromised project propped by networks giving every stand-up comic a show, and then subsequently padded with stereotypes. That Girl‘s failure was held up for decades as a reason to&nbsp;not bankroll under-served voices highlights the disproportional cultural weight these endeavors carry, something Crazy Rich Asians itself faces. Still, Cho breaking through to show up on ABC for 19 episodes weekly gave hope and possibility to thousands of young Asian girls, who had even less to look up to than the boys did. CRA‘s Awkafina has said that&nbsp;seeing Cho on television at a young age set her on the path towards performance.American Pie (1999)  61%Let us harken back to the days of 1999, when the American public was in the midst of a severe dumb catchphrase drought. “Yo quiero Taco Bell” had come and gone, and “Wazzzuup” was yet to divine itself into existence. The people demanded action. “MILF” answered the call, one of the many gifts sprung from the loins of American Pie, explained then yelled repeatedly by John Cho at a raucous high school party. There was something quietly, stupidly triumphant about this moment, which featured some normal Asian dude showing up to craft instant vulgar gold, especially when past Asian characters in the teen movie genre often came with&nbsp;heavy accents&nbsp;and mangled words and phrases. MILF: This aberration, this fine evolution of the English language, was on point.Green Dragon (2001)  61%President Gerald Ford’s compassionate Indochina Migration and Refugee Assistance Act, passed in 1975, allowed over 100,000 refugees from war-torn Southeast Asian countries to legally enter the United States. Green Dragon focuses on&nbsp;the South Vietnamese, fleeing total communist takeover after the fall of Saigon, arriving at Camp Pendelton near San Diego to await relocation in America. Patrick Swayze and Forest Whitaker play military personnel, with Duong Don as the assigned camp translator, and the three guide the new arrivals through days of fear and hope. It remains one of the very few movies set in the States told from a Vietnamese perspective.(Photo by MTV Films/courtesy Everett Collection)&nbsp;Better Luck Tomorrow (2002)  81%Amoral high school honor students turn to crime in this sardonic dismantling of the model minority myth, from future Fast &amp; Furious helmer Justin Lin. Roger Ebert famously gave the movie an outspoken defense at Sundance, after an audience member confronted Lin on how he could present “his” people in such a low manner outside of the accepted cultural image. This line of questioning is a compelling example of how outsiders are required to navigate the immediate, invisible prejudices of others.Harold &amp; Kumar Go to White Castle (2004)  74%Having survived the danger of being branded “the MILF guy,” Cho settles into the post-college role of Harold, an obsequious company drone. He gets down though with his roommate Kumar (Kal Penn), as they smoke weed, chase girls, and quest&nbsp;for hamburger sliders. The Harold &amp; Kumar movies are high-water marks in the representation game, framing the Korean&nbsp;and Indian bros&nbsp;as outwardly “normal,” while engaged in their own personal battles: Harold wants to please others but really is just afraid of confrontation, as Kumar sabotages his father’s efforts to make him&nbsp;a doctor.(Photo by Frank Ockenfels 3/AMC)&nbsp;The Walking Dead: Season 1 (2010)  87%For seven seasons, Glenn Rhee (Steven Yeun) navigated us through the zombie hellscape of The&nbsp;Walking Dead. He matured and surprised, he killed and he loved, and like all of us, spent a long night under a dumpster. Most stories have the character you root for, the one you follow further into the rabbit hole. This time it happened to be the Korean guy. In our Five Favorite Films interview with Yeun, he said, “Glenn kind of sneaks up on people. [He’s] the one that you could just parallel yourself to.” Representation isn’t just shallow theatrics — it’s about finding the anchor that you can hang the most of yourself onto, to invest more fully in the picture.Fast Five (2011)  77%After director Justin Lin took over and Sung Kang joined as Han in Tokyo Drift,&nbsp;the Fast &amp; Furious series would emerge as the most inclusive, if not ridiculous, property rolling around the movie biz.&nbsp;Drift&nbsp;wasn’t a box office hit, and follow-up&nbsp;Fast &amp; Furious&nbsp;posted the franchise-worst Tomatometer at 29%, so kudos to Universal (whose media umbrella Rotten Tomatoes falls under) for allowing Lin to drive on. Next came the groundbreaking&nbsp;Fast Five, which saw critics finally giving in to the series’ absurd pleasures and giving its first Certified Fresh entry, as Lin doubled down on making its cast as diverse (and attractive) as possible.To Be Takei (2014)  90%The original ’60s Star Trek series proclaimed to boldly go where no one had gone before, and this time that includes beyond Gorns and Tribbles. Trek‘s ongoing mission also had earthbound accomplishments, like casting the first African-American woman in a major TV role (Nichelle Nichols as Uhara), alongside an Asian-American: George Takei, who played Sulu. Doc To Be Takei explores Takei’s legacy and relationship with Trek, while illuminating his life’s journey from growing up in California during World War II, to his blooming into savvy social media icon. This also includes the pain of being placed in internment camp during the war, and the Broadway musical Allegiance that experience inspired.(Photo by ABC/Bob D’Amico)&nbsp;Fresh Off the Boat: Season 1 (2015)  91%ABC’s second try at an As-Am sitcom, with considerably more lucrative results than All-American Girl. It was rough waters at first, especially when Eddie Huang, who wrote the original source memoir, left and disavowed the sitcom. The second season refocused on the parents — affably sweet Louis (Randall Park) and driven Jessica (Constance Wu, who is the lead in Crazy Rich Asians) — and the show has been a prime time fixture ever since, even now hitting enough episodes for syndication once its upcoming fifth season wraps.Ali Wong: Hard Knock Wife (2018)  100%Wong approached celebrity status for being a Fresh Off The Boat staff writer during the first three seasons, but it’s her stand-up routine that now plants her in the spotlight.&nbsp;Wong’s raw and filthy material has massive crossover appeal,&nbsp;despite how specific her jokes are to a Chinese/Vietnamese-American experience combined with a marriage to a&nbsp;Filipino/Japanese man. Comedy, it turns out, gets funnier when you sweat the details. Between this and her previous Netflix special Baby Cobra,&nbsp;Wong laughs at dehumanizing stereotypes as a means to strip them of their power. She tears off labels like an old bandage and, in her own explicit way, finds the real woman beneath.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"History, 4/20","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"asian-american-movie-and-tv-milestones"},{"id":"47612896460116","title":"Writers Guild of America 2015 Award Nominations","content":"var mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Writers Guild of America 2015 Award Nominationsby RT Staff | January 7, 2015 |  CommentsOn Wednesday, Januray 7, the Writers Guild of America (WGA) released their list of nominees for their annual WGA Awards, honoring outstanding writing in film, television, radio, and new media.

So while it’s always important to shed some attention on the little guys (which we’ll be doing soon enough), it’s also fun to note that SXSW will be offering high-end \"gimme\" titles like \"V for Vendetta,\" \"The Notorious Bettie Page,\" \"American Dreamz,\" and the geekily-anticipated \"Slither.\"As a movie nerd who’s covered SXSW for several years now, I can honestly opine that it’s one helluva good time.

Bell (Troy), Marque Richardson (Reggie), DeRon Horton (Lionel), and John Patrick Amedori (Gabe), who discussed their characters’ pivotal moments in season 2 and what they’re most excited to see in a potential third season.SPOILER ALERT! Stop reading&nbsp;if you haven’t finished watching the Netflix comedy’s second season.Logan Browning as Sam(Photo by Netflix)After a season of dancing around each other post-breakup, Sam and her ex-boyfriend Gabe finally hooked up again.“But even after we were together and we don’t know what we’re doing,” she says. “Which honestly, it’s almost like a full circle,&nbsp;and sometimes relationships do that. We’re laying in a bed, what are we?”In the final episode, the outspoken Sam faced off against a popular conservative commentator during an on-campus debate. The commentator was played by none other than Tessa Thompson, who originated the role of Sam in the Dear White People movie.“I’ve been a fan of Tessa’s for a really long time. I’ve always been able to see myself in the characters she plays, this one included, so to just play opposite her was dope,” she said. “I feel like from an outside perspective, watching someone who is literally having a scene with a person playing a role that they did already, that was incredible. That was so cool! To be honest, I think the three of us, me, myself, Justin [Simeon, creator], and Tessa just wished we had more time because we had to shoot that scene so quickly.”DeRon Horton&nbsp;as LionelAfter budding journalist Lionel teamed up with radio host Sam to investigate the mysterious Xes they’d seen around campus, they came face-to-face with Giancarlo Esposito —&nbsp;the series’ narrator.“Lionel and Sam, they are seeing a lot of Xes, and Lionel is realizing that there is a lot of hidden things at Winchester that he wants to uncover. He’s realizing that a lot of the systematic racism is stemming from the secret societies — or at least he thinks so. So, I think Sam is going to help him uncover that and now there is this elite group of people … and the narrator’s come in. I guess that’ll be a window into what the secret societies are about. I would hope!”Brandon P. Bell as Troy(Photo by Netflix)No longer a buttoned-up future politician, Troy hasn’t been the same since he threw a chair through the window in a riot that ended the first season. In the second season, Troy embraced the slacker life and even tried his hand at stand-up comedy.“I like the different dynamic —&nbsp;the dynamic of, like, picture perfect versus just a mess and unsure. As an actor its fun because it’s two sides of the same person. It was great to play, because even though he has a sense of liberation when he shattered the window, he’s still in turmoil. He’s masking that by drinking, partying, because he doesn’t want to deal.”As for the stand-up, “Me and Marque, who plays Reggie, took stand up classes just as an exercise. It’s extremely difficult. You have to really like, not care, and its easier said than done. Because when you get up there and nobody laughs at what’s funny with your friends, you instantly get insecure. Instantly. And there’s nothing you can do to mask that other than to practice it. So, I’ll say out of respect for the medium, I suck at stand up comedy. It is so hard.”Antoinette Robertson as CocoCoco’s episode focused on her decision of whether or not to have an abortion. And after a flash-forward, fantasy future in which she had the child, she snapped back to the present and decided to terminate her pregnancy.“I’m super proud of her for being courageous enough to listen to her heart and her feelings and not let anyone else — not society, her family, whatever the case may be — dictate what she decided to do with her body. I think that’s a big deal. Especially when we see through the flash-forward episode, the Sliding Doors [moment], you see that she could either live vicariously through her daughter, or she could choose herself and give herself the potential to reach the height of success that she’s always dreamt of, so I’m happy that she chose herself. And I’m super proud of her for being courageous and doing so.”Ashley Blaine Featherson&nbsp;as Joelle(Photo by Netflix)Joelle not only repaired her friendship with roommate Sam, but she also (finally!) hooked up with Reggie.On Joelle and Reggie: “As a fan of the show, I was happy that they finally got together. And I don’t know what’s going to happen going forward, but I think that moment was still pretty satisfying. And I like that it wasn’t so easy. It wasn’t just like, oh now they’re [together]. They had a conversation, they still went through nine episodes in the second season playing at it.”On Joelle and Sam: “Logan and I are really good friends in real life, so it just is always a joy to play besties. … You realize that now that they live together, despite how close they were in season one, that they were hiding things that just have to come up and have to be addressed because they’re four feet away from each other.”John Patrick Amedori as GabeOn Gabe and Sam’s future: “I don’t know where it’ll go, but I do think they’ll both be a little bit mature in how those situations with each other from now on. It really broke down a lot of emotional walls with each other.”On what he learned about his character: “I just learned more about Gabe’s conviction, his motivation. He’s an emotional person. He’s very susceptible to Sam’s emotions and her struggles even though he doesn’t understand it. I just learned more about how much he’s willing to put himself out there to be an example, which may or may not come into play later on in season 3 or something, but I think that’d be cool to explore more, because I feel like that’s a strength of his, is his empathy, and his willingness to put himself out there.”Marque Richardson as Reggie&nbsp;(Photo by Netflix)On what he learned about his character: “I learned that Reggie really doesn’t know who he is at all, or who he wants to be, which I think is blocking his healing —&nbsp;especially going through the PTSD and still having that façade of badass, tough guy, whatever, and not fully leaning in to his vulnerability with other people and even himself. He hasn’t even gone there yet, so we’ll see how it all plays out.”What does everyone want to see in season 3?Bell: “I want to see more about Lionel’s heritage. Because it’s obvious how important and influential our upbringing is. Like, Coco not getting enough from her mother. Troy’s dad, this is the result of that, and Lionel is still kind of a mystery. We found out in season 1 his dad left really early.”Howard: “I want to see that! I mean, I feel like a lot of times for people of that demographic, who find themselves later on, find out, ‘Oh, I like this rather than that.’ I think there’s a coming-to-Jesus moment sometimes, or that’s what I’ve heard and studied. And, I feel like there’s a certain point in life they realize, ‘Oh, that’s it.’ I’m curious to see when did he discover that?”Robertson: “I want to see Coco have more fun. I just do. I feel like everything was so heavy this season that when you saw her with Kurt there was this moment that you saw this giggly Coco that you really haven’t ever seen before. You saw Colandrea, maybe, a little bit more. The guard was down more, but seeing Coco, still vixen outside, but giggle when a boy kissed her, even though its not serious, was nice to see her life after an abortion. She made a decision, and she wasn’t in a room with her head down and super depressed. It was, ‘I’m going to go out, and I’m going to live my life, and I’m going to be true to myself and what I want.’ And I love that.”Richardson: “More car chases.”Featherson: “I’m excited about the Order of X, and I’m also excited to see what happens with Giancarlo.”Browning: “I’m excited for more group scenes because in season 1, the groups were all pitted against each other. Season 2, there was all of us coming together. So with season 3, now we get to play. It would be fun to have more group scenes where everyone is interacting again in a space where they’re not butting heads.”Featherson: “I’m excited to see if Coco and Sam stay friends, or if they are friends. I don’t really know what’s going on. That’s exciting. Oh, Joelle and Coco too.”Amedori: “Troy doing his stand-up.”Dear White People&nbsp;seasons 1 and 2 are now available on Netflix.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"crime, stand-up, political, The, south, The, and, cancelled, books, Bowl","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"dear-white-people-stars-on-cameos-secret-societies-and-season-3"},{"id":"47612912209243","title":"21 Most Memorable Movie Moments: Crossing the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma (2014)","content":"Newsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})21 Most Memorable Movie Moments: Crossing the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma (2014)Congressman John Lewis and actor Stephan James reflect on the movie's final, triumphant bridge-crossing, and what Selma – the movie and events –&nbsp;means to them.by Jacqueline Coley | June 18, 2019 |  CommentsWatch: Congressman John Lewis of Georgia and actor Stephan James&nbsp;on the making of&nbsp;Selma&nbsp;above.In 2019, Rotten Tomatoes turns 21, and to mark the occasion we’re&nbsp;celebrating the 21 Most Memorable Moments from the movies&nbsp;over the last 21 years. In this special video series, we speak to the actors and filmmakers who made those moments happen, revealing behind-the-scenes details of how they came to be and diving deep into why they’ve stuck with us for so long.&nbsp;Once we’ve announced all 21, it will be up to you, the fans, to vote for which is the most memorable moment of all. In this episode of our ‘21 Most Memorable Moments’ series, Congressman John Lewis and actor Stephan James, who portrayed Rep. Lewis in Selma,&nbsp;share their memories from production and reflect on the movie’s importance.&nbsp;VOTE FOR THIS MOMENT&nbsp;IN OUR 21 MOST MEMORABLE MOVIE MOMENTS POLLTHE MOVIE:&nbsp;Selma (2014)  99%Fifty&nbsp;years after Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and a host of activists and religious leaders marched from Selma to Montgomery to protest voting&nbsp;discrimination, Ava DuVernay released Selma into theaters. The first film from a major studio to chronicle the Civil Rights icon’s life,&nbsp;Selma&nbsp;was no Wikipedia-style, all-encompassing biopic; instead, the&nbsp;movie focused on three months of&nbsp;the southern pastor’s life, and – after documenting earlier attempts to start the march in devastating scenes – culminated in a moving recreation of the historic&nbsp;procession across the Edmund Pettus Bridge&nbsp;that began the Selma to Montgomery march of 1965.With meticulous attention&nbsp;to historical accuracy, stirring drama, and memorable imagery,&nbsp;Selma&nbsp;heralded&nbsp;publicist-turned-director DuVernay’s arrival as one of the most significant African American filmmakers of her time; she would become, with&nbsp;Selma,&nbsp;the only Black woman to have directed a Best Picture nominee, and go on to such landmark achievements as the documentary&nbsp;13th&nbsp;and this year’s Netflix miniseries&nbsp;When They See Us.&nbsp;It also offered a new and nuanced take on Dr. King – magnificently portrayed by David Oyelowo – and educated a whole new generation on the fight for the Voting Rights Act of 1965. Congressman John Lewis of Georgia was there back in 1965, walking the bridge with Dr. King, and here he reflects on making the movie and its impact, along with Stephan James, who portrays him on screen.David Oyelowo plays Martin Luther King Jr. in Selma. (Photo by Atsushi Nishijima/©Paramount Pictures/Courtesy Everett Collection)“Some people did not know that people couldn’t register to vote just because of the color of their skin.”Rep. John Lewis:&nbsp;“I truly believe that Oprah, Ava, and the staff working on&nbsp;the film sought my involvement because they knew my history. Selma represented an attempt to redeem the soul of America, to help us move closer to the participation of all people&nbsp;in the political process.&nbsp;This film can educate and inform&nbsp;the mind of hundreds and&nbsp;thousands&nbsp;of young people around America and around the world.&nbsp;So many people did not know that people couldn’t register to vote just because of the color of their skin. They did not know that people were segregated. They did not know that lawyers and doctors, college professors, and teachers we discriminated against simply because of the color of their skin. They’re not participating in the democratic process. They did not understand that people were murdered attempting to register to vote. It was real. The whole story of Selma and the State of Alabama.”“I was so honored to be able to step into Congressman Lewis’s shoes, and I hope I and the rest of the cast did him, and the story, justice.”Stephan James:&nbsp;“I was so honored to be able to step into Congressman Lewis’s shoes and I hope that I and the rest of the cast did him, and the story, justice. Really it was just about being grateful to him and gracious to him, for being such a big supporter of the film, a supporter of me. He’s always made me feel like this role was meant for me. He’s always expressed how proud he is of the film and of his portrayal. So for me, it’s just one of those things you’re just grateful for. You just wanna tell him how much you’re thankful for what he’s accomplished.”Ava DuVernay on the set of Selma. (Photo by Atsushi Nishijima/©Paramount Pictures/Courtesy Everett Collection)“[Ava] got everybody on the same page and created a familial environment where everybody felt that we were creating this story from a place of love.”James:&nbsp;“Ava really is one of a kind. It takes a special sort of filmmaker to pull off what&nbsp;she did in Selma. And on her first big-budget film. She really hadn’t made a film for over a million dollars before&nbsp;Selma. And for me, I can just remember being just a little bit in awe of the way she helmed the set. We had all these days of hundreds of background actors, horses, and just wild and crazy things. It could be a lot for a director.&nbsp;But she got everybody on the same page and created this familial environment where everybody felt [the] energy that we were creating this story from a place of love, and understood the responsibility in telling the story.”THE MOMENT: The Final Crossing Of the BridgeUnder the crippling Alabama&nbsp;sun, the movie’s&nbsp;cast of Oscar-caliber actors, talented newcomers, and hundreds of background players and crew members assembled on the Edmund Pettus Bridge to recreate history – over and over. The film depicts three attempts to cross the bridge. The first&nbsp;attempt took place March 7, 1965, and became known as “Bloody Sunday” after State Troopers attacked the protesters – a confrontation DuVernay captures&nbsp;in unsparing detail.&nbsp;Two days later, Dr. King led a group of thousands to the bridge, including clergy from across the country&nbsp;who took to their knees to pray with him in front of gathered troopers, before&nbsp;he turned the march around – a pivotal move that encouraged President Johnson to introduce the&nbsp;Voting Rights bill into Congress shortly thereafter. The final time we see the bridge is for DuVernay’s depiction of the events of March 21, 1965, when Dr. King led the federally sanctioned march from Selma that would end with a rally on the steps of the Montgomery capitol four days later. It’s this final triumphant march in the film that lingers as a testament to what Dr. King achieved, but much of its power rests on the raw depiction of the events that preceded it.Wendell Pierce and Stephan James in Selma. (Photo by Atsushi Nishijima/©Paramount Pictures/Courtesy Everett Collection)“Wearing a backpack the same way that I did on March 7, 1965… The young man who played Dr. King was dressed like Martin Luther King Jr.&nbsp;“Rep. Lewis:&nbsp;“I did have a chance to spend time with the young man who played me and the young man who played Martin Luther King Jr. I got to know them fairly well. The two young people that I got to know, they really became the embodiment of the whole struggle in Selma. They made the film so real, not only the way they spoke but the clothing that they wore. I really loved the way they tried to walk in our shoes. It made the film so real with the young man wearing a trench coat and&nbsp;wearing a backpack the same way that I did. The young man who played Dr. King was dressed like Martin Luther King Jr., and he spoke like Martin Luther King Jr.”James:&nbsp;“It’s a big credit to the great wardrobe stylists, the head of costumes, Ruth E. Carter. We were totally factual in terms of the clothes of John Lewis, Dr. King, and everybody on Bloody Sunday. We were 100 percent accurate. We followed those photos from those exact moments.”“I think we all understood how sacred that bridge was, and what our jobs were in reenacting this whole moment.”James:&nbsp;“We didn’t have a whole lot of time. I’d say maybe three to five [takes] of the full walk. There are&nbsp;so many people, cast and background actors; we only have a few shots at this. And everybody would just get together, get on the same page and did it in unison. I can’t remember how many people there were but, cast and crew included, and there was just this sort of solemn sort of energy where everybody sort of understood what we were doing. I think we all understood how sacred that bridge was and what our jobs were in reenacting this whole moment. We were retracing historical footsteps – I mean you’re literally tracing the steps. These steps that have guided us through the history of our country. It’s meaningful. And it gets to the point where you’re not just making a film; you’re recreating a moment in time.”Marchers crossing the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma. (Photo by Atsushi Nishijima/©Paramount Pictures/Courtesy Everett Collection)“You just think about how brave this man is and what he did to inspire a generation of people like him.”Rep. Lewis:&nbsp;“I did get an opportunity to visit the set at a church in Atlanta. And while being there, visiting the set, a storm came up, and it started thundering and lightning, and they had to cut off the filming for a while and start it over again. But it reminded me of sometimes, during mass beatings and rallies&nbsp;and church services, a storm would come up, in Alabama or some other part of the deep south, and you had to get in the action.”James:&nbsp;“I really hadn’t spoken to John in the flesh. I had some communications with him through email. But to actually see him in the flesh for the first time… He walked in the middle of one of our scenes, and it was one of those moments where everything like freezes, and he’s the only person who is still in real time. You just think about how brave this man is and what he did to inspire a generation of people like him who are changing the world now today. And he’s still doing incredible work. I&nbsp;just saw him the other day at the Academy Awards. We shared a little moment. It’s pretty special to meet a guy like that in person and just know the impact he’s had on your life and the impact that he’s had on the world.”THE IMPACT: A New&nbsp;Legacy of ActivismSelma&nbsp;earned rightful praise for its historical accuracy, the nuance and beauty of its storytelling, and for its performances – it sits Certified Fresh at 99% on the Tomatometer. And it ushered in a new wave of formidable talent; not just DuVernay, but Oyelowo and co-stars like Tessa Thompson, LaKeith Stanfield, Andre Holland, and, of course, James, who would go on to star in Amazon’s&nbsp;Homecoming. Its impact off-camera has been powerful, too.&nbsp;Selma&nbsp;has become a standard in history classes, and some say it was the turning point for major changes to the Academy Awards.The movie received two Oscar nominations at the 2015&nbsp;ceremony: Best Picture and Best Original Song for “Glory,” performed by John Legend and featuring Common, which would win on the night. But many moviegoers and industry insiders&nbsp;were shocked to see DuVernay and Oyelowo left out of the Best Director and Best Actor categories, respectively. Frustrated by&nbsp;the snubs and the fact that no persons of color were nominated for major awards that year,&nbsp;Twitter user April Reign created the #OscarsSoWhite hashtag that trended globally for several days, and which had an impact that would last years. The Academy responded to the controversy by passing new rules and voting guidelines that helped to make membership more closely resemble that of the general moviegoing audience. The efforts have resulted in a new crop of Academy voters and possibly the nominations that would go to non-traditional films like Mad Max: Fury Road, Black Panther, Lady Bird, Get Out, and The Shape of Water.&nbsp;In recreating history, DuVernay had made some history of her own.“It moved me.&nbsp;They were able to make the&nbsp;drama&nbsp;come alive&nbsp;on the streets&nbsp;of Selma.”Rep. Lewis:&nbsp;“Watching the film and just listening to the music. It moved me.&nbsp;They were able to make the drama come alive&nbsp;on the streets of Selma. To make the words, the suffering, the tears, the crying, but also the strength and the determination that, in spite of everything, that we were going to continue until we got the Voting Rights Act of 1965 passed. People started singing ‘Glory.’ I watched with students — high school, elementary school, teachers, parents — and we just start singing ‘Glory’ and I start singing, and they cry, then I cry, and we are crying together. Because&nbsp;you cannot separate the essence of&nbsp;Selma&nbsp;without ‘Glory.'”James:&nbsp;“I can’t remember anything that I’ve been prouder to be a part of than Selma. I think the way that the whole film came together… I just felt incredibly fortunate to have been a part of that cast, with that ensemble, under the direction of Ava. And to share that moment with my mom and my cousins who I brought to the film’s premiere. I don’t know, it felt like a dream come true and something I won’t forget.”Stephan James and John Lewis at the premiere of Race. (Photo by Photo by Teresa Kroeger/WireImage)“Words can’t express what it’s meant for me to be a part of a film you’re able to teach to young kids.”James:&nbsp;“Selma feels like a triumph; it’s always felt like a triumph. Words can’t express what it’s meant for me to be a part of a film like that, where you’re able to teach to young kids. It blows me away that we’re able to show this story to young kids. Selma&nbsp;is in high schools, and&nbsp;middle schools, and kids are&nbsp;able to learn not just about the history of this country but the history of the world. And to learn about these young men and young women who were out there on the front lines of justice every day doing things, sacrificing things that we couldn’t imagine, just so we can do what we’re able to do today. That to me is the defining purpose of what Selma means, the fact that we’re able to teach people about history. A history that often gets watered down and washed away with time. And what better way to do that than through cinema? It strikes me as an important film and important&nbsp;moment for cinema.”Selma&nbsp;was released on November 18, 2016.&nbsp;Buy or rent it at FandangNOW.Like this?

Even if you never find another Southern Gothic, slow-burn, anti-buddy detective story that strikes every creepy chord of True Detective, you might enjoy one of these:Top of the LakeWhat it is: Elizabeth Moss (Mad Men) plays Detective Robin Griffin searching for a 12-year-old pregnant girl in Sundance Channel’s miniseries directed by Jane Campion and Gerard Lee.Commitment: The complete series is seven 50-minute installments. (Learn more in our Top of the Lake Weekly Binge).Why you might like it: Atmospheric and disturbing, the mystery unravels in a remote enclave of Southern New Zealand where misfits are the norm. Compelling digressions build strong characters.The Wicker Man 89%What it is: No, not the one with Nic Cage punching a bunch of ladies in the face. The 1974 version by British director Robin Hardy holds up as cult horror film and compelling mystery.Commitment: A short but intense ride, the original Wicker Man movie runs just 88 minutes.Why you might like it: Creepy factor is a 10 on account of religious themes and folksy terror (and animal masks). The mystery will keep you guessing until the end — and stay with you for a long time.The BridgeWhat it is: On the bridge connecting El Paso and Juarez, the discovery of a corpse — which turns out to be the halves of two different women — forces a duo of detectives from opposite sides of the U.S.-Mexico border to work together.Commitment: Season one delivers the entire story arc of this particular crime in 13 episodes. Season two is coming to FX this summer.Why you might like it: The unlikely partnership between a Texan straight-laced female police officer with Asperger’s and a not-so-by-the-book Mexican male detective takes this manhunt figuratively and literally all over the map.WallanderWhat it is: Kenneth Brannagh is Kurt Wallander, a rumpled, middle-aged, self-loathing detective whose most challenging mystery is his own existential crisis. PBS’s Masterpiece Mystery! miniseries is based on popular Swedish crime novels by Henning Mankell.Commitment: So far, Wallander is three seasons, with a total of nine 90-minute stand-alone mysteries.Why you might like it: Brannagh’s world-class acting animates an intriguing character, while the dark mysteries satisfy the pickiest at-home sleuths. Cinematographer Anthony Dod Mantle (Slumdog Millionaire) interprets the Swedish countryside with gloomy beauty, even in broad daylight.The Silence 88%What it is: Baran bo Odar’s German crime film is an intense, psychological whodunit which connects two murders over the span of 23 years.Commitment: The Silence takes two hours to accomplish what other storytellers need an entire season of television to do.Why you might like it: Similar to True Detective, the heinous crimes in The Silence occur decades apart, weaving a narrative about the investigators, victims and killers from past to present.Angel Heart 79%What it is: A crime noir starring Mickey Rourke, Robert De Niro and Lisa Bonet, the movie Angel Heart follows a sleazy private investigator’s unpredictable journey from Harlem to the heart of the bayou.Commitment: Experience the descent into hell in just under two hours.Why you might like it: Angel Heart showcases strong acting against the steamy, occult-ridden backdrop of New Orleans in the 1950s. Also, Matthew McConaughey picked it as one of his Five Favorite Films.BroadchurchWhat it is: After the mysterious death of an 11-year-old boy in a British coastal village, Detectives Alec Hardy and Ellie Miller probe the lives of multiple suspects.Commitment: BBC America aired the eight episodes of season one in 2013 and season two is on its way.Why you might like it: Impeccably paced, Broadchurch sustains a multidimensional character study with masterful acting and an ominous, vivid sense of place. In a small town where everyone is a suspect, paranoia and grief are treated with equal weight.HannibalWhat it is: Hannibal Lecter is a brilliant psychiatrist consulting for FBI agent Will Graham in NBC’s prequel to Silence of the Lambs.Commitment: Season one is 13 42-minute episodes; NBC is currently airing new episodes of season two, which is Certified Fresh by critics.Why you might like it: Hannibal takes a more cerebral (and totally gross-out) approach to the serial killer genre than other prime-time procedurals, using multiple episodes to unfold each mystery, along with Lecter and Graham’s especially dark connection.Sin Nombre 88%What it is: A thrilling Spanish-language film depicts a teen’s attempt to quit a notorious Mexican street gang.Commitment: Sin Nombre is 96 fierce minutes.Why you might like it: In his directorial debut, True Detective director Cary Joji Fukunaga delivers an immersive character study within the richly detailed world of Mexican gang violence.Zodiac 89%What it is: David Fincher (Fight Club, Se7en) renders the perplexing true-life mystery of San Francisco’s Zodiac Killer with suspense, style and an all-star cast.Commitment: At 157 minutes, Zodiac is the perfect rainy-day movie.Why you might like it: Fincher’s ability to build tension over long sequences of moody photography will have your hairs standing on end and — even though Zodiac is a long one — when it’s over, you’ll wish there were more.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"ViacomCBS","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"life-after-true-detective-what-to-watch-next"},{"id":"47612901667159","title":"Keanu Reeves and Chad Stahelski’s Oral History of Action Game-Changer John Wick","content":"Oral Historiesvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Keanu Reeves and Chad Stahelski's Oral History of Action Game-Changer John WickThe star and director of John Wick go deep on their long history –&nbsp;they met on The Matrix! –&nbsp;bringing the Wick world to life, and making some of cinema's most memorable action moments.by RT Staff | May 9, 2019 |  CommentsThe story of New York’s stylish and deadly Baba Yaga began in Sydney, Australia where Keanu Reeves and then stunt-double Chad Stahelski met while shooting&nbsp;The Matrix in the 1990s.&nbsp;There, the two men formed a strong bond and drew a great deal of influence from&nbsp;Matrix&nbsp;directors the Wachowski siblings.&nbsp;More than a decade later, they would be working together again on the first&nbsp;John Wick&nbsp;film, with Reeves in the lead role and Stahelski as co-director with David Leitch (Stahelski would go on to direct&nbsp;Chapter 2&nbsp;and&nbsp;Chapter 3, solo).

And while it’s been nearly two years since Avengers: Endgame first premiered in theaters, the story (and some of the major plot-points therein) are still having an impact on our heroes Sam Wilson/The Falcon (Anthony Mackie) and Bucky Barnes/The Winter Soldier (Sebastian Stan).Steve Rogers’ (Chris Evans) closest friends never were top-tier in&nbsp;the Avengers franchise, but it looks like The Falcon and The Winter Soldier is aiming to change that. Can Sam and Bucky rise to the challenge against a mysterious new foe, while also reconciling with their own pasts in order to see where they fit in a post-Endgame world without Captain America? And, more importantly, will the fans want to come along for the ride?Here’s what critics are saying about The Falcon and The Winter Soldier&nbsp;episode 1 (note: reviews&nbsp;are posted&nbsp;under each episode —rather than on the season 1 page — since critics are supplied with&nbsp;new&nbsp;episodes each week just before their debut):HOW ARE ANTHONY MACKIE AND SEBASTIAN STAN?Anthony Mackie and Sebastian Stan are on top form, with the latter really given the chance to shine as Bucky struggles to find his place in the world. His peaceful sabbatical in Wakanda as the White Wolf is over, so what happens when he’s confronted by the sins of his past? That’s a question this series looks to be setting out to answer, and if this first episode is any indication, that could take the character to some extraordinary places. –Josh Wilding, ComicBookMovie.comMackie and Stan stretch nicely in their expanded roles, finding room to play with both high drama and dark comedy, respectively — an odd couple in emotional beats as much as their actual character pairing. Stan finds touching humor in Bucky’s impossible circumstances (yes, we get Bucky on a date, and it is everything), and Mackie’s expressive eyes and face bookend the episode with two wordless yet striking scenes. We don’t need any explanation for Sam’s grief, doubt, and disappointment when we watch the actor in those moments. –Proma Khosla, MashableBetween the jaw-clenched brooding and reflective staring, Mackie and Stan find small but meaningful moments to illustrate their innate charms. Mackie’s smile has a natural glow that’s impossible to resist, and he gets to crack it a few times while “Uncle Sam” (yup) jokes with his young nephews or cajoles his sister into a new business plan. Stan, meanwhile, has this simple little moment with a Maneki-neko that’s destined for meme glory (while still conveying Bucky’s deep desire for the world to stop moving, just for a second, so he can catch up). Once these two get together, making enough time for fans to enjoy their natural charisma among the requisite action scenes may be the show’s greatest challenge. –Ben Travers, IndieWireFor Mackie — a prolific character actor many first noticed in his role in “Half Nelson” fifteen years ago — this is an overdue moment in the sun. Mackie’s work in the Marvel films has been consistently strong but somewhat underwritten, given the magnitude of his talent. What is striking about his presence here is that he is permitted to embody complexity. –Daniel D’Addario, VarietyDOES IT STRIKE A GOOD BALANCE BETWEEN ACTION AND DRAMA?(Photo by © Disney+, @ Marvel Studios)On the surface, the action sequences are arguably some of the best seen in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. –Dewey Singleton, AwardsWatchThe trailers for The Falcon and the Winter Soldier promised a lot of action in this series, and the first episode doesn’t have much of it. The few action sequences that are in the premiere are stellar, but this is a show that doesn’t mind taking its time. –Charlie Ridgely, ComicBook.comTonally it’s along the lines of The Winter Soldier and the start of Civil War, at least regarding political jockeying and America-centric military issues. That’s both good and bad. On the one hand, the series could delve into some very worthy considerations of what it means to serve, to come home, to feel unmoored by a world that has moved past you; it could even reach Wanda-levels of introspection and emotional resonance regarding consequence. On the other, it could devolve into more of how this first episode starts: Call of Duty-esque mumbo jumbo, murder, explosions. –Allison Keene, Paste MagazineHOW DOES IT PORTRAY&nbsp;THE POST-BLIP WORLD?(Photo by Chuck Zlotnick/Marvel Studios)With this show, we’re able to get more of Sam’s backstory, which hasn’t been much of a focus previously. Poised to perhaps take the reigns from Steve Rogers, we’re able to connect with him on another level; learning more about his family and life before The Avengers. And we’ll also see how he’s dealing with returning post-“blip”, having missed five years, and what that experience is like. –Jordi Sirkin, Jordi Reviews ItBy honing in on Sam’s anxiety as a black man on the precipice of taking up the moniker of America’s Aryan saviour, the writers have added a layer of complexity to his character that we hadn’t seen before. Mackie, too, steps up to the plate in a big way, exhibiting a rawness that is hard to come by in superhero fare. –Ben Allen, GQ Magazine [UK]The Falcon show features the boffo action opening, and also a richer exploration of the lives of those left behind in the Snap and of the internal contradictions of being a Black superhero in a country that doesn’t fully embrace Blackness than Marvel has ever approached. –Daniel Fienberg, Hollywood ReporterSpellman and his writers have a blast with the post-Endgame world, using the space allowed a TV series to ask questions that movies simply don’t have time to address. Do Avengers get paid? What actually happens to a nation’s infrastructure when billions of people reappear after five years? The nerdy world-building is given room to breathe and it’s a hoot. –Jacob Hall, SlashFilmNow, with his mind finally free of Hydra’s influence, Bucky is a 104-year-old man trying to find peace — or at least his version of it. In many ways, Bucky’s story is a sadder version of the one presented by Steve Rogers. After Steve was thawed out from the ice by Nick Fury, fans only got to see brief glimpses of him readjusting to modern society. The Falcon and Winter Soldier gives viewers more time to see Bucky attempt his rehabilitation tour. –Tim Adams, CBRIS THE PRODUCTION VALUE WORTHY OF THE MCU?Primetime Emmy–nominated director Kari Skogland (The Handmaid’s Tale; The Loudest Voice) is easily the biggest standout here, as she brings a very unique eye to the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Some of the camera angles she utilizes throughout the first episode feel so intimate, it’s almost like you’re inside the characters’ heads, a trick that works especially well in Bucky’s therapy scene. The premiere does feel familiar — staying true to the tone set by the Russo Brothers in The Winter Soldier and Civil War — but under her direction, everything feels oddly fresh and exciting at the same time. –Rohan Patel, ComicBookMovie.comThe excellent production values and interesting writing/directing is what make The Falcon and The Winter Soldier worth watching. –Allison Skornick-Rose, Flick DirectANY FINAL THOUGHTS?(Photo by Chuck Zlotnick/Marvel Studios)As enjoyable as it is to catch up with the two leads (while being treated to some jaw-dropping action), this is definitely something of a slow burn which drops plenty of hints about what’s to come without rushing into bringing in characters like Sharon Carter and Zemo. –Josh Wilding, ComicBookMovie.comWith a timeliness its creators could not have predicted, “The Falcon and The Winter Soldier” will likely grow to feel as necessary to our national conversation as “Wandavision” did this winter. Possibly even more so, with themes of national chaos and what “American values” really mean.And, maybe most importantly, how we move forward. –Brigid Presecky, Impressionist MediaThe series has so much inherent potential to be a breakthrough moment for action storytelling, so long as it leans more into the unique skills of its nimble characters, and not just what makes them flashy in short bursts. –Nick Allen, RogerEbert.com“The Falcon and the Winter Soldier” has yet to reach its ideal cruising altitude but it’s smooth, slow climb that promises to take viewers to new, exciting destinations. –Lorraine Ali, Los Angeles TimesThe Falcon and The Winter Soldier premieres Friday, March 19, on Disney+.On an Apple device?

A thoughtful, well-considered biopic can do what your history textbook never could: make the past come alive and comment on our present moment. Here’s a batch of fresh-rated biopics of people famous — Jackie Robinson, Queen Elizabeth II — and not-quite-so. That’s the other secret power of films about real people: immortalizing nearly-forgotten institutionalized female artists and recovering drug addicts who go on very long hikes.42 (2013)  81%This underappreciated film should have made Chadwick Boseman a movie star. He’s that good as baseball legend Jackie Robinson. Of course, Get On Up also should have made Chadwick Boseman a movie star. He played James Brown in that one and nobody went to see it, either. But back to 42: Boseman all but resurrects the patient, determined, no-nonsense athlete who broke the color barrier in professional baseball way back in 1947 during his rookie season with the Brooklyn Dodgers. It was, as you might imagine, not an easy task. Hate from fans and his own teammates tested the man every time he took the field, but Robinson never gave anyone the satisfaction of clapping back. Director Brian Helgeland, along with his extremely talented lead, creates a sobering look back at the historical realties of American sports and American racism. As for Boseman, he’s about to enter the Marvel universe as Black Panther. Movie star achievement coming soon.Watch TrailerBelle (2014)  84%Maybe you thought this was just another period British costume drama, the kind that country creates with impeccable precision, all for your mom to enjoy. But Belle glides along in its own lane, taking on the ugliest truths about the English aristocracy, and inspired by the true story of Dido Elizabeth Belle (Gugu Mbatha-Raw). She was the mixed race child of Admiral John Lindsay, raised by her great-uncle Lord Mansfield in a world of privilege, one punctured by the restrictions of her race. It was the time of slavery in England, after all, which meant Belle was unable to participate fully in the world in which she lived. Solution: fight the power and work as an abolitionist, of course. Amma Assante’s direction is clear-cut and modern, necessarily imposing today’s wisdom on historical horror, while Mbatha-Raw (who was also excellent in the same year’s underrated Beyond The Lights) moves slyly through a story that demands her character’s allegiance to strict codes and the disobedient nerve to break them.Watch TrailerBright Star (2009)  82%So it’s the early part of the 19th century and you are a passionately-in-love couple of young people. But you have to keep it secret. That’s the problem faced by English poet John Keats (Ben Whishaw) and headstrong, fashion-minded Fanny Brawne (Abbie Cornish). They don’t even like each other much, at first, which is romantic-drama-speak for “gotta have it,” and no one approves, of course, which makes it that much hotter. But if you think you know how this all goes, then you should also know that it’s a film by Jane Campion (The Piano), one of the world’s great directors. Campion understands the clichés inherent in this kind of story and she navigates around them with skill and intensity, delivering instead a truthful film about living a real life in a time that required a crushing denial of that same reality.Watch TrailerCamille Claudel, 1915 (2013)  80%If you’re here for demanding, difficult director Bruno Dumont, then you’ve already seen this one. But chances are you’re here because Juliette Binoche is one of best actors on the planet and you never even knew this film existed. Well, get ready to work, because Camille Claudel, 1915 is an exacting drama of the long-take school, featuring a deeply felt, and highly specific performance from Binoche as an artist whose life was marked by slow, inexorable tragedy. Claudel, once the mistress of sculptor Auguste Rodin, is committed to an asylum in southern France and left to waste away. Binoche, burrowing deeply into the emptiness, speaks very little, but says everything. A tough but rewarding feel-bad experience for people who don’t need happy endings.Watch TrailerFruitvale Station (2013)  94%At the moment, Michael B. Jordan is impressing audiences in Creed, but his promise was announced with this earlier film by Creed’s director Ryan Coogler. It’s a true story, one that could have been taken from any headline of the past few years, and stars Jordan as Oscar Grant, a 22-year-old black man in Oakland, California, who lost his life on New Year’s Day, 2009, when he was murdered by a police officer at an Oakland BART station. It begins with cellphone video of the real killing. But instead of delving into documentary-style drama about the event itself, Coogler shows you Grant moving through his last day, dealing with work and family and friends. This approach heightens the despair and sense of wasted life by forcing the audience to live with the everyday humanity of the crime’s victim, rather than a just-the-facts approach resulting in one more numbing statistic created by institutional racism.Watch TrailerPhilomena (2013)  91%This tear-jerker is based on the harrowing story of Philomena Lee (Judi Dench), an Irish woman whose youthful unplanned pregnancy resulted in her confinement to a cruel, prison-like convent, her child put up for adoption against her will. In her later years, she joins a journalist (Steve Coogan) in the hunt for her now-adult lost child, unprepared for what she’ll find. Now, when the deck is this stacked with tragedy, a strong center is required to avoid overselling the pain. That means you go get Judi Dench. Audiences have placed massive amounts of goodwill in her, and for good reason. She’s a walking empathy machine, gently and intelligently tugging at your heart when lesser actors would mercilessly wrestle it to the ground. Her soft-spoken, perhaps needlessly naïve and devout truth-seeker (compared to the real life woman, whose relationship with the Church that abused her involves no love lost) is all goodness, all forgiveness. This is how she earns your tears. And you will shed them.Watch TrailerThe Queen (2006)  96%Is this really how Queen Elizabeth II behaved behind closed doors in the aftermath of Princess Diana’s death? Did she have a genuine crisis of manners and standards? Was she forced to contend with the changes taking place outside the confines of royal life, where contemporary public expectations of figureheads shifted, altered by that public’s relationship with Diana herself? We’ll probably never really know for sure, but as portrayed by Helen Mirren, we now want to believe that the stoic monarch in the pastel-colored hats had a dormant heart that grew three sizes the moment Elton John re-recorded “Candle in The Wind.” Mirren carries the film like it all rests on her shoulders – it does, by the way – and she does so gracefully, balancing regulation and feeling like a proper queen. She won a well-deserved Oscar for it, too.Watch TrailerSelma (2014)  99%One of the most critically acclaimed movies of 2014 was, strangely, ignored at the box office and by award-giving organizations. Perhaps it all felt like it might be the moviegoing equivalent of homework, but Ava DuVernay’s Selma is a huge achievement, both in re-examining the past through fresh eyes, as well as in sheer entertainment. This is not a saintly MLK. David Oyelowo portrays the legendary civil rights leader as a real, flawed, sometimes frightened, sometimes furious man, and you can’y take your eyes off him. Maybe people stayed away because the story of King’s campaign to secure the Voting Rights Act of 1965 might have felt too real in a moment when politicians are still trying to figure out ways to keep non-white Americans from voting. Whatever your reasons for avoiding it were, you were wrong. Go watch this one today.Watch TrailerViolette (2014)  86%You’ve heard about the famous French writer Simone de Beauvoir. Well, this is not about her. Instead, it’s the story of Violette Leduc, a French author who was deeply involved with de Beauvoir for years. As played by Emmanuelle Devos, this lesser-known literary figure is a fascinatingly complex cauldron of conflicting feelings, a woman filled with unhappiness who was stoutly determined to get what she wanted, grasping for life and personal connection anywhere she could find it. She had an iron will and a prickly personality that you won’t like, but also won’t soon forget. Sometimes it’s the unlikeliest people who make the most interesting subjects.Watch TrailerWild (2014)  88%This is not Reese Witherspoon’s 127 Hours, her Incredible Journey, or anything else you think it is. It’s a much more subtle story about a woman’s determination to finish what she starts and heal herself along the way. Based on Cheryl Strayed’s memoir, Wild tells the story of the troubled author’s 1,100 mile hike on the Pacific Crest Trail. She encounters danger and despair, but not the kind you expect. In fact, very little of this movie relies on the usual prestige picture story beats and cathartic uplifts, the kind that secure nominations and awards. Meanwhile, Witherspoon’s performance rivals her Oscar-winning turn as June Carter in Walk The Line. She’s that good, as is Laura Dern as her mother.Watch Trailer","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"cats, awards","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"10-biopics-to-watch-immediately"},{"id":"47612959421803","title":"RT’s 2015 Oscar Picks","content":"var mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})RT's 2015 Oscar PicksHere's who we think will win, and why.by Marya E. Gates | February 20, 2015 |  Comments.content_body .col_right{overflow:hidden!important}This time every year we at Rotten Tomatoes lock ourselves in a room, put our collective heads together and try to do the undoable: guess who will win at the Academy Awards. We know this is somewhat futile, but we love it. Last year we were 21/24. Let’s see if history repeats itself.Best Picture: Boyhood  97%Like last year, we see the race split between two frontrunners: Boyhood and Birdman. While Birdman has been gaining momentum with wins at the guild awards, we think it will be rewarded elsewhere. Best Picture seems the natural final leg for Boyhood‘s twelve-year journey.Best Director: Alejandro González Iñárritu for Birdman  91%That said, this is where we see the split heading, especially after Iñárritu took home the top prize from the Director’s Guild. While Linklater’s held his vision for twelve years, it’s hard to ignore Iñárritu’s impressive work with a large ensemble cast of actors and the film’s strong visual style.Best Actor: Eddie Redmayne for The Theory of Everything  80%Early on in the race, it seemed this was Michael Keaton’s award to lose. But as the race progressed, Redmayne’s transformation into Stephen Hawking took center stage, taking home the BAFTA, Golden Globe and SAG awards.Best Actress: Julianne Moore for Still Alice  85%This marks Julianne Moore’s 5th nomination (she’s lost four times, including the year she was nominated in two categories). The Academy loves to reward people for years of consistent good work (except poor Peter O’Toole!), and this year is Moore’s year. She’s already got the BAFTA, Critics Choice, NBR, Golden Globe and SAG. It’s time to make space on her mantle for one more.Best Supporting Actor: J.K. Simmons for Whiplash  94%In the role of his career, consummate character actor J.K. Simmons steals the show as the acerbic music teacher of your nightmares. Simmons is as sure a bet as you’ll find this year, having already won in this category at the BAFTAs, Critics Choice, Golden Globes, SAGs and countless film critic groups. His performance is just the Academy’s tempo.Best Supporting Actress: Patricia Arquette for Boyhood  95%While Emma Stone has been up-and-coming for years now, her nomination is her prize. This award is as good as Arquette’s. Critics and voters seem to agree that while the film is called Boyhood, it’s Arquette’s steadfast mother who is the heart of the film. Like J.K. Simmons, she’s racked up wins at the BAFTAs, Critics Choice, Golden Globes, SAGs and critics groups.Best Foreign Language Film: Ida  96%A couple of us here at Team Tomato would argue that this film should have made its way to the Best Picture category. This homage to the Polish New Wave of the early 1960s has already won several awards in this category.Animated Feature: Big Hero 6  90%In a year with no Pixar release (and a shocking lack of The Lego Movie), we think this Certified Fresh Disney crowd-pleaser will take the gold. We can’t wait to hear Baymax’s speech.Best Documentary: Citizenfour  96%The perfect storm of an interesting (and timely) story told in an interesting way, CitizenFour has been cleaning up in this category all season.Original Screenplay: The Grand Budapest Hotel  92%This is Wes Anderson’s third nomination in this category, but the first time one of his films has made the leap to Best Picture (and director and 7 more categories), so we think this is where the Academy will reward Anderson for bringing us his quirky, unique cinematic worlds for the past twenty years.Adapted Screenplay: Whiplash  94%While we debate the validity of putting this in the adapted category, we think this is where the Academy will show love to writer/director Damien Chazelle.Best Cinematography: Birdman  91%After losing in this category five times, it seems Emmanuel Lubezki is set for a back-to-back win after nabbing gold for Gravity. His work on Birdman helped create the illusion of a film that takes place in one seamless shot, hopefully ending on a podium.Best Film Editing: Boyhood  97%It’s often said a film is born in the editing room and without the work of Sandra Adair, Boyhood is just twelve years of footage. Side note: Adair has edited all of Linklater’s films since Dazed and Confused.Best Costume Design: Into the Woods  71%Costume designer Colleen Atwood practically is this category. She’s been nominated a whopping 11 times in the last twenty years, and we think this Sunday she’ll see her fourth win.Best Production Design: The Grand Budapest Hotel  92%Wes Anderson films have long been known for their distinct style and this film is the pinnacle. A world within a world within a world, all unique and exquisitely detailed.Best Music – Original Score: The Theory of Everything  80%The heart of this film is the relationship between Stephen Hawking and his wife Jane, and Jóhann Jóhannsson’s swelling, romantic score brings the viewers into their passion without ever overwhelming us with schmaltz.Best Music – Original Song: “Glory” from Selma  99%One of only two nominations for Ava DuVernay’s MLK biopic, it’s tough to think that if it doesn’t win here, it’ll go home empty-handed.Best Sound Editing: American Sniper  72%The Academy loves a well recorded war pic.Best Sound Mixing: Whiplash  94%Did you hear this movie? Did you see those drums? Our hearts are still beating to Fletcher’s tempo.Best Visual Effects: Interstellar  72%While Caesar and his clan were seamlessly brought to life in Dawn of the Planet of the Apes and Guardians of the Galaxy boasted some eye-popping visuals, we think every one of the nominees in this category utilized their effects in much the same fashion and achieved similar goals with them. Every one of the nominees, that is, except for Interstellar, whose depiction of mindbending theoretical concepts sets it apart from the pack.Best Makeup and Hairstyling: Guardians of the Galaxy  92%Big hair and fake noses are great and all, but the complete transformations of Zoe Saldana and David Bautista into their alien characters are out of this world.Best Short Film – Live Action: The Phone CallThe Phone Call stars the great Sally Hawkins as a suicide hotline operator and the great Jim Broadbent as the grief-stricken man on the other line. That’s right: this one’s got two recognizable actors, which means it’s twice as likely that Oscar voters got around to watching it.Best Short Film – Animated: The Bigger PictureWritten and directed by Daisy Jacobs, The Bigger Picture sounds like a run of the mill drama: two brothers take care of their elderly mother. But what makes this film exceptional is the animation itself: life-size characters painted on walls interacting with real objects, resulting in a refreshing “How’d they do that?” from viewers.Best Documentary Short: Crisis Hotline: Veterans Press 1American Sniper isn’t the only Oscar-nominated film about the psychological wounds of warfare; Crisis Hotline focuses on a suicide prevention call center for servicemen. It’s a haunting, observant document of a vital issue, and it’s sure to resonate with members of the academy.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"marvel, witnail, halloween","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"rts-2015-oscar-picks"},{"id":"47612975977840","title":"2014 GLAAD Media Awards Nominations","content":"var mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})2014 GLAAD Media Awards Nominationsby RT Staff | February 4, 2014 |  Comments.awmovie .celeb,.awmovie .nopic,.awmovie .single{float:left}The GLAAD Media Awards, which “recognize and honor media for their fair, accurate and inclusive representations of the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community and the issues that affect their lives,” announced its nominees on February 4.

This month, the actor reprises his role as Dr. Lazslo Kreizler in The Alienist: Angel of Darkness, season 2 of the period drama that based on the second book in Caleb Carr’s Kreizler series. With the TNT show and the highly anticipated&nbsp;Marvel Cinematic Universe&nbsp;series, The Falcon and The Winter Soldier, in which he’ll once again be playing the villainous Helmut Zemo, Brühl&nbsp;finds himself back in some familiar shoes.The details behind the Disney+ series are still a bit vague, as the project hasn’t fully completed filming. One thing we do know&nbsp;is that Brühl will finally be donning the Baron Zemo mask,&nbsp;which, if we’re being honest, is a super-exciting detail to whet our collective appetites.View this post on Instagram„Longing, Rusted, Seventeen, Daybreak, Furnace, Nine, Benign, Homecoming, One, Freight Car.“ Zemo is getting ready #SDCC @comic_con @marvel @marvelstudiosA post shared by Daniel Brühl (@thedanielbruhl) on Jul 23, 2019 at 10:57am PDTThen there’s his role in The King’s Man, the origin story for and prequel film to the Kingsman series of movies. The film, from 20th Century Studios and starring Ralph Fiennes and Harris Dickinson, was originally scheduled for 2019, but Disney’s takeover at Fox reportedly prompted its move to February 2020. It’s release date is now September 18, 2020.That’s a lot of press junkets in one year for any actor.The Alienist: Angel of Darkness&nbsp;returns to TNT next week with a two-episode premiere event, and buzz behind the Emmy-winning program’s return is running high. For good reason: the tonal mashup of procedural crime drama and gritty period piece — The Alienist drops audiences smack dab in the middle of New York’s Gilded Age —&nbsp;elevates&nbsp;a familiar television narrative by&nbsp;embellishing&nbsp;it with lavish costumes and historic details.It’s worth noting that Angel of Darkness, while&nbsp;technically a sequel to the first season,&nbsp;works as its own standalone story. Brühl’s Dr. Kreizler reunites with his rag-tag investigative cohorts Sara Howard (Dakota Fanning), now running her own detective agency, and New York Times journalist John Moore (Luke Evans) as they work to solve a string of baby murders amid a backdrop of political and cultural turmoil. The themes of women’s rights, police brutality, and racism create a conflicted, yet timely, story here.Ahead of the show’s return, Rotten Tomatoes spoke with Brühl about how his character has evolved since the series premiere, whether the show’s disturbing subject matter gives him nightmares, how the themes explored in The Alienist: Angel of Darkness are relevant today, and if&nbsp;the COVID-19 shutdown delayed his work on The Falcon and The Winter Soldier.(Photo by TNT)Aaron Pruner for Rotten Tomatoes: This season focuses a lot on Sara Howard, while Kreizler is cultivating his own relationships. Has Kreizler, as a character, changed in how you interpret him since you first took on the role?Daniel Brühl: Knowing about Sara’s psychological skills, Laszlo Kreizler is eventually willing to share power and to give in and to let Sarah Howard be in charge of that new mystery and of that new case. He becomes, emotionally, a more open-minded man thanks to the friendship with Sara and John and eventually even finds a kindred spirit, someone who he finds very fascinating.It’s so interesting because my wife is an alienist in real life. And she told me that many times the most brilliant psychologists you know, become very nervous when they have to deal with, you know, their own introspection and their own inner life. So they may be brilliant in, you know, analyzing their environment, and yet, they have problems in expressing what they are going through.The theme of child murder continues in season 2.&nbsp;Is it tough to separate yourself from the&nbsp;dark subject matter of the show?Brühl:&nbsp;It didn’t affect me that much when we were shooting the actual show, but watching it now gives me nightmares. I’m the father of a little boy and expecting my second baby to arrive soon. The fact that this show this time around deals more with motherhood and fatherhood, respectively, felt more universal. It was also interesting to realize how engaged my wife was when she watched the show. She said that it resonated more with her than the first season.(Photo by Nelly Kiss/TNT)This is a period piece, yet the issues explored in the series continue to feel quite timely — women’s rights, sensationalism in the news, police corruption, income inequality, and racism. What message are you hoping viewers will take away from watching?Brühl:&nbsp;It is very sad to see how long it takes for mankind to really make a change. It’s funny how history goes in waves. I wouldn’t say that it always goes in the wrong direction. Sometimes we advance, sometimes we evolve, and then, sometimes we go three steps back. So it is sadly fascinating to see that a story set in 1897 and a book written about that period that was published in the 1990s still feels so current.And what the story tells us is that it always takes a couple of courageous liberal modern minds to make a change. Unfortunately, mankind needs to have the worst things happen in order to move on. So the eruption that, fortunately, we witness these days internationally, due to the things that happened in the U.S., gives me a bit of optimism, because that avalanche, that eruption, and that message that racism has to stop, is being heard loudly and clearly at the moment. I hope that, finally, we will change and, hopefully, carry on doing so. We always have to hope that we will learn something from history.(Photo by Marvel)It’s been a busy year for you. Were your scenes in The Alienist or The Falcon and the Winter Soldier&nbsp;(pictured) affected by the shutdown?Brühl:&nbsp;The Falcon and Winter Soldier was. I still have to go back, and hopefully, we’ll be able to finish that project in Prague. We’ll see how the situation is in a month or two, but that’s the plan.Surprisingly, I was able to shoot my directorial debut, which is a film [called Next Door] that I had been thinking about and writing and developing for two or three years. When we were about to start the rehearsals, the quarantine kicked in and so for a moment, I thought that this project would die. Fortunately, it didn’t. We were able to shoot it in Berlin in a studio and trimmed down the crew a little bit. And so there weren’t any major problems that we were facing, and I just finished it.Have you been able to take any piece of wardrobe or prop home from The Alienist set?Brühl:&nbsp;My cane with that little bird, which became a toy for my little boy. He’s now using it as a sword. So I have to protect it from the night games he’s playing.What else? I think I may have taken a hat. The other stuff felt too period. I mean, it looks incredibly flashy and cool, but I think people here in Berlin would think, “What the heck happened to Daniel?”The Alienist: Angel of Darkness premieres&nbsp;Sunday, July 19 at&nbsp;9 p.m. on TNTThe Alienist: Angel of Darkness (2020) 86%#1Adjusted Score: 86.805% Critics Consensus: Tense and thrilling, if not terribly distinct, Angel of Darkness takes The Alienist in a darker direction while giving the superb Dakota Fanning more time to shine.Synopsis: In The Alienist: Angel of Darkness, Sara has opened her own private detective agency and is leading the charge on...

Not a whole lot, mind you, considering the best-reviewed stuff this week is, again, mostly limited to TV and the smaller theatrical releases, but it won’t be long before the awards contenders start showing up in this column. Speaking of which, we want to note that we previously wrote about The Act of Killing back in the beginning of December, when it was originally scheduled to hit shelves, and it turns out it was actually pushed back to this week; we apologize for the mistake. With all that said, here are this week’s selections:Closed Circuit 43%This thriller opened back in late August but failed to make much noise at the box office; critics weren’t particularly enthused about it either. Directed by John Crowley (whose well-received 2007 film Boy A was Andrew Garfield’s big screen debut), Closed Circuit stars Rebecca Hall and Eric Bana as ex-lovers who are reunited when they’re separately hired to defend a suspected terrorist in a high-profile trial. As classified details are uncovered, however, the pair begin to unravel a conspiracy that could endanger their lives. The film boasts an accomplished cast that includes Jim Broadbent, Ciaran Hinds, and Julia Stiles in supporting roles, but most critics found the conspiracy angle a bit predictable and the overall narrative a bit lacking in believability. At 40% on the Tomatometer, Closed Circuit is a mediocre legal thriller that never quite accomplishes what it’s going for.Runner Runner 7%As long as we’re talking about subpar thrillers populated by otherwise impressive actors, we might as well mention Runner Runner, director Brad Furman’s disappointing follow-up to surprise hit The Lincoln Lawyer. Justin Timberlake plays Richie Furst, a Princeton student with a penchant for online gambling who loses big and travels to Costa Rica to confront Ivan Block (Ben Affleck), the gambling mogul he believes has fleeced him. Instead, Ivan takes Richie under his wing, which draws the attention of an FBI agent who wants to put Ivan away for good. Critics largely conceded Runner Runner had the seed of a decent plot, but they also overwhelmingly agreed the film wasted its potential on a lifeless, poorly crafted script. At a mere 9% on the Tomatometer, this is one you can probably skip unless you’re really bored.Thanks for Sharing 50%If Steve McQueen’s Shame was too serious for you, maybe Thanks for Sharing is more your bag. It wasn’t for about half the critics who saw it, but hey, everybody’s different. The film follows three couples dealing in different ways with sexual addiction and stars folks like Mark Ruffalo, Tim Robbins, Gwyneth Paltrow, Patrick Fugit, Josh Gad, Joely Richardson, and, in a role that impressed quite a few folks, Alecia Moore, better known as pop artist Pink. Critics generally liked the performances here; they also felt that the material was treated a bit too superficially&nbsp;and that it couldn’t quite decide on a balanced tone. Thanks for Sharing sits at 49% on the Tomatometer, so it’s not entirely terrible; a little underwhelming might be more accurate.Archer – Season 4Those who remember the early days of Adult Swim and Home Movies are already well familiar with the voice of H. Jon Benjamin. These days, he pulls double duty as both the voice of frumpy patriarch Bob Belcher on Bob’s Burgers and that of cocksure super-agent Sterling Archer on FX’s Archer. This week, the fourth season of Archer goes on sale, complete with the first episode that finds Archer, having lost his memory, flipping patties at Bob’s Burgers while his wife and three kids mill about the restaurant. Over the past few years, the show has found its footing and a dedicated fanbase, and the fourth season currently rates a 93% on the Tomatometer, so it’s a pretty solid buy for anyone who’s a fan.Top of the LakeJane Campion has focused primarily on film over the past couple of decades, but she’s had success on television as well, most recently with her 2013 miniseries Top of the Lake. A joint production of BBC Worldwide and the Sundance Channel, the six-part series is set in New Zealand and stars Elisabeth Moss as a detective charged with investigating the disappearance of a pregnant 12-year-old girl. With a supporting cast that includes David Wenham, Holly Hunter, and Peter Mullan, to name a few, Top of the Lake received near universal acclaim from critics, who praised the acting and strong, atmospheric storytelling. Certified Fresh at 93%, it’s a relatively short but riveting trip worth taking.Also available this week:Birth of the Living Dead (95%), a documentary about George Romero and the societal impact of his debut, Night of the Living Dead.Inequality for All (92%), a Certified Fresh documentary exploring the widening income gap in America that’s equal parts witty and informative.We Are What We Are (87%), a Certified Fresh mystery/thriller about the dark secrets behind a strict, small-town patriarchal family.Big Ass Spider! (78%), a sci-fi comedy about two Los Angelenos who attempt to stop a giant rampaging spider.Tiger Eyes (66%), the big screen adaptation of the Judy Blume novel of the same name about a girl coming of age in a new town after the sudden death of her father.Linsanity (65%), a documentary chronicling Asian-American NBA star Jeremy Lin’s path to success, beginning with his early life.Season 2 of Copper (100%), the BBC America television series about an Irish detective working the Five Points neighborhood in 1860s New York.The first season of The Following (65%), starring Kevin Bacon and James Purefoy in a series about FBI agents tracking down a serial killer and his cultish followers.Season 3 of the North American remake of Being Human, a TV series about three Boston roommates who happen to be a ghost, a werewolf, and a vampire.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"renewals, Thanksgiving, Prime, of, Turner, king, Films, transformers, of, Bravo, kong, Grant","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"rt-on-dvd-and-blu-ray-archer-closed-circuit-and-more"},{"id":"47612963640685","title":"Interview: Kathleen Hanna on The Punk Singer, Sexism, Riot Grrrl and More","content":"var mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Interview: Kathleen Hanna on The Punk Singer, Sexism, Riot Grrrl and MoreThe feminist rock icon talks about her career, the movies that influenced her, and the new documentary about her life.by Luke Goodsell | November 28, 2013 |  CommentsThough she’d probably hate to admit it, Kathleen Hanna is a punk rock icon. As one of the founding members of Bikini Kill, Hanna was at the epicenter of the ’90s “riot grrrl” movement and a key music figure in radical feminism, a role she carried on into her dance pop outfit Le Tigre and her new band, The Julie Ruin. Along the way she’s inspired countless female (and male) musicians, gotten infamously punched by Courtney Love, and coined the phrase “Smells like teen spirit” (the latter incidents are unrelated, as far as we know.) She’s also one of the coolest (and nicest) people you could talk to.Hanna is the subject of Sini Anderson’s new documentary The Punk Singer, a biopic of sorts that charts the singer’s rise from performance art through punk rock and beyond, and doubles as a mini-history of the riot grrrl era. Featuring interviews with the likes of Joan Jett, Kim Gordon, Carrie Brownstein and Hanna’s partner, Adam Horowitz, the movie offers an intimate portrait of the musician, and allows Hanna herself to speak frankly about her life and her recent battle with an undiagnosed case of Lyme disease.Here, Hanna chats about the movies that inspired her, sexism in media, reconciling the past, the future of riot grrrl and more.I was hoping we could start by talking a little about movies. We’re always asking about people’s favorite films and I’m really curious as to some of yours, or perhaps some of the ones that were influential on you.Kathleen Hanna: Well, a really big movie for Bikini Kill was Ladies and Gentlemen, the Fabulous Stains, starring Diane Lane and Laura Dern. They’re in a punk band called The Fabulous Stains, and there’s members of The Clash that play kind of the rival boy band, called The Professionals. [Laughs] And their song is [sings] “We’re the pro-fess-ionals! Join the pro-fess-ionals!” It’s actually really good. I don’t know if you’ve seen that movie.Oh, I’ve seen it many times. Which version of “Professionals” do you prefer? ‘Cause there’s that one over the end credits where they’re all dolled up to do the MTV-style version.[Laughs] I like all of them! I like both of them. That was the thing about it. It was kind of interesting because it was kind of like what happened to Madonna — you know, with everybody copying how she dressed and showing up at her concerts. And it was also talking about this commercialization of things, and kind of going in the direction that the ’90s would go in — like, “You’re a sellout” and all that kind of stuff. I didn’t really realize that at the time. I mean, in high school we would say stuff like, “Oh, they’re sellouts now” and we didn’t really know what that meant. [Laughs] You know what I mean? It was like, “This band’s first EP was so great, but then everybody got into them,” and because everybody got into them that made them sellouts. Which is completely some random high-school way of thinking about things. But I remember that being the first film that I heard the term “sellout,” and I saw this feminist band being like, “Well we don’t care of you call us that — we’re gonna do whatever we want.” And that was a really powerful message for me and [Bikini Kill band members] Kathi [Wilcox] and Tobi [Vail], who were watching it on laser disc at Tobi’s parents’ house.It has such an interesting history that movie, too, with the writer Nancy Dowd having her name taken off it ’cause she was worried about the final product. It’s odd how her original intent survives in the movie, even though it was directed by a guy and mishandled by the studio.Yeah. Things like that always happen. I mean, films are such long processes that all kinds of weird sh-t happens during them that are too complicated to go in to. I kind of understand that world a little bit more now, and how things can go kind of wonky.So Stains was a big one for you. Were there any other films that made an impact?Definitely Born in Flames by Lizzie Borden. That was huge for me — like, monstrously huge. Oh, and the movie Working Girls that she made — not the Melanie Griffith one. It’s about sex work. I don’t know if you’ve seen that one.No, I haven’t seen that one.It’s just as amazing in a totally different way. It basically shows this woman who seems like a high-price call girl who works out of a fancy apartment, and her job is really boring. The whole movie is really boring. And I sat there laughing and loving how really boring it was, because I’ve been a stripper and I’ve been asked about it a lot. People would say, “Oh, you were a sex-positive stripper,” and I was like, “It doesn’t have anything to do with sex, to me.” It’s really boring and pathetic and embarrassing to everyone, and I don’t think that it’s sex-positive to be a stripper. I think of it as a way to, you know, put food in your mouth and be an artist and pay for college. I didn’t ever think that I was doing this sex-positive thing. [Laughs] So, watching this movie that was about sex work that was really boring was awesome, and I laughed through the whole thing. I was so happy.Diane Lane in Ladies and Gentlemen, the Fabulous StainsBecause it was so accurate in depicting the boredom?Yeah! I would always joke, like, “Have you seen Pretty Woman, that documentary about prostitution?”[Laughs]You know what I mean? Movies like that. The mainstream public is supposed to believe that prostitution is like that.That’s an interesting choice. I’ll have to see it.Have you seen Out of the Blue?Yes, the Dennis Hopper movie with Linda Manz? Love that.It’s pretty amazing.Okay, well I have to ask you this, because I’m an idiot. What is your take on Cassavetes? Do you have a favorite?[Laughs] I would have to say say A Woman Under the Influence. That’s the one where the dog pops in. [Laughs] You know what I mean? In that scene where they’re in the living room and the German Shepherd just shows up?That’s a really odd, specific detail to remember.Yeah, I always thought that was so genius. Because it was just like, it said, “I know this is a film.” And it was playful.I’m with you on the movie. Gena Rowlands’ performance in that film is just something else altogether.Yeah. She’s out of control. She’s totally so good. So good. I mean, I also love her in Gloria.Okay, staying with movies for a moment. You’ve had a long history, with both Bikini Kill and Le Tigre, of fighting sexism in the rock world. Do you have any thoughts on sexism as an issue in film? Is there any correlation between the music and movie industries, in terms of what girl bands and actresses have to deal with?Yeah, I think definitely for actresses the big thing is weight. You’ve either gotta be rail-thin or, you know, you’re Rebel Wilson — you’re bigger and that’s how you’re sold.There’s no in-between?Right. It’s like, you’re just supposed to be extremely tiny and extremely good-looking, and you’re supposed to be 20 forever — all that kind of stuff. I think that’s similar. The thing about music is that it’s like flash-in-the-pan style — something will be really popular for like five minutes and then everybody forgets about it. It’s like, that person, in the mind of everybody, is gone. But they’re not gone, they’re still out there and making work; it’s just not being recognized or noticed. In terms of sexism in film, I’m sure it’s really just more of the same. You know, dealing with asshole male technical people who wanna make you feel like an idiot, and all that kind of stuff. I mean, look at how few female directors there are — in comparison.Hanna with Kim Gordon in Sonic Youth’s “Bull in the Heather”Which is weird when you consider that in the early days of cinema, women were a major force in directing and writing movies. People like Alice Guy, who kind of made the first narrative movie. Why do you think there are so few now?I think it’s sexism. You know, movies are a traditionally male field; I don’t know — I can’t explain it beyond that.There’s that old saying that the history of cinema is tied up in the male gaze, that of men photographing women.[Laughs] Yeah, that’s a great saying.There’s also a different standard, I think, by which female filmmakers are assessed. For example, it’s rare that anyone ever talks about Sofia Coppola without invoking her “privilege,” as though she couldn’t possess her own talent, irrespective of her father.Yeah, I mean, I think that happens all the time. I’ve done so many interviews where all they want to talk about is, you know, my husband, and my relationship with my husband [Hanna is married to musician Adam Horowitz]. And I opened that Pandora’s box in the film, so I understand it being a question, or two questions, but I don’t understand people who spend their entire 20 minutes with me talking about the Beastie Boys, you know? [Laughs] I’m like, “You do know that the film’s about me, and it’s called The Punk Singer?” [Laughs] So there’s always the thing where it’s just about the woman’s personal life; it’s never about her art. And they’re gonna give out that kind of criticism, no matter what. It’s not just. It’s like, a lot of men can get away with a ton of sh-t — a lot of white, straight men can get away with a ton of sh-t — and if a woman makes one mistake, it’s wallpapered all over the city. It’s hard to live like that. It’s hard to live feeling like one slip of the tongue and you’re over, whereas men can get away with just about anything. You know, if you say “F-ck you” to the wrong person and you’re a woman, you might be out of work forever — whereas men are expected to say “F-ck you” to each other. [Laughs]Right. And I see so many interviews with you where people are like, “What do you think of Lady Gaga?” “What about Miley?” And the intent feels like “Let’s get a bitchy quote” and sort of play everyone off against each other.Uh-huh. But you know, I know what they’re doing. It’s not like I don’t know what they’re doing — and I use it to my benefit. I also use it to keep the conversation about feminism in public going, because I think it is okay that we comment on each others’ work; I think it’s okay that, you know, I say I don’t appreciate it when women — or men — bandy about these stupid stereotypes about feminism that are age-old, and that are meant to keep people turned off from it. It’s like, “All you have to do is Wikipedia feminism to know that it’s not about man-hating — so shut up.” That makes me annoyed. And if I say that, then so be it. If people turn something into pull-quotes where I hate some female journalist or some other female musician, you know — I don’t hate any other musicians. But — I don’t like every other musician’s work. The same way that filmmakers don’t like every other filmmakers’ work. Just because I’m a feminist doesn’t mean I’m gonna say that I like every other woman’s work, or that I appreciate another statement that another woman publicly made. But I also understand that we all say stuff that’s stupid sometimes. [Laughs]Next, Hanna talks about Kurt Cobain, coming to terms with her Riot Grrrl past, her illness, and what she hopes is her legacy for a new generation.Let me back up for a second, because I will ask you one question about Adam. I know that you had the opportunity to have people like Thurston Moore and Calvin Johnson talk in The Punk Singer, but that you chose to leave them out because you didn’t want a lot of “male experts.” Did you consider cutting Adam’s interviews at all?You know, Sini never interviewed Thurston or Calvin Johnson or Ian MacKaye, or anybody like that. I just sort of said at the beginning of the film that I feel like a lot of times those three people — and nothing against them — they’re always used as the experts on underground music. I really wanted Tobi Vail, the drummer for Bikini Kill, to in a way be the expert, because she’s such a musicologist, but she’s very camera shy. So they got Ann Powers, who I thought was fantastic. But I did have a reservation about putting Adam in. I didn’t want to be “the girl who married the Beastie Boy.” I had a reservation about putting anything about Kurt [Cobain] in, because I didn’t want to be the “Smells Like Teen Spirit” girl. But at the same time I am the person who wrote that on the wall, and it ended up being this huge deal — and that’s interesting. That’s an interesting thing that happened in my life, and leaving that out of a film about me would just be weird. I’m not gonna react to sexism by censoring myself. And I feel like leaving my relationship [with Horowitz] out of the film would not only be a total lie, because it’s the most important thing in my life, but also because it’s like — how can you say this? I used to do this thing when everybody thought I was a bitch in Bikini Kill. Everybody thought I was difficult. So when we would show up at clubs, I would be nicer than nice — like, so, so nice, because I wanted to counter that stereotype, you know, that feminists were bitches. And I didn’t want to do a similar kind of thing in this film. Some people are gonna do this really sexist thing where it’s like, “Oh, Beastie Boy girl, ‘Smells Like Teen Spirit’ girl,” and that’s all they’re gonna take away from it. I don’t want my life and my art to mainly be associated with men, but then it’s like, I can’t control what people do — and if people have that kind of sexist reading, then that’s their problem. Who’s gonna leave out the fact that they wrote “Smells like teen spirit” on a wall and it became this massively huge hit, and then shifted underground culture and mainstream at the same time? Who’s gonna leave that out of their life story? I’d be crazy. Don’t you think?For sure. The other thing about that is that while Kurt has become this rock idol, what people forget is that — and correct me if I’m wrong here — he was also a feminist.Yes. He was actually an interesting person, who cared deeply about other people. Maybe too deeply, but, yeah.Rebel girls: Bikini Kill in the ’90sSo by having that story in your movie, it helps realign him with the ’90s feminist movement — instead of just being a poster on a wall next to Jim Morrison and a bunch of other dead guys. That’s good thing.I think so. I mean, I think he was influenced by a lot of stuff. He really loved heavy metal. But in this film they happened to mention his connection with the North West, and with our band and stuff like that. We were always, in Bikini Kill, we didn’t want to be associated with Nirvana, because we were worried that that would overshadow what we were trying to do. But in this film I felt like it was crazy to leave out these things that people already know, just because people would be like “Oh, she’s using that to get attention.” I mean, of course I am! I use everything to get attention — that’s why I’m a performer. [Laughs] That’s why I allowed a movie to be made about my life.Was there anything where you thought, “No, this is too personal, I can’t put this in the movie”?The thing that I almost had taken out, and I didn’t have taken out, was that picture of my father. I talk about him honestly, from my perspective. He’s still alive, and I was nervous about showing his face. But I felt like it was really weird showing a picture of my mom and to not show a picture of my dad. So I told the truth, as I know it, and that’s all I can do. That was hard for me. The stuff where I was talking about my dad was really hard for me, and I had to think about that one. I was pretty open and honest in absolutely everything, but it’s very difficult — no matter how abusive my father could be, and how boundary-crossing — it’s very hard to disconnect from your family. It’s really hard to feel like you’re a traitor to someone in your family, no matter what they do that’s despicable. So that was hard. The Lyme stuff was easy. Because in the movie, you know, that’s not even half of it. All they showed was me crying and having a hard time talking, and having some tics — not ticks, you know what I mean, but facial tics. In real life it was so much worse than that. [Laughs] So when I see that part I’m like, “Uh, next!” [Laughs]May I ask how you are at the moment? Are you well?I’m in treatment right now, so I’m, you know, still in my pajamas as I’m talking to you.So, what kind of pajamas does Kathleen Hanna wear?[Laughs] They’re just blue. Basic and nondescript. I’m pretty boring, fashion-wise, when I’m not on stage. So I’m still in treatment, and I have two more treatments after this. It’s basically antibiotics. They make me very fatigued, so I kind have to do that for a few weeks and struggle as best I can until the treatment gets a little better. After the third one, which will be in January, I’ll only have three treatments — and they shouldn’t affect me at all. So by then I should be pretty much myself again. Even if I get to 80 per cent I’ll be totally psyched for that.That’s good! I wanted to ask you a couple more questions before you go, about the new Julie Ruin stuff. There are a couple of tracks, like “Run Fast” and “Goodnight Goodbye,” that seem to find you at a kind of bittersweet crossroads — you’re almost saying farewell to the past as you move on. Does that reflect in a sense where you’re at in your life now, and why you decided to do the movie?Well, I think that when you’re really sick and you think you’re going to die, you make a lot of different decisions to what you would when you’re well. And archiving my work was a big part of that, because that’s what you do; you know, you’re 80 years old and your time’s coming, you make sure all of your stuff and your art is there, so your friends don’t have to deal with it. That’s a lot of what I was doing, so I had to look back at the past and kind of come to terms with it. In doing that it was really funny, you know, because you think that you keep everything in this kind of locked box, and then that’s how you deal with it: “That was then, this is now, and I’m like a shark — I’m just gonna keep moving.” I’ve always been like, “Okay, I’m on to the next thing.” I don’t sit there and listen to my old records; I don’t watch myself performing, you know what I mean? I’m just like, “What’s the next thing that I’m gonna do?” And through this archival process I’ve had to actually stop and look at what I have done, and, you know, be proud of a lot of it and be ashamed of a lot of it — and really kind of face it. And in facing it I was able to say goodbye. I’m not the head of Riot Grrrl, you know — I never was. Let’s say goodbye to some of the toxic residue from that time, that I still maintain I sort of allowed to control my decisions. I’m not that person anymore.Hanna in Sini Anderson’s documentary, The Punk SingerDo you get the sense that you helped cultivate a new generation? I mean, you only have to look at the Internet to see a bunch of Riot Grrrl stuff, whether it’s on Tumblr, or Rookie or wherever. Does it feel like it’s living?I hope so. I don’t really want “riot grrrl” to be living, because I’m not that interested in, like, fetishizing what already happened. I’m really interested in women who wanna actually make something more interesting than what we did, and who will challenge and critique the stuff that we did; and through that critique come up with something way better. That’s what I’m excited about; not, you know, fan sites with pictures of Riot Grrrl bands.Or a list on Buzzfeed like, “10 Things That Were Awesome About ’90s Alternative Girls.”Yeah, exactly.Are there any current artists who you think might be that next wave?I mean, I think that M.I.A. being absolutely huge, and kind of disappearing and reappearing, is really interesting. I think she’s an interesting person to follow as an artist. She’s amassed a lot of young kids who are saying stuff that they wouldn’t have said without her as a role model. So I think she’s pretty amazing. I also really like Grimes. She’s a young artist who’s producing her own material, and who’s unabashedly “No, I’m a feminist.”I saw your conversation with her on MTV.Yeah, and she requested me! And I’m like a total weird, old fogey.[Laughs] Really? That’s kind of pushing it.Oh you know what I mean. But it was nice. I think one of the things that’s happening now is that — because there’s a sort of resurgence of Riot Grrrl, and my band’s out on tour again, and people are interested and all that — there’s a generational thing going on, where a lot of the younger artists are being stirred into the pot with us older artists. And that’s really great, to have that kind of cross-pollination, you know; to have somebody who’s 45 being influenced by somebody who’s 25, and vice versa. It’s nice, and it does challenge the ageism that is typical of the music industry — although I’ve never really considered myself a part of the music industry, so… I don’t really have to deal with that! [Laughs] Except for when I was in Le Tigre and we did one major label record, and our record was up against JoJo. I don’t know if you remember her, but she was like a 15-year-old.Really vaguely. Which record — This Island?The last one, yeah, This Island. But they really needed to spend more time on JoJo’s record. [Laughs]And now everybody remembers Le Tigre, but poor JoJo!She had some song that was like [sings] “Get back! Get outta my face!” or something like that. [Laughs]Well on that note, I feel bad for keeping you so long — so I might let you go.“Might” let you go. [Laughs] “I might let you go… actually, nah.”Yeah, I’m really gonna get you to record some answering machine messages now.[Laughs] “Can you call my cousin, in Massachusetts, and sing her Happy Birthday?”How did you know?The Punk Singer opens theatrically in New York and Los Angeles this weekend, with VOD and further locations to follow.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"of, America, Day","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"interview-kathleen-hanna-on-the-punk-singer-sexism-riot-grrrl-and-more"},{"id":"47612956146026","title":"On DVD This Week: Ghostbusters, The Legend of Tarzan, and More","content":"RT on DVDvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})On DVD This Week: Ghostbusters, The Legend of Tarzan, and Moreby Ryan Fujitani | October 10, 2016 |  CommentsThis week on home video, we’ve&nbsp;got a blockbuster comedy reboot, a retelling of a familiar legend, the fifth chapter in an animated franchise, a true-life thriller, and more.

On top of that, there’s also the relatively well-received biopic about Alfred Hitchcock and the making of Psycho and a quirky Sean Penn-powered road trip drama. Lastly, we have a feature adaptation of the famed Cirque du Soleil troupe’s performances, as well as a handful of notable reissues. See below for the full list!Life of Pi 86%Yann Martel’s 2001 novel Life of Pi was a worldwide success, so it’s not surprising that development of a film adaptation began as early as 2003. Many considered the book “unfilmable,” however, so we didn’t get the movie until Ang Lee took up the helm (after several others dropped out) and felt technology was up to snuff to tell the story. The fantasy adventure revolves around Pi Patel (Suraj Sharma), an Indian teen whose parents own a struggling zoo and decide to sell all their animals to a buyer in Canada, where the family will settle. En route to Winnipeg, their freighter encounters a massive storm that wrecks the ship and leaves Pi stranded alone on a lifeboat with a few animals, including a fearsome Bengal tiger. Like its source novel, Life of Pi was met with both critical and commercial success, and was nominated for eleven Academy Awards; it won four Oscars, including Best Director for Ang Lee. Certified Fresh at 88%, it’s a trasportive, beautifully shot, technically impressive film, even if its underlying message may not resonate with everyone.Rise of the Guardians 75%Another film based on a book (or series of books, rather, authored by William Joyce), Rise of the Guardians reimagines mythical childhood figures like Santa Claus, the Easter Bunny, the Tooth Fairy, the Sandman, and Jack Frost as warrior-like protectors of the world’s children — in addition to their regular duties delivering presents and hiding Easter eggs, that is. Voiced by Chris Pine, Jack Frost is a bit of a mischief maker, starting snowball fights and conjuring blizzards, until he’s recruited by the existing guardians to help defeat Pitch (Jude Law), a dark spirit intent on taking over the world. In the process, Jack discovers both his true worth as a guardian and the secrets of his past life. Though critics felt the story itself could have been a little more focused, they also liked the clever premise of the film, as well as its lush animation and brisk pacing. Certified Fresh at 74%, Rise of the Guardians is a fresh take on some familiar characters that most will be able to appreciate.Hitchcock 60%Screenwriter Sacha Gervasi’s directorial debut, 2007’s Anvil! The Story of Anvil, earned heaps of praise, so hopes were high for his film about Alfred Hitchcock, especially considering Anthony Hopkins would be filling in the role of the great director and Helen Mirren would be playing his wife and collaborative partner, Alma Reville. Hitchcock specifically chronicles the director’s efforts to finance and produce Psycho and the tumultuous relationship that resulted between him and Reville during the making of the film. Although critics would have liked to see a bit more subtlety and insight, most found the film stylishly directed and worth watching, even if only for the inspired performances from Hopkins and Mirren. At 63% on the Tomatometer, Hitchcock isn’t the be all and end all of biopics on The Master of Suspense, but it’s a well-acted glimpse into his life and old Hollywood.Sound City 100%Last year, musician Dave Grohl (Nirvana, Foo Fighters) purchased a vintage Neve 8028 mixing console from Sound City Studios in Van Nuys, California, where he had taken part in recording the seminal Nirvana album Nevermind in 1991. The purchase inspired him to direct a documentary recounting the history of the influential studio, which oversaw the recording of several rock legends and musical icons ranging from Neil Young, Elton John, and Grateful Dead to Barry Manilow, Weezer, Metallica, and many more before it closed in 2011. Peppered with interviews and performances by many of those artists, Sound City weaves together the complete story of the studio and culminates in the purchase that inspired the film in the first place. The film, which opened in limited release just a month ago, has so far earned a 100% Tomatometer, with critics calling it an affectionately crafted passion project that’s thrilling, nostalgic, and a must-see for music fans.Cirque du Soleil: Worlds Away 3D 45%Cirque du Soleil has been an expanding Las Vegas mainstay for several years now, but they’ve been a touring troupe for even longer, their television specials have won awards, and they’ve adapted their shows into films before. This latest venture, Worlds Away, is unique in that it also offers a 3D perspective for the first time, and what’s more? It’s James Cameron-approved 3D. Though it is, in fact, just another showcase for the talents of its performers, there is a narrative framing device: a young woman named Mia (Erica Linz) visits the local circus and falls into a dreamlike world with an aerialist; in order for the two to reunite, they must traverse the various tents of the circus and navigate through their performances. Critics were fairly split here; while some thought the film incoherently plotted and most conceded it was inferior to its live equivalent, others felt it was still beautiful to look at and entertaining enough. At 46%, Cirque du Soleil: Worlds Away won’t compare to the real thing, but it’s not too bad if you can’t make it to one of the live shows.Smashed 83%Aaron Paul has already built up a considerable fanbase from his role in Breaking Bad, but while Mary Elizabeth Winstead’s star is slowly rising, she hadn’t quite landed the starring role that showcases her talents properly… until Smashed came along. In this low key indie, Paul and Winstead play Charlie and Kate, a young married couple who both decide to come to terms with their alcoholism. When Kate, an elementary schoolteacher, vomits in the middle of class, then drunkenly succumbs to smoking crack later that same night, she consequently joins group therapy and resolves to change her life. Critics roundly applauded Winstead’s performance, as well as director James Ponsoldt’s sensitive direction and the film’s melodrama-free script, en route to a Certified Fresh 84% on the Tomatometer. Costarring Nick Offerman, Octavia Spencer, and Mary Kay Place, Smashed failed to generate much heat at the box office, but here’s hoping it leads to more substantial roles for Winstead.This Must Be the Place 67%At first glance, This Must Be the Place might seem simply like the latest in a long line of quirky indie comedy-dramas: Sean Penn, looking like a cross between Bono and Edward Scissorhands, is aging former rock star Cheyenne, who travels home to New York from Ireland in order to reconcile with his estranged father as he lies on his deathbed. Though his father dies before he arrives, Cheyenne soon discovers that he was an Auschwitz survivor whose lifelong mission was to track down the man who abused him there; Cheyenne takes up his father’s quest and sets out across the US to find his father’s persecutor. It’s a strange tale, to be sure, but critics mostly found it surprisingly touching, buoyed by Penn’s oddly charismatic performance. At 68%, This Must Be the Place might be a little too off-kilter for some, but if you give it a chance, it might surprise you.Also available this week:A 25th Anniversary Blu-ray release of Disney’s Who Framed Roger Rabbit (98%), with a collection of extras ported over from previous releases and an in-depth commentary track.Two choices from the Criterion Collection: The original 1958 The Blob (69%), now on Blu-ray; and Fritz Lang’s Ministry of Fear on both DVD and Blu-ray.Some animated Disney films, paired with their direct-to-DVD sequels: Mulan (86%), The Hunchback of Notre Dame (74%), and Brother Bear (38%).Ron Howard’s 1988 fantasy flick Willow (46%) on Blu-ray.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"cancelled, Film, leads, movies, television, Discovery, and, York, Critics, renewed, monsters, police, FOX, Land","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"rt-on-dvd-and-blu-ray-life-of-pi-and-rise-of-the-guardians"},{"id":"47612985666933","title":"10 Movie- and TV-Based Video Games That Dazzled E3 Goers","content":"Newsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})10 Movie- and TV-Based Video Games That Dazzled E3 GoersThe Walking Dead, Jurassic World, Spider-Man, and more TV and film favorites shuffle, stomp, and swing through this year's annual video game expo.by Matt Cabral | June 18, 2018 |  Comments(Photo by Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment)The 2018 Electronic Entertainment Expo offered some promising new titles inspired by our favorite films and television shows when it hit the Los Angeles Convention Center June 12-14. Games based on movies and serialized TV are nothing new, but the genre has a history of pushing out products more focused on promoting an IP than offering a quality interactive experience.That’s changing. Game developers, passionate about the same titles as the rest of us, are shelving the marketing-spun schlock in favor of crafting ambitious projects that put us in our favorite fictional worlds.Here are 10 we can’t wait to play!JURASSIC WORLD EVOLUTIONDeveloper: Frontier DevelopmentsPublisher: Frontier DevelopmentsSystems: PlayStation 4, Xbox One, PCRelease Date: Available nowAs fans of the Jurassic Park franchise films are well aware, the movies are primarily action-ratcheting affairs focused on dinos unleashing all kinds of hell on unsuspecting park-goers. Jurassic World Evolution, however, trades epic destruction for careful construction, as it tasks players with planning, building, managing, and monitoring their very own prehistoric theme park. While the game’s more of a cerebral stimulation, it’ll still spike your adrenaline when, say, your burgeoning management skills accidentally let a velociraptor loose in the food court.LEGO THE INCREDIBLESDeveloper: TT GamesPublisher: Warner Bros.Systems: PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Nintendo SwitchRelease Date: Available nowIf seeing&nbsp;Incredibles 2 hasn’t completely satisfied your craving for the superhero family’s unique brand of crime-fighting fun, you may want to suit-up for LEGO The Incredibles. Brimming with block-y bad guys, brick-based puzzles, and the LEGO series’ signature personality and humor, this latest plastic toy-packed adventure lets fans relive the best moments from both entries in the popular Pixar franchise. Tons of playable characters – including fan-favorite Edna Mode – and special moves, requiring the entire Parr crew to participate, round out this family-friendly romp.MARVEL’S SPIDER-MANDeveloper: Insomniac GamesPublisher: SonySystems: PlayStation 4Release Date: September 7, 2018Set in a sprawling, open-world New York City, this original Spider-Man tale – from veteran developer Insomniac Games – forgoes the origin story slog in favor of putting players behind the shooting webs, acrobatic combat, and wisecracking sense of humor of a more seasoned Spidey. An eye-popping visual presentation, adrenaline-spiking set pieces, fluid action, and more iconic villains than you can cram into Raft prison complement the cinematic wall-crawling, web-spinning action.WORLD WAR ZDeveloper: Saber InteractivePublisher: Paramount PicturesSystems: PlayStation 4, Xbox One, PCRelease Date: 2018Plenty of games task players with shooting zombies, scavenging for supplies, and generally doing whatever it takes to survive the undead apocalypse. World War Z – which borrows more from the Brad Pitt film than Max Brooks’ book – breaths some fresh life into the rotting corpse genre, however, by putting up to 500 flesh-eating freaks on screen simultaneously. Of course, these hungry hordes can also form horrifying zombie pyramids, making it more difficult for you and your co-op partners to fend them off and live another day.SHADOW OF THE TOMB RAIDERDeveloper: Crystal DynamicsPublisher: Square EnixSystems: PlayStation 4, Xbox One, PCRelease Date: September 14, 2018Fans of the Tomb Raider films and games can expect to meet a very different Lara Croft in this trilogy-capping entry. More Predator than Indiana Jones, Shadow of the Tomb Raider sees a confident, capable, vengeance-craving Croft camouflaged in mud and employing brutal combat tactics to turn exotic jungle locales into goon graveyards. Though&nbsp;Shadow isn’t your typical relic-hunting romp, players can still expect seat-of-the-pants storytelling, cinematic set pieces, and, yes, plenty of tombs to raid.LEGO DC SUPER-VILLAINSDeveloper: TT GamesPublisher: Warner Bros.Systems: PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, PCRelease Date: October 16, 2018TT Games has no less than three Batman-starring installments in their stable of brick-busting LEGO adventures, but their latest DC entry is taking a decidedly different approach to the iconic comic book universe. As its title suggests, LEGO DC Super-Villains is all about the bad guys, from Harley Quinn and Lex Luthor to Poison Ivy and the Crown Prince of Crime himself, the Joker. Rather than playing as these iconic foes though, players will join them as their very own, fully customizable and upgradeable evildoer.OVERKILL’S THE WALKING DEADDeveloper: Overkill SoftwarePublisher: Starbreeze Studios/505 GamesSystems: PlayStation 4, Xbox One, PCRelease Date: November 6, 2018Hundreds of games have pitted players against hordes of foot-shuffling foes, and a handful of those have even unfolded in Robert Kirkman’s walker-infested world. Overkill’s The Walking Dead separates itself from the brain-craving bunch, however, by translating the unforgiving world of the comic books into thumb-blistering gameplay. For fans, this means strategically cooperating with three other players to not only survive brutally difficult encounters with the undead, but also joining forces to fight the game’s most challenging enemies, a human faction dubbed “The Family.”HITMAN 2Developer: IO InteractivePublisher: WBIESystems: PlayStation 4, Xbox One, PCRelease Date: November 13, 2018We haven’t seen the bald, bar-coded assassin on the big screen since Rupert Friend wore his signature sharp suit and red tie in 2015’s Hitman: Agent 47. Fans needn’t wait for a film sequel to be reunited with their favorite hired killer, however, as Hitman 2 is headed to game consoles this fall. Assuming the role of the titular professional, stealthy players will travel to stunningly-realized exotic locales, don disguises, and incorporate improvised weapons – such as rat poison, frying pans, and frozen fish – to permanently silence high-level targets.RESIDENT EVIL 2Developer: CapcomPublisher: CapcomSystems: PlayStation 4, Xbox One, PCRelease Date: January 25, 2019Long before zombie shooters and apocalypse survival sims spread through the video game world like a population-wiping plague, players were fighting virally-infected canines and gobbling up green herbs in Resident Evil. Now, Capcom is inviting fans back to Raccoon City to relive what’s widely considered the seminal survival horror series’ best entry.

First off, if you’re looking for hi-def re-releases of older films, the choices are many, but random: Bernardo Bertolucci’s 1900, Jon Voight thriller The Odessa File, New York Stories, and the original 1973 version of Walking Tall, for example. But we’ve got some good choices this week, including Liam Neeson’s angsty survival thriller, a superpowered found-footage film, an Oscar-nominated period piece, and Woody Harrelson’s latest effort with Oren Moverman. Sure, we’ve got a couple of stinkers too, but the new Criterion should help make up for that. See below for the full list!The Grey 79%While several of Liam Neeson’s most recent films have been critical misfires or downright flops, The Grey proves he’s still capable of captivating an audience. Here, he leads a group of plane crash survivors as they attempt to navigate their way through the snowy Alaskan wilderness, facing both the elements and a pack of hungry wolves. With an equal focus on thrills and existential philosophy, The Grey managed to surprise critics and become one of those rare Certified Fresh hits released during the early part of the calendar year.One for the Money 2%Katherine Heigl continues her post-Knocked Up string of Rotten films with One for the Money, her lowest-rated film since the Judd Apatow hit. Based on the bestselling novel of the same name, One for the Money stars Heigl as Stephanie Plum, an out of work debtor who signs up to be bail bonds recovery agent, only to discover her biggest task is bringing in the man who dumped her in high school. With the similarly themed The Bounty Hunter having hit theaters just two years prior, Money didn’t fool anyone, and critics slapped it with a damning 2% Tomatometer.Chronicle 85%The initial reaction to Chronicle was, “Another found-footage movie?” but those who were lulled in by the superpowers angle were pleasantly surprised. The story revolves around three teens who are saddled with unnatural abilities after they make a curious discovery; as their powers grow stronger, their darker sides begin to emerge. Despite its gimmicky handheld format, most critics felt that Chronicle transcended its genre with all the elements of a solid movie: smart writing, a brisk pace, and engaging performances from its mostly unknown cast.The Devil Inside 6%If ever there were an argument against the recent found-footage trend, The Devil Inside would be it. While the genre certainly allows for heightened realism, it only works if the acting is noteworthy, the writing is clever, and the director demonstrates firm control over the hand-held camera gimmickry. The Devil Inside, about a young woman who visits her institutionalized mother to determine whether she’s insane or, in fact, actually demon-possessed, exhibits none of those characteristics, earning a well-deserved (according to most) 7% Tomatometer. And if that weren’t enough, reports indicate that its abrupt ending is also one of the most inane in recent memory.Albert Nobbs 56%A passion project for Glenn Close that she spent 15 years bringing to the screen, Albert Nobbs was met with lukewarm reviews but received Oscar nods for both Best Actress (Close) and Best Supporting Actress (Janet McTeer). Reprising the role she first played on stage in 1982, Close stars as the titular character, a woman who has spent decades assuming a male identity in order to secure employment at a hotel. After meeting a fellow employee engaged in a similar ruse (McTeer), Nobbs decides to pursue domestic ties with a maid (Mia Wasikowska), who has troubles of her own. While some critics found the film thought-provoking and poignant, others felt it didn’t dig deep enough into the issues it presented, resulting in a 55% Tomatometer score. At the very least, though, most agree that the performances are top notch.Rampart 74%Woody Harrelson has enjoyed a bit of a career resurgence in recent years, thanks to films like No Country for Old Men, Transsiberian, Zombieland, and The Messenger. Last year, he joined up again with The Messenger director Oren Moverman for another Certified Fresh film, this time about a hard-nosed cop in LA’s notorious Rampart Precinct who must face the consequences of his renegade ways as the details of a large scale corruption scandal hit the news. While critics agreed that Harrelson’s character, Dave Brown, is far from sympathetic, Harrelson’s performance keeps viewers locked in, making this worth a watch for him alone.Norwegian Wood 74%The literature of Japanese novelis Haruki Murakami is often dreamlike and surreal, focusing on themes of loneliness and isolation, so it’s fitting that the film adaptation of one of his most popular works, Norwegian Wood, is appropriately moody. Helmed by acclaimed French-Vietnamese director Tran Anh Hung (The Scent of Green Papaya), Norwegian Wood tells the story of Toru Watanabe, a young student in 1960s Tokyo who falls in love with his classmate Kizuki’s girlfriend, Naoko, after Kizuki suddenly commits suicide. Suffering from the death, Naoko checks herself into a sanatorium, and that’s when Toru meets Midori, the polar opposite of Naoko, and begins to form a bond with her as well. Certified Fresh at 73%, Norwegian Wood lingered just a bit too long at times for some critics, but most found the melancholy mood infectious, making for a visually stunning and ultimately powerful meditation on youthful love and loss.Being John Malkovich – Criterion Collection 94%Director Spike Jonze and writer Charlie Kaufman announced their arrival on the feature film scene with a giant bang, establishing their knack for clever, inventive, and visually creative storytelling. Being John Malkovich stars John Cusack as Craig Schwartz, a down-and-out puppeteer who accidentally discovers a portal into the mind of actor John Malkovich; as his co-worker (Catherine Keener) and wife (Cameron Diaz) become involved, complicated sexual politics ensue, leading to a bizarre and quietly chilling finale. This week, Criterion releases their edition of Being John Malkovich, complete with brand new extras like commentary featuring Jonze and Michel Gondry, interviews with Malkovich and Jonze, a behind-the-scenes doc, and the full versions of the two films that appear within the film. Great pickup for fans of the film and all those involved in its making.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"Disney, marvel, Pop, Company, animated","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"rt-on-dvd-and-blu-ray-the-grey-chronicle-and-albert-nobbs"},{"id":"47612982219123","title":"5 Survival Movies You Need to See Before The 33","content":"var mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})5 Survival Movies You Need to See Before The 33by Tomatazos Staff | November 12, 2015 |  CommentsOn August 5 2010, a mine collapsed in the town of San José, Chile, prompting a&nbsp;seemingly impossible rescue mission that unfolded over the course of three months. This week’s&nbsp;The 33 dramatizes&nbsp;the event as a testimony to the human struggle against the elements, and in that spirit, our Spanish-language partners over at Tomatazos have offered up a brief list&nbsp;of similar stories to get you into the “rescue mood” before you purchase a ticket.Apollo 13 (1995)  96%Even though it drifts away stylistically from the following entries, this space epic heads our list because it also shares some of their fundamental characteristics. Even when everything seems perfectly planned out, including daily chores, one small failure (a technical one in the Apollo’s case) is all it takes to make things go sour in a hurry, prompting all those involved to face risky situations in order to regain control. Kind of makes you believe “13 is an unlucky number,” dosen’t it?Watch Trailer127 Hours (2010)  93%This tale feels like something lifted straight&nbsp;out of a Eugène Ionesco play (the whole “eating yourself to survive” business), and it’s doubly shocking because it was, of course, based on a real story. It’s claustrophobic, anguishing, and crude; no wonder it got James Franco an Academy Award nomination.Watch TrailerInto the Wild (2007)  83%Almost every character in this list is a victim of circumstance; that is to say, they obviously did not choose to be burned&nbsp;in space or trapped between a literal rock and a hard place. But not Chris McCandless (Emile Hirsch,) the daunting protagonist of this film, who chose to leave his whole life behind and be “one” with nature. Nature, cranky as she’s wont to be, took care of the rest.Watch TrailerThe Impossible (2012)  81%This J.A. Bayona flick hits closer to home when you realize that the suburbanite family onscreen could be yours; not that suburbanites are inherently threatening, but because of the prospect that you could be chilling at your favorite overseas resort, and then bam! The sea’s now all over you. And your child. And Naomi Watts. Now that’s a spooky image.Watch TrailerAlive (1993)  59%We just could not leave this classic survival film off&nbsp;the list, especially since it’s become a definitive reference on the matter. It’s the movie that made audiences think twice&nbsp;the next time they took a flight. It’s a safe bet to say that whenever people think of this story, they feel a knot in their stomach; and it all began with a simple plane trip above the Andes…Watch TrailerYou can find&nbsp;the original&nbsp;article in Spanish at Tomatazos.com.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"Heroines, Sony, stoner, killer, Britbox, cartoon, dark, Netflix, Kimmy, Lifetime, A24","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"5-survival-movies-you-need-to-see-before-the-33"},{"id":"47613002853754","title":"Free Tickets to Seven Psychopaths in Los Angeles","content":"var mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Free Tickets to Seven Psychopaths in Los AngelesCome see the movie on us, and meet its furriest star!by RT Staff | October 18, 2012 |  CommentsSeven Psychopaths, the latest hilariously twisted film from Martin McDonagh (In Bruges), is Certified Fresh on the Tomatometer at 85%.

Throughout&nbsp;23 films (and counting), there are crossover characters, intersecting storylines, and resonant names, locations, and even brands. Of course, when you step back, you realize that the MCU was only doing what comic books have been doing in print for decades. Take another step back, and you’ll notice that what they’ve done isn’t all that unique to movies, either. Because Quentin Tarantino, for one, has been doing it for decades, too.From his earliest days as a struggling screenwriter to his iconic and era-defining films, Tarantino has built his own world of interconnected characters and original brands. In honor of the 25th anniversary of his legendary opus Pulp Fiction&nbsp;(released October 14, 1994), let’s take a look at the QTCU — the Quentin Tarantino Cinematic Universe.My Best Friend's Birthday (1987) A short film co-written, directed, and starring Tarantino while he was famously working at Video Archives in Manhattan Beach, California (it’s no longer there, so don’t plan a visit), My Best Friend’s Birthday only exists in a truncated 36-minute cut because large parts of it were destroyed in a fire. Still, the seeds of the QTCU are there. For one, Quentin plays a character named Clarence who, early on, discusses his love of Rockabilly music and Elvis’ acting ability. This would, of course, foreshadow Christian Slater’s character in True Romance, a script written by Tarantino but directed by the late Tony Scott. In Birthday, Tarantino’s Clarence hires a call girl to show his friend a good time on his special day — a sequence of events that would be flipped in True Romance,&nbsp;when Slater’s Clarence finds himself on the receiving end of a birthday call girl surprise.Reservoir Dogs (1992)  92%Tarantino’s signature work, the movie that launched him as a filmmaker. In this tale of a jewel heist gone wrong, the audience is treated to flashbacks that fill in the stories of each of the movie’s black clad, code-named criminals. We find out that Mr. White (Harvey Keitel) used to run with a partner named Alabama. Of course, a woman named Alabama Whitman (later, Worley) is seen getting a taste for a life of crime in True Romance, the Tony Scott film that Tarantino wrote (see below). We also learn that Mr. Blonde (Michael Madsen) is named Vic Vega, as in the brother of John Travolta’s Vincent Vega in Pulp Fiction.True Romance (1993)  92%(Photo by Warner Bros. courtesy Everett Collection)Apart from the obvious connections&nbsp;to earlier films — the Rockabilly-loving Clarence and call girl-turned-crook Alabama — there is a more subtle cinematic link in Tony Scott’s Tarantino-penned action adventure. The movie climaxes with a drug deal in the hotel suite of big time movie producer Lee Donowitz (Saul Rubinek, channeling real life producer Joel Silver). Donowitz is a producer of war movies — fitting because his father, Donny Donowitz, fought in WWII as part of the Inglourious Basterds. You might remember him as the baseball bat-wielding avenger known as “The Bear Jew” (played by Eli Roth).Pulp Fiction (1994)  92%(Photo by Miramax Films)Pulp Fiction, which celebrates its 25th anniversary this year, is arguably the Iron Man of the QTCU, because it’s really the one that takes the threads and begins to weave them together.&nbsp;The film&nbsp;introduces us to several brand names that would become central players in Tarantino’s world, starting with “that Hawaiian burger joint” Big Kahuna Burger — Samuel L. Jackson’s Jules takes the world’s most intimidating bite of one of these burgers and washes it down with “a tasty beverage” from the place early in the movie. Later, Bruce Willis’ Butch Coolidge orders a pack of Red Apple cigarettes, a brand that shows up in just about every subsequent QT movie. Finally, Christopher Walken’s Captain Koons — he of the legendary “gold watch” speech — is also a descendant of “Crazy” Craig Koons, one of Django’s bounties in Django Unchained.Natural Born Killers (1994)  48%(Photo by Warner Bros. Pictures)Although Natural Born Killers was&nbsp;directed by Oliver Stone, the script was pure Tarantino. We mentioned earlier the brother connection between Vic and Vincent Vega, but there is another set of brothers that was first introduced in Reservoir Dogs, too. In Dogs, Vic complains about a pain-in-the-ass parole officer named Seymour Scagnetti (we never actually see him), whose own brother, Jack, would show up in Natural Born Killers (played by Tom Sizemore).Four Rooms (1996)  14%In the Tarantino-written and -directed segment of this anthology film, the characters are seen smoking Red Apple cigarettes. Tarantino’s character also refers to his drink as a “tasty beverage,” which echoes the same colorful turn of phrase Jules used in Pulp Fiction.From Dusk Till Dawn (1996)  62%Tarantino wrote the script for this Robert Rodriguez-directed horror film and peppered in some of his signature touches. There are Red Apple cigarettes present and accounted for, and George Clooney’s Seth Gecko at one point makes a run for Big Kahuna Burgers. The movie also introduces gravelly-voiced, no-nonsense Texas Ranger Earl McGraw (played by Michael Parks), who would become a key player in the QTCU. It’s also worth noting that the movie features yet another pair of brothers (Seth and his brother, Richie, played by Tarantino) who have a thing for black suits.Jackie Brown (1997)  87%(Photo by Miramax Films)Beware of people who claim that, because it was based on an Elmore Leonard novel and not an original Tarantino idea, there are no overt connections to the QTCU in Jackie Brown. They’re just not paying attention. Midway through the film, we see Jackie in the Del Amo Mall&nbsp;food court, enjoying a meal from Teriyaki Donut — the same fictional fast food franchise whose food Ving Rhames’ Marcellus Wallace is carrying when Butch Coolidge runs him down in Pulp Fiction. In a second food court scene not long after, we not only see Jackie indulging in Teriyaki Donut again, but her accomplice Sheronda (LisaGay Hamilton) sits down at her&nbsp;table with a tray full of food from Acuña Boys, which would later be referenced in Kill Bill Vol. 2 and appear a couple of times in Grindhouse.Kill Bill: Volume 1 (2003)  85% and&nbsp;Kill Bill: Volume 2 (2004)  84%(Photo by Miramax Films)We’ll treat this kung fu-inspired magnum opus as one film, with plenty of easter eggs to link it to the larger QTCU. For one, if you look at The Bride’s (Uma Thurman) old gang, the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad, you’ll notice that they all fit a little too easily into Mia Wallace’s description of her failed TV pilot, Fox Force Five – the blonde leader, the Japanese kung fu master, the black demolition expert, the French seductress, and Mia’s. character, the deadliest woman in the world with a knife (or sword?). The first cop on the scene after the Bride’s wedding day massacre is, of course, Earl McGraw, and Red Apple and Big Kahuna also make appearances. And remember&nbsp;Acuña Boys from&nbsp;Jackie Brown?&nbsp;In Vol. 2, they happen to be the name of the gang that Michael Parks’ Esteban Vihaio runs.Grindhouse (2007)  84%(Photo by The Weinstein Co./Dimension)In both the Tarantino portion of this double feature homage, Death Proof, and the Rodriguez portion, Planet Terror, there are connections to the QTCU. Big Kahuna burgers are mentioned, and Red Apple cigarettes are smoked. On top of that, an ad for&nbsp;Acuña Boys “Authentic Tex-Mex Food” — first glimpsed in&nbsp;Jackie Brown&nbsp;—&nbsp;pops up during intermission, and one of Stuntman Mike’s early victims, Vanessa Ferlito’s Arlene, can be seen sipping from an&nbsp;Acuña Boys cup. Texas lawman Earl McGraw also reappears, along with his son, Ed, and we learn there is a sister named Dakota, too, who features in Planet Terror.&nbsp;As kind of a bonus, Rosario Dawson’s Abernathy has a familiar ringtone on her phone&nbsp; — it’s the same melody whistled by Elle Driver (Darryl Hannah) in Kill Bill Vol. 1.Inglourious Basterds (2009)  89%(Photo by Francois Duhamel/©Weinstein Company)In addition to Donny Donowitz, Michael Fassbender’s English soldier-turned-spy Archie Hicox has deep ties to the QTCU, it turns out. Late in the old west-set Hateful Eight, it is revealed that Tim Roth’s Oswaldo Mobray is actually a wanted man named “English Pete” Hicox, Archie’s great-great-grandfather.Django Unchained (2012)  87%(Photo by The Weinstein Co.)We’ve already mentioned “Crazy” Craig Koons, but there is another deep cut reference to Django hidden in an earlier Tarantino movie. In Kill Bill Vol. 2, Bill’s brother Budd (played by Michael Madsen – also another pair of QT brothers!) buries the Bride alive in the grave of Paula Schultz. This is the lonely final resting place for the wife of bounty hunter Dr. King Schultz (Christoph Waltz) in Django.The Hateful Eight (2015)  74%(Photo by The Weinstein Company)In addition to the Hicox family tree, Red Apple tobacco — the early version of the soon-to-be ubiquitous (in the QTCU, anyway) cigarette brand — makes a couple of appearances here. Demián Bichir’s Bob smokes a “Manzana Roja” right after the intermission, and Channing Tatum gets a custom-rolled&nbsp;Red Apple cigarette — his “favorite” — from&nbsp;Dana Gourrier’s Miss Minnie.Once Upon a Time In Hollywood (2019)  85%(Photo by Columbia Pictures)At one point in Kill Bill Vol. 2, The Bride drives a blue Volkswagen Karmann Ghia. That same car shows up (driven by Brad Pitt’s Cliff Booth) in Hollywood. And not only do Booth and Leonardo DiCaprio’s Rick Dalton smoke Red Apples (of course), but there’s an end-credits scene in the movie that shows Dalton doing a TV commercial for the cigarette brand.Pulp Fiction was released in theaters on October 14, 1994.#1Pulp Fiction (1994) 92%#1Adjusted Score: 99.222% Critics Consensus: One of the most influential films of the 1990s, Pulp Fiction is a delirious post-modern mix of neo-noir thrills, pitch-black humor, and pop-culture touchstones.Synopsis: Outrageously violent, time-twisting, and in love with language, Pulp Fiction was widely considered the most influential American movie of the...

Pictures, ©2020 Disney/Pixar)For some, December 25th movie releases have traditionally offered an escape from uncomfortable family time while providing theater employees a chance to make that sweet holiday pay. Most of us won’t be heading to cineplexes on Christmas Day this year, though, due to&nbsp;the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and the widespread business closures associated with it. Like a lot of things in 2020, it’s an unprecedented situation, and movie lovers looking for something to pass the time will instead likely turn to HBO Max’s&nbsp;Wonder Woman 1984 or&nbsp;Disney+’s&nbsp;Soul to fill that gap. All of this got us thinking about the&nbsp;movies of Christmas&nbsp;Past, and we&nbsp;thought it might be both fun and enlightening to look back at every film ever released on December 25th and try to figure out if one rises above all the rest.One might understandably&nbsp;assume the list would be littered with holiday classics,&nbsp;but since they’re typically released earlier than, you know, Christmas Day, we ended up with a hodgepodge of just about anything you could imagine. Considering they include&nbsp;titles&nbsp;as diverse as&nbsp;Magnum Force, Tombstone, An American Werewolf in Paris, and that most celebrated of yuletide standards,&nbsp;47 Ronin,&nbsp;it’s clear&nbsp;that there isn’t any rhyme or reason&nbsp;to Christmas Day releases beyond “Let’s cross our fingers and hope this makes a lot of money.”(Photo by Frank Connor/©Universal Pictures)Before we jump in, though, we need to clarify a few things about the process. First, our data set includes films that received wide releases on December 25th and have Tomatometers, Audience Scores, and reliable box office numbers. Regarding the latter, we had to stick to domestic box office earnings due to reliability issues with global market totals. Unfortunately, this meant older films&nbsp;like&nbsp;There Was a Crooked Man and Friday Foster&nbsp;failed to make the cut due to incomplete or insufficient data. Once we collected the relevant information, we ranked all the movies by Tomatometer, Audience Score, and Domestic Box Office (adjusted for inflation), added up their ranking numbers, and arranged the results in descending order so that the film with the lowest rank total would take the top spot. We know; it’s a lot to digest.With the logistics out of the way, let’s get to why you’re here. After compiling all the statistics and ranking all 124 movies we looked at, we were able to narrow the list down to a Top 10. Will the top spot go to a bloody revisionist Western, an all-timer heist flick, or a stylish take on a legendary sleuth? Check out the full list below, along with each film’s rank in our three data categories and a little bit of context, to find out which one is the Best Movie Released on December 25th!10.&nbsp;Tombstone&nbsp;(1993) – 50 Points(Photo by ©Buena Vista Pictures courtesy Everett Collection)Tomatometer Score (Rank): 74% (21st)Audience Score (Rank): 94% (4th)Domestic Box Office (Rank): $125 million (25th)While we have no evidence of this, it’s safe to assume that many adults would’ve been O.K. to receive tickets from Santa to go watch Tombstone when it was released on December 25, 1993. The thought of watching legendary lawman Wyatt Earp (Kurt Russell) go to war against an outlaw gang of red-sashed murderers, led by Powers Boothe and Michael Biehn, is simply too epic to pass up. Not only was Tombstone a hit in 1993, but it’s grown in stature&nbsp;since then as its memorable mustachioed characters, epic gun fights, and iconic lines (“I’m your Huckleberry”) have become more and more popular. It also doesn’t hurt that the cast also includes&nbsp;– deep breath&nbsp;–&nbsp;Val Kilmer, Bill Paxton, Sam Elliott, Billy Zane, Michael Rooker, Charlton Heston, Stephen Lang, Thomas Haden Church, Billy Bob Thornton, and Dana Delaney, and they’re all excellent. Tombstone is a rollicking good time, and despite some behind-the-scenes friction and director swaps, it’s&nbsp;still a fan favorite that boasts an outstanding 94% Audience Score.It’s tough to single out the best moment, as the movie features a plethora of memorable scenes. Whether it’s Wyatt Earp’s&nbsp;takedown of a bully (Billy Bob Thornton in a fun cameo) or Doc Holliday’s “I’m your Huckleberry” right before he puts one in Johnny Ringo’s forehead,&nbsp;Tombstone has a deep bench of epic moments and characters, which is why it’s on our list.9.&nbsp;Sherlock Holmes&nbsp;(2009) – 49 Points (Tie)(Photo by Alex Bailey/©Warner Bros. courtesy Everett Collection)Tomatometer Score (Rank):&nbsp;69% (25th)Audience Score (Rank):&nbsp;77% (20th)Domestic Box Office (Rank):&nbsp;$250 million (4th)Riding high off the success of 2008’s Iron Man, Robert Downey Jr. stepped into the well-worn shoes of another famous brilliant person, Sherlock Holmes. The end result was an intriguing modern-day update of the character created by Arthur Conan Doyle in 1887. Rather than simply using his brain, Holmes uses his brawn as well, engaging in underground fist fights that showcase his six-pack abs and uncanny ability to anticipate his foe’s moves, which allows him to exert maximum pain on his bare-knuckle boxing opponent (is that cheating?).The Guy Ritchie-directed film about Sherlock’s hunt for an aristocratic serial killer would go on to collect $524 million worldwide and spawn a sequel two years later, Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows, which also cleared the $500 million mark at the global box office.Fans and critics alike were fairly impressed with the performances by A-listers Downey, Jude Law, Rachel McAdams, and Mark Strong, as well as the stylized directing of Ritchie, which breathed new life into an old character. We’re even scheduled to get a third entry in the franchise in December of 2021.9.&nbsp;Magnum Force&nbsp;(1973) – 49 Points (Tie)(Photo by Everett Collection)Tomatometer Score (Rank):&nbsp;72% (23rd)Audience Score (Rank):&nbsp;77% (20th)Domestic Box Office (Rank):&nbsp;$211 million (6th)As the second entry in the five-film&nbsp;Dirty Harry&nbsp;franchise, Magnum Force&nbsp;had the luxury of trading on the blockbuster success of its predecessor, but it also carried the expectations of the popular film that featured San Francisco Police Department Inspector Harry Callahan (Clint Eastwood) asking people if they felt lucky. Focusing on Harry’s&nbsp;hunt for corrupt cops who take the law into their own hands, Magnum Force features explosions, murder, blood, profanity, and more explosions – you know, typical holiday movie stuff&nbsp;– which thrilled 1973 audiences who were looking for all of those things. Director Ted Post, who also worked with Eastwood on the well-received 1968 Western&nbsp;Hang ‘em High, knew what he was doing (making an action sequel), and there is no better evidence of that than in the opening credits: the cast and crew list&nbsp;is played over Harry’s .44 Magnum gun, which he then points towards the screen and shoots (think American James Bond) in a bonkers breaking of the fourth wall that tells the audience immediately what they’re in for.7.&nbsp;Broadcast News&nbsp;(1987) – 48 Points(Photo by ©20th Century Fox Film Corp.)Tomatometer Score (Rank):&nbsp;98% (2nd)Audience Score (Rank):&nbsp;79% (18th)Domestic Box Office (Rank):&nbsp;$116 million (28th)Written and directed by James L. Brooks, the workplace comedy Broadcast News was nominated for seven Academy Awards and is considered to be one of the greatest movies ever about journalism.&nbsp;Holly Hunter, William Hurt, and Albert Brooks all received&nbsp;Oscar nominations for their lively performances, and it would be tough to find a more likable and well-written comedy about three people who love/hate making television together. Hunter famously joined the project shortly before production started, and she’s so good you’d think Brooks wrote the role just for her. Also, if you’ve never watched Broadcast News, go ahead and check out&nbsp;Aaron’s (Albert Brooks) sweating scene; it’s an uncomfortable moment that features an excellent reporter absolutely bombing on camera, and Brooks plays it to perfection.&nbsp;Glancing at the reviews, you’ll see the phrases “uproariously funny,” “warm and heartfelt,” and “enormously entertaining” pop up time after time, and for good reason. Broadcast News gave audiences a lot to cheer for on December 25, 1987.6.&nbsp;The Aviator&nbsp;(2004) – 47 Points(Photo by Warner Bros. Pictures)Tomatometer Score (Rank):&nbsp;86% (11th)Audience Score (Rank):&nbsp;79% (18th)Domestic Box Office (Rank):&nbsp;$147 million (18th)Directed by Martin Scorsese, and starring Leonardo DiCaprio, Cate Blanchett (who won a Best Supporting Actress Oscar), and Kate Beckinsale, among others,&nbsp;The Aviator focuses on the early life of director/aviator/entrepreneur Howard Hughes and his legendary antics. Much like Hughes, The Aviator is larger than life as Scorsese loads it with glamour, plane crashes, and excellent visual effects that blend seamlessly into the period setting. The Aviator was the second (of the now five) collaborations between DiCaprio and Scorsese, and it netted DiCaprio his first Best Actor Academy Award nomination (he was previously nominated for Best Supporting Actor for What’s Eating Gilbert Grape); it also happens to be the first of three&nbsp;– yes, three&nbsp;– appearances on this list by Leonardo DiCaprio. The $110 million-budgeted drama won five Oscars (of a total 11 nominations) and still holds up beautifully, as the work of editor Thelma Schoomaker and cinematographer Robert Richardson give the 170-minute biopic an epic feel.5.&nbsp;Little Women&nbsp;(2019) – 42 Points(Photo by Sony Pictures)Tomatometer Score (Rank):&nbsp;95% (5th)Audience Score (Rank):&nbsp;92% (6th)Domestic Box Office (Rank):&nbsp;$108 million (31st)Powered by&nbsp;Greta Gerwig’s Academy Award-nominated script and direction, the $40 million-budgeted Little Women pulled in $216 million worldwide and was met with near universal praise.&nbsp;The feat is all the more impressive (and not altogether unexpected, since Gerwig loves the novel) considering Louisa May Alcott’s iconic story about sisters growing up in Massachusetts during the civil war has been adapted for the screen multiple times, dating all the way back to 1917. What makes this adaptation stand out among the rest is the way Gerwig includes a nonlinear storyline and a different ending to offer audiences something fresh and unexpected. Also, bringing back her Lady Bird star Saoirise Ronan&nbsp;to play the pivotal role of Jo March&nbsp;was a smart idea, as the two work wonderfully together, and Ronan received Academy Award nominations for both films. Plus, Gerwig didn’t stop with Ronan;&nbsp;she and producer Amy Pascal also landed the immense talents of Meryl Streep, Florence Pugh (who received a Best Supporting Actress nomination), Emma Watson, Laura Dern, Timothée Chalamet, and a host of other incredible actors, lending the film the kind of A-list shimmer you’d expect to see in a prestige picture.4.&nbsp;To Kill A Mockingbird&nbsp;(1962) – 30 Points(Photo by Everett Collection)Tomatometer Score (Rank):&nbsp;92% (7th)Audience Score (Rank):&nbsp;92% (6th)Domestic Box Office (Rank):&nbsp;$148 million (17th)Since its release in 1960, Harper Lee’s Pulitzer Prize-winning novel&nbsp;To Kill a Mockingbird&nbsp;has been an American institution that has&nbsp;sold over 40 million copies and been discussed and re-evaluated in classrooms across the country. Two years after its publication, director Robert Mulligan&nbsp;brought&nbsp;To Kill a Mockingbird&nbsp;to the big screen, and it was a smash hit that won three Academy Awards and eventually earned the 25th spot on the American Film Institute’s Top 100 Films list.&nbsp;Anchored by Gregory Peck’s Oscar-winning performance and Horton Foote’s faithful screenplay,&nbsp;Mockingbird tells the story of Atticus Finch (Peck), a lawyer in the depression-era South defending a Black man named Tom Robinson (Brock Peters) who has been put on trial for an undeserved rape conviction.Putting aside the important cultural discussion that continues to this day, To Kill a Mockingbird is an example of a book adaptation done right. Mulligan and Foote knew they had excellent source material to work from, so they stuck to&nbsp;it (mostly), and with the help of Harper Lee presented a faithful adaptation that struck a chord with audiences who saw the movie as a gift when it opened on Christmas Day of 1962.3.&nbsp;Django Unchained&nbsp;(2012) – 28 Points(Photo by Andrew Cooper/©Weinstein Company)Tomatometer Score (Rank):&nbsp;87% (10th)Audience Score (Rank):&nbsp;91% (7th)Domestic Box Office (Rank):&nbsp;$191 million (9th)Between Four Rooms, Jackie Brown, and The Hateful Eight, Quentin Tarantino sure loves releasing movies on December 25, but his biggest Christmas Day hit came from Django Unchained, a super R-rated revisionist Western featuring a final gunfight that leaves a Mississippi plantation estate flooded with blood. The movie pulled in a whopping $15 million its opening day (Catch Me If You Can only pulled in $9 million) and ended up earning $191 million domestic, winning Academy Awards for Tarantino (Best Original Screenplay) and Christoph Waltz (who won his second Best Supporting Actor Oscar after earning his first for another Tarantino collaboration, Inglourious Basterds).Django Unchained tells the story of a freed slave named Django (Jamie Foxx) who teams up with an eccentric German bounty hunter named Dr. King Shultz (Waltz) in exchange for Shultz’s help freeing Django’s wife Broomhilda (Kerry Washington) from the vile clutches of plantation owner Calvin Candy (Leonardo DiCaprio, making his second appearance on this list). Normally, hard R-rated exploitation films with 165-minute running times wouldn’t be nominated for five Academy Awards (and win two). Yet under Tarantino’s supervision, Django&nbsp;delighted audiences around the world and provided Christmas counterprogramming&nbsp;with silver-tongued devils, flesh-ripping torture, and Leo DiCaprio monologuing about skulls.2.&nbsp;Catch Me If You Can&nbsp;(2002) – 15 Points(Photo by ©DreamWorks courtesy Everett Collection)Tomatometer Score (Rank):&nbsp;96% (4th)Audience Score (Rank):&nbsp;89% (9th)Domestic Box Office (Rank):&nbsp;$257 million (2nd)It wasn’t a hard sell to get audiences into theaters to watch Catch Me If You Can&nbsp;in 2002. Directed by Steven Spielberg&nbsp;and starring Tom Hanks&nbsp;and&nbsp;Leonardo DiCaprio&nbsp;(and that makes three!),&nbsp;Catch Me If You Can is a rollicking film about Frank W. Abagnale Jr. (DiCaprio), a likable con man being chased around the world by Carl Hanratty (Hanks), a likable FBI agent who really wants to, well, catch him. During the globe-trotting caper, we also get to spend time with the very likable Frank Abigaile Sr., played by Christopher Walken, whose performance was so warm and welcoming he received an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor.We’re not trying to be reductive about how “likable” the movie is, either.&nbsp;The expertise of Spielberg, the skill of his cast, and the Oscar-nominated score by John Williams make this 141-minute film&nbsp;fly by faster than a Pan Am airliner. Its appeal to people of all ages can’t be argued because it’s the rare film to receive nominations from the AARP, MTV, and Teen Choice Awards, which essentially makes it the Tom Hanks of movies.1.&nbsp;The Sting&nbsp;(1973) – 10 Points(Photo by Universal Pictures)Tomatometer Score (Rank):&nbsp;94% (6th)Audience Score (Rank):&nbsp;95% (3rd)Domestic Box Office (Rank):&nbsp;$835 million (1st)Looking to build off the blockbuster success of 1969’s Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid,&nbsp;which grossed $661 million domestically and won four Academy Awards, director George Roy Hill and stars Robert Redford and Paul Newman reteamed for The Sting. With an “if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it” mantra in place, The Sting once again showcased Redford and Newman’s unbeatable chemistry, playing lovable criminals who plan on swindling money from a&nbsp;shifty character played by Robert Shaw&nbsp;in 1930s Chicago (and hopefully avoid a freeze-framed death via a barrage of bullets). The Sting might be one of the most enjoyable films to ever to win Best Picture at the Academy Awards (it won a total of 7 Oscars&nbsp;from its 11 nominations). It also boasts an $835 million domestic box office haul, which would make almost any Marvel film jealous,&nbsp;and it’s currently the 21st highest domestic grossing film of all time. If you haven’t watched The Sting, do yourself a favor and check it out, because the A-list star power, the beautiful Oscar-winning costumes, and the charisma of Redford and Newman together are undeniable.On an Apple device?

The Dark Knight Rises. Skyfall. There were plenty of highly-anticipated, critically acclaimed films that wowed moviegoers this year. But you know all about that stuff already, so we at RT decided to give some love to a few of the overlooked, underappreciated, and, in some cases, critically dismissed movies that made an impression on us. Read on for a rundown of lesser-known gems from 2012 that we think deserve another look. 85%End of WatchMatt Atchity – Editor in ChiefThis was one of my favorite movies of the year (along with The Grey), but it really struggled to find an audience. So I was glad to see if get a recent re-release nationwide, and I really recommend seeing it if you have the chance. This story about two cops in South Central LA is sometimes funny, sometimes terrifying, and sometimes heartbreaking, and this movie caught me completely off-guard. I’m not sure what I’d been expecting, maybe another forgettable cop drama. What I got instead was a riveting ride-along with two cops (played by Jake Gyllenhaal and Michael Pena) that I really believed had been partners for years. They had an easy familiarity that looked like a couple of guys that had gone beyond being partners or friends, and into real brotherhood. You laugh with them when they laugh at each other, and you worry about them when they’re on their own. Anna Kendrick, America Ferrera and David Harbour all put in strong supporting turns, Kendrick as Gyllenhaal’s new girlfriend, and Ferrera and Harbour as fellow cops. As I said before, I strongly recommend this movie, and I’d really like to see some of this cast (especially Pena) get some notice as the awards season heats up. 89%The Turin HorseTim Ryan – Senior EditorNobody makes films like Hungarian director Bela Tarr. His spare, eerie meditations on morality and mortality occupy a bleak, mystical plane that seems to exist outside of time (or any notions of contemporary cinematic influence). The plot of The Turin Horse is simple — a man and his daughter tend to their farm while waiting for an apocalyptic storm to hit — and it’s told with an absolute minimum of artifice: the camera barely moves as our protagonists eat, work, and go about their daily business in near silence. I’m not even going to try to sell you on The Turin Horse; it’s the type of movie experience that will strike some as poetic and evocative, and others as a nifty cure for insomnia. But it casts a hypnotic spell, one that I’ve been unable to shake since seeing it. If you choose to watch it, I’ll give you one piece of advice: wear a sweater, because you can practically feel a wintery chill from the screen. 86%The Pirates! Band of MisfitsGrae Drake – Senior EditorSince I am terrible at remembering actual historical events, I love movies with revisionist history–especially when they involve pirates and claymation. Aardman Studios enlisted the help of Hugh Grant, Imelda Staunton, David Tennant, Jeremy Piven, Salma Hayek, and Martin Freeman to tell the tale of the Pirate Captain, who really isn’t a great leader, and his quest to impress a girl (Queen Victoria). Along the way, he meets Charles Darwin, enters a science contest, tries to win Pirate of the Year, and learns what friendship is really all about. This film is nothing less than what I have come to expect from the Wallace and Gromit folks– it’s hysterical from start to finish, has staggering amounts of charm, and provides phenomenal detail even within the foam on beer. Every time I watch it, I want to give this movie a hug. 95%The Queen of VersaillesRyan Fujitani – EditorThis critically acclaimed but largely underseen documentary surprised me not so much because it was good, but because I enjoyed it for very different reasons than I expected. Lauren Greenfield’s The Queen of Versailles begins with a portrait of a wealthy family living in excess: time-share mogul David Siegel and his wife Jackie are in the process of building their dream house, a 90,000 sq. ft. mansion modeled after the Palace of Versailles. But then, the 2008 economic crisis hits them hard, and Siegel is forced to make vast cutbacks, both in his corporate empire and within the Siegel home itself; construction on the mansion is halted. At this point, one might expect to be overcome by a sudden rush of gleeful schadenfreude – and certainly, I felt some of this as I watched the beleaguered patriarch agonize over his expenses – but the film begins to reveal the layers behind the glitz and glamour, and this shift is what took me by surprise. Jackie’s been warped by her wealth, sure, but she’s well-meaning, she’s loving, she’s supportive, and she wants so badly for her family to feel like a family; I have to admit, I was kind of touched. The Queen of Versailles is an absolutely fascinating glimpse at the lives of the super rich, but its power is in its portrayal of the Siegels who, at the end of the day, are just another family trying to adapt to changes they’re wholly unprepared for. Never before have I experienced such a mix between my sympathy for and smug satisfaction with the misfortune of others. 47%The ComedyLuke Goodsell – International EditorWhat can I say, I love movies about messed-up, unpleasant people — and the more messed-up and unpleasant the better, as far as I’m concerned. Tim Heidecker and Eric Wareheim have been testing the dynamics of audience discomfort for years with their brilliant Awesome Show, and that laugh-or-cringe sensibility manifests in a complex, dramatic way in Heidecker’s character here. Giving easily one of my favorite performances of the year, Heidecker plays a kind of repulsive trust-fund monster whose money allows him to do literally nothing with his life — nothing, that is, apart from drift from situation to situation antagonizing people; as though some kind of slovenly Andy Kaufman had been resurrected for a Noah Baumbach movie. He’s hideous but he’s also hilarious, and The Comedy moves more like a drama — you’re just never sure whether you should be in howls of pain or hysterics. The most impressive thing about both Alverson’s direction and Heidecker’s genius underplaying is not just the truth they locate in this husk of a man-boy, it’s that they nearly make you care about his sad predicament by the movie’s end. It’s the kind of character and film that splits critics down the middle, as well it should — with 40% on the Tomatometer, there’s love and loathing aplenty. The Comedy had a miniature theatrical run, but it’s widely available on VOD. Watch it, and either thank me or despise me afterwards. 77%Jeff, Who Lives at HomeAlex Vo – EditorOf the 6,000 films Jay and Mark Duplass were involved with this year, Jeff, Who Lives at Home stands out. Not that I have any personal identification with a slacker who lives in his mom’s basement and believes he’s getting signs from the universe to do something meaningful, Jeff who (probably) eats too much cereal and (probably) is still hung-up on his ex. No identification at all. Instead, I connected with the movie’s charm and simplicity, from the title all the way down to its surprisingly generous spirit. Jeff (Jason Segel, essentially updating his Freaks and Geeks character for the information age) is presented as a lovable oaf, who could be a real underdog if it weren’t so inconvenient to getting high. And there is exciting depth to his friends and family, which includes people played by Susan Sarandon, Judy Greer, and Ed Helms, all of whom get a few great scenes. Jeff’s adventure is madcap and full of digressions, easing its way into an affecting finale against the backdrop of a setting sun. Mumblecore, aka hipster Dogme, may be fleeting but in considering Jeff’s little heartfelt accomplishment, we can see the signs of life.El DedoKerr Lordygan – Review AggregatorTossing around in my head films such as Smashed (possible Oscar buzz on this anyway) and Bait (2012, funny, silly, exciting with quite creative gore), I ended up opting for El Dedo (“The Finger”). A selection of the Global Film Initiative, the film handles a slightly grotesque premise with lightheartedness and charm. The results are sometimes comical and always endearing. The plot is just ridiculous enough to be true. Based on real events, a few of the real-life subjects co-star, breaking the fourth wall to bring us closer. A beloved townsmen running for mayor in a town’s first election is murdered and his finger is saved for sentimental purposes. The town looks to the severed index finger for guidance, but will it still win the mayoral election? The characters are so likeable, the plot is almost surreal, this one is a winner, even for those who might not ordinarily watch foreign films. 53%People Like UsCatherine Pricci – Review AggregatorThis Chris Pine and Elizabeth Banks drama may not necessarily be off the radar, but overall it was poorly received. And that’s unfortunate since this underappreciated film had fantastic performances by its two leads. A lot of critics felt this film lacked depth and was melodramatic, but most agreed that Pine and Banks put in standout performances. And audiences should keep an eye on newcomer Michael Hall D’Addario, who played Banks’s son; he stole most of the scenes he was in and is definitely someone to look out for in the future. If you like films with great performances, and don’t mind a tear or two, this one is worth another look. 26%This Means WarBeki Lane – Production AssistantI’m here to recommend a flick that got crushed on the Tomatometer, but is still tasty if you can handle a little pulp. This Means War is formulaic, but I believe that plot formulas exist because, just often enough, they work. This one really surprised me. If you don’t make the mistake of going in expecting something more than what it is, this film offers a lot of laughs and a really good time. Reese Witherspoon, Chris Pine and Tom Hardy are really funny, and keep it stylish to boot. This film doesn’t fall into the chick flick category, nor does it cater exclusively to the bros. Rather it has great balance, and can be appreciated by all. In the civil unrest that can arise during the debate of what DVD to select for a stay-in date night, This Means War can bring both sides to a suitable accord. 79%DreddJulio de Oliveira – Project ManagerDredd is not one of those movies that you never heard about, but it’s probably one you didn’t care to watch when it hit the theaters earlier this year. Let’s face it, its box office was far from great, but – as a comic book fan – I decided to give it a shot, and I’m really glad I got to watch it in all its 3D glory. The guys behind Dredd did a pretty good job giving life to Mega City One, a post-apocalyptic metropolis dominated by crime, where cops enforce the law onto its citizens as judges, jury and executioners. The city looks so overpopulated, chaotic and hopeless that it convinces the audience that the unorthodox methods applied by the judges are the only way to go. Instead of spending a long time introducing this dystopic reality, director Pete Travis let you learn as you go. He basically shows a day in the life of the always-frowning Judge Dredd (Karl Urban) and rookie psychic partner Anderson (Olivia Thirlby), who get trapped in a gigantic residential complex called Peach Tree – more like a vertical concrete slum, dominated by drug lord Ma-Ma (Lena Headey). The movie is packed with action, God-they-are-not-gonna-make-it moments, and loads of gory violence. I also really like its beautiful, dark cinematography and the visual impact of the well-applied slow-motion technology and bullet-time effects. It’s a visual masterpiece. Dredd is still not available on home entertainment, but it will hit 3D Blu-ray, Blu-ray, DVD and digital download on January 8, 2013.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"Premium, franchise, asian-american, miniseries, on, Apple, Awards, Mystery, Spectrum, awards, love, Lucasfilm","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"best-movies-off-the-radar-2012"},{"id":"47613051069833","title":"RT on DVD & Blu-Ray: Super 8 and Conan the Barbarian","content":"RT on DVDvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})RT on DVD &amp; Blu-Ray: Super 8 and Conan the BarbarianPlus, the latest Spy Kids, a solid Holocaust film, and a couple of notable classics.by | November 21, 2011 |  CommentsThis week on home video, we’ve got an interesting mix of choices, and at least a couple of them may be a bit controversial. As for items we won’t be discussing at length: there are new Blu-rays for films like The Three Amigos, Rushmore (the existing Criterion edition), and ESPN’s 30 for 30 series (which we covered when it first arrived on DVD). The big titles this week are J.J. Abrams’ sci-fi treat, an update on a classic fantasy hero, and the latest of Robert Rodriguez’s Spy Kids films. Then we’ve got a French drama centered on the Holocaust experience, a unique look at the Hussein family, a controversial silent film, and a bona fide courtroom classic. See below for the full list!Super 8 81%J.J. Abrams has been known to keep his projects super secret, whether it was a major plot point in his hit television show LOST or the unveiling of the monster in Cloverfield, which he produced. It was no different with his latest directorial effort, Super 8; the first trailer released thrillingly depicted a collision between a pickup truck and a freight train carrying something ominously powerful, but not much else. As it turned out, the film follows a group of kids making a home movie with a super 8 camera who happen to be present when the aforementioned collision takes place, and their camera inadvertently captures something they never expected to film. When strange things begin occurring in town, the children take it upon themselves to solve the mystery. Many agree that Super 8 is an earnest throwback to the kid-friendly sci-fi adventures of the 1980s, and with Steven Spielberg producing, it’s no wonder. With plenty of thrills, visual dazzle, and emotional depth, Super 8 is Certified Fresh at 82% and a pretty good choice if you’re looking for some good, old-fashioned, nostalgic fun.Conan the Barbarian 25%It’s been almost three decades since the last big screen portrayal of Robert E. Howard’s Conan the Barbarian, and most will remember that he was famously played by Arnold Schwarzenegger. How, then, would a remake fare, with a new story and a new Conan? Not very well, actually. This time around, Jason Momoa (of recent Game of Thrones fame) plays the titular warrior, who is born in the heat of battle and trained as a warrior until his entire family is slaughtered by an evil warlord named Khalar Zym (Stephen Lang) in search of pieces to a mystical mask. Conan escapes the onslaught and lives on as a pirate until a chance meeting provides him with a new lead to seek vengeance for his clan’s extermination. Co-starring Rose Mcgowan, Rachel Nichols, and Ron Perlman in small role as Conan’s father, Conan the Barbarian failed to impress critics, who felt the film lacked any good characterization, worthy dialogue, or competent acting. It’s gory and over the top, so if you’re looking for a mindless action flick with those credentials, have at it; if you’re looking for anything more, search elsewhere.Spy Kids: All the Time in the World 4D 22%As with plenty of franchises before it, the Spy Kids movies may be running low on creative juice, but that doesn’t mean they know when to pack it in. Spy Kids: All the Time in the World in 4D, the latest entry in Robert Rodriguez’s venerable kiddie adventure series, wasn’t exactly greeted fondly by critics, who haven’t enjoyed a Spy Kids movie en masse since Spy Kids 2: The Island of Lost Dreams. Jessica Alba stars as a retired spy who’s lured back into action when a maniacal supervillain threatens the free world. She’s joined in her mission by some newly recruited spy kids. The pundits said the movie will probably appeal to the little ones, and there are moments of visual inventiveness, but for the most part adults may be less than charmed this time out. For all you Spy-hards out there, the new Blu-ray has plenty of cool extras, including an interview with Rodriguez by an intrepid kid reporter, behind-the-scenes footage, and deleted scenes.Sarah’s Key 72%The first thing one might be inclined to say about Sarah’s Key after hearing its premise is, “Oh, another Holocaust movie?” While this is true, most critics will tell you that this one is certainly worth watching. Somewhat of a two-part film, the first half of Sarah’s Key focuses on the titular Sarah (Melusine Mayance), a young Jewish girl living in France who falls victim to the Vel’ d’Hiv Roundup in 1942, wherein French police in German-occupied Paris rounded up Jewish families to be shipped off to Auschwitz; Sarah is able to escape, but not in time to save her little brother, and this haunts her until her death as an adult. In the present day, an American journalist (Kristin Scott-Thomas) learns that her French husband has inherited the same apartment where young Sarah once lived, and she begins an investigation into the apartment’s past that uncovers Sarah’s history. Critics found the film absorbing and impeccably acted all around, even if it had a few minor plot issues. Certified Fresh at 75%, Sarah’s Key may not be the definitive Holocaust film, but it’s one that will engage you until the credits roll.The Devil’s Double 54%Much has been made of Saddam Hussein’s multiple doppelgangers, who the notorious dictator used to stay one step ahead of those who might capture — or kill — him. Based on factual events, The Devil’s Double focuses on the same phenomenon as it applied to one of Hussein’s sons, Uday Hussein. Dominic Cooper here plays dual roles as both Latif Yahia, the Iraqi lieutenant chosen as Uday’s double, and Uday himself; as Latif discovers the depths of Uday’s dark and psychotic behavior, he must come to terms with what he’s been asked to do in Uday’s name. Critics were fairly split about The Devil’s Double, thought most praised Cooper’s dedication to the role. Directed by Lee Tamahori (Die Another Day) and co-starring Ludivine Sagnier, Philip Quast, and (surprise!) Latif Yahia himself in a supporting role, The Devil’s Double earned a 53% on the Tomatometer, with many critics balking at the graphic portrayal of Uday Hussein’s cruel and sadistic nature, but willing to recognize the strength of Cooper’s performance.The Birth of a Nation – Special Edition Blu-Ray 93%We’re stuck with The Birth of a Nation. Few would deny its profound influence on movie history, but fewer still can watch its loathsome treatment of African Americans with anything less than disgust. For as much as D.W. Griffith’s epic helped codify the modern language of filmmaking (utilizing the most sophisticated editing techniques and camerawork that cinema had yet seen), its glorification of the Ku Klux Klan as heroes of the Reconstruction era was pretty controversial even upon its release in 1915. Griffith was a man of his time, and a not particularly ideological one at that (he was surprised at the negative backlash the movie generated) and yet his masterwork was so skillfully made that it remains a flashpoint of film scholarship — is it possible to admire, or even enjoy, a film with such an odious message? Kino’s lavish three-disc The Birth of a Nation – Special Edition will certainly add to the conversation; in addition to a new transfer of the film, the set features a number of Griffith’s short films and plenty of bonus featurettes and documents about the making of the movie and the controversy it caused.12 Angry Men – Criterion Collection 100%Cinema history is loaded with courtroom dramas, but 12 Angry Men remains the most influential — and one of the most perpetually watchable — of the bunch. Directed with verve and urgency by Sidney Lumet, 12 Angry Men is the tale of a jury tasked with deciding the fate of an impoverished murder suspect; as the jurors examine the evidence, they come to realize that perhaps the case wasn’t as open-and-shut as it first appeared. Sure, it’s a “message movie,” but with electric performances from the likes of Henry Fonda, Martin Balsam, Jack Warden, and Jack Klugman, it never feels preachy. A new Criterion edition of the film features a fresh transfer of the movie, new and archival interviews with Lumet and other crew members, and an earlier, made-for-television version of 12 Angry Men.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"criterion, PaleyFest, Certified, Comic, unscripted, FOX, Pixar, Lucasfilm, werewolf, fast","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"RT-on-DVD-and-Blu-Ray-Super-8-and-Conan-the-Barbarian"},{"id":"47613035638148","title":"RT on DVD & Blu-Ray: Contagion Spreads to Home Video","content":"RT on DVDvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})RT on DVD &amp; Blu-Ray: Contagion Spreads to Home VideoPlus, a successful Irish film, a couple fright flicks, and a classic Western bargain.by | January 3, 2012 |  CommentsThis week on home video, we’ve got a couple of solid new releases, a couple of so-so features, a couple of bombs, and an impressive three-movie collection at a very affordable price. Steven Soderbergh’s latest, a star-studded epidemic film, and the highest grossing independent Irish film of all time come home. Next up, the Guy Pearce/Katie Holmes-powered haunted house movie and a medical conspiracy thriller starring Chris Evans, followed by a joyless creature feature and the Sarah Jessica Parker vehicle that rehashes her Sex and the City character in a more domestic setting. Last but not least, we’ve got a 3-pack of some of the most iconic Westerns every filmed. Check out the full list below!Contagion 85%Steven Soderbergh is one busy man — he’s directed at least one film a year since 1995, with the exception of 2003 — and he’s also one of those directors who has successfully navigated both independent and mainstream waters with finesse. Last year, we got his latest ensemble hit, Contagion, an apocalyptic thriller about a deadly epidemic starring some of Hollywood’s biggest stars, and while we?ve seen outbreak movies before (like, for example, 1995’s Outbreak), critics found Contagion worthy of a Certified Fresh 84% Tomatometer. The story follows multiple threads as a lethal airborne virus rapidly goes worldwide, charting the paths of those tasked with mitigating the global impact of the disaster and those simply trying to cope with its deadly effects. Bolstered by an all-star cast that includes Matt Damon, Gwyneth Paltrow, Kate Winslet, Jude Law, Laurence Fishburne, and Marion Cotillard, just to name a few, Contagion is a tense, tightly plotted, and exceptionally smart disaster movie that simply adds another notch to Steven Soderbergh’s already stellar career.The Guard 94%At first glance, The Guard may look like a buddy cop comedy with fish-out-of-water elements, but we’re pretty far from Rush Hour territory here. To be specific, we’re in the cold, rural climes of County Galway, where Sergeant Gerry Boyle (Brendan Gleeson) enforces the law in a highly idiosyncratic (read: often unprofessional) manner. Enter Wendell Everett (Don Cheadle), a straight-laced FBI man, who teams up with Boyle to solve an international drug trafficking case. Boyle is so fond of drugs, hookers, and politically incorrect pronouncements that Everett (and the audience) is never quite sure if he’s a buffoon or a genius, and Gleeson’s performance is so strong that he rarely tips his hand. The Guard won raves for its fine performances, witty dialogue, and evocative sense of place, and it’s a great example of a film that makes age-old conventions feel fresh again.Don’t Be Afraid of the Dark 60%After back-to-back supporting roles in Thank You for Smoking and Batman Begins back in 2005, Katie Holmes took a break from the movies — call it maternity leave — before returning to the big screen in 2008. Unfortunately, the film that marked her return was Mad Money (23% Tomatometer), and since then, she’s appeared in six straight Rotten films. To its credit, Don’t Be Afraid of the Dark is the highest rated of those, and it’s just shy of Freshness at 59%, but critics just couldn’t entirely get behind this remake of the 1973 TV movie of the same name. Starring opposite Holmes is Guy Pearce as Alex Hurst, who, along with his girlfriend Kim (Holmes), is restoring an old mansion to prep it for the real estate market. When Alex’s young daughter Sally (Bailee Madison) is placed in his care and begins to hear voices calling to her from the basement, the mansions dark secrets gradually begin to unfold. Critics found the haunted house flick’s effective atmosphere initially quite scary, but ultimately felt the film failed to deliver chills as successfully as the original. It’s not the scariest movie you’ll see, but it might be worth a rent on a cold, rainy night.Shark Night 3D 18%With that, we move on to a different kind of horror movie in Shark Night 3D. Styled after the nautical terror of Jaws and its ilk, Shark Night follows the misadventures of a group of undergrads vacationing in Louisiana who are methodically hunted by various ravenous sharks who have inexplicably taken up residence in the lake surrounding the house. After one of the coeds is brutally mauled while waterskiing, the others make an effort to get him medical attention, which, of course, merely results in more death as they attempt to traverse the dangerous waters of the lake. Shark Night performed poorly with the critics, who awarded it a paltry 15% Tomatometer score, and fared only slightly better at the box office. Hampered by its PG-13 rating, the film failed to deliver the goods in either of the two major draws of the genre: gratuitous violence and/or gore, and gratuitous sex and/or nudity. Shark Night brings nothing new or exciting to the formula, so it’s pretty difficult to make a recommendation out of it.I Don’t Know How She Does It 17%Writer/director Douglas McGrath has got a couple of good ones on his resume (Emma, Infamous), but his first film in five years was not a welcome return for him. Banking on the star power of Sarah Jessica Parker, coming off the second Sex and the City movie, I Don’t Know How She Does It purports itself to be a comedy about a working mother named Kate Reddy (Parker) who has it all, but must learn how to balance her career, her marriage, and her children. Unfortunately, critics didn’t really seem to care much about how Kate did it, as the film teetered hesitantly between comedy and drama and relied on hopelessly outdated viewpoints on gender to deliver its message. Despite a supporting cast that included the likes of Greg Kinnear, Pierce Brosnan, and Christina Hendricks, I Don’t Know How She Does It is probably best suited as entertainment for those who are looking for just a small taste, just one more fix, of Sarah Jessica Parker in full-on, Sex and the City Carrie mode.Puncture 52%Not long after his turn as Captain America, Chris Evans hit theaters again, but this time in a very small, very limited release called Puncture. Based on true events, the film focuses on a pair of Houston lawyers (Evans and co-director Mark Kassen) who agree to defend an ER nurse (Vinessa Shaw) who’s been pricked by a contaminated needle. As the attorneys delve deeper into the case, they uncover a web of conspiracy that involves a widespread medical issue and the shady underbelly of the pharmaceutical industry. Critics were willing to go with the story, which they found compelling, but most were a little reluctant to buy into the formulaic plotting that drove the narrative along. At 53% on the Tomatometer, Puncture isn’t quite the equivalent of The Insider, but it should get the job done for those looking for a passable potboiler featuring a rising star.The Searchers/The Wild Bunch/How the West Was Won Blu-Ray Triple FeatureAny Western fans out there? Sure there are, and to be honest, if you’re one of them, chances are you’ve probably seen all three of the movies in this nifty little 3-pack. That said, the three movies included here are so good that we couldn’t forego mentioning this little gem. What we have here is a triple header that features The Searchers, The Wild Bunch, and How the West Was Won; in other words, three of the most iconic Westerns ever to be filmed, starring the likes of John Wayne, Henry Fonda, Karl Malden, William Holden, and Ernest Borgnine, just to name a few. And if you haven’t seen many Westerns in your time, this is probably about as good as it gets, from masters of the genre like John Ford and Sam Peckinpah. Need more proof? The three films listed above hold Tomatometer scores of 98%, 97%, and 100%, respectively. Still wondering if it’s worth picking up? Alright, we’ll sweeten the deal by telling you that the triple feature is available on Blu-ray and costs less than $25. Granted, you won’t be getting a lot of bonus features (if any) on a package this inexpensive, but all three films are certainly worth having in your collection.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"competition, TV, Studios, Walking, &, ID, satire, asian-american","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"RT-on-DVD-and-Blu-Ray-Contagion-Spreads-to-Home-Video"},{"id":"47613030578562","title":"RT on DVD & Blu-Ray: Crazy, Stupid, Love & Cars 2 & Water for Elephants","content":"RT on DVDvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})RT on DVD &amp; Blu-Ray: Crazy, Stupid, Love &amp; Cars 2 &amp; Water for ElephantsPlus, a silent era Phantom, a traditional Christmas, and a saucy documentary.by | November 1, 2011 |  CommentsThis week brings us another handful of interesting releases on home video, with a mixture of Certified Fresh choices and critical duds. Notable “also-ran”s for this week’s column include both the 1951 adaptation of A Christmas Carol and the 1988 Bill Murray version Scrooged, as well as the Robin Williams Peter Pan tale Hook and a Blu-ray set for the Toy Story trilogy, all ideal for the holidays. George Clooney’s Confessions of a Dangerous Mind also gets the hi-def treatment, as does the British miniseries Brideshead Revisited. That said, we’ll be focusing on the recent Steve Carell/Ryan Gosling romcom, Pixar’s most recent sequel, and a Robert Pattinson/Reese Witherspoon drama. Then we’ve got Errol Morris’s latest doc, a faith-based Christmas story, Joel Schumacher’s hostage movie, and a creepy silent era classic. See below for the full list!Crazy, Stupid, Love. 79%Steve Carell’s big screen career thus far has been quite fruitful for him, but though the talented actor has already notched a few starring roles, Crazy, Stupid, Love. marks the first one since The 40 Year Old Virgin to earn the Certified Fresh stamp (if you don’t include his work in animated films like Despicable Me). Carell plays Cal Weaver, a family man suffering from marital problems who befriends smooth-talking womanizer Jacob (Ryan Gosling) in order to get back into the dating game. Soon, however, Jacob himself begins to earnestly fall for Hannah (Emma Stone), and both he and Cal must lean on each other for support through their tumultuous love lives. With a supporting cast that also includes Julianne Moore, Marisa Tomei, and Kevin Bacon, Crazy, Stupid, Love. charmed critics, who called it unabashedly sweet even if it doesn’t quite live up to the “crazy” part of its title, to the tune of a Certified Fresh 77%. While it may not necessarily elicit the biggest laughs of the year, it should make for a pleasant rom-com elevated by a terrific cast.Cars 2 40%Though it sports a Certified Fresh 74% on the Tomatometer, 2006’s Cars is widely regarded as Pixar’s least impressive film, especially when considering the fact that every other entry in the animation studio’s canon has earned between 91% and 100% on the Tomatometer. What, then, prompted this sequel, when there would appear to be so many other worthy entries to expand into franchises? Some argue that it was a money grab, seeing as how Cars merchandise has been disgustingly popular with the kiddies. Others argue that… Well, okay, we haven’t heard much in the way of a counterargument, considering Cars 2 went on to become the first Rotten movie for Pixar. This time around, Lightning McQueen (voiced by Owen Wilson) and his buddy Mater (Larry the Cable Guy) do a bit of globetrotting for a World Grand Prix, during which Mater becomes unwittingly involved in an international espionage operation. Despite the film’s fantastic visual flourishes, critics say, Cars 2 lacks compelling storytelling, making it possibly the first Pixar film not to appeal successfully to adults as much as children. The cast, which includes Michael Caine, Emily Mortimer, John Turturro, and more, is great, though, and kids will undoubtedly love it, so there you go.Water for Elephants 60%It’s a bit too early to tell whether or not Robert Pattinson will forever be known primarily as Twilight‘s Edward Cullen, but it would seem that Water for Elephants, based on the NY Times Best Seller of the same name, isn’t the film that will memorably set him apart from the popular teen vampire series. Pattinson plays Jacob, a twentysomething Cornell veterinary student during the Great Depression who, after learning his parents have died tragically and left a mountain of debt, decides to hop on a passing train in lieu of returning to school. As it turns out, the train belongs to the Benzini Brothers Circus, who hires Jacob as the circus’s vet, and he soon falls in love with the head animal trainer’s (Christoph Waltz) wife, Marlena (Reese Witherspoon). While the tale is tastefully told and beautifully filmed, critics felt that that Water for Elephants suffered from a pronounced lack of chemistry between its leads, earning it a just-barely-Fresh 61%. It might do the trick if you’re looking for an old-timey romance, but don’t expect many sparks to fly.Tabloid 92%When is an Errol Morris (Gates of Heaven, The Thin Blue Line) documentary ever uninteresting? The acclaimed filmmaker has been crafting award-winning docs for decades now, and Tabloid, Certified Fresh at 92%, proves he still has what it takes. Of course, it certainly helps if your subject is Joyce Bernann McKinney, the former Miss World contestant with a colorful past who turned up in the news again when a woman going by the name of “Bernann McKinney” traveled to South Korea in 2008 to have her pet dog cloned. As chronicled in Tabloid, McKinney was previously tied to a 1977 investigation in which a Mormon missionary living in Surrey, England alleged that McKinney kidnapped him, chained him to a bed, and raped him. As critics noted, Tabloid isn’t Morris’s most thought-provoking work, but it’s nevertheless a smart, spirited, and engaging look at tabloid culture and one very fascinating woman, and that makes for a solidly entertaining film.Christmas with a Capital CFaith-based films have never done very well with critics, typically because such films have a difficult time balancing effective storytelling (and decent acting, to be honest) with heavily message-driven themes. We can’t really tell you what most professional film critics thought of Christmas with a Capital C, however, because, for the most part, only Christian organizations bothered to review it. What we can tell you is that, upon the release of the film’s trailer, a lot of people on the internet had a lot of funny things to say about it, so we’re including it here as a curiosity. The story is pretty straightforward: Dan Reed (Ted McGinley) is a small-town mayor in Alaska who relishes the traditional Christmas celebrations every year, and when his high school rival Mitch Bright (Daniel Baldwin; why not Stephen is anyone’s guess) returns home from the big city, things heat up quickly. You see, Mitch isn’t comfortable with the public displays of religious themes, and in an effort to bring the town in line with the consitution’s Establishment Clause, he decides to run against Dan in the mayoral race. The film, in other words, is basically a feature-length illustration of the so-called “War on Christmas” and is intended to cater to those who firmly believe Christmas should remain a Christ-centric celebration. If you fall into this constituency, then this will be a perfect holiday treat; if not, then your life will likely not have been significantly affected by skipping the film.Trespass (2011) 11%Those who are intent on scrutinizing Nicolas Cage’s career as he takes role after role in films of ALL sorts may want to give this one a look, if only for a few more of his trademark freakout moments. Helmed by Joel Schumacher and co-starring Nicole Kidman (honestly, what is she doing in this?), Trespass follows a wealthy young family who are taken hostage in their mansion by extortionists looking to score on a home invasion run. Unfortunately, as the critics tell it, the film simply relies on too many familiar elements from other similar films like Panic Room, rendering the tension ineffective, and is far too nasty and aggressive to be entertaining. At 13% on the Tomatometer, it’s not much of a surprise that the film opened almost exactly two weeks ago and is now already finding its way to home video. (You can read about Joel Schumacher’s Five Favorite Films here.)Phantom of the Opera (1925) Blu-ray 90%If you’re in the market for some post-Halloween creepiness, you’re in luck: The Phantom of the Opera is hitting shelves on Blu-ray. Starring Lon Chaney in perhaps his most iconic role, this supremely gothic 1925 masterpiece is unlikely to shock contemporary slasher fans (or even adherents to Andrew Lloyd Webber’s smash musical), but it still has the power to get under your skin and stay there. Chaney plays Erik, a disfigured, misunderstood music star who slinks around the dark corridors below the Paris Opera House, causing all sorts of havoc in a misguided attempt to win the heart of his beloved Christine (Mary Philbin). Featuring grotesque makeup and innovative color sequences, Phantom remains disquieting stuff; for silent movie buffs, the disc has some interesting bonus materials, including a commentary track, the original script, a photo gallery, and a souvenir program.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"Mary, docudrama, YA, Star, Best, movies, Cosplay, NBC, cinematic, Mystery, TV","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"RT-on-DVD-and-Blu-Ray-Crazy-Stupid-Love-and-Cars-2-and-Water-for-Elephants"},{"id":"47613028505985","title":"AFI Fest Selections Score Big During Awards Season","content":"var mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})AFI Fest Selections Score Big During Awards SeasonAs an incubator for Oscar buzz, the festival has a strong recent track record.by Tim Ryan | November 12, 2013 |  CommentsIn the pantheon of film festivals, the AFI Fest ranks a few notches below Cannes and Sundance in the public’s imagination. As an incubator for awards season buzz, however, the fest has had a bigger impact than its reputation would suggest.In 2012, the AFI Fest hosted screenings of Life of Pi, Silver Linings Playbook, Lincoln, The Impossible, Amour, and, in a secret screening, Skyfall, each of which ended up being nominated for an Oscar (with Life of Pi, Lincoln, and Skyfall each taking home multiple statuettes). Plus, four of the five films nominated for Best Foreign Film (Amour, Kon-Tiki, A Royal Affair, and War Witch) were shown at the fest.The 2011 fest wasn’t quite as jam-packed with future Oscar winners, but it still sported a pretty decorated lineup that included eventual Best Picture winner The Artist along with nominees My Week with Marylin and Pina and three of the five Best Foreign Film hopefuls (A Seperation, which won, along with Bullhead and Footnote). On the other hand, the 2010 lineup was a veritable murderer’s row of films that garnered Oscar noms, including The King’s Speech, Black Swan, Rabbit Hole, Blue Valentine, and The Fighter.Of course, not every AFI Fest selection goes on to earn awards season glory; for every Life of Pi, there are films like J Edgar, Love and Other Drugs and Hitchcock that earn polite reviews but no hardware. It will be interesting to see how this year’s lineup fares come Oscar season; we wouldn’t be surprised if Idris Elba or Christian Bale get Best Actor noms for Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom and Out of the Furnace, respectively. Or if Meryl Streep or Judi Dench get Best Actress nods for August: Osage County and Philomena. Or if Bruce Dern is up for Best Supporting Actor for his turn in Nebraska. Or if Spike Jonze gets a Best Screenplay Oscar for Her.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"Funimation, laika, toronto, jurassic, dc","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"afi-fest-selections-score-big-during-awards-season"},{"id":"47613041660295","title":"Awards Tour 2012: Producers Guild of America Awards Winners","content":"var mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Awards Tour 2012: Producers Guild of America Awards Winnersby RT Staff | January 21, 2012 |  CommentsThe Producers Guild of America (PGA) announced today the motion picture and long-form television nominations for the 23rd Annual Producers Guild Awards.

The end-of-winter release date and the bright LA streets kicked off a metaphorical heatwave for McConaughey’s career that led to blockbuster hits, R-rated gems, and a Best Actor Oscar at the 2014 Academy Awards.After stumbling a bit in the films Ghosts of Girlfriends Past and Surfer Dude, McConaughey surprised viewers by fully inhabiting the role of Michael “Mickey” Haller, a Defense Attorney (who never gets car sick) whose office is a Lincoln Town Car driven by a former client named Earl (Laurence Mason). Adapted from the 2005 book by Michael Connelly, the R-rated film collected $80 million worldwide on a $40 million budget and was adored by critics and audiences who declared it guilty of being an excellent courtroom thriller. McConaughey is in nearly every second of the Brad Furman-directed film, and the fly-on-the-wall camerawork full of pans and zooms by cinematographer Lukas Ettlin follows him around the streets of LA as he works on a high-profile case involving a rich maniac named Louis Roulet (Ryan Phillippe).Later in 2011, the Richard Linklater-directed Bernie&nbsp;and William Freidkin-directed Killer Joe&nbsp;erased the bad taste of Ghosts of Girlfriends Past&nbsp;and catapulted Failure to Launch&nbsp;out of people’s memories, ushering in the “McConaissance.” McConaughey followed these up with The Paperboy, Mud, Magic Mike, Dallas Buyers Club (which won him the&nbsp;aforementioned Oscar), The Wolf of Wall Street, True Detective, and the $700 million-grossing worldwide blockbuster Interstellar.&nbsp;In other words, McConaughey was doing “alright, alright, alright,” as everything he touched turned to gold (well, except for Gold, which, after Fool’s Gold and Sahara, proved he should avoid treasure hunting).Here’s five reasons why The Lincoln Lawyer&nbsp;was the perfect film to put McConaughey on the expressway to the McConaissance.1. McConaughey Is an Excellent Movie Lawyer(Photo by ©Lionsgate courtesy Everett Collection)While many consider McConaughey’s breakthrough performance in Dazed and Confused to be his launching pad, it was the 1996 film A Time to Kill that pushed his career into orbit. The John Grisham book adaptation featured McConaughey as a defense attorney for Carl Lee Hailey (Samuel L. Jackson), a man who murdered his daughter’s rapists and injured a cop in the process. The film killed it at the box office, bringing in $152 million worldwide, and McConaughey was awarded the “Most Promising Actor” distinction from the Chicago Film Critics Association. A year later, McConaughey starred in&nbsp;Steven Spielberg’s&nbsp;Amistad, which was based on the true story and 1987 book Mutiny on the Amistad: The Saga of a Slave Revolt and Its Impact on American Abolition, Law, and Diplomacy. McConaughey once again played an attorney, this time defending a group of Africans who took control of the slave ship bound for the Americas that they were imprisoned on. Both films were Fresh successes, and proved he could excel in courtroom dramas.After a decade of romantic comedies and Reign of Fire&nbsp;— which is awesome, by the way; McConaughey is swallowed whole by a dragon —&nbsp;The Lincoln Lawyer and Bernie saw his return&nbsp;to&nbsp;the courtroom and reminded everyone of his rakish charm and acting prowess. Mickey is in almost every frame of The Lincoln Lawyer, and you can tell McConaughey loves playing the character. Whether it’s his off-the-charts chemistry with Marisa Tomei&nbsp;or the way he sucks the life out of Ted Minton (Josh Lucas), the overmatched state’s attorney, McConaughey thrives in the slimy-yet-likable role. When Earl asks Mickey if he’ll still have a job after Mickey&nbsp;gets his license back (he lost it due to a DUI),&nbsp;Mickey says he’s already had&nbsp;it&nbsp;for three months; the two smile, say nothing, and continue on with their day. It’s at this exact moment you realize you actually kind of like Mickey, the divorced alcoholic attorney hated by so many because he’s so good.&nbsp;After 10 years, this scene still hits us every time.2. The Film Gave Him His Edge Back and Allowed Him to ResetIf&nbsp;you saw Dazed and Confused as a teenager, McConaughey’s character Wooderson may have come across like a mythical figure. In hindsight, though, it probably dawned on you that Wooderson is an older dude who kind of creeps on high school girls, and you probably wouldn’t want him hanging out with your children or their friends. That’s the magic of McConaughey: he can find the charm in people you’d&nbsp;probably want nothing to do with otherwise. While he certainly earned his share of fans in rom-coms like&nbsp;How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days&nbsp;and&nbsp;The Wedding Planner, many forget he got his start playing sleazy or mysterious figures in movies like&nbsp;Dazed and Confused, Lone Star, and Frailty.McConaughey is at his best in films like Killer Joe, Magic Mike, and The Gentleman, when he can embody a square-jawed menace. His speech about the laws of the jungle in The Gentlemen&nbsp;and every second of his Killer Joe screentime are laced with unpredictable anger and a “don’t come at me” vibe that had been lost in movies like Surfer, Dude. In The Lincoln Lawyer, he’s a bad dad and a terrible husband, and he’s responsible for destroying an innocent man’s life (Michael Peña) after he refused to listen and fight for him. However, despite these glaring flaws, he’s still exceedingly likable, and&nbsp;he still possesses&nbsp;something of a moral compass. When Mickey visits Peña’s character&nbsp;to confirm a suspicion, you see in the course of just a couple minutes that McConaughey is nervous, shaken, and desperate as he tries to right a prior wrong.Reviews for The Lincoln Lawyer use phrases like “very refreshing,” “never-better,” and “the only actor in Hollywood who can swagger while sitting down.” This performance hit the reset button for McConaughey, who admitted in an interview with Cigar Afficionado magazine (of course) that the so-called McConaissance was more a case of him saying&nbsp;“f*** the bucks” and taking roles that “scared” him after a decade of easy, lucrative rom-coms. While he enjoyed giving audiences “90-minute breezy romantic getaways,” he wanted to be an actor again, “going as deep as you can in a role,” and&nbsp;The Lincoln Lawyer marks the beginning of that journey.3. McConaughey Soars in R-Rated Films(Photo by Everett Collection)It’s also fitting that&nbsp;The Lincoln Lawyer marked Matthew McConaughey’s comeback because the Tomatometer scores in his filmography reveal an interesting trend. His R-rated films boast a Fresh 60.2% average, whereas his PG-13 films&nbsp;sit at a Rotten 40.9% average. In other words, he has thrived in more adult-oriented fare, as 14 of his 15 best-reviewed films are rated R (Kubo and the Two Strings is the lone exception). McConaughey won his Oscar for the&nbsp;Dallas Buyers Club, and most recently, The Gentleman collected a 75% Tomatomometer and an 84% Audience Score&nbsp;en route to earning&nbsp;$115 million worldwide. Basically R = McC glory — with the exception of&nbsp;Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Next Generation, Tiptoes, and Surfer, Dude, but even those three have cult followings of their own.Though it was a television program, the HBO crime drama&nbsp;True Detective sported a similar&nbsp;TV-MA rating, which is appropriate for a show that features brutal murder, copious profanity, and a sense of dread that weighs on you like a Lincoln Town Car. McConaughey’s performance in&nbsp;the first season of the series&nbsp;earned him Golden Globe and Emmy nominations for his turn as “Rust” Kohle, a Lone Star-swigging detective who goes through super dark times while hunting for a serial killer.Now, his PG-13 films have made much more money at the box office — Interstellar (that crying scene…) and How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days&nbsp;in particular were giant hits. But movies like Mud, Killer Joe (which actually received an NC-17 rating), and Magic Mike were low-budget marvels that found him hitting new gears and allowed him to work with people like&nbsp;Steven Soderbergh and Jeff Nichols.&nbsp;Yes, 2019’s famously panned&nbsp;Serenity is also rated R,&nbsp;but it’s insane, and we love that it exists — because it’s insane.What’s wild is that between 2003 and 2011, McConaughey’s only Fresh film was Tropic Thunder,&nbsp;the R-rated comedy epic that saw him dueling with Tom Cruise&nbsp;and throwing TiVos in the air to stop deadly rockets. The role is a minor one, but Rick Peck, Hollywood Agent, is another cocky creation who is just as&nbsp;dedicated as Mickey Haller is&nbsp;to his clients.4. He’s at His Best Playing Characters Whose Names Begin with M(Photo by ©STX Films, Jim Bridges/©Roadside Attractions, Saeed Adyani/©Lionsgate)Bear with us here: Between Mud, The Gentlemen, The Beach Bum, The Wolf of Wall Street, Frailty, and The Lincoln Lawyer, R-rated movies in which McConaughey’s character’s first or last name begins with an “M” have a 76.5% Tomatometer average. This is well above the 60.2% average of his R-rated films in general. During the McConaissance, five of his best films have him named Mud, Mickey, Moondog, Michael, and Mark. Is this mere coincidence, or is there some other cosmic force at work?Two of McConaughey’s most underrated performances are in The Beach Bum and Frailty (which isn’t part of the McConaissance, but it’s legit). In The Beach Bum, Harmony Korine’s follow-up to Spring Breakers, he returned to Florida and cast McConaughey as a pleasure-loving author who gets entangled in shenanigans that involve great white sharks, cannabis, and explosions. Moondog is a peculiar entity who feels like an alternate version of McConaughey himself from a different timeline. The film moves at a leisurely pace, and it’s kept together by a dedicated McConaughey who knows he’s in a singular role of a lifetime. In Frailty, the Bill Paxton-directed horror film, McConaughey plays a guilt-ridden man named Adam/Fenton Meiks who believes he is on a mission from God to eliminate demons that walk among the living. He also tells excellent stories about past murders and family trauma, which he would do again in True Detective.5. The Film Boasts a Deep Bench of Supporting Characters(Photo by Saeed Adyani/©Lionsgate courtesy Everett Collection)While The Lincoln Lawyer may feature McConaughey in every scene, it helps that he’s surrounded by a&nbsp;supporting cast that’s deeper than the bench of the 2002-2003 San Antonio Spurs. It’s a treat watching John Leguizamo, Marissa Tomei, Josh Lucas, Laurence Mason, Michael Peña,&nbsp;William H. Macy, Shea Whigham, Frances Fisher, Ryan Phillipe, and Bryan Cranston act against McConaughey. It feels like their energy made him raise his game, and you can see it on the screen.His chemistry with Tomei’s Maggie, Mickey’s ex-wife, is palpable, and Michael Peña gives him pure gold to work with as an innocent man doomed to decades in prison. It also helps that Ryan Phillipe oozes menace and gives viewers a villain who desperately needs to be found guilty. The&nbsp;ensemble is instrumental to the success of the film;&nbsp;he’s surrounded by an embarrassment of riches,&nbsp;which makes the film&nbsp;infinitely rewatchable.That’s another reason why McConaughey has flourished in the decade since The Lincoln Lawyer’s release: Between Interstellar, The Wolf of Wall Street, Mud, Dallas Buyers Club (Jared Leto also won an Oscar for this film), Bernie, and Magic Mike, he’s been surrounded by A-listers doing A+ work. It’s part of the conscious decision he made back in 2011 to seek out challenging, rewarding material and work with talented individuals at the top of their game, and it reflects his newfound commitment to his craft. Would the McConaissance have still happened if he didn’t choose to star in&nbsp;The Lincoln Lawyer? Maybe, probably, but thanks to a number of factors — both obvious and esoteric — there couldn’t have been a more appropriate vehicle. Also, we like to imagine&nbsp;it led to this.The Lincoln Lawyer&nbsp;was released in theaters on March 18, 2011.On an Apple device?

But before we get to those, let’s mention some of the other items coming out this week that we won’t be mentioning: The Robin Williams classic Good Morning, Vietnam is getting a 25th Anniversary Blu-ray, Criterion releases a new Blu-ray of Steven Soderbergh’s Traffic, and the recent Journey to the Center of the Earth gets the hi-def 3D treatment… you know, for the kiddies. As far as new stuff, there’s the George Clooney directed political drama starring Ryan Gosling, the new Christian film from the makers of Fireproof, two of the moldiest movies to come out in 2011, and a retro coming-of-age tale. Finally, Criterion is also introducing its new transfer of a Luis Bunuel classic featuring one of Catherine Deneuve’s most iconic roles. See below for the full list!The Ides of March 83%Now that awards season is fully under way, 2011 is shaping up to be a pretty good year for George Clooney. He’s already picked up a couple of awards for his work in The Descendants (which has garnered its own fair share of accolades), but his latest directorial effort, The Ides of March, was nominated for four Golden Globes, including Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Screenplay. The star-studded cast includes Ryan Gosling (that fourth Golden Globe nom went to him for Best Actor) as an idealistic campaign manager who becomes increasingly jaded by politics, Philip Seymour Hoffman as his wily boss, Paul Giamatti as a competitor trying to woo Gosling away from his candidate, Marisa Tomei as a persistent reporter hungry for a scoop, and, of course, Clooney himself as the seemingly perfect presidential candidate who has a few secrets of his own. With talent like that and a timely story, the film was almost destined to do well, and it indeed managed a Certified Fresh 85% on the Tomatometer. Even if you’re not so much into politics, it’s still an expertly acted, smartly written drama.Courageous 36%Independent Christian dramas have been the subject of some ridicule, primarily because they’re often low budget affairs that wear their messages on their sleeves and feature sometimes questionable acting. According to critics, Courageous manages at least to exhibit competent filmmaking, even if, as with previous films of its kind, it caters a little too heavily to a very specific demographic to be openly enjoyable for all. Set against the backdrop of the drug trade in Georgia, Courageous follows four deputies — all fathers — who are urged by their sheriff to spend more time with their families. When tragedy befalls one of the deputies, all four of them make a formal pact to change their lives and honor God in all that they do. The primary complaint coming from most critics had nothing to do with the message of the film itself; rather, they found Courageous to be a bit melodramatic and heavy-handed, choosing to gloss over complex issues with broad platitudes. If you’re a believer, you may find yourself nodding in approval at the film, but at 35%, don’t expect Courageous to do much more than spoonfeed you what you already know it’s going to say.Abduction 5%Let’s be fair here: some inspirational cinema may be a bit obtuse and unsophisticated, but there are plenty of worse films that don’t preach any particular spiritual message. Case in point: Abduction, which stars Twilight heartthrob Taylor Lautner as Nathan Harper, a teen who, while researching for a school project on missing children, discovers that his true identity has been kept hidden from him all his life. As Nathan uncovers more about his past, he and his friend Karen (Lily Collins) are plunged into the dangerous world of his biological father, a former CIA agent embroiled in an espionage war. Apart from Lautner, who has yet to establish himself as an actor of some range, the cast is surprisingly solid: Alfred Molina, Sigourney Weaver, Jason Isaacs, Maria Bello, and even the original Dragon Tattoo star, Michael Nyqvist are all on board here. We say “surprisingly” because, despite this pedigree, Abduction only managed to eke out a 4% on the Tomatometer, making it one of the worst-reviewed films of the year, with critics calling it soulless and incompetent. Things could have been worse though, and speaking of which…Bucky Larson: Born to Be a Star 3%If you haven’t heard of Bucky Larson: Born to Be a Star, then you are one of three things: 1) only a sporadic reader of RT, 2) extremely fortunate, or 3) both. Considering it only made about $2.5 million in box office receipts and left theaters after two weeks, it’s an understandable oversight. Produced by Adam Sandler’s Happy Madison studio, the film stars comic Nick Swardson as the titular Bucky, a man-child who discovers his uptight parents were once famous porn stars. With this newfound knowledge, Bucky decides to follow in his parents’ footsteps and sets his sights on Hollywood, where his small genitalia make him a popular gimmick. There’s more to the story, but it’s really not worth getting into. At a whopping 0% on the Tomatometer, this aggressively unfunny and severely misguided comedy is the worst-reviewed movie of the year and winner of the Moldy Tomato; do what you will with that information.Dirty Girl 34%Though it may not seem obviously so, coming-of-age films are difficult to pull off, because the balance one must maintain in order to offer just the right amount of sentimentality — without crossing over into schmaltz — is a tricky feat to master. In Dirty Girl, first-time writer/director Abe Sylvia makes things even harder for himself by setting the film in the nostalgic 1980s and promising a subversive edginess in his titular protagonist, a promiscuous high schooler named Danielle (Juno Temple) who embarks on a cross-country road trip with an unlikely partner in crime: a closeted bisexual classmate named Clarke (Jeremy Dozier). According to most critics, unfortunately, Sylvia fails to bring it all together and make it work; they found Dirty Girl tame and uneven, never quite bringing the Dirty and then trying to tie it all up in a sentimental bow that’s wholly unearned. Despite an experienced cast that includes William H. Macy and Mary Steenburgen, Dirty Girl sits at 25% on the Tomatometer.Belle de jour – Criterion Collection 95%Celebrated Spanish-born surrealist director Luis Bunuel made a career out of exploring the various ways in which fantasy and reality intertwine, from his early work like film school staple Un chien andalou all the way up to his final film, That Obscure Object of Desire. 1967’s Belle de jour is one of the better known examples of his aesthetic, featuring a smoldering Catherine Deneuve in one of her most iconic roles. Here, Deneuve plays Severine, a wealthy Parisian housewife who, bored of her sexless marriage, entertains lurid fantasies and ultimately begins to visit and offer her services at a nearby brothel under the titular pseudonym. When she becomes involved with a gangster named Marcel (Pierre Clementi) and attempts to quit the brothel, jealousies lead to an explosive confrontation with rather ambiguous results; fusing daydreams with reality throughout the film, Bunuel leaves the end open for interpretation. This week, Criterion releases their brand new edition of Belle de jour, which comes packed with extras like a video examination of sexual politics, a new interview with screenwriter Jean-Claude Carriere, and an excerpt from a television interview with Carriere and Deneuve.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"french, cults, Year, 20th, drama, ABC, on, book, Sony, visit, Swim, awards, impossible","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"rt-on-dvd-and-blu-ray-the-ides-of-march-has-arrived"},{"id":"47613073843602","title":"Kevin Feige’s Oral History of the Marvel Cinematic Universe","content":"Oral Historiesvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Kevin Feige's Oral History of the Marvel Cinematic UniverseOn the eve of Infinity War, the Marvel Studios president reflects on the ups, downs, and twists in each phase of the MCU.by Joel Meares | April 23, 2018 |  CommentsPhase One: 2008-2012Iron Man (94%) |&nbsp;The Incredible Hulk&nbsp;(67%) |&nbsp;Iron Man 2&nbsp;(73%) |&nbsp;Thor&nbsp;(77%) |&nbsp;Captain America: The First Avenger&nbsp;(79%)&nbsp;|&nbsp;Marvel’s The Avengers&nbsp;(92%)Jon Favreau and Robert Downey Jr. were not obvious pegs on which to hang a superhero movie — or the fortunes of a studio. Favreau’s biggest hit was a Christmas flick, which still had some time to go before becoming a classic, and Robert Downey Jr. was an acclaimed actor, but at that stage far from the world’s biggest star. But Marvel Studios and studio president Kevin Feige were determined to pick the best talent over marquee names. “It was liberating to make decisions like that, that I don’t know would have been made at other studios at the time,” Feige told Rotten Tomatoes when he sat down to talk about 10 years of the MCU. The decision paid off —&nbsp;Iron Man was beloved by critics (94% on the Tomatometer) and audiences alike (the film has an Audience Score of 91%).Not all of Phase One’s films fared as well: The Incredible Hulk, Louis Leterrier’s reboot of the character, starring Edward Norton, was a sturdy effort, and is Fresh on the Tomatometer at 67%, but failed to set the world on fire — or launch a trilogy, as all other Phase One movies did. Mostly, however, critics and audiences rapturously embraced the assembling Avengers that Marvel Studios unleashed on multiplexes. Joss Whedon’s Avengers then took things next level with a 92% — a score that wouldn’t be matched again until Spider-Man: Homecoming. The secret sauce, Feige says, was there in the very first MCU effort. “What Jon brought to the process and what Robert brought to the process, as we were making Iron Man, laid the foundations —&nbsp;not only with the narrative and the story for where we’ve gone, now, almost 19 films with Infinity War —&nbsp;but also the tonality of our films and behind the scenes, the way we made the films.”What follows is a history of the MCU, and reflection upon it, drawn form a sit-down interview between Feige and Rotten Tomatoes.&nbsp;PHASE ONE | PHASE TWO&nbsp;| PHASE THREE“If we were to fail, at least we would have failed with the best intentions.”&nbsp;“I had been involved and Marvel had been involved at certain levels on other films before Iron Man, but always as a partner, never as the lead decision maker. The other studios spent the money to make the films&nbsp;– they had control of the films. When we got the chance to do it ourselves, there was a lot of pressure involved, because it was all on us. But I was very comfortable with that because: If we were to fail, at least we would have failed with the best intentions. And,&nbsp;Iron Man being our first film, we really believed in Tony Stark, we really believed in having a character that was as interesting, if not more interesting, outside of the costume as he was in the costume.”Robert Downey Jr. and Director Jon Favreau on the set of 2008’s Iron Man (Photo by ©Paramount/Courtesy Everett Collection)“Let’s just cast the best actor we can find.”“Deciding that Marvel Studios’ Iron Man will be the marquee name allowed us to say, ‘Let’s just cast the best actor we can find.’ And it’s funny to remember now, [when] Robert Downey Jr. is one of the biggest stars on the planet. What he was then was one of the best actors on the planet – [if not] necessarily one of the biggest marquee stars on the planet. It was liberating to make decisions like that, that I don’t know would have been made at other studios at the time.”“On those early Iron Man screenings, it was apparent that audiences loved Tony Stark, that audiences loved the redemption arc that Tony was undergoing in that movie.”“We do what we call friends-and-family screenings on all of our films, made up of neither friends nor family, but made up of people that we trust to tell us the truth and not tell anyone else about the horrifically rough version of the movie that we’re showing them at that point. On those early Iron Man screenings it was apparent that audiences loved Tony Stark, that audiences loved the redemption arc that Tony was undergoing in that movie. It was after those screenings… some of the executives at the studio at that time started making very big predictions for the opening weekend.”Edward Norton in 2008’s The Incredible Hulk. (Photo by ©Universal/courtesy Everett Collection)“Hulk is a great character –&nbsp;who I do think can have standalone movies, and who I think would be great in his own standalone movies.”“With The Incredible Hulk, we were trying to bring a Bruce Banner and a Hulk into the beginnings of the MCU, the beginnings of our cinematic universe. The thing about Hulk, and we realized this early on as we started working on The Avengers, is that he is a great character —&nbsp;who I do think can have standalone movies, and who I think would be great in his own standalone movies.&nbsp;There’s a wish fulfilment to Hulk that even the worst of us can be used for good – that, I think, is why that character has endured for as many years as it has. But there was also something fun that had never been explored on screen before, in either of the two movies or in his television series, [something] which had only been explored in the comics: Which was [what he is like] when he is part of an ensemble, when he is this unpredictable part of this ensemble.”Hayley Atwell as Agent Carter in Captain America: The First Avenger (2011). (Photo by Jay Maidment/©Paramount Pictures/courtesy Everett Collection)“Agent Carter is unbelievably capable at a time when it was very difficult to rise up the ranks in the military. We really wanted to create these female characters that were as strong and as capable as the heroes.”&nbsp;“From the beginning of my career, the notion of the damsel in distress was outdated, and when we started to make our own movies, we didn’t want to fall into that trope –&nbsp;we wanted to avoid it as much as possible. With Agent Carter, she is unbelievably capable at a time when it was very difficult to rise up the ranks in the military. We really wanted to create these female characters that were as strong and as capable as the heroes. Now, as we’ve continued to grow, that’s gotten even more apparent, to the point where they are the heroes. Literally right this second, Brie Larson is on the set of Captain Marvel in the first few weeks of photography; Evangeline Lilly has finished her role as The Wasp in Ant-man and the Wasp – and it will only grow from there. What Ryan Coogler did with Okoye, Nakia, and Shuri in Black Panther…&nbsp;they’re already iconic characters, and people are already asking, ‘When are they getting their movies? When are we getting the Shuri movie?’ The answer is: Nobody wants to see that more than me. And that’s a testament to that film and to those actresses. And to the world being ready, and overdue, to see these types of characters on the screen.”Director Joss Whedon and Scarlett Johansson on set of The Avengers. (Photo by Zade Rosenthal, © Walt Disney/courtesy Everett Collection)“The big danger with the first Avengers was just getting overwhelmed with action. So many superheroes, so much spectacle, so many special effects.”“Early on, we realized that the role of the filmmaker on our films is to bring a unique tonality and be able to maintain and ride that tone over the course of production and through post-production. We have amazing artists and technicians who can help with the scale, that can help with as big a canvas as it is. &nbsp;What the filmmakers need to do is not get lost in all of that and to focus on the great character work. The big danger of the first Avengers was just getting overwhelmed with action. So many superheroes, so much spectacle, so many special effects. The most interesting thing about the Avengers is: Why in the world are all these people in the same room together –&nbsp;and what would they do when they were in the same room together? Joss Whedon was an amazing writer, and had done amazing things that showed that character would not get lost amongst the spectacle. And, he of course exceeded all of our wildest expectations – twice.”PHASE 1 |&nbsp;PHASE 2&nbsp;|&nbsp;PHASE 3","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"Disney, Movies, children's, Family, TBS, Arts, Network, Review","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"kevin-feiges-oral-history-of-the-marvel-cinematic-universe"},{"id":"47613079268757","title":"Ebert & Roeper: \"V For Vendetta\" Dark, Thoughtful, And That’s Good","content":"var mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Ebert &amp; Roeper: \"V For Vendetta\" Dark, Thoughtful, And That's Goodby RT Staff | March 13, 2006 |  CommentsOn their weekly syndicated show \"Ebert &amp; Roeper,\" Roger Ebert and Richard Roeper gave early reviews of \"V For Vendetta\" — and gave the comic adaptation two thumbs up.Ebert enjoyed the revolutionary superhero tale of a lone freedom fighter in a fascist future Britain, despite not being able to draw specific analogies between the film’s political message and any corresponding situations in the real world: \"The strange thing is I kept feeling it was a sharply pointed political parable but I couldn’t get the parallel going.\" Despite this apparent ambiguity, Ebert said \"it does make incoherence really entertaining.\"Equally impressed, Roeper commended the overall performances of Hugo Weaving and Natalie Portman — \"she kind of wrestled with her English accent here and there, but it’s a nice performance\" — and dismissed the controversy that \"Vendetta\" glorifies terrorism, noting that anarchist hero V is labeled a terrorist \"by someone who’s essentially Hitler, a dictator.\"Both Ebert and Roeper drew the quite obvious thematic parallels to \"Phantom of the Opera\" (V’s masked mentor), \"1984\" (with John Hurt as Big Brother), and even \"Beauty and the Beast\" (guess which is which). Both critics were also quite taken with the film.Ebert celebrated the growing maturity of comic book adaptations, which \"are getting more thoughtful and challenging in their stories and after \"Batman Begins\" and \"Spiderman 2\", \"V For Vendetta\" is one of the most intriguing so far.\"Roeper agreed: \"There are some great brilliant action scenes but this is more thoughtful, darker, and more in the vein of \"Batman Begins.\" And that’s a very good thing.\"For Ebert &amp; Roeper’s complete audio review, visit their official site.\"V For Vendetta\" comes out this Friday, March 17.

Why is this interesting? Because Hot Fuzz is the geek-droolingly anticipated follow-up flick from the boys who treated us to Shaun of the Dead.Continuing the company’s expansion of its feature slate, Rogue Pictures will domestically distribute Working Title Films’ contemporary action comedy Hot Fuzz, which began production last month. Rogue Pictures president of production Andrew Rona made the announcement today.A Working Title production in association with Big Talk Productions, Hot Fuzz marks the eagerly anticipated second feature from the co-creators of 2004’s award-winning sleeper hit Shaun of the Dead, the romantic zombie comedy (\"rom zom com\") which was also made by Working Title and Big Talk and released by Rogue domestically. As on the earlier movie, Simon Pegg and Edgar Wright have written the original screenplay, with Wright directing and Pegg and Nick Frost starring. Also as on the earlier movie, Natascha Wharton is executive-producing. Hot Fuzz is produced by Nira Park (Shaun of the Dead) and Working Title co-chairs Tim Bevan and Eric Fellner.Pegg and Frost are joined in Hot Fuzz by a stellar U.K. cast, including Jim Broadbent (Academy Award winner for Iris), Paddy Considine (In America), Steve Coogan (Tristram Shandy: A Cock and Bull Story), Timothy Dalton (The Living Daylights), Paul Freeman (Raiders of the Lost Ark), Anne Reid (The Mother), Billie Whitelaw (Twisted Nerve), Stuart Wilson (The Mask of Zorro), and Edward Woodward (The Equalizer); and Shaun of the Dead alumni Martin Freeman and Bill Nighy.Pegg stars in the film as London’s top cop, police officer Nicholas Angel. This tough law enforcer is good at his job – so good, in fact, that he makes his colleagues look bad. As a result, his superiors \"promote\" him to the village of Sandford, where all is garden parties and neighborhood watch meetings. Partnered with Danny Butterman (Frost), an oafish but well-meaning young local cop, Angel struggles to adapt. But he just can’t… until a series of grisly \"accidents\" indicates that foul play is afoot. Suddenly, this seemingly idyllic town is a case that Angel has to crack – hard.Rona commented, \"’Shaun of the Dead‘ was the very first Rogue Pictures release, so it’s especially gratifying to reteam with Edgar, Simon, Nick, Nira, and our friends at Working Title.\"Park added, \"We’re delighted to once again be joining creative forces with Rogue Pictures and Working Title on what’s going to be a very exciting and very funny film. With ‘Hot Fuzz,’ we’re going to give the police action genre the same treatment we gave the living dead!\"Production on Hot Fuzz, which is being shot on locations in North London and Wells, commenced in mid-March and is slated to finish in early June.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"Tour, Black","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"rogue-shows-some-fuzz-love"},{"id":"47613075298707","title":"Kid Stars Sign Up for \"Spiderwick\"","content":"var mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Kid Stars Sign Up for \"Spiderwick\"by Scott Weinberg | July 24, 2006 |  CommentsYoung actors Freddie Highmore (\"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\") and Sarah Bolger (\"In America\") have signed to star in Paramount’s big-screen rendition of \"The Spiderwick Chronicles,\" which is based on the very popular series by Holly Black and Tony DiTerlizzi.From The Hollywood Reporter: \"Mark Waters (\"Mean Girls\") will direct the film from a screenplay by John Sayles (\"Limbo\")… In the movie, the three Grace children move to the ancient Spiderwick mansion, where they discover Brownie, an enchanted creature who introduces them to a world of goblins, fairies and sprites.\"Production gets underway in September.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"Trailer","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"kid-stars-sign-up-for-spiderwick"},{"id":"47613070101904","title":"“Rotten Tomatoes Is Wrong” About… The Harry Potter Movies","content":"RT Podcastvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})\"Rotten Tomatoes Is Wrong\" About...

Is it truly the most magical entry in the series though? In this ep, we tackle RT's ranking of the Harry Potter franchise.by RT Staff | November 19, 2020 |  Comments(Photo by © Warner Bros. )Do you like your Harry Potter films light and frothy –&nbsp;like the early years? Or do you prefer your Wizarding World all broody and dark –&nbsp;like the later years? Perhaps your Potterverse sweet spot is in the middle films, like Goblet of Fire, which expertly blend both, capturing Harry, Hermione, and Ron at a time when they’re still innocent enough to be awed by the magic around them, and when He Who Must Not Be Named is moving from&nbsp;lingering threat to fully formed strange-nosed wand-swinger.Whichever way you lean Potter-wise, you’re likely to have some strong thoughts about our ranking of the Harry Potter films.Our list orders the movies&nbsp;by their Tomatometer score, which reflects the percentage of critics that gave the films a thumbs up.

Final film Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 2 comes in at number one with a whopping 96%, with fan fave Prisoner of Azkaban close behind on 90%; in last place is Deathly Hallows – Part 1, which suffered – according to critics –&nbsp;from an inevitable feeling of being unfinished.In the latest episode of our new podcast, Rotten Tomatoes Is Wrong (A Podcast from Rotten Tomatoes), we’re going big.

The Square, Nash Edgerton’s directorial feature debut, however, takes that unlikely location and weaves a twisted, compelling and darkly ironic tale.Raymond Yale (David Roberts) is in a loveless marriage. He’s also having a passionate affair with Carla Smith (Claire van der Boom) who, in turn, is married to gruff, angry crim Greg (a stand out performance from Anthony Hayes).Things start to heat up when Carla finds a bag of money from Greg’s latest crime. This is her chance to escape her controlling husband and flee with Raymond. A simple plan that soon careens out of control… but we won’t spoil it. This is a film best seen with as few expectations as possible.Nash Edgerton – deftly directs the script written by brother Joel Edgerton – who also appears in the film as pyromaniac Billy – and Matthew Dabner, who previously did script duties with Alex (The Crow; I, Robot) Proyas.Nash Edgerton started in the industry doing stunt work; a lot of stunt work.How did you get into the stunt game, Nash?NE: I never really considered it as a career at first. I used to always do things like jump off the roof. I was just out of school, doing an electrical engineering degree at uni and I just wasn’t feeling it.So you just up and started stunting?NE: Actually I was at a school formal and some guy said ‘stunt’ or was talking about stunts and the idea just sort of stuck in my head.The kind of idea that seems awesome after a couple of beers?NE [laughs]: I got the yellow pages and looked up “stunt”. I found a place that looked good, called them up and that was it.You have a huge collection of stunts to your name, including doubling for your brother, Joel. Is that because he’s a big girl?NE: I reckon Joel’s really capable but wouldn’t do half the things I do, probably because he’s smarter than me. But I’ve happily been his stunt double a number of times. I remember, on a TV show — it was 3am, I was getting hit by a car and he’s all rugged up with a coffee and I thought: ‘there’s something wrong with this picture.’So you just sort of charged right into the stunt caper, what about directing? Did you just decide to swap on a whim?NE: I didn’t swap. I still do stunts. Directing just seemed another challenge. And I know I can’t fall down stairs and get hit by cars forever. You get to a point where you can only be hit by cars and set on fire so many times.We’re going to have to apologise for this question in advance, because no doubt every other journo has asked it – but with you directing and Joel writing – do you see yourselves as Aussie Coen brothers?NE: Oh look, it’s a very flattering comparison. They’ve made a lot more films than we have!And Joel Coen directs, whereas Joel Edgerton writes and acts. It’s a bit of a dodgy comparison, but some points in The Square felt like the Coen’s first feature Blood Simple.NE: Blood Simple is one of my favourite films, and I’d love to work with Joel again. We’re both aiming for the same thing, both of us have the same objective in mind.The tone of the film, or the style, felt very Australian. But it never felt forced. There was no overtly ‘ocker’ stereotypes on display. Was that something you did deliberately?NE: There was a definite attempt to keep things realistic. I find the more realistic it feels the more chances of humour there are. Humour that comes from the situation and characters, I mean. Also, I think it’s a mistake to try and make an Australian film more Australian. You know: having shots of the Sydney Harbour Bridge or the Opera House for the sake of it. I’m an Australian and I’m shooting in Australia with other Australians. It’s going to be an Australian film – you don’t have to try!There was some nice linguistic quirks. ‘Good on ya’ was used several times to mean ‘shut up’ and ‘well done’.NE: It felt right to use some classic Australian terms but at the same time the story was universal. One of the uniquely Australian things we did have was Santa Claus rocking up on a boat for the kiddies.And the parents sitting back, chatting away, drinking beers because Christmas in Australia is bloody hot!NE: That’s right. You don’t see that in a lot of Aussie movies. But those moments aside, this is a story that could happen anywhere.Where’d the idea for film come from?NE: The idea came from Joel. He likes to read the weird, little stories in newspapers, the ones that have no information other than what happened. He found one where some people were digging up the foundation of a house and found the skeleton of a baby.Yikes.NE: Yeah, but there was no detail about why it was there, nor any chain of events that lead up to that. So we speculated on a story like that, starting with the end and going backwards. We also wanted to have someone commit murder but try to make the audience understand why they did it. And even feel sympathy for them. We wanted to show the results of their actions and them reaching a point of no return.That’s the beauty of The Square: everyone is doomed. But you don’t know how they’re doomed. It had a lovely random confluence of events interacting with people’s plans, a nicely nihilistic quality.NE: We also wanted the characters to have layers. Like, it would have been easy to have Greg be a wife basher or Ray’s wife be a total nag – but that would let them off the hook. It can’t be that black or white. If you make anyone completely bad or completely good you take away any sense of realism. Everyone has moments of both.There’s a scene that we won’t reveal the substance of, other than to call it the ‘dog scene’ – that seemed to be symbolic of the whole film.NE: Yeah, that was our way of saying, ‘just when you think things can’t get any worse… they do!’ Also, it’s a scene you’d never guess the end of. I love taking the story to places people don’t expect.Are you going to direct again?NE: If they let me!Directing a film does seems like an insane amount of hard work.NE: Oh mate, a couple of weeks in and I thought ‘I’m never directing again!’ but towards the end I was dying to direct something else – while all the lessons and tricks I’d learnt on set were fresh in my mind. But it’s really hard work. It’s a marathon.Do you have the next one lined up?NE: Yeah I’ve got another idea – it’s in my head and on scraps of paper at the moment. This last month or so it’s became clear what I want to do next.Same genre or something completely different?NE: Something different. More like my shorts like Spider. More twisted black humour. A lot of people have told me The Square is pretty twisted but I want to go further, do more.The Square opens in Australian cinemas on Thursday.

So when we had the chance to sit down with director Park Chan-wook, we leapt at it. The South Korean director doesn’t speak English, and our Korean isn’t all that hot, so we chatted with the help of a translator who’s worked with him for years. Read on as we talk about Thirst, his Cannes experience, the state of Korean cinema and Hollywood producers’ tendency to remake anything they can get their hands on.[tomatometer]MuzeID=1213120[/tomatometer]I hear Thirst has been quite long in the making.Park Chan-wook: Well, although I say that this has been a film 10 years in the making, I’ve not necessarily spent all those 10 years making the film of course! At the beginning I didn’t think of it as something very serious, I didn’t give it that much of a thought. One night I thought of the idea of a vampire film and wrote it down on a couple of bits of paper.The idea that I had at the time was of a priest who was also a medical doctor. He started as a priest, who went on to study medicine, and so has a licence to practice as a medical practitioner. So as a priest/doctor, he volunteers to participate in this biological experiment in order to help save humanity, but despite his good intentions he becomes a vampire.That was the idea written down back then, but everything in the middle was a big blank. Somehow he would fall in love with a woman, after she realises he’s a vampire and thinks he’s a monster, he ends up taking her life, but turns her into a vampire. So these two ideas were written down way back then, and afterwards I was constantly struggling with how to fill out the rest of the story, but I went on to other more pressing films that I had been working on in that time.What was it that fascinated you about the idea of a priest who becomes a vampire?PC: It’s because of the differences between the characters. Here is one identity which, by its very existence, can be looked at as evil: A vampire, who takes other peoples’ blood in order to survive. On the other hand is this priest, which by the very meaning of the vocation is a vocation where you devote your life to others, living your life in service of others. Between these two identities, there is a huge ethical gap; a huge moral chasm. You have the moral height of being this noble priest, and the moral downfall to where you become a vampire, taking others blood. It’s such a height to make such a fall. And on the way down there are bigger scares and more thrills that you have to go to, that there is a bigger sense of vertigo that you feel.Did you struggle with the conflict, taking the character too far one way or the other?PC: They are actually inseparable, the identity of a priest and the identity of a vampire, so I didn’t have any concern about which extreme to take this character at all, because they had to co-exist. He is a priest who is forced to live on as a vampire despite his faith. This conflict, the suffering, and the pain that he goes through; this struggle is the main point of this film so the two need to go hand in hand.Let’s say I’m shooting a sequence about Beethoven, on the first performance of his ninth symphony, and when the concert finishes, and there is a roar of applause from the audience, but he can’t hear and he’s facing away from the audience, so one of the orchestra members has to turn him around to face the audience and take his bow. If I was to shoot this sequence, would you ask whether this was about the man with a hearing problem, or about a great composer? These two matters go hand in hand. If it hadn’t been about the man having a hearing disability, would we even shoot the sequence?Still from Thirst.In casting the female character Tae-joo, what considerations do you have to make about how she’ll play off Song Kang-ho?PC: Complexity, instability, and somebody who can cover all the different stages that this character has to go through, from almost child-like innocence to a downtrodden housewife who is burdened with all these chores and having to deal with everyday life situations. In this film, it almost feels as if her clock is running in reverse. She starts off as a downtrodden housewife, and then she turns into a young woman in love, and then when she becomes a vampire, there is this dialogue saying, “Happy birthday,” and this is where she is turned into almost a child, a baby.So I needed somebody who could handle all the performances for all these different states of the character, and could deal with all these different ages that this character goes through, so she needed the right appearance for that as well as the acting chops required.Oh, and lastly, sex appeal.Did you see all that immediately in Kim Ok-bin?PC: Yes. Even within five minutes of first seeing her, she exuded all those qualities that I needed, and I saw just how energetic she was.You’ve directed some quite disparate films. Are there any constants for you, as a director, which you feel apply to your body of work as a whole?PC: Yes, I feel there are constants throughout by body of work. Dealing with absurdity and dealing with surrealistic expressions.Continue on to page two as the director expands on his surrealism, updates on Korean cinema and discusses Hollywood remakes.[tomatometer]MuzeID=1213120[/tomatometer]Do you look to achieve surrealism through your visuals?Park Chan-wook: Not necessarily. Of course there are elements in my approach to surrealism, and perhaps the visual aspect of it is the most important, but I think it’s the situation itself which provides a surreal element to my film.Vampirism is a subject that has been covered in great length in cinema, books, music even, what did you want to bring to the mythology?PC: In this film, the biggest element is the moral downfall of the central character and the suffering that he goes through. So compared with other vampire works, it probably lacks the romanticism. In order to bring the moral aspects of the story to the fore, you need to remain very cold and approach it in a very realistic way, and that’s what sets it apart from other vampire films. Even if it’s not a vampire film, in a contemporary film, if the film is emphasising the moral aspects of the story, you may find that it’s old-fashioned. But somehow the moral emphasis and aspects make my films feel fresher.Do you have a fascination with the genre? What are your favourite films in this genre?PC: Nosferatu is my favourite vampire film out of all the classic films and even the modern ones too, with Herzog‘s remake. I’ve always had an interest in vampire films, not just Nosferatu, but there are many others that I have enjoyed; Abel Ferrara, Coppola, Neil Jordan.What does it mean to you to be premiering at Cannes?PC: It’s a festival which can cause headaches, and which can be very picky and quite cumbersome, but after a week’s schedule, going through all this pain, its also a festival where in that 10 minutes after your screening, it can make you forget about everything that you had been going through before, just with the reaction of the audience after your screening, where they express their supreme respect for the filmmaker.Still from Thirst.Do you find that the European audiences react differently to your films than the Korean audiences do?PC: I do, but overall it’s not fundamentally that different. Even in Korea itself, depending on which screen it was shown at, which theatre you go to, which screen time you choose, there are different people in the audiences and so the reaction is always different. So can you say that there is a range of difference found in domestic audiences when compared with the international audience? It’s hard to say.Do you think there is a bigger, more receptive, audience for Korean cinema outside of the country nowadays?PC: Yes there is. Korean films have been introduced to the Western and overseas audiences constantly in the past few years, so I find that they are increasing in popularity more and more. Whereas, up ’til now, Western audiences had found Korean films through DVD releases or festivals or even illegal internet downloads, now I think the time is right for the audiences to see these Korean films through commercial distribution at a cinema where the audience could see any film.Is there more money in the Korean film industry because those international channels are widening?PC: I don’t think that we’ve reached a level where we can say that, but certainly there are incremental changes; for instance, with Thirst, Universal came on board as an investor. But not just with this film, there are more and more remake rights being sold and exported into other territories outside of Korea. It’s not so much that you can say that there is an exponential growth of the money coming in.There are a lot of international directors going to Hollywood to make films, is that something that’s ever appealed to you, maybe even remake one of your own films?PC: When it comes to remaking my own films in the English language, I can only imagine that it is a very boring process, I wouldn’t ever dream of it. But much in the way that I have my radar on for a good script in Korea, if there is a good script coming my way from the US, of course I would go shoot a film there. Not just the US, but anywhere in the world.Can you tell us about your next project?PC: There isn’t a next film confirmed at the moment unfortunately. At the moment, all I can think about is taking some rest. If I was to start on the next film, I’d hope to do something closer to everyday life.Thirst is out in the US on Friday. It arrives in UK cinemas on 16th October.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"Comic-Con, One, Polls, nightmare, nfl, your, zero, zombies, language","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"director-park-chanwook-talks-thirst-rt-interview"},{"id":"47613134223781","title":"RT on DVD & Blu-Ray: Buried and Animal Kingdom","content":"RT on DVDvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})RT on DVD &amp; Blu-Ray: Buried and Animal KingdomPlus, a couple of Sam Fuller classics, and the re-teaming of Robert De Niro and Edward Norton.by Alex Vo | January 18, 2011 |  CommentsThis week, we’ve got a wide variety of choices, mostly fresh from the theaters. First up, we’ve got the winner of the AU Golden Tomato award, a slick little crime thriller that should please most. Then we’ve also got a highly rated thriller starring Ryan Reynolds, a heist flick with a big cast, a prison showdown between Edward Norton and Robert De Niro, another “is it real or fake” mockumentary about a teen losing his virginity, Philip Seymour Hoffman’s directorial debut, and a documentary omnibus film based on a popular nonfiction book. Then, to top it all off, we’ve got brand spanking new Criterion Collection editions for a couple of classics by Samuel Fuller. So dig in and see if anything tickles your fancy.[tomatometer]MovieId=770818882[/tomatometer]Animal KingdomIf you’re a regular visitor to RT, then you’re possibly already aware of this small Australian film that captured the attention of critics all over the world. One of the ten best-reviewed limited release films of 2010, as well as the top film from Australia, Animal Kingdom is a crime drama that paints a portrait of Melbourne’s seedy underbelly. The story focuses on Joshua “J” Cody (James Frecheville), young nephew in the Cody crime family, and his initiation into the “family business.” J becomes the subject of investigation by a police officer named Nathan Leckie (Guy Pearce), who attempts to lure J against his family. Critics felt that the cast all performed superbly, and with a well-written script and a steady, kinetic pace, the Certified Fresh Animal Kingdom (96% on the Tomatometer) proves that Australia’s cinema is not to be ignored. If you’re into gritty crime dramas, this is definitely worth checking out.[tomatometer]MovieId=770819772[/tomatometer]Buried2010 saw the release of a handful of one-location thrillers, like Devil (an elevator) and Frozen (a stalled ski lift), but possibly the best-reviewed one of them all was a little-seen indie thriller that took place primarily inside a coffin. Ryan Reynolds stars as a man who wakes up to find himself buried alive with nothing to help his situation but a lighter and a cell phone. With air dwindling, he must quickly figure out why he’s been buried and who did it. Films like this depend heavily on the acting chops of their stars, and critics say that Reynolds holds the movie together terrifically, helping to create a gripping drama from a premise that could easily have lost its novelty quickly. At 85% on the Tomatometer, Buried is Certified Fresh, so don’t let its minimalist setting fool you; this is a thriller worth checking out.[tomatometer]MovieId=770803979[/tomatometer]TakersIt’s difficult these days to make a heist movie stand out from its predecessors, being that so many plot twists and turns have been explored in the genre. Unfortunately, despite featuring a cast that includes everyone from Matt Dillon, Zoe Saldana, and Idris Elba to recording artists Chris Brown and T.I., Takers ultimately falls prey to conventional heist movie clichés and poor characterization, leaving little for the viewer to indulge in aside from a few explosive set pieces. Dillon and Jay Hernandez play detectives Jack Welles and Eddie Hatcher, who are hot on the trail of a gang of organized bank robbers led by Gordon Crozier (Elba). When an old crewmate (T.I.) thought to be in prison is released, he talks the gang into one more heist, and plenty of double crosses ensue. Takers only rang true to the critics to the tune of a 29% Tomatometer, but the other constant with heist movies is that, even if they are derivative, they’re usually still a bit fun to watch, so you might save this one for a rainy night.[tomatometer]MovieId=770871631[/tomatometer]StoneThe prospect of seeing Edward Norton and Robert De Niro square off with each other just doesn’t have the appeal that it did a decade ago. Back then, De Niro was coming off of performances in Casino, Heat, and Ronin, and Norton was hitting his stride in films like Rounders, American History X, Fight Club. So it wasn’t a surprise when 2001’s The Score, featuring both actors, was a hit. Fast forward to 2010, when Stone saw De Niro as a retiring correctional officer named Jack Mabry who takes one last case, namely that of Gerald “Stone” Creeson (Norton). In an effort to secure an early parole, Stone manipulates Mabry with mind games and instructs his own wife, Lucetta (Milla Jovovich), to seduce Mabry as part of the deal. Critics are largely split on Stone, but most agree that its premise is a tad farfetched and, despite a solid cast, veers wildly into strange territory. Not exactly a crowdpleaser, but if you’re a fan of either actor, you may still enjoy it.[tomatometer]MovieId=770767771[/tomatometer]FreakonomicsIn 2005, a non-fiction book took the country by storm, examining several sociological phenomena from the perspective of economics, or, as pointed out by authors Steven Levitt and Stephen J. Dubner, the study of incentives. Four years and four million copies later, a number of critically acclaimed documentary filmmakers, from Alex Gibney (Enron: The Smartest Guys in the Room) to Morgan Spurlock (Supersize Me) to Seth Gordon (King of Kong), were brought together to illustrate on film the principles featured in the book. While the results were both thought provoking and often humorous, critics felt that viewers might be better served by reading the book, which offered the same sorts of stories, but with greater insight and more detail. Nevertheless, the film still earned a decent 66% Tomatometer, so for those who just want the crash course, this should do just fine.[tomatometer]MovieId=771204351[/tomatometer]The Virginity HitDirectors Huck Botko and Andrew Gurland succeeded in writing one documentary-style film last year, The Last Exorcism, and that one did pretty well for itself, both critically and commercially. This wasn’t the case, unfortunately, for the film the duo directed, namely The Virginity Hit, the chronicle of one teenager’s quest to lose his virginity, as told via handheld home video cameras and cell phones. Though it’s unclear how much of the story was staged for the production, and how much of it was genuine (much like another similar film, Catfish), Matt (the teen in question) and his buddies occupy the screen like real life versions of characters from a Judd Apatow movie. Unfortunately, critics were not impressed by what they saw, calling the film shallow, uninteresting, and crass, despite a few funny moments. Maybe worth a look for the supremely curious, but probably not something that’s got widespread appeal.[tomatometer]MovieId=770814193[/tomatometer]Jack Goes BoatingPhilip Seymour Hoffman has had his share of success in front of the camera, and he’s also an accomplished theater director, so the next natural step for him was to direct a film, and that brings us to Jack Goes Boating, Hoffman’s directorial debut and a film adaptation of a play of the same name. Hoffman plays the titular Jack, a limo driver with a penchant for Reggae music, who’s introduced to Connie (Amy Ryan) through Jack’s friend Clyde (John Ortiz) and his wife Lucy (Daphne Rubin-Vega). As Jack and Connie grow closer, Clyde and Lucy simultaneously begin falling apart, and both couples must learn how to come to terms with these new developments. Hoffman played Jack in the original stage production, and the script for Jack Goes Boating was adapted by the writer of the original play, so there is some authenticity to the picture, and critics appreciated the honest characterization, giving the film a respectable 67% Tomatometer score. There is a little bit lost in translation from stage to screen, but it’s a well-acted romantic dramedy that should be perfect for some.[tomatometer]MovieId=20272[/tomatometer]Shock Corridor and The Naked Kiss – Criterion CollectionSamuel Fuller has never been a stranger to controversy, the most well-known case of which probably revolves around the production of his anti-racism themed 1981 film White Dog, which, ironically, was suppressed by Paramount Pictures for fear that the film would mistakenly be considered racist. But even as far back as the 1960s, Fuller was making excellent films about unpopular subjects, and two of them get the refreshed Criterion Collection treatment this week: 1963’s Shock Corridor and 1964’s The Naked Kiss. The former centers on a journalist who checks himself into a mental hospital in order to investigate a murder, but ends up slowly going insane himself; the latter is a satire of suburbia that sees a prostitute moving to a prim new town to start her life over, only to discover that it harbors its own dirty little secrets. Both films are offered in DVD and Blu-Ray formats, with Criterion’s typically outstanding special features, including archived TV interviews, a documentary on Fuller himself, and illustrations and essays.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"YA, MSNBC, Returns, Tour, ID, scary, Movies, vampires, Emmys","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"RT-on-DVD-and-Blu-Ray-Buried-and-Animal-Kingdom"},{"id":"47613123169695","title":"Cannes 2009: Sidebar Awards Round-up","content":"var mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Cannes 2009: Sidebar Awards Round-upFIPRESCI, Critics’ Week and Un Certain Regard award their prizes.by Joe Utichi | May 24, 2009 |  CommentsIt’s the final day of the Cannes Film Festival today, and following yesterday’s announcement of the Director’s Fortnight awards, now we have word from Critics Week and FIPRESCI ahead of tonight’s official competition ceremony. Meanwhile, the festival’s official sidebar, Un Certain Regard (UCR), has also announced its results.UCR, which presented 20 films from 20 different countries, has given its top prize to Greek repression drama Kynodontas (Dogtooth). Directed by Yorgos Lanthimos, it’s a tale of three teenage children who are completely cut off from the outside world by their parents.This year’s selection featured works by named auteurs like Bong Joon-ho and Hirokazu Kore-eda who went home empty-handed. Precious, directed by Lee Daniels and starring Mariah Carey, Lenny Kravitz and Mo’Nique, also failed to scoop an award, despite tremendous praise for its handling of its subject matter and performances.Un Certain RegardUN CERTAIN REGARD PRIZEDogtooth – Yorgos LanthimosUN CERTAIN REGARD JURY PRIZEPolice, Adjective – Corneliu PorumboiuSPECIAL PRIZE UN CERTAIN REGARD 2009No One Knows About The Persian Cats – Bahman GhobadiFather of My Children – Mia Hansen-LoveCritics’ WeekCRITICS’ WEEK GRAND PRIXGoodbye Gary – Nassim AmaoucheSACD PRIZELost Persons Area – Caroline StrubbeCID/CCAS CASH PRIZEWhisper With the Wind – Shahram AlidiOfaj/TV5 MONDE (VERY) YOUNG CRITIC AWARDWhisper With the WindREGARDS JEUNES PRIZEWhisper With the WindCANAL PLUS GRAND PRIX (SHORT)Seeds of the Fall – Patrick EklundKODAK SHORT FILM DISCOVERY PRIZELogorama – Francois Alaux, Herve de Crecy, Ludovic HouplainFIPRESCIThe FIPRESCI federation of film critics presents one award to a film in the official competition, one to a film in Un Certain Regard and one to a film in either Critics’ Week or Director’s Fortnight.COMPETITIONThe White Ribbon – Michael HanekeUN CERTAIN REGARDPolice, Adjective – Corneliu PorumboiuDIRECTORS’ FORTNIGHT/CRITICS’ WEEKAmreeka – Cherien Dabis","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"emmy, natural","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"cannes-2009-sidebar-awards-roundup"},{"id":"47613130692003","title":"Exclusive: The World of Where the Wild Things Are","content":"var mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Exclusive: The World of Where the Wild Things AreSpike Jonze, Maurice Sendak and more take RT on a journey through the film.by Will Lawrence | December 7, 2009 |  CommentsIt has taken Being John Malkovich and Adaptation director Spike Jonze more than five years to bring Where the Wild Things Are to the big screen. Maurice Sendak, the writer and illustrator of the best-selling children’s book (which has sold upward of 20 million copies), identified Jonze as the only man he trusted enough to render his story on film. That story focuses on Max, the boisterous boy in wolf pyjamas who, when sent to his room for bad behaviour, journeys in his imagination and travels to the realm of the Wild Things, a gaggle of hairy monsters who proclaim him king. The book contains only a few hundred words, and yet Jonze has created a full feature film, as wild as the source and as dark and brooding as any ancient fairy tale. The director joins Maurice Sendak and some of his key collaborators to explain exclusively to RT how they shaped the world of Where the Wild Things Are on the big screen.Maurice Sendak, author and illustrator:When I started working on the book back in 1960, I didn’t really know why I’d written it. I think the inspiration came from a lot of our family’s relatives who used to come from the old country to visit, and they were really unkempt, they didn’t speak English, their teeth were horrifying, their hair all crazy and they’d pick you up and hug you and kiss you and would say ‘Arrghhh, we could eat you up.’ And my brother and sister and I knew that these people really would eat anything, so I decided to render them as Wild Things.Spike Jonze, writer/director:I had gotten to know Maurice about 15 years ago. We worked on a movie that didn’t happen and through that became friends. One day he talked to me about doing Where The Wild Things Are. I was excited by it but also really nervous about it because the book is so short but I didn’t want to add some storyline or some plot. I’d look at it and say, ‘How could you add to this?’ And anything I felt like adding would just sound cheesy. But over the years, as I started thinking more about the book, I suddenly thought that the Wild Things could be wild emotions. Suddenly out of that everything tumbled and it felt like I could build from inside the book.Dave Eggers, co-writer:Spike wanted to make sure that what he remembered feeling through his childhood corresponded with what kids think today. He interviewed lots of kids of Max’s age, and it really confirmed that they all deal with very deep emotions. So with the screenplay, the Wild Things embody those emotions. The film really is about childhood. It’s about what it’s like to be eight or nine years old and trying to figure out the world, the people around you, and emotions that are sometimes unpredictable or confusing.Spike Jonze:We never set any rules about whether it would be a movie for kids or for adults. Maurice Sendak didn’t consider himself a children’s author; he wrote about what it felt like to be a kid. So it was really important that we got the main character right. For Max I wanted a real kid, not necessarily an actor that was going to give a typical ‘movie-kid’ performance. I wanted someone who was going to give a real, emotional performance, and after a very long search I found Max Records. He really is the heart of the movie, and he has such depth to him as a person. It doesn’t feel as though he’s acting at all. It’s such a natural performance.Max Records, actor (Max):One of my favourite scenes is the dirt clod scene, where the Wild Things and Max are chucking all this dirt at each other. I had a scene where I had to run through the forest and it was like a minefield with all these dirt clods exploding everywhere. That was maybe my favourite scene. My favourite moment was sliming Spike. There’s a scene where I get licked by a Wild Thing and covered in all this goo. So I got our revenge by covering Spike with goo, too!Catherine Keener, actor (Max’s Mom):Obviously Max and I didn’t know each other when we arrived on set, and I had to show him that he could trust me. I tried to play quite hard with Max, and encouraged him to really let loose. It’s funny, I have a young son who was on set and he asked me why Spike didn’t live with his mum and dad. I said it was because he was an adult, but that says a lot about Spike.Catherine O’Hara, voice actor (Judith):Spike is very much in touch with the child within. In fact, even more so than the man without! No, seriously, we had a wild time on this movie. We improvised with this wonderful dialogue everyday and had such terrific fun. We’d do a lot of childish things and go really nuts. Which was just what Spike wanted.Spike Jonze:The Wild Things are such a strange invention of Maurice’s and it’s weird to think that at some point they did not exist in the world. For me, since I knew it as a kid I knew thes designs, I knew these characters, and it is as though they always existed in this strange surreal dream-like way. Maurice had tapped into some primal thing when he created them. They are furry and cuddly but giants with teeth and nails, and they’re dangerous. But then they have the proportions. Their heads are half the size of their body so they are baby-like in that way. And they’re hairy. They have really captured something. It is creativity at its best. They are as close as you can get to creating something that really is magic.Forest Whitaker, voice actor (Ira):We didn’t get inside the suits — they had other actors for that — but we did the voices and Spike captured our facial expressions to layer onto the body suits, to get the facial expressions and so forth. Once, he even interviewed us as characters, to build a little back-story for us, so we could get a better handle on who were and how we viewed our universe.Spike Jonze:When we first screened the movie to the studio they were a bit freaked out. They thought it was too scary for kids. But we didn’t make this movie just for kids. This is a movie about childhood; for everyone. Thankfully, though, they learned to love our movie. The kids weren’t scared, it was just the executives that were scared. I think kids are just like us. They see something that’s honest and they are attracted to it. Kids are attracted to things that are funny but I think all of us are also attracted to things that are true.Maurice Sendak:No one could have guessed that when I created the Wild Things they’d have such a hold over people, even today. Lots have people have wanted to make the movie, but I only wanted Spike to make it. He’s crazy and whacked out and wild, but he’s so gifted, creatively and dramatically. I think he’s done a wonderful job bringing my book the screen. I’m so pleased that I pursued him.Where the Wild Things Are is out in the UK this weekend.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"Dates, science, prank, A24, jurassic, actors, TV, Superheroe, Office, Discovery, VH1, Paramount","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"exclusive-the-world-of-where-the-wild-things-are"},{"id":"47613128753570","title":"The Effects of Where the Wild Things Are","content":"var mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})The Effects of Where the Wild Things AreWe go behind the scenes with London's Framestoreby Orlando Parfitt | December 11, 2009 |  CommentsSpike Jonze‘s eagerly-anticipated adaptation of Maurice Sendak‘s Where the Wild Things Are was initially supposed to use entirely practical effects, but the director soon realised he’d need more sophisticated computer trickery to bring the seven ’emotionally complex’ (read: grumpy) Wild Things to life. That’s where London’s Framestore came in, the effects house needing to seamlessly animate all the monsters without compromising Spike Jonze’s naturalistic vision for the project. RT went to visit them this week at their Soho headquarters, where Animation Director Michael Eames and Director of VFX Tim Webber told us how they did it, and shared some exclusive behind-the-scenes shots.Tim Webber, Director of VFX:With Wild Things, I think they started shooting hoping they would be able to make it with these very heavy animatronic masks – mechanisms attached to heads. But Spike realised that it was impractical, and that he couldn’t get anything like the levels of performance that they wanted. So he talked to a few people about the approaches and this seemed the best way of getting what he wanted.This project is a great amalgamation of three different techniques. First of all, the voice actors, they physically acted the scenes, on a set. Tapes were then made of the performances. Spike then used these to rehearse with the suit performers on the set to recreate the actors’ work. Then having got those we came in with the animation, and the results that we managed to get were so much for having those stages done before.Tim Webber, Director of VFX:Framestore got involved pretty late on in the film, considering how long the movie has been in development. We begun work on it for the last out of five years of development. It was terrifying, because it was so much work! The animation technique we used should logically take less time but it isn’t really the case.The process is the ‘re-projection’ technique. You take the thing that’s photographed in camera on set – in this case the creatures – and you effectively warp an image in 2D to create the facial expression, even though its 3D. Then you re-project it back onto what you’ve shot. This — in simple terms — means that because you’re working with real footage the amount of distortion you can create is very limited. So the difficulty was in getting the extremity of emotion in the performances. For example one of the characters — Carol — has a scene where’s he’s crying and is incredibly upset, there’s a limitation to how much facial expression we can animate.Michael Eames, Animation Director:Personally I’ve always thought that the best approach is to do a mix of different kinds of effects – and this movie is a great example of this. The guy in the suit is a practical thing, and we’re doing the face – it’s using each bit for what it’s best at.I’m quite a believer in — even when we’re doing CG — giving it qualities that make it real, rather than creating creatures who don’t obey the laws of physics and can just fly around. With this technology, you can do anything with your camera and your creature, but you don’t want to because then it wouldn’t look real. As soon as you do something that doesn’t feel possible the audience knows it’s computer generated and then becomes uninterested. I think it’s important to stay on the physical borders of what is real.Tim Webber, Director of VFX:It was totally important that the animation we did looked as much like practical effects as possible. That’s what Spike was after, he made it perfectly clear. One of the difficulties for example were the characters of Carol and K.W.; both had very large mouths which is difficult because characters with big mouths look like Muppets. Spike didn’t want that, he wanted humanistic, subtle emotion. Our starting point with them was the eyes – we hoped to distract viewers away from the mouths and focus on the eyes.Michael Eames, Animation Director:The single most unique challenge was the depth and level of the animation that was required. Most visual FX stuff is either creatures, or its cartoony animation, but with this — the intensity of the emotion that Spike was after was unique. He wanted audiences to be able to be able to feel the emotion and on a fairly human and subtle level, however unhuman the characters were. That was the hard bit — to get those thought processes on screen.Michael Eames, Animation Director:Spike would say things like: “That character is sounding quite confident here, but I want you to show in the eyes that they’re not quite as confident as they’re sounding.” There were layers of emotion and feeling going on he wanted to capture. I guess it’s also unusual for animated characters to have the sort of dialogue that the Wild Things have. It’s much more natural, and therefore they absolutely have to have that level of natural animation.He was really great to work with, and that’s not just the standard thing that everyone says in interviews. He was very exacting, he’d worked on this film for 5 years and he really, really knew what he wanted, and so that was quite a difficult target to hit. The thing with Spike is that everything he does is a little bit different, but actually he understood the process really well. It’s also pretty rare to work that closely with directors in visual effects. For a start you’re not normally creating 7 of the lead characters of a movie. This was a bit different in that sense; we needed that close interaction.Where the Wild Things Are is out now.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"Tarantino, all-time, archives, The, anime, critic, transformers, Turner, Elton, TCA, drama, documentaries","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"the-effects-of-where-the-wild-things-are"},{"id":"47613126761889","title":"Everything We Know About Toy Story 4","content":"Everything We Knowvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Everything We Know About Toy Story 4After a long wait, Woody, Buzz, Rex, and the toys are back for another story: See plot details, release dates, new characters, and more.by Whitney Friedlander | November 20, 2018 |  CommentsIn June 2019, Disney’s Pixar will head to infinity and beyond, once again, with the release of Toy Story 4. Although it will be nine years since the last film in the franchise, bringing back the family favorite characters voiced by Tom Hanks, Tim Allen, and others will no doubt result in a box office smash that – if history repeats – will warm even the coldest critic’s heart (all three of the first Toy Story &nbsp;have perfect or near-perfect Tomatometers, and&nbsp;Toy Story 3 was even nominated for the Best Picture Oscar). But surefire revenue and review predictions aside, what do we actually know about the new film? Let’s explore what’s already been&nbsp;revealed.HEY HOWDY HEY! SAY HI TO THE RETURNING CAST MEMBERS(Photo by © Walt Disney Pictures)Hanks and Allen are returning to rekindle the on-again/off-again bromance between their respective cowboy Woody and astronaut Buzz Lightyear, and the fourth Toy Story also welcomes back Joan Cusack as cowgirl Jessie, Wallace Shawn as Rex the dinosaur, John Ratzenberger as Hamm the piggy bank, Annie Potts as Woody’s main squeeze Bo Peep, Estelle Harris as Mrs. Potato Head, and more franchise favorites.Don Rickles, who played Mr. Potato Head in the first three films, passed away in April 2017 before he recorded any work for the new film. However, the character was seen in a teaser video released in November, suggesting that he is a part of the project in some way. A replacement voice actor has yet to be announced – if, in fact, someone is needed and the filmmakers won’t rely on Rickles’ unused dialogue from previous projects – but that hasn’t stopped the fan speculation.NEW CHARACTERS! NEW PLOT?That teaser also introduced a new character: Forky, a spork voiced by Veep’s Tony Hale. Although he started out as kitchenware, Forky’s found new life as a toy, thanks to the meddling hands of the young Bonnie (a.k.a. the little girl who inherited some of the toys from the now college-age Andy at the end of Toy Story 3). Needless to say, Forky’s not handling this life change well – especially when Woody and Buzz make him an unwitting participant in a road trip dedicated to the awesomeness of being a toy.Said adventure may also have something to do with tracking down Potts’ Bo Peep, who was absent from Toy Story 3. However, that plot detail was shared in 2015, and there have been some shifts at Pixar since then (see below for more on that).Another teaser trailer showcased the voices of Keegan-Michael Key and Jordan Peele as carnival toys Ducky and Bunny and who are pretty much plush versions of the&nbsp;valet characters the actors played in their Comedy Central sketch series, Key &amp; Peele. Perhaps Woody and Buzz’s joy ride includes a stop at a fair?During an appearance on NBC’s&nbsp;The Tonight Show, Allen told host Jimmy Fallon that Keanu Reeves also has a tiny part in the film.There’s also a viral fan theory that puts a rather … adult … spin on the definition of which toys are allowed to have stories. There are slim chances any of that will make it into the movie.TOY STORY 4 HAS GONE THROUGH DRAFTS LIKE SID GOES THROUGH MATCHES(Photo by @ Walt Disney Pictures)While promoting Toy Story 3, director Lee Unkrich – who also worked on the first and second film – said that, although he was flattered by the suggestion, there were no plans for a Toy Story 4 and that he always considered the third film to be “the conclusion to one big story.” Continuing that thought, Pixar president Jim Morris has stressed that the fourth film will be a “separate story.”But writing that story? That’s been its own saga. Andrew Stanton, who co-wrote the previous Toy Story films, among countless other projects, wrote a treatment for the film with then-Pixar chief creative officer John Lasseter, Unkrich, and fellow Pixar regular Pete Docter.Rashida Jones and Will McCormack were also attached as writers but departed the project. When Lasseter left his post last year in the wake of sexual misconduct allegations, the duo stressed to The New York Times that they respect Pixar’s films but “it is also a culture where women and people of color do not have an equal creative voice.”In June of 2018, Potts told Radio Times that Pixar “threw out three-quarters of [the script] and rewrote” it, thus resulting in the film being pushed a year from its original June 15, 2018 premiere date. Stephany Folsom, who previously worked on Thor: Ragnarok and is now penning the Michelle Williams abortion drama This is Jane, stepped in to write the screenplay.PIXAR FAV JOSH COOLEY LANDS HIS FIRST FEATURE DIRECTOR CREDITLasseter’s departure also means that he is no longer co-directing Toy Story 4 with Josh Cooley, as originally planned. Cooley, whose credits also include serving as story supervisor on Pixar’s Inside Out and directing the short Riley’s First Date?, which included some of that film’s characters, is now the sole director on the film. It’s also his first credit as a feature film director.TOY STORY&nbsp;STILL HAS A FRIEND IN RANDY NEWMAN(Photo by @ Walt Disney Pictures)Musician Newman has an Oscar for writing the original song “We Belong Together” for Toy Story 3 and has nominations for writing the songs “You’ve Got a Friend in Me” for Toy Story and “When She Loved Me” for Toy Story 2. So it’s a no-brainer that he’s back with more original music for this film.Toy Story 4 is in theaters June 21, 2019.#1Toy Story 4 (2019) 97%#1Adjusted Score: 116.691% Critics Consensus: Heartwarming, funny, and beautifully animated, Toy Story 4 manages the unlikely feat of extending -- and perhaps concluding -- a practically perfect animated saga.Synopsis: Woody (voice of Tom Hanks) has always been confident about his place in the world, and that his priority is...

But really, Penelope will always be Pedro’s girl. Since he cast her a decade ago in steamy drama Live Flesh, Spanish auteur Pedro Almodovar quickly adopted Cruz as his muse and leading lady of choice. No other director has been able to unleash and harness her sexuality, vulnerability and star power so fully. Casting Cruz as a would-be actress and call girl in tricksy tale of art and lies, Broken Embraces is her fourth movie with Almodovar. As Rotten Tomatoes chatted with her at Cannes 2009, we get the feeling it won’t be her last.[tomatometer]MuzeID=1202277[/tomatometer]Broken Embraces is your fourth film with Pedro Almodovar. What’s so special about working with him?Penelope Cruz: We have developed this working relationship and this friendship now for many years. He was the reason why I decided to become an actress, because of the admiration I felt for him.Do you and Pedro work on a character for a long time?PC: We rehearsed every day for three and a half months for Broken Embraces. I like having that time. Just to find things, to be able to make mistakes, to try different ways to do a scene.Do you drop everything when Pedro has a film role for you?PC: He always tells me many, many months before. Sometimes a year before. Then if I know he wants to shoot there and he wants me to do it, I just skip everything so I am free.You’re rocking an Audrey Hepburn look in this one. Is she an inspiration to you?PC: Yes, always. She was a great actress. She had a very special quality. She was magic, that woman.Is she your favourite actress?PC: My favourite actress is Meryl Streep. Oh, and Anna Magnani.Do you still want to work with Lars Von Trier?PC: Well, I haven’t seen Antichrist, but yes I still want to work with him!Cruz in Broken EmbracesDo you remember how you first broke into the movies?PC: It was for Jamon Jamon. I felt very surprised that I was getting yes as an answer for the first audition that I did. It was really the beginning of a big change in my life, because after that I stated working all the time.You’ve starred in everything from Westerns to sci-fi films. How do you decide whether to say yes to a role?PC: The script, the director, the role… You just have to feel as though you can do something with it. In order to make anybody else feel anything with that character, you have to feel something first.Do nude scenes and sex scenes bother you?PC: It’s difficult to answer. I have fear, always on the set. Insecurity to the point where the first week I always think I could be fired. I think that’s a fear most actors have. But Pedro can intimidate me more than anybody. Because I care so much about him and I don’t want to disappoint him.What has it been like since winning the Oscar for Vicky Cristina Barcelona?PC: I feel everything has gone very fast. And I need to take a few months or a year away from work. To really digest this whole adventure.Are you better at dealing with your nerves now?PC: No, I just get used to working while I’m nervous and insecure. It doesn’t change that much after the second week or the second month. It stays. It’s just a very, very exciting thing that has happened. I don’t know about the confidence![tomatometer]MuzeID=1202277[/tomatometer]Is it true that you take your Oscar everywhere with you?PC: No, not now. But I did it for three weeks, I took it everywhere with me. I even took it to the beach one day. Because I was so excited! I would wake up and look at it and say, ‘No, that’s not mine. How could this happen?’Is there something you always take with you when you travel?PC: My grandmother’s ring.You have your own production company. Are you working on some movies now?PC: Yes. But the things I am starting to develop, I don’t want to talk about them. Because they are still very green.Is there a biopic you’d love to tackle?PC: Yeah, there is one. That’s one of the projects that we are developing. But I won’t tell you it! Because then I feel like I am talking about it too soon instead of putting my energy into doing it.Do you find making movies exhausting?PC: Yeah, that’s why I’m not going to work for the rest of the year. I can make one a year. One movie a year. I’m going to work promoting this movie and promoting Nine. But I’m not going to shoot another movie.With Almodovar on set.Nine is the musical you’re doing next?PC: Yes, it’s a fresh and new thing, but it’s 100 percent inspired by 8 ½. The story is the same one of Guido and his creative crisis. I play Carla, the mistress of Daniel Day-Lewis. I think Daniel is going to be incredible in it.What made you want to do it?PC: I love this character. I can’t believe I got this role. I did five castings to get the movie, because of the dancing and the singing. I was a student of dance for many years, but Nine is the first time that I do a musical. It was a lot of fun, but it was scary also. Most of my scenes are with Daniel Day-Lewis. He’s incredible. Such a gentleman.Did you know that Pedro said you’re the only woman he’s ever thought of having a child with?PC: What?That’s what he said!PC: Because he says it to me and I think he’s joking. But then he says it to you! So… I think he was probably joking. But I don’t know. I will ask him again if he was joking. I mean, I know he’s joking… It’s Pedro!Broken Embraces hits UK cinemas today.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"media, Pictures, Superheroes, Pacific, video, MSNBC, Christmas, Movies, Crackle, leads, The","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"penelope-cruz-talks-broken-embraces-rt-interview"},{"id":"47613150310829","title":"RT on DVD: Gran Torino, Crossing Over, Nobel Son Exclusive Look","content":"RT on DVDvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})RT on DVD: Gran Torino, Crossing Over, Nobel Son Exclusive LookSee what's new this week on DVD and Blu-ray!by Jen Yamato | June 8, 2009 |  CommentsThis week on DVD, celebrate the big screen heroics of two former movie heroes (Clint Eastwood in Gran Torino, Harrison Ford in Crossing Over) or watch Clive Owen and Naomi Watts do battle with an evil bank (Tom Tykwer’s The International). If comedy is more your style, you can go low-brow (the cheerleading comedy Fired Up!) or worse: direct to DVD (the bowling comedy Strike! starring Tara Reid). Take a gamble on a twisty, stylized thriller about kidnapping and dysfunctional families (Nobel Son, starring Eliza Dushku and Alan Rickman) or take your chances with a critically panned race drama (Spinning into Butter, starring Sarah Jessica Parker). What’ll it be?Gran Torino —80%A crabby old man comes to terms with his racial insensitivities (and comes to blows with a local gang of thugs) in Gran Torino, a film that showed us not only that director-producer Clint Eastwood still has it, but also that even a septuagenarian can be a shotgun-wielding antihero in the 21st century. Eastwood stars as the grizzled war veteran Walt Kowalski, a widower who develops a tenuous friendship with the Hmong family that lives next door while defending them from a local gang. Despite dipping into tongue-in-cheek comedy, this violent melodrama works on the sheer strength of Eastwood’s performance; catch Eastwood relaying his own Gran Torino experience on a Blu-ray-exclusive special feature.Next: Harrison Ford in Crossing OverCrossing Over —11%Speaking of old men, Crossing Over stars Harrison Ford in Wayne Kramer‘s mishmash of a melodramatic tale about people from all walks of life (illegally) seeking the American Dream. As a Los Angeles immigration agent, Ford stumbles across — or, as always in this type of familiar LA tale, crashes into — one illegal immigrant after another, from a desperate deported mother (Alice Braga) to a British musician (Across the Universe‘s Jim Sturgess) and his Australian girlfriend (Alice Eve) who herself is sleeping with an ICE officer in exchange for legal status (Ray Liotta). Then you’ve got the Bangladeshi student (Summer Bishil), the Korean kid (Twilight‘s Justin Chon), an irate Iranian (Cliff Curtis), and Ashley Judd. Critics pummeled the heavy-handed drama, which director Kramer and studio execs notoriously squabbled over; no special features are included in the disc.Next: Fired Up: raunchy but watchable?Fired Up! —28%When two high school jocks decide to chase girls all the way to cheerleader camp one summer, does hilarity ensue? That depends on your tolerance for well meaning-but-flat jokes, as critics decreed that Fired Up! tries hard but ultimately fails to capture anything but raunchy, formulaic comedy. With rated-R gags reworked to fit into a PG-13 rating, Fired Up! might appeal to those who snicker at sex jokes and the name Freedom Jones (which is the apparently made-up person credited with the film’s script); a generous helping of funny bonus features and an audio commentary by director Will Gluck and actors Nicholas D’Agostino and Eric Christian Olsen actually make this a watchable, if juvenile, DVD offering. After all, what do those initials spell?Next: Clive Owen battles an evil bank in The InternationalThe International —58%Dancing close to the edge of Freshness, this Clive Owen–Naomi Watts thriller is the perfect movie to watch on DVD — you know, the kind of flick that you pass over in theaters and figure you’ll see eventually. Director Tom Tykwer (Run, Lola, Run) injects his signature frenetic energy into the story of an Interpol agent (Owen) and a NYC district attorney (Watts) trying to take down a global financial conglomerate. And in these tough economic times, who can’t relate to fighting back against a villainous bank? While some of the story unfolds rather slowly, one show-stopping set piece shootout in the middle of the Guggenheim museum will leave you breathless. See how they did it in one of a handful of featurettes, which accompany a single deleted scene, filmmaker commentary, and more.Next: Strike bowls a gutter ballStrike— N/AHave you been wondering where Tara Reid, Robert Carradine, and Robyn Lively had disappeared to? We found them all in this direct-to-DVD sports comedy, about a slacker actor who flirts with fame and fortune as a professional bowler, only to destroy his personal relationships in the process. It’s a comedy, see? Unfortunately, we’ve seen this formula before (remember Kingpin?) and with a lower budget and newbie filmmakers at the helm, it doesn’t even come close to striking gold — more like a turkey, but not the good kind.Next: Sarah Jessica Parker Spinning a clunkerSpinning Into Butter — 17%Sarah Jessica Parker toplines this misfire adapted from Rebecca Gilman’s celebrated 1999 play of the same name, but the success of said original play might just be what’s wrong with the film. Director Mark Brokaw seems to cater too much to the play’s stagey plotting, and the result is a stilted, forced meditation on racism and denial. Parker stars as Sarah Daniels, Dean of Students at a liberal Vermont college who takes it upon herself to champion a campus forum to discuss race relations in the mostly white campus community; as tensions rise, the cast of one-dimensional characters take their turn atop the cinematic soapbox in an attempt to confront the ugliness of prejudice head on, though Brokaw’s ineffective direction and a monologue-driven script make for a painful movie watching experience. Next: An exclusive look at Eliza Dushku in Nobel SonNobel Son — 25%The makers of this indie thriller describe it as having “so many twists it could make David Mamet blush,” to which we ask, would that really be a good thing? Bryan Greenburg (One Tree Hill) stars as Barkley Michaelson, the nerdy PhD student son of a brilliant, if terrible, Nobel Prize-winning scientist (Alan Rickman). When Barkley scores a date with a hot poet named City Hall (Eliza Dushku), it seems like his night’s off to a great start — that is, until he’s kidnapped by Shawn Hatosy, tortured, and held for a ransom that his father refuses to pay. Lots of twists, turns, and cannibalism come into play in the over-stylized thriller, which also features appearances by Danny DeVito, Mary Steenburgen, Ted Danson, Bill Pullman, and Ernie Hudson.Next: The ’70s will never die as long as you have Woodstock on DVD/Blu-ray!Woodstock 40th Anniversary Director’s Cut — 100%Hippies old and new should take a look at the 40th Anniversary Director’s Cut of this seminal rock documentary, which captured the three-day 1969 love fest in upstate New York that served as a touchstone for an entire generation. The newly remastered version of director Michael Wadleigh’s film — edited by the likes of Martin Scorsese and Thelma Schoonmaker — also contains an extra hour of never before seen concert footage and is a must-own for former flower children and fans of Janis Joplin, Jimi Hendrix, Joan Baez, Jefferson Airplane, and the 20-odd musical performers who took the stage. Blu-ray owners have the added benefit of building interactive playlists that can be shared with other BD viewers.Until next week, happy renting!","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"Mudbound, Epix","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"RT-on-DVD-Gran-Torino-Crossing-Over-Nobel-Son-Exclusive-Look"},{"id":"47613170265526","title":"RT on DVD & Blu-Ray: Cloudy with a Chance of The Final Destination","content":"RT on DVDvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})RT on DVD &amp; Blu-Ray: Cloudy with a Chance of The Final DestinationPlus, a couple of surf/skate docs, indie flicks, and Elvis doing karate.by RT Staff | January 4, 2010 |  CommentsThe new year is here, everyone, and with it comes another week of new releases on home video. Many of the most anticipated films have already come out on DVD and/or Blu-Ray, and the few remaining films in that category will be released in the coming weeks. For this week, however, this means our choices are somewhat tame again. For starters, we’ve got a surprisingly well-received animated children’s book adaptation and the last installment (so they say) in a horror franchise, as well as a few indie films that flew beneath the mainstream radar. Then we’ve got a few Blu-Ray reissues of some beloved older films, and one oddball choice profiling the martial arts antics of the King of Rock ‘n’ Roll. Read on for full details![tomatometer]MuzeID=1196077[/tomatometer]Cloudy with a Chance of MeatballsSony Pictures Animation has had a couple of big screen successes with its 2006 debut, Monster House, and 2007’s Surf’s Up. Earlier this year, they proved they had what it takes to stand out in the growing field of computer animated films when their most recent offering, Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs, became their highest rated release yet, earning an 85% on the Tomatometer on the way to Certified Fresh status. The story focuses on an aspiring inventor, Flint Lockwood (voiced by SNL’s Bill Hader), who succeeds in manipulating the weather so that food falls from the sky. Things go awry, of course, and it’s up to Flint and his weather girl love interest, Sam Sparks (Anna Faris), to figure out what’s really going on and put a stop to it. Critics largely felt the film was fun, quirky, and humorous enough to appeal to a wide variety of ages, as well as visually impressive. You can pick it up on DVD or Blu-Ray this week.[tomatometer]MuzeID=1207470[/tomatometer]The Final DestinationDo you like grisly, gruesome, ironic movie deaths? Yeah? Well, do you think you’d like them more…… if they were in three dimensions? That’s right, kiddies: critics say The Final Destination offers all the gore of the previous three installments, with the same amount of character development (zero) and quotable dialogue (again, zero). But this time around, all the deadly fatalities are comin’ atcha! (Oh, wait… the 3-D stuff only works on Blu-ray = which also includes a making of featurette and two alternate endings.)[tomatometer]MuzeID=10011022[/tomatometer]Fifty Dead Men WalkingAnother smallish film that went largely unnoticed this year was Fifty Dead Men Walking, which neither stars Sean Penn as a death row inmate nor features any zombies, as some might mistakenly assume the title to imply. This indie thriller centers around the civil conflict in Ireland during the late 80s and one man, Martin McGartland (21‘s Jim Sturgess), who was an undercover informant within the IRA. The film benefited from strong performances both from its lead and from supporting turns by Ben Kingsley and Rose McGowan, and it managed to earn Certified Fresh status with an 86% Tomatometer rating. For a crime drama on the road less traveled, you could do much worse.[tomatometer]MuzeID=1203312[/tomatometer]TruckerPlenty of actors and actresses pick out tiny independent films with quirky or rough hewn characters to make a mark they can’t really make in the soft and fluffy romcoms that pad their resumes (and bank accounts). After Michelle Monaghan was handpicked for her role in Shane Black’s Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang she seemed destined for big things-and she did have some classically Oscar-built supporting stints in North County and Gone Baby Gone thereafter. Technically those parts did get her bigger roles but in softer genre flix like Made of Honor. Crammed into the middle of this tennis match of a resume is Trucker, a low profile prestige item that hangs its drama on multiple standout performances, and though critics were mixed on it as a whole — many felt it was an overwrought collection of indie clichés — Monaghan herself won almost universal praise for her role. The DVD features a behind-the-scenes slideshow and footage of Monaghan in preparation for her role.[tomatometer]MuzeID=1172536[/tomatometer]The Hip Hop ProjectWith a likely bit of support from rap mogul Russell Simmons and an unlikely hand from actor Bruce Willis, The Hip Hop Project charts the growth of two talented singer/songwriters: Cannon and Princess. Their obstacles are harrowing but their support system is determined. Critics said that, while the story is touching, the film isn’t particularly inventive and the music is fairly middle-of-the-road too, but for fans of the live-the-dream doc or fans of hip hop, it’s uplifting. DVD is pretty spare, boasting a few sound options and subtitles.Battlestar Galactica: Season 1By now, most are familiar with this reboot of the classic television series; it garnered widespread critical acclaim for its portrayal of real-life issues set in a distant future… in space. After recently ending its run last March and releasing its companion piece, The Plan, on home video in October, the series is now finally releasing its first season on Blu-Ray. For those of you who missed out on all the hoopla the first time around, now’s your chance to catch up on the hottest sci-fi series to hit television in recent memory. The Blu-Ray is a four-disc set that includes all episodes from the first season, as well as lots of bonus features like episode commentaries, deleted scenes, behind-the-scenes footage, and an extra titled Battlestar Galactica Series Lowdown, featuring interviews with cast members.[tomatometer]MuzeID=1088599[/tomatometer]Ten Things I Hate About YouSaddened fans everywhere more than likely revisited this teen movie gem sometime around two years ago when up-and-coming Australian actor Heath Ledger tragically passed away. Ledger played the romantic lead, Patrick Verona, in a modern interpretation of Shakespeare’s The Taming of the Shrew, starring alongside Julia Stiles and Joseph Gordon-Levitt. Many saw early potential in Ledger, who was dashing and charming here in his star-making role. Overall, critics were somewhat lukewarm on the film, but for many, this represented some of the most entertaining teen cinema to come out of the 90s. This week, it’s available in a new two-disc special edition and, for the first time, on Blu-Ray.[tomatometer]MuzeID=1133970[/tomatometer]Riding Giants and Dogtown and Z-Boys – Blu-RayAlright, my fellow beach bums and California natives, these are the Blu-Rays you’ve been waiting for. Skateboard mogul-cum-documentary filmmaker Stacy Peralta made a couple of rousing documentaries in the early 2000s that clearly demonstrated his passion for surfing and skating. 2002’s Dogtown and Z-Boys and 2004’s Riding Giants were two of the most lovingly crafted pics about skating and surfing culture, respectively, and his affection for the subject matter shone through each production, earning Dogtown a Certified Fresh 91% and Giants a Certified Fresh 92%. Profiling the history of each sport, moving through their early development and culminating in modern times, Peralta focuses on famous figures and dramatic stories to inspire the same sort of awe that bystanders likely felt when witnessing them for the first time. Now that they’re both available on Blu-Ray this week, you can experience all the glory again in high definition.[tomatometer]MuzeID=1130898[/tomatometer]Dawn of the Dead (2004)Capitalizing on what was fast becoming a rebirth of interest in the zombie flick, Zack Snyder (that’s “visionary director Zack Snyder” to you Watchmen fans out there) took a stab at remaking a horror classic, namely George Romero’s original 1978 Dawn of the Dead. Did it succeed? Most would argue that it had a lot to live up to, what with the original currently rated at 95% on the Tomatometer, but Snyder’s vision for the film seemed to work for most audiences, and it managed to secure a healthy, Certified Fresh 76% Tomatometer score of its own. Critics felt that the reimagining of the film was fun in most of the right ways, sufficiently suspenseful, and gory when it needed to be (and sometimes more). Now available on Blu-Ray, you’ll get to pick the flaws out of the zombies’ makeup in high definition, so that’s always a plus.Elvis Presley Gladiators: The 1974 Elvis Karate Legacy ProjectHere’s a little item that might come in handy at your next trivia game. Back in the late 50s, Elvis joined the Army, and he was then introduced to the martial arts discipline of Karate. The King went on to study karate for several years, and even got into an onstage tussle with concertgoers. This documentary film seeks to chronicle those little known days of Presley’s life, and the DVD comes with lots of interesting little features, like some raw footage of Elvis, an interview with Wayne Carmen, who worked with Elvis for three years, a photo gallery, and 6 postcards of Elvis decked out in karate gear.Written by Tim Ryan, Sara Schieron, and Ryan Fujitani","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"cars, Fox, Adventures, Plus, and, Mindy, scene, New, WarnerMedia, HBO, Drama, PaleyFest, Avengers","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"RT-on-DVD-and-Blu-Ray-Cloudy-with-a-Chance-of-The-Final-Destination"},{"id":"47613145199018","title":"RT on DVD & Blu-Ray: 127 Hours and Love and Other Drugs","content":"RT on DVDvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})RT on DVD &amp; Blu-Ray: 127 Hours and Love and Other DrugsPlus, an action flick, a music doc, and another Disney classic.by | March 1, 2011 |  CommentsIn the wake of the Oscars last night, our top two entries for this week’s column feature the co-hosts of the festivities, James Franco and Anne Hathaway. Unfortunately, while Franco’s film was a multiple Academy Award nominee (including a Best Actor nod for Franco himself), Hathaway’s film… Well, let’s just say her film didn’t impress critics as much. After that, we’ve got the latest actioner headlined by Dwayne Johnson, a music doc about one of LA’s prominent clubs, a musical featuring Cher and Christina Aguilera, and a certain Disney classic about an orphaned deer. See below to check out this week’s new releases!127 Hours 93%This timely release comes on the heels of the Oscars, where the film was nominated for six awards, including Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Film Editing, Best Picture, and a Best Actor nod for its star (and co-host of the evening’s festivities) James Franco. Directed by Danny Boyle (Trainspotting, Slumdog Millionaire), 127 Hours tells the remarkable real life story of outdoorsman Aron Ralston, who embarked on a canyoneering trip in Utah in 2003. While he was passing through a narrow passage, a boulder broke free and trapped him within the canyon, pinning his right arm against the rock wall and beginning a five-day struggle to survive. 127 Hours was a hit with critics, who called it equally gut-wrenching and inspirational and praised Franco’s performance in particular. It didn?t come home with any Oscars on Sunday, but it did receive a Certified Fresh 93% Tomatometer, so if you missed it when it was in theaters, here’s your second chance. Be forewarned, though: there are some scenes that are not for the faint of heart.Love and Other Drugs 49%And here we have the latest film from the other co-host of the Oscars, Anne Hathaway; this one, however, wasn’t nominated for any of the awards. Starring alongside Jake Gyllenhaal, a smooth-talking pharmaceutical salesman (and womanizer) named Jamie, Hathaway plays Maggie Murdock, a woman with early onset Parkinson’s disease who proves to be a wit-for-wit match for Jamie. The two begin a casual, sex-based relationship, but eventually they fall in love and must deal with the consequences. Directed by Ed Zwick (Glory, The Last Samurai), Love and Other Drugs failed to impress critics very much, earning just a 49% Tomatometer. The film suffered from a lack of narrative focus, and despite striking many as a refreshingly adult romance, the lack of balance between its plot elements ultimately was its undoing. If you’re fan of the stars, or just a fan of seeing them without their clothes on, this’ll be perfect for you.Faster 42%Dwayne Johnson seems to have been focused on family films and comedies as of late, with roles in The Tooth Fairy, Get Smart, and The Other Guys. In fact, he hasn’t been in a proper action movie since 2005’s Doom. So, in some ways, it was refreshing to see him step back into his tough guy shoes for Faster, a revenge flick about a recently released ex-con (Johnson) who must dodge both the police and a hitman while he seeks retribution for those responsible for the death of his brother. Unfortunately, critics felt that the film’s leaps in logic were a bit much to bear, and the story was riddled with too many subplots that distract from the issue at hand. As such, it’s got a 45% Tomatometer score, and it may satisfy those looking for some cheap action thrills, but it probably won’t do much more than that.Troubadours 64%Troubadours is a rock doc that definitely does not go to 11. Instead, it’s a celebratory look at a key moment in American pop ? specifically, the mellow, introspective singer/songwriter movement that coalesced around the famed L.A. club the Troubadour. James Taylor, Joni Mitchell, David Crosby, Carole King, Jackson Browne and a bunch of other mellow rock luminaries are on hand to offer fond anecdotes about the time and the scene; if critics had a nit to pick with Troubadours, it’s that this amiable talking-heads portrait doesn’t go much deeper than surface level. However, fans of the music will be in heaven, and the DVD set comes with a bonus CD with cuts from Taylor, Linda Ronstadt, Tom Waits, and 2011 Oscar winner Randy Newman, among others.Burlesque 36%On paper, Burlesque must have looked like high-camp heaven. Cher and Christina Aguilera star class up a plot that’s older than dirt: a small-town girl goes to the big city, falls under the wing of an old showbiz pro, and becomes a star. Unfortunately, critics savaged the film, calling it a cliché-ridden mess lacking the kind of showstopping musical numbers needed to overcome the predictability of the plot. Still, if you’re in the mood for some old-school razzle dazzle, you could probably do worse, since they don’t make movies like Burlesque anymore, for good or ill. The DVD features a bunch of making-of featurettes, director’s commentary, a blooper reel, an alternate opening, and videos of the movies musical sequences.Bambi – Two-Disc Diamond Edition 90%Generations of children have been traumatized by Bambi. Now, with a sparkling new Bambi Blu-Ray, you and your family can experience the most horrifying mommy shooting in movie history — in high definition! Seriously, though, Bambi is yet another jewel in Disney’s crown, a beautiful, charming, and at times achingly sad perennial that continues to amaze nearly 70 years after its original release. Briskly paced, with plenty of adorable characters, Bambi may fall a notch or two below Snow White or Fantasia in the Mouse House cannon, but it’s a remarkable entertainment nonetheless. The Blu-Ray is chock full of goodies as well, including a making-of doc, deleted scenes, a look at some Disney artwork from the vault, a short film of Uncle Walt explaining the filming techniques, and a Silly Symphony animated short from 1937.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"Skip","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"RT-on-DVD-and-Blu-Ray-127-Hours-and-Love-and-Other-Drugs"},{"id":"47613147132331","title":"Awards Tour: 2010 People’s Choice Awards Winners!","content":"var mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Awards Tour: 2010 People's Choice Awards Winners!Find out who won when the power went to the people!by RT Staff | January 6, 2010 |  CommentsGiving entertainment fans a place to vote for some of the biggest names and properties in pop culture, this year’s People’s Choice Awards delivered a diverse list of nominees across movies, television, and music.

There were some disappointments, but plenty of movies to get excited about, and RT was there for the whole festival checking out the best Cannes had to offer. So what’s worth keeping an eye on? Join us as we take a visual journey through the 10 Cannes films you absolutely have to see.Broken Embraces – Most critics agreed that director Pedro Almodovar was on fine form with his latest, which stars Penelope Cruz. “Fans of Almodovar will get plenty of what they expect here – rich saturated colours, hyper plotting, stylistic pyrotechnics and off-centre comedy,” said Barry Byrne of Screen International. David Gritten summarized the film nicely by saying, “while [Almodovar’s] new film parades his many virtues, it treads water rather than breaks new ground.”Find Out MoreDrag Me to Hell – As we write, Sam Raimi‘s return to horror is at 100% on the Tomatometer with 16 reviews in the bank. It’s “A visceral assault on the senses and will have you gasping for breath as the laughs and scares mount,” says Chris Tilly of IGN, while Peter Debruge of Variety is happy to celebrate the film’s flaws. “Scant of plot and barren of subtext, the pic is single-mindedly devoted to pushing the audience’s buttons, and who better than Raimi to do the honors?”Find Out MoreFish Tank – Andrea Arnold came to Cannes in 2006 with her debut feature, Red Road, not long after winning an Oscar for her short. Then, she won the jury prize, an award she collected again this year for Fish Tank. “Powerful, punishing, funny and beautifully observed, it’s driven by a stunning performance from non-pro newcomer Katie Jarvis,” writes Jonathan Crocker in Little White Lies. Dave Calhoun agrees in Time Out that it’s “a very strong film — one that’s utterly gripping and always surprising.”Find Out MoreI Love You Phillip Morris – Playing in the Director’s Fortnight section of the festival, this Sundance hit stars Ewan McGregor and Jim Carrey and shocked and delighted critics in equal measure. It’s a “funny, sometimes tender and ultimately unsettling black comedy,” says Damon Wise in Empire. “The direction is more than adept,” says John Anderson for Variety. “Many of the laughs erupt at the end of scenes, as Carrey or McGregor toss off some seemingly random line, and it sticks.”Find Out MoreLooking for Eric – Ken Loach won the Palme d’Or when he was last in Cannes with The Wind That Shakes the Barley in 2006. Lightning didn’t strike twice in a row, but there was much love for his latest, which some claim is his most accessible yet. “When it works, Eric has many incidental pleasures,” says Derek Elley in Variety. James Christopher agrees. “Ken Loach couldn’t have painted a more perfect, bitter-sweet picture for Cannes.”Find Out MorePrecious – Surely the festival’s greatest surprise. Precious, based on the novel Push by Saffire, casts Mariah Carey, Lenny Kravitz and Mo’Nique in key roles and is still most memorable for its performances, with many tipping the latter for Oscars. It’s “a must-see portrait of life’s underprivileged which is utterly compelling,” writes Mike Goodridge of Screen International. He adds that a debut performance from the lead, Gabourey Sidibe, “is one of the most electrifying debuts in years.”Find Out MoreA Prophet – Critics raved for Jacques Audiard‘s latest, about a young prisoner swept into the world of organized crime. The film “works both as hard-edged, painstaking detailed social realism and as a compelling genre entertainment,” says Jonathan Romney in Screen International. Damon Wise in Empire says it’s “an astonishingly detailed crime drama that could end up being this year’s Gomorra, although it’s arguably more accessible.”Find Out MoreUp – Few doubted that Pixar’s latest could be an instant classic, but that doesn’t mean the result is any less impressive — at 26 reviews as we write, it’s 100% fresh. “a rare, wondrous story of true love and dream-catching,” writes Jonathan Crocker in Little White Lies. “Of holding on and letting go. You will believe a house can fly.” “Per usual, the nuances of human relationships are conveyed via Pixar’s predictably acute attention to detail, coded in a mysterious evocation of mood,” writes Ed Gonzalez for Slant.Find Out MoreThe White Ribbon – It wasn’t without reason that Michael Haneke‘s film took home this year’s Palme d’Or — it was one of the festival’s best. Todd McCarthy argued it was, “a difficult film to embrace,” a sentiment shared by many critics of the film’s tough subject matter. But he added that the narrative, “goes beyond its general analysis of humanity to implicitly suggest some tendencies in the German character and culture that could point to certain developments in the subsequent three decades.”Find Out MoreAntichrist – Lars von Trier‘s controversial latest may not be as well reviewed as the other nine films on our list, but it earns its place for the sheer love-it-or-hate-it lengths it goes to in provoking a reaction from its audience. “What Lars is driving at is something completely bizarre, massively uncommercial and strangely perfect,” writes Damon Wise for Empire, while Todd McCarthy argues for Variety that, “Lars von Trier cuts a big fat art-film fart, as if deliberately courting critical abuse.” Clearly one not to miss.Find Out MoreCatch up on all of our Cannes coverage right here.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"richard, killer, Signature, First, binge, cancelled, Fox","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"cannes-2009-rts-10-mustsee-movies"},{"id":"47613156409775","title":"Whip It Good: Our Favorite Rollerskating Jams","content":"var mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Whip It Good: Our Favorite Rollerskating JamsDrew Barrymore's grrrl-power roller-derby film sent us back to the rink -- and the roller disco -- to pick some of the most memorable movie moments on eight wheelsby Michael Adams | October 1, 2009 |  CommentsAs Gene Wilder’s Willy Wonka so eloquently put it: “If the good lord had intended us to walk, he wouldn’t have invented roller skates.” Indeed. Yet while this week’s Drew Barrymore-directed, grrrl-powered roller-derby film Whip It is garnering positive critical buzz, it’s only the latest in a — who would have guessed? — surprisingly long (if decidedly checkered) line of on-screen roller-skating jams to have touched wheels to the cement and the rink. Don’t believe us? Here then are some of the greatest, the shoddiest and the plain old weirdest of them — as we proceed to whip it, and whip it good…Rollerball (1975)In just nine years from now — 2018! — corporations rule a world pacified via the televised spectacle of… Rollerball! It’s a game in which company teams take to a circular track on skates and motorbikes and bash all kinds of hell out of each other as they try to get a metal ball into a magnetized goal. The brutal sport has been secretly designed to demonstrate the futility of individuality but, of course, one man has risen to become a global champion. And that man is Jonathan E and he refuses to retire, even when the powers-that-be revise the game’s rules — or lack thereof — with the intention of killing him. Norman Jewison’s flick features James Caan at his mid-’70s toughest amid some crunching action, terrific use of Bach’s Toccata and a dark vision of capitalism’s end-run around liberty. Why oh why did they have to remake it so badly in 2002?Xanadu / Can’t Stop The Music (1980)What was in the air — or the water — in 1980 that it gave us two legendarily camp movie musicals, both of which feature roller-skating interludes? Choosing the worst ain’t easy. In Xanadu we get Olivia Newton-John as the all-singing, all-dancing muse who’s never happier than when she’s skating ethereally around LA’s boardwalks and disused auditoria — or through dry ice smoke. And there’s Gene Kelly, in his last, er, roll, zipping along, and tap-dancing to, er, boot. (Kelly had done it before in the far classier 1955’s It’s Always Fair Weather — watch the clip below.) The Village People vehicle Can’t Stop the Music, meanwhile, features the ghastly spectacle of Steve Guttenberg trying — emphasis on trying — to roller-skate through Manhattan. And then, later, Bruce Jenner gets in on the roller-action.Boogie Nights (1997)It was great to see Heather Graham so well cast in The Hangover this year because too often the beautiful actress is seen wallowing in the likes of Killing Me Softly or Miss Conception. But arguably her best-ever performance, and one that provided a rare combination of her comedic and dramatic talents, was as “Rollergirl” in Paul Thomas Anderson’s towering porn-world epic Boogie Nights. Bubbly, sexy, innocent, crazy, dangerous — she projected it all, and often on rollerskates. Don’t try this at home, or in the dome.Roller Boogie (1979)Linda Blair (moving from Hell’s minion to Hell on wheels) and Jim Bray (former competitive skater) star alongside Beverly Garland (B-movie actress best known for It Conquered The World) for director Mark L. Lester (Class of 1984, Commando) in this tale of roller-skating kids in love who just want to roller boogie in the Roller Boogie competition, except for that dastardly developer who wants to knock down their Roller Rink! At the end, Linda Blair goes off to New York (in reality, she’d head into decades of schlock), Jim Bray goes to the Olympics (he couldn’t because he’d ended his amateur status by doing this movie) and 50 or so extras used here got ready to don the skates again for Xanadu, shot in many of the same Venice locations. What’s terrific about this is the roller-skating breakdancing on the rink, a couple years before the trend really took off in the mainstream. What’s less terrific is Cher’s song from the film, “Hell on Wheels”.The Muppets Take Manhattan (1984)In the annals of roller-skating, it’d seem that while Los Angeles wins out, thanks to its board walks and more laidback vibe and skater history, Manhattan has its share of stellar sequences. And none are more stellar than Miss Piggy strapping on some borrowed skates in Central Park to chase down a mugger who has stolen her purse. Her flying through the park to take him down is up there with the work seen in Unholy Rollers. Hiiiiyaaar! And no, Miss Piggy was not harmed in the shooting of this scene. The long shots are a human stunt double. In case it wasn’t, you know, really obvious.Unholy Rollers (1972)Think Whip It, if it’d been made by Paul Verhoeven. Former Playboy playmate Claudia Jennings is cat-food worker Karen who, following sexual harassment, makes ends meet by becoming a star roller-derby babe. Anticipating Jonathan E., she’s no team player, and, predating Nomi Malone by two decades, she uses her rising status to take down her lesbian nemesis. It goes without saying that this features plenty of gratuitous nudity and includes a skate rink strip and sex scene. Sadly, the gorgeous Ms Jennings would die before the decade was out, killed in an auto accident. Executive producer Roger Corman, however, would go on and on like the Duracell Bunny. We hope this one’s is included in the clip montage next year when he’s presented his lifetime achievement Oscar by Martin Scorsese…Kansas City Bomber (1972)Who knew 1972 was such a banner year for roller derby flicks? While the title sounds like a terrorist-stalks-a-city plot also popular at the time, it actually refers to Raquel Welch, whose character K.C. is, as the poster puts it, “the hottest thing on wheels”. In a deviation from other roller-skating epics, in this one K.C. is encouraged to be a star and supposedly it’s the fans you gotta look out for. That said, a lot of the movie’s taken up with in competition and out-of-game smack downs between girls, guys, team members and adversaries. The rivalry between K.C. and Jackie (played by Helena Kallianiotis, who was Golden Globe nominated for Best Supporting Actress — whip that, Drew!) though, has to be resolved (after an awesome punch in the face) by a “match race”. It sounds quite civil but, with its high-kicking, gut-punching and hair-flailing, it’s a bitch fight for the ages! A couple of quick questions, though: did Will Ferrell time travel to play the referee? And is that Sasquatch with the number 25 jersey on?Modern Times (1936)Charlie Chaplin had taken to the roller skates before in 1916’s The Rink (see below), but his crowning moment on the little wheels came in this classic. He and Paulette Goddard don the skates in the fourth floor toy room of a department store and he glides around ever-so-gracefully, blindfolded, right next to a precipice, while gorgeous gamin’ Goddard stumbles around trying to warn him. It’s classic. And still hair-raising! The effect, however, was created using a matte, so there was actually no huge drop and no risk to the actor. His blindfold, meanwhile, was a see-through mesh. But he did all the skating himself — devoting a whopping eight days to the short scene.Leprechaun (1992)A year before she became America’s Sweetheart on Friends, Jennifer Aniston made her movie debut in this low-budget cult horror comedy, which stars Warwick Davis in the title role. What’s weirdest about this story of one little Irish monster’s quest for his treasure (“I want me gold… now!”) are the remarkable modes of transportation he uses. You’ll find him zipping around on a kid’s tricycle, a wheelchair and a go-kart, and bouncing up and down on a pogo stick until he spears it through a dude’s chest. The horrible little beast eventually also gets around to roller skates, careening down a road, arms flailing, until he crashes into a white picket fence — leaving a Leprechaun-shaped hole, of course.Roller Blade (1986)Set in an alternative-universe post-apocalypse, this has the sometimes nude, always rollerskating nuns of the holy order of Roller Blade (no, we’re not making this up) infiltrated by the sexy — and roller-skating — minion of evil sock puppet Dr Saticoy. And then there’s Marshall Goodman, goodly skate cowboy, who’s trying to teach his son the ways of the little wheels. Soft-core girl-girl porn and Zen philosophy collide in the first of numerous weirdy-beardy roller-skating epics from the late, great Z-grade filmmaker Donald G. Jackson.Heaven’s Gate (1980)We’re not about to rewrite cinematic history by arguing Michael Cimino’s legendary flop is some sort of neglected masterpiece. True, it’s beautifully shot and the production design is wonderful, but it’s also tedious beyond belief in places. That said, the roller-skating scene is technically wicked. Acid-wit Joe Queenan, calling Heaven’s Gate the worst film ever made in The Guardian last year, also wrote: “This is a movie that has five minutes of uninterrupted fiddle-playing by a fiddler who is also mounted on roller skates.”Fletch (1985)That State of Play didn’t set the box-office on fire earlier this year probably had a lot to do with the fact that Russell Crowe didn’t go about his journalistic business with a series of wacky pseudonyms and disguises — and rollerskates. It certainly worked for Chevy Chase as Fletch. During this highpoint of his comic career, he introduces himself as Harry S. Truman, Igor Stravinsky and Don Corleone, not to mention Dr Rosenpenis/Rosenrosen and John Cocktolstone, and poses as a big-toothed aircraft mechanic and IRS geek. But Fletch’s most outrageous impersonation is Baba au Rum, a bald but bearded roller-skating beach hippie in long flowing robes.Derby (1971)Think Whip It, if it’d been made by Michael Moore. This is about Mike Snell, tire-factory worker who aspires to be a roller derby champion, and others who play the sport. While there’s plenty of roller derby action, it soon gives way to an intense, raw depiction of the American working class in the early 1970s. Read Roger Ebert’s review from back in the day and see if it doesn’t make you thankful the DVD was released earlier this year.Bonus absurdity:Prayer of the Rollerboys (1990)Okay, we know this one’s all about roller-blading, but we couldn’t resist. For those of you wondering what became of Corey Haim’s career, might we direct you to this 1990 futuristic actioner — a future in which, as the tagline reminds us: “it’s gonna take one man and his blades to save the world from another man…and HIS blades.”","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"female, Shudder, Swim, on, spinoff, 45, dramedy, Mudbound, Unbreakable","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"whip-it-good-our-favorite-rollerskating-jams"},{"id":"47613154568622","title":"Saturday Night Live Stars on the Big Screen","content":"var mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Saturday Night Live Stars on the Big Screenby RT Staff | September 26, 2014 |  CommentsSaturday Night Live celebrates the premiere of its 40th season this weekend, and to celebrate, we’ve compiled a list of critically-acclaimed films featuring SNL alums. The movies listed here aren’t necessarily the best or the best-reviewed movies from these stars; rather, we wanted to give a sense of the range and versatility of the not-ready-for-primetime players. Featuring those who rose to prominence during their time on the show (Eddie Murphy, Will Ferrell, Kristin Wiig) and a few you may have forgotten about (Robert Downey Jr., Julia Louis-Dreyfus), our list is a testament to SNL‘s continuing relevance as an incubator for some of the entertainment world’s brightest talents.Adventureland 89%Full of humor and nostalgia, and featuring wry supporting turns by Kristen Wiig and Bill Hader, Adventureland is a sweet, insightful coming-of-age comedy that will resonate with teens and adults alike.Best in Show 93%A fine example of writer-director-star Christopher Guest’s gift for improv comedy, Best in Show boasts an appealingly quirky premise and a brilliantly talented cast.Bridesmaids 90%A marriage of genuine characters, gross out gags, and pathos, Bridesmaids is a female-driven comedy features star-making performances from Kristen Wiig and Maya Rudolph.City Slickers 90%With a supremely talented cast (led by Billy Crystal) and just enough midlife drama to add weight to its wildly silly overtones, City Slickers uses universal themes to earn big laughs.Elf 85%A movie full of Yuletide cheer, Elf is a spirited, good-natured family comedy, and it benefits greatly from Will Ferrell’s funny and charming performance as one of Santa’s biggest helpers.Enough Said 95%Wryly charming, impeccably acted, and ultimately quite bittersweet, Enough Said is a grown-up movie in the best possible way, and it offers a chance to see Julia Louis-Dreyfus play an intriguingly complex character.48 Hrs. 93%Marking an auspicious feature film debut for Eddie Murphy, 48 Hrs. is a briskly paced action comedy that succeeds largely due to the outstanding chemistry between its two leads.Ghostbusters 97%An infectiously fun blend of special effects and comedy, Ghostbusters derives many of its biggest laughs from Bill Murray’s hilarious deadpan wit and Dan Aykroyd’s enthusiastic geekiness.God Said, Ha! 86%God Said, Ha! plumbs poignant depths, but Julia Sweeney’s sharp, graceful wit makes this one-woman monologue a wise, big-hearted burst of uplifting — and perhaps therapeutic — entertainment.Good Hair 95%Funny, informative, and occasionally sad, Chris Rock’s Good Hair is a provocative look at the complex relationship between African Americans and their hair.Groundhog Day 96%Smart, sweet, and inventive, Groundhog Day highlights Bill Murray’s dramatic gifts while still leaving plenty of room for laughs.Innerspace 82%A manic, overstuffed blend of sci-fi, comedy, and romance, Innerspace nonetheless charms, thanks to Martin Short’s fine performance and the insistent zaniness of the plot.Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang 86%Tongue-in-cheek satire blends well with entertaining action and a spot-on comic performance from Robert Downey Jr. in this dark, eccentric film noir homage.Mean Girls 84%Sharper and darker than the average teen comedy, Mean Girls benefits from refreshing honesty and a terrific cast that includes Tina Fey, Amy Poehler, and Tim Meadows.National Lampoon’s Animal House 90%The talents of director John Landis and Saturday Night Live‘s irrepressible John Belushi conspired to create a rambunctious, subversive college comedy that continues to resonate.National Lampoon’s Vacation 93%Blessed by a brilliantly befuddled star turn from Chevy Chase (as well as strong supporting work from Randy Quaid and a young Anthony Michael Hall), National Lampoon’s Vacation is one of the more consistent — and thoroughly quotable — screwball comedies of the 1980s.Nebraska 91%Elegant in its simplicity and poetic in its message, Nebraska is boosted by a poignant, bittersweet dramatic performance by Will Forte.Obvious Child 90%Tackling a sensitive subject with maturity, honesty, and wit, Obvious Child serves as both a showcase for Jenny Slate and a promising debut for writer-director Gillian Robespierre.Punch-Drunk Love 79%Odd, touching, and unique, Punch-Drunk Love is also delightfully funny, utilizing Adam Sandler’s comic persona to explore the life of a lonely guy who finds love.School of Rock 92%Full of high spirits and loads of heart School of Rock into a hilarious, rocking good time, thanks in part to sharp supporting work from Joan Cusack and Sarah Silverman.Shrek 2 89%Topical humor and exuberant vocal performances from Mike Myers and Eddie Murphy help to make Shrek 2 a funny, smart animated tale for audiences of all ages.The Skeleton Twins 86%Led by powerful performances from Kristen Wiig and Bill Hader, The Skeleton Twins effectively mines laughs and tears from family drama.This Is Spinal Tap 95%Smartly directed, brilliantly acted, and packed with endlessly quotable moments, This Is Spinal Tap is an all-time comedy classic, and represents a high water mark for stars Michael McKean, Christopher Guest, and Harry Shearer.Trading Places 88%Featuring deft interplay between Eddie Murphy and Dan Dan Aykroyd, Trading Places is an immensely appealing social satire.The Truth About Cats and Dogs 85%Sharp, witty, and charming, The Truth About Cats and Dogs features a standout performance from Janeane Garofalo.Wayne’s World 78%An oddball comedy that revels in its silliness and memorable catch phrases, Wayne’s World is also fondly regarded because of its endearing leads — played with infectious goofiness by Mike Myers and Dana Carvey.Whip It 84%Drew Barrymore’s directorial debut has enough charm, energy, and good-natured humor to transcend its many cliches — and it features fine supporting performances by Kristen Wiig and Jimmy Fallon.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"Sci-Fi, TV, Heroines, Pictures","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"saturday-night-live-stars-on-the-big-screen"},{"id":"47613185198525","title":"The 10 Scariest Animated Children’s Movies","content":"Newsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})The 10 Scariest Animated Children's MoviesOn the 35th anniversary of The Black Cauldron, we look back at 10 other animated films aimed at kids that terrified and traumatized young viewers.by Rafael Motamayor | July 24, 2020 |  Comments(Photo by (c)Buena Vista Pictures courtesy Everett Collection)Far too often, animated movies are written off as overly kid-friendly, unsophisticated fluff, when the truth is the medium is capable of telling stories as mature as the most prestigious live-action dramas. Sometimes, however, an animated movie ostensibly made for children can also be spooky enough to terrify the most hardened youngsters, and even a&nbsp;few adults.One of Disney’s most infamous animated movies, The Black Cauldron, opened 35 years ago and traumatized kids of all stripes, and to celebrate its anniversary, we’re taking a look back at its peers. Whether they were intentionally spooky or simply featured a couple of freaky moments that made every kid hit fast-forward, we’ve put together a list of the scariest animated movies that terrified the young audiences they were meant to entertain.Coraline (2009)  90%(Photo by Focus Features)On the surface, this stop-motion adaptation of Neil Gaiman’s novel is a silly story of a spunky, bored little girl who finds a hidden door to a secret world where everything is perfect, yet slightly off. But just like its hidden parallel dimension, Coraline is freaky and&nbsp;frequently plain horrifying. As soon as Coraline finds the secret door, the story begins to unfold like a horror film, ramping up its creepy atmosphere and frightening creatures. But the real terror comes the moment Coraline is given her own set of button eyes, to be sewn on by her creepy Other Mother… before she transforms into a giant spider and all hell breaks loose. Moira MacDonald summarized it for the&nbsp;Seattle Times: “Children who like being scared will get a kick out of this wildly creative movie; adults needn’t have a child in tow to enjoy it, too.”The Great Mouse Detective (1986)  80%(Photo by Walt Disney Productions)A&nbsp;noir mystery starring mice may not necessarily seem like a film that would give you nightmares for days on end, but you would be wrong. Based on the children’s novel&nbsp;Basil of Baker Street&nbsp;— which itself was inspired by the tales of Sherlock Holmes —&nbsp;The Great Mouse Detective&nbsp;starts with a little mouse girl named Olivia celebrating her birthday with her father at home, when suddenly a one-legged bat breaks into the house and kidnaps the father. The film’s eerie atmosphere persists throughout its runtime, and even when there are moments of levity or sweetness, they’re usually followed by moments of utter terror. For many children, the bat represents their first experiences with jumpscares, as he is responsible for the two most frightening ones in the film: first, when he bursts into Olivia’s home at the beginning of the movie, and later when he leaps out of a baby carriage to abduct her. Nina Darnton wrote for&nbsp;The New York Times&nbsp;that “Small children may be afraid of some of the bad characters — the Disney Studio’s gift for creating really nasty bad guys means that they are scary — but they will love the cute, brave mice and cheer their triumphs. Adults will enjoy the wit and style.”The Last Unicorn (1982)  76%(Photo by Jensen Farley Pictures)Horror and fantasy are two genres that don’t cross nearly enough, but when they do, they&nbsp;offer unique experiences. The Last Unicorn skews more towards fantasy, but it still packs enough spooky elements to make it a scary film for kids. Rankin/Bass may be better known for their holiday classics like the stop-motion animated Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer, but this fantasy epic — about a unicorn who discovers she is the last of her kind and embarks on a quest to discover&nbsp;what has happened to her kin —&nbsp;is full of horrific dangers. Without a doubt, the most frightening for kids was the fiery Red Bull, evil incarnate, with its deep, blood-red color and almost hollow eyes that no doubt inspired countless nightmares. Writing about the film for Time Out,&nbsp;Geoff Andrew&nbsp;explained that The Last Unicorn has “Some horrific moments (the mark of the best fairytales) and some sublimely witty lines.”Monster House (2006)  75%(Photo by Sony Pictures courtesy Everett Collection)Monster House is ultimately charming and fun for most, but this is, after all, the only “proper” horror film on this list, and while it’s largely kid-friendly, it’s also suitably frightening in spots, as any haunted house movie worth its salt should be. The film follows three kids who decide to explore&nbsp;the creepy old house in their neighborhood with a terrifying reputation.&nbsp;It feels like a 1980s Amblin movie, full of adventure and comedy and more than a little danger, thanks to a few intense scenes courtesy of the imaginatively rendered titular house. As&nbsp;L.A. Weekly’s&nbsp;Scott Foundas said of the film, “Monster House becomes one of those wonderfully weird adventure stories beloved of children who don’t mind getting a good old-fashioned case of the heebie-jeebies. It’s kind of a blast for adults too.”The Nightmare Before Christmas (1993)  95%(Photo by Buena Vista Pictures)Ask any horror fan and they’ll tell you that Christmas and horror make for a fantastic combination, but this is one of the rare times that the two cross over in animated form, and it’s mostly a delightful treat. From the mind of Tim Burton and Henry Selick comes the story of the Pumpkin King of Halloween Town, Jack Skellington, who gets tired of the same annual festivities and decides to kidnap Santa Claus and take over Christmas. As sweet and funny as it is terrifyingly gruesome, The Nightmare Before Christmas is a visual treat, even if those visuals are frequently bizarre, off-kilter, and a little macabre for the toddler set. The best example is the burlap-sack villain Ooogie Boogie, who literally refers to himself as “the boogieman” and who meets his demise when he comes apart at the seams and&nbsp;reveals he’s full of creepy-crawlies. As Alan Jones wrote&nbsp;for the Radio Times,&nbsp;“Only the deliciously demented imagination of Edward Scissorhands director Tim Burton could have come up with such a dark vision of the holiday season.”Scooby-Doo on Zombie Island (1998)  88%(Photo by Warner Bros. Pictures)For decades,&nbsp;Scooby-Doo&nbsp;and the Mystery Inc. gang have served as an introduction to horror for kids, offering mildly creepy stories that always ended with an “Aw, shucks!” and a smile. Well, not&nbsp;Scooby-Doo on Zombie Island, which marked the first time the gang faced a real supernatural threat as they set out to find ghosts and monsters in Louisiana. What starts as another typical&nbsp;Scooby-Doo&nbsp;adventure quickly devolves into a tale of voodoo, ghost pirates, vengeful cat demons, and of course, zombies, all tied together by a tragic backstory much darker than fans of the show would have been accustomed to. There aren’t any greedy tycoons in rubber suits here, and actual death — of werecats and humans alike — is a major element of the plot.&nbsp;There really isn’t anything else quite like this in the&nbsp;Scooby-Doo canon, and any kid going into it expecting the usual antics was in for a shock.The Secret of NIMH (1982)  93%(Photo by United Artists)If you thought animated movies featuring talking animals were all sunshine and rainbows, think again. This film based on the children’s novel&nbsp;Mrs. Frisby and the Rats of NIMH&nbsp;follows a field mouse as she tries to save her ill son both from his pneumonia and from the farmer whose land they live on before he plows through it. Don Bluth’s adaptation is full of truly terrifying moments involving the survivors of scientific experiments, including a rat-eating cat named Dragon. But the scene that really traumatized kids was the visit to the Great Owl, whose introduction includes a lair littered with the bones of his devoured prey, a gruesome encounter with an ill-fated spider, and a pair of&nbsp;creepy, glowing eyes that stared into your very soul. Bluth’s films always skewed a little darker than typical Disney fare, and this was a prime example of his aesthetic. As critic&nbsp;Christopher Null wrote for Filmcritic.com,&nbsp;“Never mind the G rating, this is scary stuff which sent my little one fleeing to another room inside of 10 minutes.”Spirited Away (2002)  97%(Photo by Walt Disney Pictures)Japanese animation maestro Hayao Miyazaki’s films have been described as beautifully made artistic wonders and visual masterpieces, but “frightening” isn’t a sensation you normally associate with his work. That being said,&nbsp;Spirited Away&nbsp;is his most haunting film, and it has more than its fair share of creepy moments that sneak up on you and make a lasting impression. The story of a girl lost in a world ruled by spirits is as whimsical as a Disney film, but it doesn’t shy away from disturbing imagery, like when young protagonist Chihiro sees her parents transformed into monstrous and endlessly hungry pigs, or when the spirit No Face begins to devour all the employees of the bathhouse in a wild frenzy. Children who toughed it out through the more frightening moments were rewarded with an enchanting, magical experience, but for some kids, that would have been a tall order.Watership Down (1978)  82%(Photo by Avco Embassy courtesy Everett Collection)It doesn’t take long for&nbsp;Watership Down&nbsp;to shed its “cute bunny film” facade and reveal a deeper allegory that flows red with blood. This adaptation of Richard Adams’ novel follows a group of rabbits on a perilous journey to find refuge after one of them has an apocalyptic vision about their home. For generations,&nbsp;Watership Down&nbsp;has traumatized children with haunting imagery of red-eyed rabbits ripping each other’s throats out or suffocating as they’re buried alive, and peril lies around every turn in the story.&nbsp;Walter Chaw of&nbsp;Film Freak Central summed it up succinctly: “Unsentimental and terrifying.”Who Framed Roger Rabbit (1988)  97%(Photo by Buena Vista Pictures)“Wait a second.&nbsp;Who Framed Roger Rabbit&nbsp;is a live-action movie,” you might say, and you’d be (mostly) right, but Robert Zemeckis’ loony live-action/animated hybrid deserves a spot on this list because it features one of Disney’s scariest villains, Christopher Llloyd’s Judge Doom, who — spoiler alert — is actually a cartoon himself. When we first meet Doom, he mercilessly murders an innocent toon without flinching, dumping it into a vat of corrosive “dip.” Then comes the pivotal moment when we discover Doom’s true identity; as played by Lloyd, he already resembled a half-desiccated corpse, a cross between the evil preacher from the&nbsp;Poltergeist&nbsp;movies and the&nbsp;Gestapo officer from&nbsp;Raiders of the Lost Ark who gets his face melted off.&nbsp;But once he’s run over by the streamroller and pops back up, Doom is another beast altogether and the stuff of childhood nightmares.The Black Cauldron was released on July 24, 1985.Did we leave out one of your favorites?

For those of you who were hotly anticipating Sam Raimi’s return to the horror genre, you’ll be pleased to know that Drag Me to Hell is finally available on DVD and Blu-Ray, and fans of the sleeper hit animated series Futurama will positively geek out at the latest collection to hit shelves. Marvel loyalists will get a second chance to check out a few of their new animated films, and we’ll put you onto a couple of good indie flicks that failed to get much exposure. Have a look at what’s coming out and beef up that collection.[tomatometer]MuzeID=1198119[/tomatometer]Drag Me to HellDirector Sam Raimi earned a great deal of goodwill and respect from moviegoers with his work on the Evil Dead series, and many consider those his best films. So it was with great anticipation that audiences looked forward to his return to the horror genre with Drag Me to Hell, particularly after Spider-Man 3. Though the film was rated PG-13, Raimi amped up the “eww” factor with plenty of bodily fluids, capitalized on his dark sense of humor, and utilized the same sort of ambient tension that made the Evil Dead films so effective, and the result was an all-around crowd-pleaser. Alison Lohman plays a loan officer at a bank who denies a mysterious old woman an extension and earns herself a deadly curse in return — she must find a way to remove the curse, or in three days time, she’ll be, you know, dragged to hell. Simple, but oh so effective. You can pick up the movie this week on DVD and Blu-Ray; special features include production video diaries and a featurette, among other things.[tomatometer]MuzeID=1189343[/tomatometer]Land of the LostFor as popular and low-risk as remaking pop-culture icons must seem, remaking Land of the Lost looked like nothing but a gamble, even with heavy hitters like Will Ferrell and Danny McBride on the line. Sid and Marty Kroft’s show, which began in the mid 70s then resurrected very temporarily in the early 90s, followed characters Rick, Will and Holly (here played by Pushing Daisies‘s Anna Friel) through space and time to a “Lost” place where Sleestaks and Dinosaurs mix freely with giant crustaceans, Roman galleys, B-52s and Ice Cream Trucks. DVD features include deleted scenes, a fake ad for Devil’s Canyon, and a short called “A Day in the life of a Big Movie Star,” while Blu-Ray editions include more deleted scenes, Dr. Marshall’s food dairies, and a making-of featurette, among others.[tomatometer]MuzeID=1206888[/tomatometer]The ProposalSandra Bullock has had a rough time as of late; 2007’s Premonition earned a meager 8% on the Tomatometer, and All About Steve, which opened just over a month ago, actually managed to make it onto our 2000-2009 Worst of the Worst list. The one recent semi-bright spot was The Proposal, which opened in June. Though the movie was also rated Rotten overall by critics, many cited the onscreen chemistry between Bullock and co-star Ryan Reynolds as a strength, and for all its formulaic turns of plot, there were still some funny moments to be had. It doesn’t break any new ground in the rom-com genre, but it might be worth a bowl of popcorn on a rainy day. You can pick it up on DVD and Blu-Ray this week.Futurama: The Complete CollectionOne megahit animated series just wasn’t enough for Matt Groening, so he figured he’d create another one. Okay, sure, it probably wasn’t that easy, even for the creator of The Simpsons, but we’re sure glad he decided to do it, because Futurama turned out quite brilliant. Though the series went off the air after just four way-too-short seasons, it was recently announced by Comedy Central that 26 new episodes would be created for 2010, and seemingly in preparation for that, Fox is releasing an amazing Complete Collection. The DVD set comes with 19 discs that hold every episode of the series, plus the four direct-to-video feature length movies that have been made since the show’s cancellation. There are commentaries, easter eggs, deleted scenes, and lots of other goodies, but the crown jewel might just be the packaging: a giant Bender head, complete with detachable antenna.[tomatometer]MuzeID=1020092[/tomatometer]The StepfatherThe 1987 version of The Stepfather appears on DVD this week, just in time for the film’s update of the same name to hit theaters this Friday. Terry O’Quinn (John Locke on TV’s LOST) stars as Gerard “Jerry” Blake, who’s a perversion of Reagan era Family Values if ever there was one. Half Prince Charming, Half Ted Bundy, Jerry Blake has a clear idea of what his family is supposed to be, and the genteel and dashing O’Quinn plays him so smoothly it’s not hard to see how divorcees and widows might take to his intensely protective interest in them. Of course, family life looks different once you enter it, and Mr. Blake has issues when things look, shall we say, less than ideal. Out October 13th, the DVD includes a featurette about the film’s legacy and the novel that also inspired a sequel, as well as a commentary track with director Jason Ruben.[tomatometer]MuzeID=1088009[/tomatometer]South Park: Bigger, Longer &amp; Uncut – Blu-RayWhat Would Brian Boitano Do? Well, if he’s in the market for a good DVD, the 10th anniversary editon Blu-Ray of South Park: Bigger, Longer &amp; Uncut might do the trick. One of the most manic, profane, and perversely amusing animated features of recent years, South Park has enough wacky songs, inspired political commentary, and out-and-out naughtiness to recommend it – even if we don’t have Saddam Hussein to kick around anymore. This new release features audio commentary from Trey Parker and Matt Stone, as well as a music video for “What Would Brian Boitano Do?”[tomatometer]MuzeID=1206666[/tomatometer]American VioletOne of the noteworthy independent releases coming out this week is a little seen film called American Violet, starring newcomer Nicole Beharie and directed by Tim Disney (that’s right, the grandnephew of Walt Disney). Based on a true story, American Violet is about a Texas woman with no prior criminal history who is thrown in jail on suspicion of dealing drugs. She must make a choice between staying in jail and fighting the charges, which could result in the loss of custody of her children, or plead guilty and return home a disgraced woman. The film came in just below Certified Fresh status at 72%, and critics applauded Beharie’s performance in particular. You can pick it up on DVD and Blu-Ray tomorrow.Marvel Animation – 6-Film SetAlso coming out this week is a collection of 6 previously released direct-to-video feature length films from the guys at Marvel. We’ll start by saying that if you’re looking for any new special features to accompany this package, you won’t find them. The collection is simply that: a collection, specifically of the already available editions of each film. However, if you’re a die hard Marvel fan who, perhaps, might not have seen many of them, then here’s your chance to snatch them all up en masse. The six movies you’ll be getting are Ultimate Avengers, Ultimate Avengers 2, The Invincible Iron Man, Doctor Strange, Next Avengers, and Hulk Vs., along with the extras already available on all of them individually.[tomatometer]MuzeID=1209567[/tomatometer]Every Little StepTo paraphrase its show-stopping signature number, A Chorus Line truly was a singular sensation, merging the real-life tales of showbiz vets with the razzle-dazzle of the Great White Way. The Certified Fresh documentary Every Little Step focuses on the 2005 revival, but also make plenty of time for the 1974 original, chronicling the show’s history, past and present. The DVD features cast and crew interviews, deleted scenes, and director’s commentary.[tomatometer]MuzeID=1054150[/tomatometer]Natural Born Killers – Blu-RayOliver Stone’s stylistically bold meditation on our tabloid media culture generated a ton of controversy upon its release in 1994. Specifically, the level of violence was enough raise the hackles of cultural gatekeepers. Critics were mixed as well; while some found Stone’s rapid-fire methods exhilarating, others thought his satirical aims were muddled at best. The Blu-Ray includes several featurettes, an introduction and commentary track from Oliver Stone, a 44-page booklet, an alternate ending and loads of deleted scenes.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"awards, TV, Geo, james, thriller, Elton, Guide, Adventures, TV, female","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"RT-on-DVD-Drag-Me-to-Hell-and-All-of-Futurama"},{"id":"47613173967288","title":"RT on DVD & Blu-Ray: Bad Lieutenant: Port of Call New Orleans","content":"RT on DVDvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})RT on DVD &amp; Blu-Ray: Bad Lieutenant: Port of Call New OrleansPlus a handful of 80s classics and Peter Jackson's epic trilogy on Blu-Ray.by RT Staff | April 6, 2010 |  CommentsWhat can we say? This isn’t a very robust week for home releases on video, so we’ve done the best we could to come up with some noteworthy (in one way or another) choices. Not all of these are going to be everyone’s cup of tea, but there are at least a couple of entries that should be widely appealing, if only for nostalgic purposes. The two selections competing for most interesting this week are a Werner Herzog-Nicolas Cage collaboration that many critics felt was Cage’s best performance in years (if not his entire career), while the other is Peter Jackson’s epic fantasy trilogy (do we even need to specify it by name?). We made the best of what was out there, so hopefully something here strikes your fancy.[tomatometer]MuzeID=1209562[/tomatometer]Bad Lieutenant: Port of Call New OrleansWerner Herzog has stated in so many words that Bad Lieutenant: Port of Call New Orleans is not intended to be taken as either a remake or a sequel to Abel Ferrara’s 1992 film Bad Lieutenant. While the films do share a title, as well as a central character who is a corrupt cop that regularly indulges in gambling and various drugs, Port of Call New Orleans takes on a slightly campier tone, what with Nicolas Cage in the lead. Here, Cage plays a Louisiana cop who injures his back and becomes addicted to prescription drugs as a result; as he tracks down suspects in a post-Katrina murder case, he sinks deeper and deeper into the dirty underworld of New Orleans. Critics largely praised the film, helping it to a Certified Fresh 85% on the Tomatometer, and many singled out Cage’s performance as one of the best of his career. Port of Call New Orleans didn’t open very wide, though, so if you’re curious to see the movie that many feel Cage was perfectly cast for, then you can pick this up this week.[tomatometer]MuzeID=1014762[/tomatometer]The Natural – Blu-RayAnother classic hitting Blu-Ray this week is Barry Levinson’s beloved sports drama The Natural, starring Robert Redford, Robert Duvall, Glenn Close, and Kim Basinger, among others. The inspiring story of a young baseball player who meets with tragedy early in his life and attempts a professional comeback as a 35-year-old was adapted from a novel of the same name and is considered one of the best sports films ever made, incorporating elements of baseball’s grassroots origins and historical significance, and creating a sort of mythology of its own. The new Blu-Ray comes with the same extras found on the standard definition Director’s Cut DVD, which include several featurettes on the making of the film and baseball in general, with appearances by former players like Ryne Sandberg, Don Mattingly, and Cal Ripken, Jr, as well as a featurette on Eddie Waitkus, the former MLB player who was shot by a stalker and who was one of the inspirations for the novel upon which The Natural was based. Fans of great sports films, Robert Redford, or Barry Levinson will all enjoy the movie, which you can pick up this week in its Blu-Ray reissue.Battlestar Galactica: The Complete Series – Blu-RayIn 2004, a classic sci-fi TV series from the 70s was resurrected with updated special effects and storylines that regularly referenced or paralleled current world events. The result was a highly successful new show that developed a bit of a cult following all its own and ran for four seasons. Now, the complete series of Battlestar Galactica has already been made available in Blu-Ray before, but that set came in a large box with a collectible Cylon head included. While many fans thought, “Free memorabilia? Cool!”, there were obviously some who just wanted the discs themselves in more traditional packaging. Well, that time has come, as BSG is being released in its entirety in a simple box set that’ll be available this week. If you held off on picking up the series before because you had no interest in the nifty Cylon, then now’s your chance to grab the set in a box that isn’t so hard to file away next to your other DVDs.Icons of Suspense: Hammer FilmsIts proof of powerful cinema that we can’t talk about slaughter on camera without invoking the ghost of one particular shower-related slashing from 1960. Well, Hammer Studios did for the post-Victorian button-up-your-collar prescriptions of Jolly Old England what J-Horror does for the uptight codes of Japanese business and society. However, Hammer Studios made more than BLOOD AND BOOBS pictures, and the fancy thing about this DVD box set (an international package out on Region 1) is its interest in Suspense over Gore or Fantasy. Cyril Frankel’s Never Take Candy from a Stranger, the Box set’s rarest inclusion, is a class-conscious drama about an elderly child molester with impeccable standing in the small town where he does his (ew) work. Plus, well after Michael Powell got publicly lambasted because of the release of his masterpiece Peeping Tom (aka The British Psycho), Hammer producer and executive Michael Carreras made Maniac (1963), a serial killer tale with plenty of nods to its British expat’s precursor. But the jewel in the crown may be Joe Losey’s 1964 These Are the Damned (aka The Damned), and it rolls around in all the angst of the classic exploitation film: backwater teens, atomic anxiety, technology-imposed human mutation, etc. There are six titles in this box, each of them skating lines of social acceptability; gotta love what’s borne of repression.Madonna’s Sticky &amp; Sweet Tour – Blu-RayOnly a few inches from the moral decrepitude and gaudy confusion of Hammer Horror we have Madonna’s Sticky Sweet Tour blu-ray. Those not in the know about Madge’s tours on DVD will think this is a sequel to Truth or Dare, but it turns out it’s the singer’s most extensively attended tour yet. Something like 3.5 million fans in 32 countries saw this Live Nation production and now Live Nation is helping the other bajillion fans and facebook gripers fill the gap in their soul left by missing that tour live. Ah, the magic of Blu-Ray. Fancy bit: the show was shot in Argentina and the highlight of that particular stop was a stand-alone performance of “Don’t Cry for Me Argentina.” Classics like “Material Girl” and “Borderline” are present along with newer titles like “Beat Goes On” (reportedly featuring Kanye) and “Get Stupid.” Behind the scenes bonus features included. And yes, that’s right, you just read an RT on DVD writeup for a Madonna concert DVD… Don’t blame us; blame the studios for releasing almost nothing this week![tomatometer]MuzeID=1004422[/tomatometer]Cocoon – Blu-RayAnother 1980s phenomenon finds its way to Blu-Ray this week, as Ron Howar”s 1985 sci-fi tearjerker Cocoon gets its first high definition rerelease. For those unfamiliar with the film: the story revolves around a handful of senior citizens at a rest home who discover strange alien pods resting at the bottom of their pool; when the seniors decide to take a dip anyway, they discover they feel rejuvenated in both mind and body, and this creates a stir amongst the rest of the residents. Starring a slew of distinguished older actors, including Don Ameche, Hume Cronyn, Jessica Tandy, Wilford Brimley, and more, Cocoon ultimately won two Oscars (including a Best Suporting Actor trophy for Ameche) and even spawned a sequel three years later. Special features include a Ron Howard commentary as well as featurettes on the actors’ underwater training, how the Antareans (the aliens) were created, and a general making-of special.The Lord of the Rings: The Motion Picture Trilogy Blu-RayPeter Jackson made a name for himself when he adapted one of the most beloved (if not THE most beloved) fantasy novel series of all time, the Lord of the Rings trilogy. None of the three epic masterpieces he crafted received any lower than a 92% Tomatometer rating, and the series culminated in a multiple Oscar-winning finale with 2003’s The Return of the King. Now, watching the entire series in one sitting would be quite a feat, but if you really wanted to, now you can finally do it in Blu-Ray, as the LOTR trilogy is finally available in high definition. For those who haven’t yet experienced Middle Earth in all its glory and intrigue, what better way to make the introduction than on Blu-Ray? One thing to note here is that the box set contains the theatrical versions of each film, so you hardcore fans out there may have to wait just a little bit longer to get the extended editions in this format, but if you liked the theatrical versions just fine, then you’d be doing yourself a disservice not to snatch this up right away.Written by Ryan Fujitani and Sara Schieron","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"crime, TV, wars, 007, FXX, cinematic, canceled, Baby, drama, Marvel, toronto, Wars, Max, Family, Carpet","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"RT-on-DVD-and-Blu-Ray-Bad-Lieutenant-Port-of-Call-New-Orleans"},{"id":"47613188665791","title":"The Damned United – A Photo Primer","content":"var mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})The Damned United - A Photo Primerby Orlando Parfitt | March 27, 2009 |  CommentsBack in 1970s, before the Premiership, Sky TV and WAGS came to characterise the beautiful game, football managers were almost exclusively gruff Northerners who smoked 60 a day and avoided publicity like the plague. That is part from Brian Clough, perhaps the most charismatic, media-savvy and complex manager to have graced the sport. The film tells the story of the most bizarre spell of his otherwise illustrious career, but for those not up on their 70s football, here’s our frankly indispensible visual guide to The Damned United.The man himself played by the current master of the celebrity impersonation, Michael Sheen. A legendary figure because of his charismatic personality and plethora of one-liners, it’s also sometimes forgotten just how successful Clough actually was in his prime in the late 60s and 70s.The movie revolves around Clough’s ill-fated spell in charge of Leeds United. At this point they were the league champions and one of the best teams in Europe. He is seen here being welcomed by fans, but the manager soon made enemies after making it clear how much he still despised the club. Much of the David Peace’s novel (the source material for the film) is made up of psychological speculation as to why Clough took the job — did he want to destroy the club from the inside? Did he deliberately sabotage his time there to somehow punish himself for accepting the role?The main reason for Clough’s hatred was former Leeds manger Don Revie (seen here played sinisterly by Colm Meanie). The film opens with Revie somewhat reluctantly leaving his job to take over the England national team. The team Revie built was extremely successful (they won every trophy going except the European cup) but were despised by many — especially Clough — for their negative play, arrogance, and cynical attitude towards the game. Leg-breaking tackles and referee intimidation were just some of the tactics espoused by Revie.In contrast, Clough’s managerial style was good football (“If God had wanted us to play football in the clouds, he’d have put grass up there” is a famous Clough-ism) and gentlemanly behaviour on and off the pitch. Clough built his reputation with this management style whilst he was in charge at Derby County. The film moves back and forth between his time at Leeds and this highly successfully spell at the Midlands’ club. We see here his Derby side taking on Revie’s brutal Leeds in their first year in the first division. Amazingly, despite having just been promoted, Derby would go onto win the league, just pipping Leeds themselves to the title.Clough’s genius lay in his man-management, which — usually in conjunction with assistant manager Peter Taylor — varied from arms-around-the-shoulder empathy to full on hysterical bollockings, depending on the situation and the players’ personalities. This approach, however, failed miserably when he got to Leeds, and he had to try and tame Revie’s players, especially the likes of (from left to right) Johnny Giles, Billy Bremner, Norman Hunter and Trevor Cherry. He alienated them from the beginning by famously telling them, “you won all your medals by cheating.”Probably the most important factor in Clough’s nightmare spell at Leeds however was the failure of his longtime assistant, Peter Taylor, played by Timothy Spall in the movie, to move up north and join him at the club. One of the greatest talent-spotters the game’s ever seen, he was also the only person to say “no” to Clough. They had a complex relationship, however, with the quiet and taciturn Taylor constantly feeling undervalued and underappreciated compared to the flashy Clough. The pair eventually acrimoniously parted ways for good whilst at Nottingham Forest in 1982. Clough never won a major Trophy without Taylor by his side.The film switches back to Clough’s time at Derby late in the film, and shows how his combustible personality and distrust of authority lost him (and Peter Taylor) their jobs. Constantly clashing with County chairman Sam Longson (a suitably slimy performance from Jim Broadbent), who resented Clough’s fame and influence, he eventually resigned due to perceived boardroom interference – though he was just using this a ploy to get Longson sacked, and never believed his resignation would be accepted.One of the final set pieces of the movie is a joint interview Clough did for Yorkshire TV after his sacking from Leeds with Don Revie. The real-life broadcast went down in football history for the barely repressed loathing and disgust both men showed towards each other, with Clough telling Revie “I wanted to win the league, but I wanted to win it better!” Clough would go onto win two European cups with Nottingham Forest, whilst Revie would fail as England manager.The Damned United is released today in the UK and on 13th August in Australia. The US release is to be confirmed.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"Festival, Pet","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"the-damned-united-a-photo-primer"},{"id":"47613200557509","title":"RT on DVD: Rachel Getting Married, Milk Lead Super Fresh New Releases","content":"RT on DVDvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})RT on DVD: Rachel Getting Married, Milk Lead Super Fresh New ReleasesLet the Right One In, Batman Anthology also hit shelves.by Jen Yamato | March 9, 2009 |  CommentsHome video enthusiasts, prepare yourself for what may be the best week ever! This week you’ll have to choose between Academy Award flicks Rachel Getting Married (Best Actress Nominee, Anne Hathaway) and Milk (Best Actor, Sean Penn), plus a few films that should have been honored at this year’s Oscars (Happy-Go-Lucky, Let the Right One In). Next, consider a Certified Fresh comedy (Role Models), a Charlie Kaufman original (Synecdoche, New York), and a pair of period pics (Cadillac Records, The Boy in the Striped Pajamas). We won’t judge if you give Jason Statham’s latest a spin (Transporter 3), but we do insist that Blu-ray viewers pay attention to a few key re-mastered releases (Pinocchio 70th Anniversary Edition, The Batman Anthology). Dig in to RT on DVD for more!Rachel Getting Married — 87%Anne Hathaway put those Princess Diaries days behind her with an excellent (and Oscar-nominated) performance as Kym, a recovering drug addict who powers her way through her sister’s wedding like a locomotive in Jonathan Demme‘s Rachel Getting Married. Director Demme, best known for making films like The Silence of the Lambs (and in recent years, the acclaimed documentaries Neil Young: Heart of Gold and Jimmy Carter: Man from Plains), lends the proceedings the feel of a verité film, his viewer another guest at the weekend nuptials; the script from Jenny Lumet (Sidney’s daughter) stings and warms in equal measure.One notable DVD featurette examines the film’s eclectic soundtrack, which includes songs from Robyn Hitchcock (who performs on-screen during the wedding), and TV on the Radio’s Tunde Adembimpe (who in a key role, plays Rachel’s fiancé). Deleted scenes, a cast and crew Q&amp;A, and two commentary tracks highlight the remainder of the bonus menu. Watch an exclusive clip below.Next: Watch Sean Penn’s Oscar-winning performance in MilkMilk — 93%Two weeks ago on Oscar night, a pair of acceptance speeches reminded us that sometimes movies are about more than just entertainment. Both Sean Penn (who won the Academy Award for Best Actor) and Dustin Lance Black (who won for Best Original Screenplay) honored slain San Francisco politician and gay rights advocate Harvey Milk, whose life and work became the basis for Gus Van Sant’s moving biopic, Milk. Penn, no stranger to politics, and Black, a Mormon-raised gay writer who thanked Milk for helping him overcome his own struggles, are just two reasons to pick up the triumphant, bittersweet period drama this week. (Need another reason? It’s among the best-reviewed films of 2008.)Bonus features include deleted scenes and three featurettes on the real-life Harvey Milk and the intersection of Hollywood and gay rights.Next: The best movie you didn’t see in 2008, Let the Right One InLet the Right One In — 97%A piece of future advice for 2010: don’t get caught buying a ticket to the American remake of Let the Right One In without having seen the original. This Swedish vampire tale, adapted by writer John Ajvide Lindqvist from his own novel and directed by Tomas Alfredson, is a quiet miracle of a film that, in this writer’s opinion, deserved a shot at the Foreign Oscar race (it went un-nominated by its home country). Part fang horror, part coming-of-age romance, Let the Right One In tells the story of young, bullied Oskar (Kare Hedebrant) and his new neighbor, Eli (Lina Leandersson), a girl who appears to be Oskar’s age but in fact is a blood-drinking vampire who must keep her secret from the public eye; when her older human caretaker leaves (was he once, like Oskar, young and in love with Eli?) the pair turn to one another for help and companionship, captured poetically by Alfredson. It’s one of the most beautiful — and dark, and darkly humorous — films of last year, and a much-needed jumpstart to a genre that’s become reliant on mediocrity and gore.Deleted scenes and a making-of documentary comprise a disappointingly light special features menu, but if sales do well don’t be surprised to get a commentary track on an eventual double dip.Next: Catch Sally Hawkins’ infectious cheer in Happy-Go-Lucky!Happy-Go-Lucky — 93%Should British actress Sally Hawkins have earned an Oscar nomination for her portrayal of a supremely cheerful school teacher in Mike Leigh‘s Happy-Go-Lucky? We say yes, but judge for yourself this week as the intimate, infectious film makes its way to home video. Through a series of real-life trials that might test the patience of any normal person, the effervescent Poppy (Hawkins, who workshopped the role with Leigh) maintains a smile no matter how rough life gets — to the consternation of her grumpy driving instructor, Scott (a hilariously on-edge Eddie Marsan), and perhaps, also to viewers. Only a few extra features are to be found here, including a commentary track by director Leigh, although one behind-the-scenes featurette in particular provides insight into the creation of the film and of the Poppy character, whose bliss is anything but ignorant.Next: Raunchy laughs with Paul Rudd and Seann William Scott in Role ModelsRole Models — 76%Director David Wain has had a hit-or-miss career with his comedies (I blame that Stella sense of humor) but his latest flick, Role Models, is a solid combination of crass humor, strong characterizations, and dorkiness of the RPG-playing kind. Which is to say, I was sold. The Certified Fresh comedy — a rarity these days, unless your name is Judd Apatow — follows energy drink-selling buddies Danny and Wheeler (Paul Rudd and Seann William Scott) sentenced to mentor a pair of troubled kids as community service: sword-wielding LARP devotee (that’s Live Action Role Playing game to you non-nerds), Augie (Christopher Mintz-Plasse, AKA Superbad‘s McLovin’) and foul-mouthed troublemaker Ronnie (Bobb’e J. Thompson, who steals the show).The DVD includes both the theatrical cut and an uncut version that runs three minutes longer, as well as a host of featurettes/deleted scenes/alternate takes. Look for Knocked Up OB-GYN Ken Jeong in a scene-stealing role as the king of Augie’s role-playing realm.Next: Charlie Kaufman’s challenging Synecdoche, New YorkSynecdoche, New York — 62%If you’re a fan of Charlie Kaufman, chances are you’re enamored of the signature complexities of his screenplays for films like Being John Malkovich, Adaptation, and Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. Well, if you like those Kaufman flicks, just try to wrap your mind around his latest, which also marks his directorial debut. Synecdoche, New York tells the story of a struggling playwright (Philip Seymour Hoffman) who decides to mount his life’s greatest work — an autobiographical play with no ending — in a giant warehouse, casting actors to play himself and his loved ones until the whole thing takes on a meta-quality that will have you scratching your head well past the end credits. It’s impressive stuff, if fairly impenetrable; as Roger Ebert advises, see it twice. Four DVD featurettes, including a Blogger’s Roundtable discussion of the film with Glenn Kenny, Walter Chaw, Andrew Grant, Karina Longworth, and Chris Beaubien, should help you filter Kaufman’s opus.Next: Transporter 3 the worst of the franchise, but hey — it’s Jason Statham!Transporter 3 — 37%There are two kinds of people in the world: those who actually want to see Transporter 3, and those who wouldn’t do it for a million bucks. (There’s also my kind — people who had to see it and wish they didn’t.) While the first Transporter (53%) is a straight-up pleasure, and the second (51%) is more of a guilty one, this third flick — directed by Olivier Megaton, who named himself after Hiroshima — is a slim imitation of a Transporter movie, and features the worst actress of the entire franchise (newcomer Natalya Rudakova, who was apparently discovered by Luc Besson on the street). But if you like the idea of watching Jason Statham fight baddies using a dress shirt as a weapon (all the while getting increasingly unclothed), then Transporter 3 might not feel like a complete waste of time.Next: Beyonce, Mos Def sing the blues in Cadillac RecordsCadillac Records — 68%If soul music is your bag, then Cadillac Records should be worth a rental; the biographical tale of Chess Records, the studio that brought musicians like Etta James (Beyonce Knowles) and Muddy Waters (Jeffrey Wright) to the masses in the 1960s, earned decent enough reviews but critics agreed the light drama coasted on the strength of its music. Adrien Brody stars as Leonard Chess, the R&amp;B-loving businessman who made it all happen; Beyonce, Wright, and Mos Def (as Chuck Berry) hit all the right notes in performing their own songs. Featurettes, deleted scenes, and a commentary by director Darnell Martin supplement the disc.Next: Holocaust dramatics in The Boy in the Striped PajamasThe Boy in the Striped Pajamas — 63%A German boy befriends a Jewish prisoner and begins to question the Nazi way of life in this Holocaust drama, which drew mixed reviews from critics. While some thought it among the best films of the year, others criticized its execution and the decision to turn an event as horrific as the Holocaust into a parable. Deleted scenes, a making-of featurette, and a commentary track by writer/director Mark Herman and author John Boyne, who wrote the original book of the same name.Next: Pinocchio celebrates his 70th birthday on Blu-rayPinocchio: 70th Anniversary Edition on Blu-ray — 100%It’s hard to believe that Disney’s classic adventure Pinocchio is already celebrating its 70th birthday, but what’s even more incredible is how good a job the Mouse House has done with this Blu-ray release; every single scene is a dazzling work of art. Disney’s remastering process has burnished the film with an amazing clarity and richness, so much so that watching Pinocchio again this way is like watching it for the first time. You’ll be swept away by the painterly details that the Blu-ray cut reveals — the way something as simple as an ocean wave laps against another in the background, or how the camera turns to follow Pinocchio walk up and down a street despite the medium’s two-dimensional constraints.Fans of the wooden hero (or of Disney animation history in general) should employ either the new pop up trivia track or the “Cine-Explore” track featuring film critic Leonard Maltin, animator Eric Goldberg, and J.B. Kaufman. In addition to behind-the-scenes documentary features that cover all things Pinocchio, Disney has included deleted scenes (told via storyboards), production galleries, archival trailers from every one of Pinocchio‘s theatrical releases, games, alternate viewing options (including the original 1.33:1 aspect ratio), and, as with Disney’s Blu-ray titles, a standard DVD of the film. Wish upon a star for this stellar (and limited edition!) Blu-ray release.Next: Batman: The Motion Picture Anthology on Blu-rayBatman: The Motion Picture Anthology 1989-1997 on Blu-ray — N/AIt’s that Bat-time, people: time to sit down with all four pre-Nolan Batman flicks and revisit the franchise before the franchise, from Batman (69%) to Batman Returns (77%) to Batman Forever (44%) to Batman &amp; Robin (12%)! Warner Bros. is releasing all four films to DVD and Blu-ray (each in their own 2-disc Special Edition), and though the set does not include either Batman Begins (84%) or The Dark Knight (94%) (or the camp-tastic 1966 version), keep in mind that a double and triple dip is inevitable. That said, if you’re a Batman completist and love the high def format, you’ll find that these remastered flicks look and sound good even one to two decades after initial release. Just watch out for those Blu-ray-enhanced codpieces.A host of commentary tracks, deleted scenes, featurettes, and even a four-film spanning “Shadows of the Bat” documentary come within the box set, though there are no added materials beyond what has already appeared in the anthology on standard DVD.Until next week, happy renting!","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"all-time, Sematary, lee, GoT, Awards, Emmys","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"RT-on-DVD-Rachel-Getting-Married-Milk-Lead-Super-Fresh-New-Releases"},{"id":"47613213892045","title":"UK Critics Consensus: Was W.

Wicked? Is Pride &amp; Glory Proud and Glorious?Plus; Easy Virtue, Does Biel Appeal?by Tom Butler | November 7, 2008 |  CommentsThis week in the UK cinemas we have Oliver Stone’s latest presidential dissection, the George W. Bush biopic W. with Josh Brolin in the title role. Also out is Pride &amp; Glory, a US cop thriller with a stellar cast, and an adaptation of the Noel Coward play, Easy Virtue, starring Jessica Biel and British stalwart Colin Firth. But what did the UK critics have to say?In a momentous and historical week when the USA got shot of President Bush and replaced him with a newer, shinier model, Oliver Stone’s latest film W. hits the UK cinema screens with some mischievous scheduling at play. Never shy of making incendiary political pictures, this is Stone’s third presidential picture, following JFK (84% on the Tomatometer) and Nixon (74% on the Tomatometer), but where does W. stand in comparison? At a rather bland, almost Fresh but not quite, 57% on the Tomatometer, it seems that W. doesn’t quite stand shoulder to shoulder with Stones previous political polemics. The critics enjoyed the performances in the film, with Josh Brolin being tipped for honours in the award season, and the stellar supporting cast putting in quality turns.Reviewers also applauded the films warmth, humour and honesty in its portrayal of a man who, rather than being the embodiment of imperialist evil, was actually simply out of his depth. This approach angered others however, with many grumbling at Stone’s apparently toothless and even handed approach to the subject. The director was accused of pulling his punches with a flippant and neutral film that many are calling a missed opportunity. Made on a shoestring budget, and rushed out to meet its election time scheduling, the film has also been derided for its cheap production values and throwaway nature. So not classic Stone then; and another example of his fading powers perhaps?Pride &amp; Glory is a cop procedural that brings together two of modern cinema’s more enigmatic and possibly problematic stars; Edward Norton and Colin Farrell. Norton’s last film was Marvel’s The Incredible Hulk reboot (a decent 67% on the Tomatometer), and Farrell has had a mixed year so far with the disappointing Woody Allen flick Cassandra’s Dream (49%) and the hilarious In Bruges (81% on the Tomatometer). So how would they do when they share the screen in Pride and Glory? Not very well as it turned out. At a measly 35% Pride and Glory has been dismissed by the critics for being a cliché ridden, predictable and hackneyed picture despite a decent turn from Edward Norton. Macho, derivative, generic and unforgivable are just some of the many adjectives used by the hacks to describe Pride and Glory, which means the film shouldn’t be proud, or expect to bathe in any glory at all.Easy Virtue is a big screen adaptation of the Noel Coward play of the same name, which recently showed at the London Film Festival. Starring the stunning Jessica Biel as Larita, the glamorous American bride recently married to Ben Barnes‘ English gent John Whittaker, who is brought to 1920s England to meet the stuffy parents. Some critics enjoyed the films fizzy and breezy tone, along with performances from the stars who deliver the witty dialogue with playful ease. Others however were less amused, slamming the film for its lack of laughs, heavy-handed approach to the source material, and its smug and irksome soundtrack, which may have been better suited to the small screen. Currently standing at 53% on the Tomatometer, Easy Virtue has not been given an easy ride by the UK critics.Also worth checking out this week…Let’s Talk About The Rain — A loose and subtle French ensemble comedy of manners with solid performances and a few witty one liners. 77% on the Tomatometer.OSS 117: Cairo, Nest Of Spies – This clever spy spoof plays politics and movie conventions for laughs and features a great turn by Jean Dujardin as a smarmy-suave nouveau-Bond. 76% on the Tomatometer.Quote Of The Week“A detonation of flatulent, macho-sentimental gibberish is what this ugly and violent film positively farts out of the screen at you.”Pride And Glory.

OSS 117: Cairo Nest of SpiesRT Obscura 12: Celebrating the other 2006 spy franchise reboot from France.by Kim Newman | February 21, 2008 |  CommentsRT Obscura, the exclusive column by renowned critic Kim Newman, sees the writer plumbing the depths of the RT archive in search of some forgotten gems. In his twelfth column, Kim scoots back to 2006 and discovers that year’s other spy franchise reinvigoration from France.Just as the new version of Casino Royale thoroughly reworked and revitalised the flagging 007 franchise for the new millennium, OSS 117: Le Caire nid d’Espions (2006) brings back France’s equivalent spy franchise. However, it takes exactly the opposite approach to the Bond property by setting aside dead straight thrills in favour of deadpan laughs.Insouciant agent Hubert Bonisseur de la Bath, who goes by the code-name OSS 117, was created by author Jean Bruce in 1949, and has appeared in a library’s worth of pulp adventures. He made his screen debut, played by Ivan Desny, in OSS 117 n’est pas mort (1956), but didn’t click as a screen character until the post-Dr No scramble to put rival suave superspies into pictures.Sometime-Sinbad Kerwin Matthews was Hubert in OSS 117 se déchâine (1963) and Banco à Bangkok pour OSS 117 (1964), with Frederick Stafford taking over for Furia à Bahia pour OSS 117 (1965) and Atout coeur à Tokyo pour O.S.S. 117 (1966), followed by John Gavin in Niente rose per OSS 117 (1968) and Luc Merenda in OSS 117 prend des vacances (1970).Wooden and widescreen, full of gorgeously inexpressive actresses and attractive locations, these mid-range productions all scored English-language releases in the 1960s under bland retitlings (Mission for a Killer, Panic in Bangkok, Murder for Sale) which didn’t push the hero as anything special. Alfred Hitchcock, however, caught at least one of the series and cast Stafford as the bland, OSS 117-like hero of his least-remembered film, Topaz.This new take, courtesy of director Michel Hazanavicius, doesn’t present a Hubert who is as extreme a spoof character as, say, Austin Powers or Maxwell Smart, but does poke gently vicious fun at the spy’s overconfident blind stupidity. With slick hair, a Gene Kelly grin and an array of Rat Pack suits, Jean Dujardin manages a letter-perfect send-up of the heroes of yore. In a black and white prologue, Hubert (with pencil moustache) and his best friend Jack Jefferson (Philippe Lefebvre, who also writes and stars in Tell No One) thwart some Nazis during the last days of the war, all the while laughing insanely and — at least on Hubert’s part — barely repressing their attraction for each other. Then, in 1955, in full colour and sinuous widescreen, Hubert travels from Rome to Cairo to investigate Jack’s apparent death and take over his mission to spy on various factions who are after a shipment of Soviet arms.The basic joke is that, through simple-minded idiocies, Hubert actually causes the Suez crisis which will ultimately lead to the end of France as a colonial power. Furthermore, by getting out of bed early to tell a noisy muezzin to shut up during the call to prayer, radicalises local Muslims (he hasn’t heard of the religion and assumes it won’t catch on) to the extent that his confidence that Westerners will always be welcome throughout the Middle-East is sorely misplaced.Along the way, Hubert exerts his manly prowess in fistcuffs and wrestling with thugs (including a pyramid full of leftover Nazis), has steamy relationships with secretary-cum-rebel Larmina (Bérénice Bejo) and King Farouk’s niece (Aure Atika), is dogged by a djellaba-clad mastermind whose ultimate identity is fairly guessable (but prompts a terrific contradictory flashback joke), persistently misses obvious clues (a match-book with a name scrawled in it) that are literally thrust under his nose, is menaced by various conniving factions (including a Belgian chicken salesman who is furious that the poultry operation France runs as a cover for its local secret service outpost — which Hubert takes a childish delight in — is outperforming his legitimate business), impersonates an Arab cabaret star to do a catchy Eastern-inflected cover of ‘Bambino’ (known in English as ‘With his Little Mandolin’) only to be distracted by the sudden audience acclaim from his actual job of blending into the background, and escapes from certain death when tied up and dropped into the Suez canal (he tells Larmina he’s impressed that Egyptians could have dug this 4000 years ago).The political angle isn’t stressed, and there’s a refreshing refusal to trade in ‘funny foreigner’ comedy stereotypes as Hubert is presented as the only true idiot in the story, with various Arab dignitaries looking on in astonishment as he babbles. Hazanavicius has an eye for cool period trappings and smart compositions, recreating almost exactly the look and style of the original OSS 117 films, from the slick animated titles through the underpopulated panoramic backdrops to the magazine layout costumes. There is a healthy dose of low humour (involving chickens or barely-repressed bisexuality) amid the smart stuff and Dujardin brings just enough heart to the simple-minded, dangerously inept hero (who has never heard of Arabic but has bothered to learn hieroglyphics as prep for his Cairo mission) to make him worth putting up with for a whole film. A sequel is in the works.Like Dujardin’s surfing comedy Brice de Nice, a major hit on its home territory, OSS 117 hasn’t so far been widely exhibited outside France, but is well worth tracking down.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"comic, movies, USA, stand-up, Geographic, Golden, YA","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"kim-newman-on-oss-117-cairo-nest-of-spies"},{"id":"47613219071440","title":"RT on DVD: The Dark Knight Is Here!","content":"RT on DVDvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})RT on DVD: The Dark Knight Is Here!Plus Horton Hears a Who, complete series sets of The Wire and Deadwood, and more.by Jen Yamato | December 8, 2008 |  CommentsWelcome to The Dark Knight DVD week at Rotten Tomatoes! Warner Bros.’ dark, masterful sequel arrives on DVD and Blu-ray Tuesday as one of the most anticipated home video releases of the year. (Stay tuned for RT’s test drive of the Dark Knight BD-Live function, in which fans can record, upload and share their own commentary tracks set to scenes from the film.) Also see what else is new to DVD: The Wire The Complete Series, Deadwood The Complete Series, Horton Hears a Who, Man on Wire, and more!1. The Dark Knight — Two-Disc Special Edition and Blu-ray — 94%So last summer you might have heard of this little character-driven movie, in which a wealthy businessman-turned-crime fighter takes on a diabolical foe named the Joker whilst questioning the negative effects of his lifestyle choice on his fellow citizens. Doesn’t ring a bell? Well, that’s just fine, since this week The Dark Knight hits DVD and Blu-ray in a major way, giving you plenty of opportunity to watch and re-watch Christian Bale match wits with the late, great Heath Ledger in Christopher Nolan’s artful comic book movie sequel.The Dark Knight (Certified Fresh at 94% on the Tomatometer and one of the year’s best-reviewed films) comes to DVD and Blu-ray with a host of special features designed to make you drool like a Pavlovian pup. Here you’ll find galleries of concept art and stills, the Gotham Uncovered documentary, and six episodes of “Gotham Cable’s Premier News Program;” featurettes on the Batpod, the Bat-suit and Hans Zimmer’s score; and all six sequences shot in IMAX, presented as they were originally intended.Of course, these features will look all the better in Blu-ray, which contains a total of three hours of bonus materials. The Dark Knight is also the very first Warner Bros. title to enjoy the BD-Live function, which you can use to create your own video commentary from select scenes from the film and share them with your friends. Below, watch our very own Editor in Chief, Matt Atchity, as he delivers a gripping commentary of his own using The Dark Knight‘s BD-Live function! (And yes, that’s yours truly riding shotgun.)Next: Saddle up with the complete set of Deadwood2. Deadwood – The Complete SeriesLike many of the denizens of its namesake town, HBO’s series Deadwood lived a vibrant, but short, life during its three-season run on television. With the possibility of tele-film sequels now as dead as Wild Bill Hickok, you and your favorite Deadwood fan can take solace in the fact that the entire series is now available in one 19-disc package. And for the low, low price of $179.99!Next: Horton hears a DVD!3. Horton Hears a Who! — 78%Reach back into the far recesses of your memory, beyond the Kung Fu Pandas and Wall-E‘s of this year, all the way back to March — when a little animated flick called Horton Hears a Who debuted in theaters. The Certified Fresh retelling of Dr. Seuss’ original tale delighted critics, who appreciated the whimsical, faithful adaptation of one of the Dr.’s best-loved stories.Pick up the 2-Disc Special Edition for a bonus-packed menu that includes two commentaries (one with the directors and producers, the other with stars Jim Carrey and Steve Carell), tons of deleted scenes and animated screen tests, featurettes, and perhaps most enticing of all, a sneak peek short film featuring the characters Sid and Scrat from the upcoming Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs.Next: Drift away with LOST: Season Four4. LOST – The Complete Fourth SeasonThe hit ABC show LOST bounced back from its mid-life slump with a Season Four that hooked viewers in again — a good thing, since the Castaways only have a few more seasons to go before the series meets its definitive conclusion, as previously announced. In Season Four, catch up with new rivals Jack and Locke, mourn the loss of the beloved (or to many, reviled) Charlie, meet a host of brand new characters from the freighter ship Kahana, and stay riveted as the show that defined “twist” for modern television explores the concept of the flash-forward. Special features include featurettes on LOST‘s location filming, composer Michael Giacchino’s score, deleted scenes and more.Next: One of the year’s best docs: Man on Wire5. Man on Wire – 100%Director James Marsh pieces together a portrait of one of the world’s bravest (or is it dumbest?) man in this critically acclaimed documentary, which also happens to be one of the best reviewed films of the year. In Man on Wire, meet Philippe Petit, a charismatic, iconoclast high wire walker who in the 1970s recruited a band of loyal collaborators to stage the dangerous stunt of walking (sans safety net) between the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center. The spectacle led to a few arrests, granted Petit instant fame, and caused the dissolution of many of his closest relationships, though by his own account the daredevil has absolutely no regrets. Watch this fascinating documentary on DVD, which also features an audio commentary and deleted scenes. Man on Wire made the Oscar documentary shortlist for this year’s nominations.Next: Take home the complete DVD set of The Wire6. The Wire – The Complete SeriesKnow any die-hard fans of HBO’s gritty series The Wire? We guarantee they’ll squeal with delight at unwrapping The Wire: The Complete Series this holiday season. The 23-disc set is essentially a collection of all previous season box sets in one place; included are all five seasons of the celebrated show, as well as special features like cast and crew audio commentaries, three prequel features, and a gag reel. The only hitch? It’ll set you back a cool $299.99, so start saving up.Next: The I Am Legend Blu-ray double dip7. I Am Legend – Ultimate Collector’s Edition Blu-ray — 69%If you bought your copy of I Am Legend the first time it debuted on Blu-ray, you’ll most likely want to bypass this double dip. But if you don’t yet own the Will Smith post-apocalypse thriller in High Definition, this is a great set to consider. While most of the special features were released previously, this set contains some new materials, like a new audio commentary with director Frances Lawrence and screenwriter Akiva Goldsmith. A 40+ page glossy production booklet makes this set a collectible, one supposes.Next: Import John Woo’s Chinese epic, Red Cliff8. Red CliffAsian cinema fans, take heed: John Woo’s highly anticipated historical epic Red Cliff is headed to Blu-ray…and it’s region-free. Despite breaking records in release in Asia, where the first of two feature-length parts has already debuted, Red Cliff has no set U.S. release date; picking up an import Blu-ray disc might be your best bet at watching Woo’s celebrated return to Hong Kong. The epic tale, based on the ancient Battle of Red Cliffs in the year AD 208, stars Takeshi Kaneshiro (Mongol), Tony Leung (Lust, Caution) and was reportedly the most expensive movie in Asian cinema history.Special features include cast interviews and press conferences, photos and a trailer.Until next week, happy renting!","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"The, caribbean, A&E, razzies, blaxploitation, Out, cops, dramedy, Larson, video, Pirates, RT, boxoffice, war, TV","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"RT-on-DVD-The-Dark-Knight-Is-Here"},{"id":"47613205043656","title":"Awards Tour: Writers Guild Winners Announced!","content":"var mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Awards Tour: Writers Guild Winners Announced!The Hurt Locker and Up in the Air gain momentum.by RT Staff | February 20, 2010 |  CommentsThe Writers Guild of America announced its awards for Best Original Screenplay, Adapted Screenplay, and Documentary Screenplay on Saturday night.

Based on 1990 novel Good Omens: The Nice and Accurate Prophecies of Agnes Nutter, Witch by Gaiman and Terry Pratchett, the Amazon Prime limited series tells the story of agents of God and Satan who want to stop the Apocalypse&nbsp;— simply because it sounds like a terrible idea. Fortunately, it seems like the reluctant Antichrist has similar inclinations.Michael Sheen (The Queen) plays angel Aziraphale, and David Tennant (Broadchurch) is demon Crowley. The two first met when Crowley turned into a snake and slipped past Aziraphale into the Garden of Eden to tempt Eve. Theirs has been a fine bromance ever since.Rotten Tomatoes met up with the stars, Gaiman, director Douglas MacKinnon (Doctor Who), and, representing Terry Pratchett’s estate, executive producer Rob Wilkins, ahead of the series’ London premiere to find out just what makes the Amazon Studios and BBC Studios co-production Good Omens such a delicious binge-watching option.1. A Monty Python NonsensibilityStarting out the gate with the credit sequence, the series pays homage to Monty Python.But while in sketch series Monty Python’s Flying Circus, nobody expects the Spanish Inquisition, Agnus Nutter actually does expect the Spanish Inquisition when her time of judgment arrives.2. The Celestial Bromance at Its Core(Photo by Amazon Studios)Aziraphale and Crowley build their lovingly adversarial relationship one historical clash after another – including, during another nod to Monty Python, when Crowley turns up as the Black Knight.&nbsp;Sketches of Aziraphale and Crowley’s bond strengthening over the ages are pure joy and recommend further adventures of the collegial duo. And Welsh actor Sheen and Scottish actor Tennant spark onscreen in a way that critics have hailed.“Most of the show’s charm hinges on the unlikely camaraderie between an Angel and a Demon, played, with considerable gusto, by Michael Sheen and David Tennant,” CNN’s Brian Lowry wrote.New York Magazine’s Keith Phipps wrote, “Good Omens can work only with the right leads, so cheers to bringing in Sheen and Tennant, two actors who know how to make a three-course meal out of understated dialogue and cosmic absurdity.”And, from Allison Shoemaker of RogerEbert.com: “Together, it’s like watching two musicians at the top of their game play a duet; they positively sing.”In a press conference before meeting with reporters, Tennant explained the relationship further.“They’re not particularly good representatives of their respective head offices. They’ve rubbed off on each other, so much, that Crowley’s not that mean anymore, and Aziraphale’s not that holy,” he said. “So, between them, they’ve reached a common ground, and they’ve become each other’s, sort of, significant other, really … They’ve only got each other to rely on, and they’ve become — although they would deny it until the end of time, quite literally, they’re sort of each other’s yin and yang … But, it’s only when you see what head office is like — for instance, when the angel, Gabriel, appears — that you realize how humanized they’ve become by the mortal world, that they really like, quite a lot because it’s got wine.”3. The Obscene Wealth of Talent(Photo by Scott Garfitt/BACKGRID)Sheen and Tennant are just the start. The rest of the cast fills out with an enviable assemblage of talent for serialized entertainment:Jon Hamm (Mad Men) as Archangel Gabriel, who leads the angelic hostAnna Maxwell Martin (The Bletchley Circle) as Beelzebub, leader of the forces of HellJosie Lawrence (Enchanted April) as 17th-century witch Agnes Nutter, who produces the only accurate book of prophecies ever writtenAdria Arjona (True Detective) as Anathema Device, a witch and Agnes Nutter’s descendantMiranda Richardson (Harry Potter franchise) as part-time medium and prostitute Madame TracyMichael McKean (This Is Spinal Tap) as Witchfinder Sergeant ShadwellFrances McDormand (Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri) voices GodBenedict Cumberbatch (The Hobbit film franchise) voices SatanSam Taylor Buck as reluctant Antichrist Adam YoungThe series, a coproduction of Amazon Studios and BBC Studios, is directed by Douglas Mackinnon (Doctor Who) and also features Jack Whitehall, Mireille Enos, Brian Cox, Nick Offerman, Ned Dennehy, Ariyon Bakare, Nina Sosanya, Steve Pemberton, and Mark Gatiss.4. Expertly Drawn Characters(Photo by Amazon Studios)The series’ stars raved about bringing Gaiman and Pratchett’s characters to life.“Nothing is odd about this character; I think she’s entirely relatable. Particularly, the channeling of many, many souls, alive and dead, and riding a motorbike, in a cape, with a former member of Spinal Tap. It’s just part of the day job, really,” Richardson related in a press conference before breaking off to meet with reporters. “It feels like my element. I love it. Transformation and costume and inhabiting of other, but at the same time, the character is, all the characters are, incredibly humane. I just… I love that about this project. That’s what comes across, I think.And what will book fans think, especially given changes like Archangel Gabriel’s expanded role?“I think had we gone into this project without Neil,” Hamm said, “there would have been a different reaction, but because Neil was involved from the get-go and was so involved during the process of making it, it became like a version 2.0. So I think the fan base was jazzed, they were like, Oh my God, we’re getting more, we’re almost getting a sequel or something, we’re getting the extended version, the EP. … We were at New York Comic Con and there were 5,000 people that showed up for a panel discussion. It was bonkers. It was like a rock concert. It didn’t hurt that we had Doctor Who on stage. It was still pretty cool and that was when I was like, Oh yeah there are way more people that are just as excited about this as I am. Worldwide, it’s been published in 70 languages.”5. A Story With Heart(Photo by Mike Marsland/WireImage)Good Omens has a lot of heart. That’s baked into the series by Gaiman, the stars attest.“The writing is absolutely promoting humanity,” Richardson said. “You know, it’s very affirmative and optimistic, really, isn’t it?”“[Neil is] very centered,” she continued. “He knows what he thinks about everything. That doesn’t mean he’s not open. He is completely open. So you ask him a question, and it’s really considered. It’s not, ‘You don’t need to worry about that.’ It’s this is just what’s happened, or I think you should try that, or whatever it is. You know, everything is very considered. It’s great.”Lawrence: “He has time for you, which is wonderful.”Richardson: “Like having Daddy on set.”Lawrence: “Yes, it is, or a beautiful angel.”Hamm also noted that Gaiman brings something different to the process of creating a series.“What Neil really brings to everything he does is the capacity for storytelling,” Hamm said, “and that’s first and foremost. Also I think some people in the more traditional Hollywood aspect, they’re trying to make money. They’re making product, whether it’s a Marvel movie or what have you franchise, they’re not necessarily concerned with storytelling. They’re concerned with IP, or what’s it going to be on the second weekend or what’s the third movie going to be at franchise – Neil just wants to tell a story. That’s how he’s created this career that’s been so wide-ranging, and I think you’re going to see a lot more Neil Gaiman stuff get filmed because the stories are so compelling.”6. The Antichrist Has Never Been More&nbsp;EnchantingAntichrist Adam Young has the wide-eyed English-schoolboy charm of classic heroes like Mark Lester’s 1968 Oliver or any number of Nicholas Nicklebys throughout the cinematic age – until, of course, the boy inherits his powers. Aziraphale and Crowley’s attempts to manage the situation are akin to trying to stop a tornado with a butterfly net — a magical butterfly net, but still.7. Evolved Female Characters(Photo by Scott Garfitt/BACKGRID)Though Good Omens’ main characters, Aziraphale and Crowley, are male, we find engaging and richly drawn women among the secondary stars of the series. Anathema spends most of her time chasing a McGuffin, but in the end contributes greatly to the stop-the-Apocalypse cause.“There’s a big difference between a tough female character and a strong female character and Anathema’s strong, she’s very in her essence,” Arjona said. “She’s a woman and she’s sure of herself and so unsure of what she’s doing and messes up, and she’s flawed and she doesn’t get it right all the time — sometimes she does — and she has this guy that’s following her and never falls into romance. She’s like, ‘I gotta do what I gotta do — maybe after babe. I’ll catch you later.’ She’s doing her own thing and I love that about her, and I wish a lot of other characters would be like that because relatable to me, and I see my friends and the way they deal with their careers and their own life, and it’s very similar to Anathema.”Richardson’s Madame Tracy is a very rich character, who, despite her own flaws, endures a level of verbal abuse and emotional sabotage from Shadwell.“Madame Tracy has her own strengths. She, in some ways, feels a bit retro. I mean, her part is retro, and the fact that she’s making a living in the way she is, is a bit retro. But at the same time she’s providing an incredible help in the community, and she’s also very supportive, and she’s trying to be a little bit life-enhancing … so there are those feminine traits, things showing. She takes care of Shadwell, and she looks out for people. It’s rather lovely, but she’s her own woman.”Good Omens sets out to prove a love bond between the prostitute and the Witchfinder, but where she definitely shuts the door on the risk of her infidelity, his name-calling promises to continue.“I know it is a bit questionable,” Richardson said, “but maybe it’s, pardon the pun, better the devil you know. I don’t know, you know? She’s practical.”8. Unique Artistry(Photo by Amazon)The production design, effects, and costuming on the series lend a distinctive voice to the characters’ surroundings. Several of the actors noted that the costumes and unique environments helped them fully inhabit their characters.“There’s an opportunity to sort of portray this guy as the boss that everyone has, that everyone hates, who’s constantly smiling and telling you, ‘Great job,’ while also subconsciously saying, ‘You’re terrible,’” Hamm related. “And, I’ve worked for that guy before, and I’ve hated him, and it was kind of fun to play. Just like, ‘Everything you’re doing is wrong. Keep going.’ And, I got to wear so much cashmere in this, that it was A: warm, B: soft, C: comfy. But yeah, there was a lot to recommend for being on the heavenly side of thing, from a fabric point of view.”Arjona similarly credited the series’ style choices for aiding her performance: “I just tried on her boots and something happened, and I got really lucky because I didn’t have to do much work after I tried on her boots.”9. An Uncompromised Creative Vision(Photo by Ian Gavan/Getty Images)With Good Omens, Gaiman sought to fulfill a deathbed wish of his collaborator on the book, Terry Pratchett, and so, dug in his heels.“Being the writer was relatively pleasant and entirely stress-free in that nobody was really waiting for this. I wrote it, I promised Terry I would write it, I wrote it, did the adaptation, divided the book into six, every 50 pages: OK, that’s episode one, that’s episode two. Fair enough, I’ll write a mini movie through time that will kick off episode three. That was all simple and very stress free,” Gaiman said.“The problem is that I’d promised Terry Pratchett that I would make a TV show that he would want to watch, and I’d learned through my previous outings in television — some of which have been incredibly successful and some of which hadn’t — that the measure of which were successful and which weren’t were not the quality of the script to begin with; it was what actually wound up on the screen at the end. And I thought, OK, I have to be in a place where I can control that, where I have a director who I can work with who we share a vision with, where I can cast the people who I see in my head, where I’m there just making sure that a producer who — producers don’t understand scripts. I wish they did, but they don’t —”MacKinnon: “Some of them do.”“Some of them do,” Gaiman conceded. “A lot of the time, what a producer will do when they go, ‘OK, we have X amount of money. We have this in the script and here is a sequence that is both expensive and if we lose it, we’ll save a day of filming and nobody’s going to notice if that scene is gone,’ completely failing to understand that if they pull that scene out, nothing that follows it will actually make any more sense. This is something producers have been doing since the dawn of time.“To make this thing for Terry, what I had to do was be in a place where I could just say no when somebody said, ‘So, we think we’re going to lose Shakespeare’s Globe.’ I go, ‘Yeah, no we’re not.’ Sometimes I would come back with, ‘I’ll tell you what. If we need to save that money, we can lose this scene after that you really like but that actually doesn’t change anything. It can go.’”It’s the only instance of anyone tied to Good Omens who we’ve spoken to describing Gaiman’s behavior on the production as anything other than “lovely.”10. Heavenly Irreverence(Photo by Amazon Studios)Both Sheen and Tennant aren’t strangers to supernatural beings; Sheen appeared as Head Lycan in Charge Lucian in the Underworld vampires-versus-werewolves film franchise, then as The Twilight Saga vampire Aro. Tennant, meanwhile, not only played the titular extraterrestrial in Doctor Who for three seasons and in specials as the tenth Doctor, whose abilities were anything but earthly, but also turned up as witch and Voldemort loyalist Barty Crouch, Jr. in Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire.The actors appear to take on these heavenly creatures with ease and a sort of glee.“All those characters like vampires, werewolves, angels, demons, they get reinvented — don’t they? — by each generation, because they come to represent different things for each generation,” Sheen said. “And also budgets have changed. There’s a lot more money to make stuff that can really use those sort of effects quite well. But in terms of Heaven and Hell and angels and demons — the end of time’s and apocalypse is a whole other thing, I suppose — we’re starting to think about slightly differently. I think the angels and demons thing and Heaven and Hell is always partly about going, well you have these two extremes and real life is about somehow being in the middle somewhere and being in the gray area and that’s certainly what, I think, Good Omens is about.”There’s a good chance that Good Omens will ruffle some feathers, but Gaiman isn’t worried.“One of the things that I made a call writing literally page one, which was, I thought, Well, it could be Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden, and they’re not going to be white. So, in the first five minutes, you’re going to have to deal with the voice of God and she’s a woman and she’s Frances McDormand, and you’re going to have to deal with a non-white Adam and Eve. That’s your first five minutes. You can stop watching now. If you were upset or offended, great excuse to stop watching now. You will probably be much more offended by things later on like an 11-year-old Antichrist who is actually a good kid … But look, that was there for you: You had a five-minute warning — [Good Omens] actually starts with the word ‘warning.’”Good Omens&nbsp;debuts on Friday, May 31 on Amazon Prime.Like this?

Here, instead of spoiling your journey into these characters’ psyches, we take you on a trip to the past, showcasing eight cinematic gems from this season’s True Detective cast.Colin Farrell (Ray Velcoro)Film: In Bruges (2008,  84%), was the first of screenwriter/director Martin McDonagh‘s one-two punch of clever crime tales with sympathetic and sociopathic characters. The Oscar-nominated story follows two hitmen who’ve been ordered to kill a priest, but kill a little boy in the process as well. They’re banished to Bruges, a gorgeous city in Belgium, where sad hilarity ensues with a cast of characters including Ralph Fiennes and Brendan Gleeson.Role: Because of its slow-building cult success (despite the box office gross of less than half of the $15 million it was made for), In Bruges might seem like an obvious choice for Colin Farrell. It’s where many people finally decided that the Hollywood party boy from Ireland had some acting chops as hitman Ray. Indeed, he won a Golden Globe for it.Watch Trailer&nbsp;Vince Vaughn (Frank Semyon)Film: Into the Wild (2007,  83%), is the harrowing, exciting, crazy true story of Christopher McCandless (Emile Hirsch) who foregoes his college education, athletic promises of grandeur, and all his worldly possessions in order to find his true self, live a true life, and feel truth in all its many forms. Based on the book by Jon Krakauer, a writer and mountaineer, the film — adapted for the screen and directed by Sean Penn — was only a mild box office success.Role: Wayne Westerberg is one of the many characters McCandless meets during his nation-wide journey — a grain elevator operator who befriends McCandless at a bar in the fall of 1990 in Montana. He first offers the wandering young ma a ride, then a place to stay, and eventually a job at his plant in Carthage, South Dakota. The two become close friends and Westerberg is actually the one to receive McCandless’s postcard in Denali National Park in Alaska.Watch Trailer&nbsp;Rachel McAdams (Ani Bezzarides)Film: State of Play (2009,  84%)is a political thriller à la All the President’s Men, but sexier. Russell Crowe plays Cal McAffrey, a reporter who goes deeper than he bargained for into an investigation against a Congressman (Ben Affleck) whose former aid — and the woman he was having an affair with — turns up dead. There’s a huge supporting cast including Robin Wright, Helen Mirren, Jason Bateman, and Jeff Daniels, all directed by Kevin Macdonald, who had done mostly documentaries before the award-winning The Last King of Scotland.Role: Della Frye is the gutsy, go-getter blogger for The Washington Globe, who plays like a sidekick to Cal. For the role, McAdams got to really immerse herself in life on the Hill, spending time with reporters at The Washington Post to prepare for turning the tables onscreen and getting her chance to probe for once.Watch Trailer&nbsp;Taylor Kitsch (Paul Woodrugh)Film: The Normal Heart (2014,  94%) was first written as a play by Larry Kramer, who saw the rise of HIV/AIDS in the early 1980s claim the lives of dozens of friends and even more peers. HBO had him adapt it into a screenplay for their Ryan Murphy-directed version, which follows Ned Weeks (a fictional version of Kramer and played by Mark Ruffalo) and his unintended rise into political activism for healthcare for gay men and awareness surrounding the AIDS epidemic sweeping the nation.Role: In the same year, Kitsch showed us one type of strength in Lone Surivor as an Army Special Ops fighter, and another type of strength as Bruce Niles, the partner of a man whose death helped spur Ned Weeks’ movement for AIDS activism in San Francisco in the early 1980s. Although Niles, a Wall Street banker, is closeted, he shows great leadership and ideas about activism as the first president of the Gay Men’s Health Crisis and has to field the fiery Weeks’ attempts to out him on camera. The two — surrounded by supportive characters played by Julia Roberts, Matt Bomer, and Jim Parsons — have the same goal, just different approaches.Watch Trailer&nbsp;Kelly Reilly (Jordan Semyon)Film: Last Orders (2002,  79%)has cast full of British heavyweights in their early Golden Years — Michael Caine, Tom Courteney, David Hemmings, Bob Hoskins, and Helen Mirren. Jack, played by Caine, was a simple London butcher who loved his friends and his wife. His last orders before passing away were to have his ashes scattered in the sea at Margate, and the tale follows his mates on their journey, woven with flashbacks to his early days with them and the love of his life, Amy.Role: Young Amy was Reilly’s first major role outside of her many British television roles throughout the 1990s. She felt she was being typecast in comedy roles and actively sought a role to prove her dramatic chops. She and JJ Field, who played young Jack, portrayed the early days of the relationship, leading to love, trust, respect, and eventually the deathbed.Watch Trailer&nbsp;Afemo Omilami (Police Chief Holloway)Film: Tigerland (2000,  77%), is the nickname for Fort Polk, an infamous Army training camp in Louisiana. There, a group of recruits go through Advanced Infantry Training as a last stop before entering into the Vietnam War in 1971. The story’s hero is Private Roland Bozz (none other than our Mr. Farrell), an unruly soldier who’s got a problem with authority, disobeying orders and talking back to his superiors all in the hopes of maintaining his humanness, and not giving over to the machine.Role: True Detective isn’t the first time Omilami has gotten to bark orders at Farrell. Fifteen years ago, as Seargent First Class Ezra Landers, he gave Private Roland Bozz tough love and sound advice during training for Vietnam.Watch Trailer&nbsp;James Frain (Lt. Kevin Burris)Film: Hilary and Jackie (1998,  88%)is a film about the famed du Pré sisters — both musical geniuses — based on the book written by Hilary du Pré (played by Rachel Griffiths who was nominated for an Oscar for the role). Cellist Jacqueline du Pré (played by Emily Watson, also nominated for her part) emerges from the shadows of older sister Hilary’s more triumphant childhood successes to become the world-renowned musician — only to develop Multiple Sclerosis. The film was shrouded in controversy because the famous musicians who knew Jackie in real life condemned her sister’s version of the story in the book and film.Role: Daniel Barenboim is the famed pianist married to Jackie, who stays with her until her death in 1987 — despite Jackie’s affair with her sister’s husband, conductor Kiffi Finzi, and despite his own with Russian pianist Elena Bashkirova. Many instruments at play in this story, if you catch our drift.Watch Trailer&nbsp;David Morse (Eliot Bezzerides)Film: The Negotiator (1998,  74%)is the aptly named film about two top Chicago negotiators facing off. Directed by the then only 29-year-old F. Gary Gray (who was known for his high-profile music video direction), Samuel L. Jackson and Kevin Spacey star as Danny Roman and Chris Sabian. Roman is a celebrated police officer who finds out that he has been set up as a corrupt cop and a murderer. He takes control of a building in a panic, holding many hostages and will only negotiate with Sabian for his freedom.Role: Although Commander Adam Beck is not the central figure here in a high-stakes situation, he’s the man who is always right there by Sabian’s side. Morse has played many roles that put him in a stern, authoritative position. Perhaps it’s his 6’4″ frame, or perhaps it’s because he’s from Boston and everyone knows you don’t mess with a 6’4″ guy from Boston.Watch Trailer&nbsp;Gallery: 15 California Crime Stories on Film and TVTrue Detective Season Two ReviewsTrue Detective Season Two Photos","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"golden, Freeform, fiction, AMC, Sony","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"8-certified-fresh-gems-starring-the-true-detective-cast"},{"id":"47613281113577","title":"UK Critics Consensus: The Wackness aint Wack, but Babylon Blows","content":"var mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})UK Critics Consensus: The Wackness aint Wack, but Babylon BlowsVin Diesel sinks while Ben Kingsley swimsby Tom Butler | August 29, 2008 |  CommentsSo the big movies out this week are Vin Diesel-powered Babylon A.D., yet another Judd Apatow-produced comedy about immature losers – Step Brothers with Will Ferrell and John C. Reilly – and the 90s coming-of-age teen drama The Wackness, starring a bong-chugging, Olsen twin-snogging knight of the realm, Sir Ben Kingsley. What did the UK critics have to say?Denounced by its director, the Vin Diesel sci-fi action flick Babylon A.D. flops into the cinema with UK critics mirroring the US critics’ response, pretty much universally denouncing it for its indecipherable plot, tacked on action sequences, and wholesale shameless plundering of sci-fi flicks Children of Men and Blade Runner. With the Tomatometer tallying the UK response, Babylon A.D. has shot from a pathetic 0% to a measly 7%. When one of the only positive review reads, “It’s utter codswallop, yet enjoyable if you unplug your brain.” (The Times), you know you’ve got a stinker on your hands.Will Ferrell teams up with John C. Reilly again, and with their last effort Talledega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby garnering a respectable 73% on the Tomatometer, the standards are set high, but can they repeat their success with Step Brothers? It’s had a mixed response from the UK scribes, with the general consensus being that if you like the relentless, absurd and puerile shtick peddled by Farrell and Reilly in Anchorman, Talledega Nights and Semi-Pro, then you’ll fall for Step Brothers too. On the other hand, if the sight of two grown men behaving like 12-year-olds, and sporting prosthetic testicles, seems a bit infantile to you, then steer well clear. Step Brothers is currently the black sheep of the family at 53% on the Tomatometer.Is 1994 too recent to be considered a period piece? The critics didn’t think so with most UK critics rating The Wackness fresh, mainly for the ever-versatile Ben Kingsley’s portrayal of the bong-smoking, long haired, last hippy on the block, Dr Squires, but also for its touching and quirky story of adolescence and love in mid-90s New York. The performances save the movie from its meandering, and at times soppy, sauntering pace, and at 67% on the Tomatometer, it has just enough Dopeness to stop it truly being The Wackness.Also worth checking out…Badlands. Terrence Malick’s 1973 debut gets a limited re-release. This masterpiece is worth seeking out. Currently 100% on the Tomatometer.Times and Winds. Lilting and meditative, Reha Erdem’s story of three adolescents in rural Turkey captivates with intimate details and long takes of the endless countryside. 83% on the Tomatometer.Quote of the Week“A sci-fi actioner that sees bald hero Vin Diesel back, stomping around the future like a small, gun-toting penis.”Babylon A.D. – Larushka Ivan-Zadeh, Metro.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"Set, TruTV, USA, ABC, superhero, Rom-Com, Video, Toys, Exclusive, winner, new, who, batman","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"uk-critics-consensus-the-wackness-aint-wack-but-babylon-blows"},{"id":"47613224423891","title":"RT on DVD: Zombie Strippers, Meet Kit Kittredge!","content":"RT on DVDvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})RT on DVD: Zombie Strippers, Meet Kit Kittredge!Plus Journey to the Center of the Earth 3-D and more spooky laughs for Halloween.by Jen Yamato | October 27, 2008 |  CommentsFor the week leading up to All Hallow’s Eve, there’s a surprising dearth of new horror releases hitting DVD. Rest assured, though, titillation and scares can be found in a trio of horror comedies (Zombie Strippers, Poultrygeist, and the reissued slasher classic, Pieces). (Watch our interview with Zombie Stripper Jenna Jameson below.) For tamer fare, check out Kit Kittredge, Journey to the Center of the Earth 3-D, and Disney’s CGI Tinker Bell.1. New to DVD: Zombie Strippers Unrated Special Edition – 40%If forty percent on the Tomatometer seems surprisingly high for a horror comedy about strippers-turned-walking dead starring former adult actress Jenna Jameson, think about this; it’s about 30 percentage points better than Saw V, and you can watch it in the safety of your own home this Halloween! Zombie Strippers is about, well, undead exotic dancers, who comprise one side of a strangely philosophical battle with their still-human counterparts when a secret government experiment is unleashed upon the unsuspecting denizens of the Rhino club.Do zombies dance better? Are regular old strippers passé without super-human pole dancing skills and a ravenous hunger for human flesh? Find out with the Unrated Special Edition DVD, which includes a few featurettes, deleted scenes, and a commentary track by director Jay Lee and actors Joey Medina, Jenna Jameson, and Robert Englund.Watch our exclusive one-on-one chat with Jameson below!Next: Kit Kittredge: An American Girl2. New to DVD: Kit Kittredge: An American Girl – 78%Resist the urge to dismiss little miss Abigail Breslin, whose star turn in this summer’s period adventure about an intrepid Depression-era girl has put her in the running to overtake Dakota Fanning’s tween queen crown. At 78 percent on the Tomatometer and Certified Fresh, Kit Kittredge: An American Girl is one of this week’s best bets for quality flicks on DVD, so give it a try — and fellas, you don’t have to tell a soul if you enjoy it.Based on the uber-popular children’s doll and book franchise, the film follows aspiring newspaper reporter Kit Kittredge (Breslin) as her family struggles through the Great Depression and she unravels a mysterious rash of crimes. Breslin gets class-act support from an impressive cast of grown-ups that include Julia Ormond, Stanley Tucci, Jane Krakowski, Chris O’Donnell and Joan Cusack. A digital copy and DVD-ROM with bonus content accompany the film.Next: Journey in 3-D3. New to DVD: Journey to the Center of the Earth 3-DThough Jules Verne’s classic sci-fi tale has been adapted before for the screen (some good, some bad), it hadn’t yet been adapted into the future of movie-watching: 3-D. Until now. Brendan Fraser stars in this loose reimagining as Trevor Anderson, a geologist who finds himself in otherworldly underground danger with his teenage nephew (Josh Hutcherson) and an Icelandic hottie (Anita Briem). In three dimensions!Pick up the Limited Edition set for a 2-D cut and a 3-D version, which comes with four pairs of 3-D glasses.Next: Tarantino can’t save this Hell Ride4. New to DVD: Hell Ride – 11%Thanks to the genre-obsessed films of Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino (who produced Hell Ride), the B-movie grind house aesthetic has returned to vogue. If only replicating that grimy, gleefully vulgar sensibility consistently translated to compelling cinema. B-movie actor Larry Bishop enlists the likes of Michael Madsen, Eric Balfour, and Dennis Hopper in this gratuitous and indulgent biker movie, written, acted, directed and produced by none other than B-movie actor Larry Bishop.Bishop also shows up on a comprehensive commentary track and making-of featurettes on the “Bikes,” the “Babes,” and the “Guys” of Hell Ride.Next: Pledge Delta with Animal House 30th Anniversary set5. New to DVD: Animal House 30th Anniversary Set – 89%Did you ever wish you could live amongst the irreverent, partying brothers of Delta Tau Chi fraternity? Well, now you can take home the Delta house itself, in an all new Animal House 30th Anniversary DVD housed in the most raucous domicile of Faber College.The collegiate gross-out comedy classic from director John Landis celebrates middle age with a 2-disc Special Edition ($19.98) and gift set package ($34.98) that include all-new special features, Scene-It trivia games, and reunion interviews with the cast and filmmakers. Drop a few more bucks for the frat house-shaped gift set, which also includes a new 98-minute documentary and a collectible yearbook.Next: Tinker Bell’s starring debut6. New to DVD: Tinker BellFollow Disney into the 21st century with this CGI-animated spin-off film starring Peter Pan’s beloved fairy BFF, Tinker Bell. In her first solo adventure, Tinker Bell (voiced by Mae Whitman, AKA George Michael Bluth’s girlfriend “Bland” Ann Veal, who reportedly beat Brittany Murphy for the role) arrives in the town of Pixie Hollow to determine her destiny, meeting plenty of A-list fairies along the way (voiced by Kristin Chenowith, Lucy Liu, America Ferrera, Anjelica Huston, and more). But what’s a Disney film without musical numbers? And will such a familiar character hold up to the liberties taken in the name of updating Tinker Bell’s legend for children of today (speaking for the first time, for example)?Tots will likely be enraptured, as will anyone who recognizes the names Jesse McCartney (who voice acts), Katharine McPhee, and Selena Gomez (who contribute songs to the soundtrack).Next: The lens turns on celeb photographer Annie Leibovitz.7. New to DVD: Annie Leibovitz: Life Through a LensHaving shot some of the most iconic celebrity photographs in the last few decades (John Lennon on the eve of his death, Demi Moore nude and pregnant, and Miley Cyrus most recently), it’s about time photographer Annie Leibovitz got her own documentary. Shot, written, and directed by Leibovitz’s sister Barbara, Life Through a Lens follows Leibovitz at work snapping celebrities, interviewing a handful of them about their photo shoot experiences while discussing the life and career of the woman who gave Rolling Stone and Vanity Fair some of their most intimate celebrity portraits ever.Next: Brazilian police get brutal in Elite Squad8. New to DVD: Elite Squad – 50%If you enjoyed 2002’s City of God, check out another crime drama set in the heart of Brazil’s most dangerous neighborhoods. Based on the nonfiction book Elite de Tropa, about Rio de Janeiro’s elite BOPE special police force, Elite Squad follows police captain Nascimento (Wagner Moura) as he struggles to find his own replacement before retiring. While critics split over the brutal, violent tale, this is precisely the type of film that finds a life on DVD.Next: Troma flies with Poultrygeist9. PoultrygeistThose familiar (and amused by) the antics of Lloyd Kaufman and his merry band of indie moviemakers will thrill at the latest Troma release, a horror musical-comedy that shows what could happen when a fast-food fried chicken restaurant gets built over the burial grounds of ancient native Americans: homicidal ghost-chickens! Kaufman himself directs and makes an appearance; Ron Jeremy shows up playing a character named “Crazy Ron.” Cinephiles, skip directly to the next entry!Next: Our Halloween slasher pick of the week!10.

For family audiences there is the animated extravaganza Kung Fu Panda starring Jack Black while Adam Sandler counters with his latest laughfest aimed at young men, You Don’t Mess With The Zohan. The new choices will offer some variety to a marketplace dominated by the female-skewing event pic Sex and the City and the old-school adventure tale Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. With so many worthy choices, and four movies likely to top $20M, it looks to be a sizzling session at the box office as the top five films alone have the strength to beat the entire Top 20 from a year ago.Jack Black leaps into theaters anchoring Kung Fu Panda playing a Chinese panda bear who trains to become a martial arts expert in order to save his village. The PG-rated toon features voices from a wide array of actors including Dustin Hoffman, Angelina Jolie, Lucy Liu, Seth Rogen, Ian McShane, and Jackie Chan. The marketplace is certainly ready for a major family film right now. Since March’s Horton Hears a Who, there really hasn’t been anything major to excite this lucrative audience segment. Last month saw two high profile PG-rated pics, but the dark and violent The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian has attracted half of the crowd of its predecessor while Speed Racer was an all-out disaster. With summer vacations getting closer and closer, children of all ages are pumped for something fun and exciting to go and see.In the DreamWorks stable, Kung Fu Panda should post one of the largest openings for a non-sequel animated entry. It even has the potential to set a new high. Currently, 2004’s Shark Tale and 2005’s Madagascar are tops with $47.6M and $47.2M, respectively. At today’s ticket prices those would be in the low $50M range. Panda has similar features like having a popular comedian in the lead. Dramatic actors add little to the box office strength of an animated film with their voices, even big A listers. But when comedians are at the center and are allowed to improvise and add their own sense of humor, moviegoers cheer. Panda also has the type of comedy that will be loved by adults as well as by kids. Good marks from critics won’t hurt either.The marketing has been solid. The concept is familiar with a young talking animal going after his dreams while the Asian setting adds something new. Big business should be had with kids of single-digit age since recent family offerings have been too risqué for parents to buy tickets for. Plus direct competition is close to zero making for a perfect time to strike. Attacking over 3,600 theaters, Kung Fu Panda may eat up around $52M this weekend.Jack Black as the voice of Po in Kung Fu PandaFor zany humor from characters that are more human ticket buyers have another choice this weekend as Adam Sandler returns with his latest escapade in You Don’t Mess With the Zohan. The PG-13 film reunites the comedy superstar for the fourth time with director Dennis Dugan after Happy Gilmore, Big Daddy, and last summer’s I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry. Zohan finds the former SNL star playing the title character, a first-rate commando in Israel’s armed forces who escapes to New York to pursue his true passion of hairstyling. Sandler hopes this will do for him what Coming to America did for Eddie Murphy two decades ago this very month.No comedian has been more consistent at the box office this decade than Sandler who has scored $100M+ grossers over the last six consecutive years. Aside from Will Smith, no other Hollywood star can claim such a streak. Plus not since the Harold and Kumar sequel has there been a comedy aimed at young males. And after all the media attention that Carrie Bradshaw and pals have gotten in the past week, guys may be ready for some testosterone-fueled fun.However, Sandler fans are not known to be all that into Israeli soldiers or hairdressers so subject matter could be a problem. Last July’s Chuck and Larry bowed at number one with $34.2M, but it was also the funnyman’s lowest opener for a broad comedy since 2000’s Little Nicky. Maybe the combination of a ridiculously long title and a not-so-macho storyline could prevent Sandler from reaching his usual $40M debut mark again this weekend. In addition, the comedian is straying from his natural voice for the first time since Nicky which doesn’t bode well either. Fans like it best when Adam plays Adam, just a regular American dude getting himself into comical situations. Infiltrating over 3,300 theaters, You Don’t Mess With The Zohan could debut with around $35M.Sandler is The ZohanPanda and Zohan kick off an unusually light June release schedule which will see fewer wide releases than normal. In fact across all four of the month’s weekends only two competitors enter wide release each session for a total of eight major players. Looking at the last several years there have always been 10 to 12 wide releases over the same time period. Studios are hoping that each film this June will have some extra breathing room to find its audience and not get stomped on a week later by a barrage of four pictures cramming into multiplexes at the same time.In limited release, Picturehouse will platform its Oscar-nominated historical epic Mongol in four theaters in New York and Los Angeles. The subtitled story of the rise of Genghis Khan features a cast assembled from across Asia and is directed by the acclaimed Russian filmmaker Sergei Bodrov. Though it lost out to The Counterfeiters in the foreign language race this year, it still is being aggressively marketed to arthouse moviegoers and fans of world cinema. Mongol expands to major markets on June 20.Sergei Bodrov’s MongolLast weekend, the 179 years of life experience of Parker–Cattrall–Davis–Nixon pulled an upset victory over the 190 years of Ford–Spielberg–Lucas as it was truly no country for old men. But the boys will try to beat out the girls this time around for the title of top holdover in what will certainly be a much closer race.Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull will face some competition for young men from Zohan while families will be tempted away by Paramount’s own Panda. But adult men will still be focused on the Communist-fighting whip man so a 45% drop could result leaving a $24M frame. That would propel the cume to a stunning $254M after 18 days.Sex and the City shocked the industry with its stellar $56.8M bow last weekend. Also impressive were the sturdy grosses of $5.5M a piece on Monday and Tuesday this week. But the sizable 34% Friday-to-Saturday tumble showed how much demand was absorbed on that first day which was essentially an after-work girls-night-out for fans. Word-of-mouth has been good, but so much of the target audience has already been reached so a big drop is likely even though the new releases are not direct competitors. Panda however will take many thirtysomething and fortysomething mothers out of the picture. A 60% fall could occur giving the New Line-Warner Bros. flick roughly $23M – still a full-figured number. That would give Sex a fabulous $100M in just ten days.Universal’s The Strangers was a surprise hit last weekend posting the best horror movie opening of 2008. But a fast fade is likely so sales could slump by 55% to about $9.5M. That would give the Rogue production a solid $37M in ten days. Iron Man is steadily closing in on that triple-century mark. The super hero smash should dip by 35% to around $9M boosting the cume to $290M.LAST YEAR: The summer of threequels moved forward with Ocean’s Thirteen which bowed at number one with $36.1M for Warner Bros. on its way to $117.2M domestically and $311M worldwide. That put the bad boys behind the $363M of Twelve and the $444M of Eleven. Disney’s Pirates of the Caribbean: At World’s End dropped to second after two weeks on top with $21.1M breaking the quarter-billion mark in just over 17 days. Universal’s Knocked Up, the first of two pregnancy comedy hits in 2007 to sail past $140M, followed with $19.6M in its sophomore frame. Sony’s animated penguin film Surf’s Up debuted in fourth with a respectable $17.6M leading to a $58.9M final. Rival toon Shrek the Third sat in fifth with $15.3M. The horror sequel Hostel Part II struggled in its opening weekend taking in $8.2M or less than half the bow of its predecessor a year earlier. Lionsgate reached $17.6M.Author: Gitesh Pandya, www.BoxOfficeGuru.com","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"Women's, green, justice, movies, to, TV, Rey, AMC, Reality, Guide, anthology, singing, Awards, IFC, Fox","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"box-office-guru-preview-black-vs-sandler-in-comedy-showdown"},{"id":"47613222718930","title":"Edinburgh 2008: What to Watch","content":"var mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Edinburgh 2008: What to WatchWe share twenty of the best movies screened.by RT Staff | July 1, 2008 |  CommentsThe Edinburgh International Film Festival is well underway in the Scottish city, screening hundreds of brand new films and cramming A-listers into posh hotel suites. This year, Rotten Tomatoes is proud to be an official media partner of the festival, and we’ll be presenting an award to one of the films in the programme. Click here for more information.The festival has, in the past, played home to the world premiere of Serenity and the European first-show for Clerks II. Its programme is open to the public, and provides a wide variety of home-grown, European, American and international cinema. Last year’s festival saw two of the freshest movies of the year play to UK audiences for the first time – Knocked Up and Ratatouille – and they were joined by the indie likes of Hallam Foe and French warbler Les Chansons d’Amour.In short, there’s something for everyone of every age, gender and nationality, and it’s probably one of the most relaxed and, in turn, exciting festivals on the calendar. It’s also a good place to start or join in that ever-exciting early awards buzz, and with that in mind we thought it’d be a good idea to let you know what we think of the films on display so you can add them to your wish-list.We’ve picked twenty interesting films from the programme so far to tell you all about. If you didn’t make it to the festival, this is your guide to the hot films to look out for in the coming months!Set in London at the beginning of the Second World War, The Edge of Love revolves around charmingly scruffy poet Dylan Thomas (played by Matthew Rhys), famed for his intense, romantic verse, and the two loves of his life – wife Caitlin (Sienna Miller) and childhood sweetheart Vera (Keira Knightley).The material lets the talented ensemble produce career best work; Knightley, despite an initially jarring Welsh accent, is pitch perfect as the slightly naive but banterous Vera, whilst Miller impresses hugely with her portrayal of an emotionally damaged, promiscuous pleasure-seeker.It’s all fairly depressing, and not entirely convincing, with the spiralling self-destruction on show dredging up all the ‘tortured poet and his muse’ clichï¿½s found in a million bad TV literary adaptations. The result is a well-intentioned but ultimately unsuccessful stab as serious, romantic drama that is not as clever or affecting as it thinks it is. Orlando ParfittRobert Carlyle makes a welcome return to form in Summer, an intelligent and brilliantly-acted family drama. The Scot plays Shaun, an embittered middle aged man who spends much of his time reluctantly caring for his wheelchair bound best friend Daz. The film goes onto examine what bought him to this point in his life, uncovering years of misfortune, bad decisions and an uncaring establishment. Shaun then looks back with rose-tinted glasses at his youth and yearns for the freedom’s of his salad days, before his troubles began. Fairly bleak to-to-be-sure, but intensely moving and powerful too, thanks to the emotionally resonant central performances. OPWith Donkey Punch, you get two great movies for the price of one; a brilliantly set-up, marvellously tense teen thriller, and a barmy, magnificently over-the-top slasher horror. It’s just a shame they’re shoe-horned together in the same film.We begin with a trio of girls from Leeds, Northern England, on holiday in Mallorca and getting ready for a night on the tiles. Eventually they meet up with four good-looking men who persuade them to continue their night on a yacht they’ve ‘borrowed’ from the harbour master.Things suddenly take a turn for the nightmarish however when one of the men delivers the donkey punch of the title (we won’t reveal what it is, but it’s kind of disgusting). She drops dead, and now the lads must try and get rid of the body and calm down the two remaining girls.It’s a brilliant set-up, but suddenly a new film cranks into action, as the girls begin picking off the lads one-by-one in increasingly bizarre, over-the-top and hilarious ways. Those with a strong stomach should still definitely seek out Donkey Punch – a refreshing, if maddeningly schizophrenic antidote Hollywood norm. OPVery rarely does RT get shocked, sickened or appalled at the cinema these days. This little indie horror film at Edinburgh turned out to have one of the highest concentrations of sheer wrongness we’ve ever seen – in a good way.Mum and Dad revolves around airport cleaner and Romanian immigrant Lena who, one night, after a series of misadventures, finds herself unable to get back home. ‘Luckily’ her seemingly-happy-go-lucky colleague Birdie offers her a bed for night with her family. Thinking her troubles are over, at least in the short term, Lena accepts, but the invitation turns out to be a one way ticket to a hellishly violent, sadistic suburban hell.Birdie’s sinister ‘family’ includes ‘Mum’ — a barmy, torture-obsessed housewife whose sadistic deeds are made all the more shocking by her maternal pretentions — and ‘Dad’, a fat, greasy sexual predator who wears a party hat. So begins a nightmarish journey for Lena as she is forced to abandon all humanity to escape this twisted family unit.if you’re a hardcore horror fan and have a strong constitution — and have a healthy disregard for family values – then you should check this out, just don’t say we didn’t warn you! OPA deserved winner of the Golden Bear in Berlin this summer, Elite Squad, Jose Padilha‘s testosterone-fuelled actioner revolves around Nascimento, commanding officer of BOPE, the hard-as-nails paramilitary wing of Rio’s police force entrusted with keeping order in the cities drug-cursed favelas.Macho and ultra-violent, the director defiantly take sides in the drug war through blaming both drug dealers and their rich clients for the violence and social problems their trade creates. However Elite Squad is more even handed than some have suggested, with Padilha not shying from showing the brutality of BOPEs methods and the widespread corruption in the police force. OPAn amusing exercise in ’90s nostalgia, The Wackness is anything but wack…It’s New York in 1994; Cobain has just shot himself, Biggie and Tupac are still friends and Giuliani has only just been elected mayor. Experiencing it all is Luke (played by former child star Josh Peck) a self-confessed loser in his last year at high school – and also a part-time pot dealer.We meet him in the office of one of his clients – and best friend – Dr. Squires (Ben Kingsley), a self-medicating psychiatrist. The film then follows the pair through one long, hot, life-changing summer.It’s the often hilarious script that stays in the mind. Kingsley generally gets the best lines (when Luke tells him he feels down, he asks “is it because of Kurt Cobain?”), and despite a wavering New York accent, shows a real flair for comedy. OPStandard Operating Procedure is essential viewing, but often difficult to watch. Master documentary maker Errol Morris (who won an Oscar for his Robert McNamara interview The Fog of War) sits down with (almost) all of the prison guards responsible for the sickening scenes of prisoner humiliation and torture that emerged from Abu Ghraib prison in the aftermath of the Iraq war.You may find Morris’ empathy with his subjects, almost all of whom show little remorse for their heinous acts, hard to bear, but it’s arguable that by simply letting these individuals have their say they damn themselves far more than any liberal commentator could. Documentary at its most powerful and timely. OPImagine the basic conceit of Groundhog Day — a man is forced to relive the same day over-and-over again – re-imagined as an atmospheric, jolly creepy Spanish horror film and you’ll be somewhere near to Timecrimes.This superbly sinister effort follows Hector — an ordinary suburban guy who one night glimpses a naked woman through the trees. He goes outside to investigate, but finds himself attacked by a rather angry and aggressive man with a bandage head.The movie is at its most effective in the opening scenes in the woods, with director Nacho Vigalondo proving adapt at conjuring scares and making guys with bandaged heads look very creepy indeed. Timecrimes, along with the similarly well-produced Spanish-horror-thriller [Rec], proves the Iberian peninsula a fertile breeding ground for brilliantly made frighteners with brains. OPAfter the success of This is England, Shane Meadows returns with Somers Town, a smaller-scale but still hugely affecting film again revolving around adolescents on the margins of society.Thomas Turgoose (spectacular as the young skinhead in England) plays Tomo, a teenager from Nottingham who — for reasons that are never explained — arrives by train in London despite not knowing a soul and having nowhere to go. After he’s mugged and loses all his money, he befriends Marek, a Polish boy living with his builder father. They soon become close friends, and both lust after the hot French waitress who works in their local cafe.It’s a simple, almost plotless story, but one that is made immensely powerful by the characteristically superb and naturalistic performances. The simple shooting style – the film is shot in black and white and features little camera movement – amplifies the bonhomie and natural chemistry of the two young leads as they embark on a series of hilarious scrapes. OPA spectacularly silly, amusing and gory examination of the world’s problems with fossil fuels, Blood Car is set to become a cult favourite.Set in the near future – with cars rendered almost non-existent by the scarcity of oil – this low budget effort centres around Archie; an ultra environmentally conscious vegan kindergarten teacher who has been trying to build a car that runs on vegetable juice.One day, with the car engine refusing to run on the fauna-based liquid, he accidently cuts his hand, a drop of blood dripping into the contraption and immediately starting the motor. The result? Green fingered Archie has inadvertently invented a car that runs on human blood.It’s a hilariously dark stuff that feels like it could have evolved from a Grindhouse fake trailer. A deliciously tasteless scene towards the end of the film, featuring a trigger-happy government agent and Archie’s kindergarten class, is worth the price of admission alone. OPThe Edinburgh Film Festival drew to a close at the weekend with the world premiere of Faintheart, a sweet and sentimental romantic comedy set in the world of Viking re-enactments.Faintheart revolves around Richard (Eddie Marsan), an overgrown kid who is far happier brandishing his broad-sword in battle than he is in facing up to family responsibilities at home. When he misses his father-in-law’s funeral in favour of a Viking brawl, wife Cath (Jessica Hynes) kicks him out, leading our hero on a quest of the heart as he struggles to win her back with the help of his Norse chums.It’s charming stuff, played for laughs by a uniformly excellent cast and the script is chock-full of comic gems, laughing along with its subjects without ever actually poking fun at them. The result is a fine family film that is sure to leave a smile on your face. Chris TillyPhilippe Petit‘s successful 1974 attempt to cross the gap between the Twin Towers on a tightrope is documented in this kinetic film from James Marsh as a fast-paced caper about a charismatic Frenchman’s drive to do something outrageously necessary. From the moment the Man on Wire starts we’re introduced to Petit as a man with passion and belief who is convinced that these two buildings were built for him to cross.What follows is an examination of the method behind the madness, as the sheer endurance trial that was the planning of the event is shared through Petit and his key collaborators. He spent 45 minutes on wire, but rigging it, sneaking the rigging into the building and planning the entire operation took years, stretching right back to a news article he read in a dentist’s office about the Twin Towers’ construction. The film leaves its audience in no doubt that Petit is special and that this act of rebellion – the walk was totally illegal – was his gift to the world. Absolutely gripping stuff. Joe UtichiIt’s hard to know how much to reveal about Let the Right One In. Such is the nature of the film’s delicate plotting that it’ll prove to be a different but equally fulfilling experience should you be aware of its subject matter or not before you watch it. Like Pan’s Labyrinth, the film’s fantastical elements disguise the real human drama of its characters and while it might, on the surface, appear to be a new twist on a familiar genre, at its heart it’s one of the most original coming-of-age stories in years.As Oskar, young actor Kåre Hedebrant’s confident performance is at turns sweetly innocent and surprisingly dark. If your tolerance for foreign-language films is limited, let this film change your mind. If the idea of a coming-of-age story fills you with dread, let it convince you otherwise. In fact, if you only see one film that’s off the beaten path this year, you’d do very well to let the right one in. JUWhen an old man (Brian Cox), fishing by a river, is forced to witness a group of young hoodlums shoot his dog he becomes determined to see justice prevail; pursuing the boys’ fathers (Tom Sizemore and Robert Englund) to encourage them to punish their sons and, when that fails, turning to the law. Red is a heartrending tale of a man who has lost everything trying and who is desperately to hold onto what’s right, Brian Cox is relentless in the lead role, delivering a stunning and strangely disturbing performance as he seeks retribution.The film may go a little too far before the end, but for the most part it’s brilliantly gripping with shades of Stephen King about its thrilling structure. JUWalter is a sad, lonely, embittered Connecticut teacher whose life has been on a downward spiral since the passing of his wife. However, all of that changes when he is sent to New York to present a paper on economics, and arrives to discover an immigrant couple living in his long-forgotten apartment. Understandably perturbed, Walter kicks them to the kerb, but compassion leads him to go after them and invite the strangers into his empty home.The Visitor is stirring, heartbreaking stuff, told at a stately pace perfectly in keeping with the story unfolding. Director Thomas McCarthy truly gives his characters time to breathe, and as their story slowly plays out, it’s impossible not to be swept up in the gut-wrenching emotion of it all. He’s helped out by a grandstanding performance from Richard Jenkins as Walter. It’s brilliantly multi-layered and full of subtlety and nuance.Combined with McCarthy’s economic script – which brilliantly deals with the sensitive topic of immigration without ever feeling preachy or patronising — it makes for a magical movie-going experience that will provoke thought, discussion, sadness and joy in equal measure. Truly outstanding stuff. CTOne of the most powerful documentaries in a long time, Alone in Four Walls introduces us to the inmates of a Russian prison for boys aged 11-14, interspersing their daily activities with tales of their crimes from the boys themselves and from their families and victims. It’s hard to know what to feel about these inmates as they go through the usual struggles of adolescence and the regional struggles of poverty on one hand and then we’re told, in police report detail, what found them in the institution to begin with.Emotionally harrowing, with an incredible attention to cinematography, this, like all documentaries should be, is a window on a world we’ll never come across, but more than that it’s a frighteningly appropriate film for a world in the throes of increasing teenage violent crime. Want to keep kids out of jail? Showing them this would be a good place to start. JUWerner Herzog returns to documentary filmmaking with Encounters at the End of the World, this time travelling to Antarctica to share stories about the people who call the frozen continent home. Starting off, and frequently returning to his base in McMurdo, a desolately grey and dreadfully functional town that most in Antarctica call home.Herzog’s typically editorialised commentary singes the film with humour, as he shares with us his insistence to financiers that he wouldn’t be travelling all that way to make another movie about penguins, though, of course, he finds a researcher to plug with questions about the flightless birds’ sexual proclivities and mental instabilities. There are moments of extreme humour as he interrupts a woman’s tales of her travels by opining that “her story goes on forever,” and wonders how many languages have died in the time he’s been talking to a man who’s explaining, at great length, how often languages die.But, equally, there are scenes that seem extended for no reason other than to keep the running time feature length and while Herzog finds plenty of characters, few of them seem compelling enough to warrant the journey. People who call Antarctica home are bound to be slightly weird by our standards, but are they really as crazy as Herzog seemed to hope on his journey out there, or are they just people doing their job exploring extremes so that we don’t have to? JUNot only is WALL*E one of the freshest films of the year – some critics have even thrown around the word ‘masterpiece’ like they believe it this time – but it’s also one of the loveliest, most charming and most accomplished animated films of all time. Pixar’s tale of a little robot, WALL*E, who dreams of a new companion in the shape of a sleek and shiny probe called EVE is a testament to Pixar’s emphasis on story and emotion.It shouldn’t work – not in an era of big, noisy and exposition-heavy event movies – and yet it really, truly does. Within a few minutes without even a hint of dialogue the film has you totally invested in this little character’s journey and you’re with him right until the end. Combine such a strong core with some of the most beautiful and creative artwork ever seen on screen and WALL*E deserves to be remembered as a proper classic. JUThe Black Balloon is a typically-bright but satisfyingly-dark Australian drama about a teenage boy, Thomas Mollison (Rhys Wakefield), whose autistic brother Charlie (Luke Ford) requires constant attention and whose acting out is starting to put a strain on the friendships Thomas is developing at a new school. When a girl comes along, in the form of a beautiful school friend, Thomas’ relationship with his brother, and parents who’ve largely ignored him to take care of Charlie, will be tested.Toni Collette and Erik Thomson co-star, but it’s really a movie for Wakefield and Ford, with the latter particularly brilliant as the autistic Charlie. It’s a selfish side of caring that’s rarely witnessed but inevitably present; a teenager’s desire for a “normal” brother and a relationship with his parents that’s hampered by the special needs of his sibling and it’s handled delicately and emotionally without delivering and overly-sentimental piece. JUMancora will be compared to Y Tu Mama Tambien, being that it’s about a sexually-charged road trip involving three hot, young things in a Spanish-speaking country, but there’s something decidedly more real about the consequences of these actions. As incest makes way to tribal drug trips, the characters go on hard, real journeys and push themselves to their limits, perhaps in an attempt to find some feeling within them: as the film begins, our lead, Santiago, has lost his father to suicide and finds that he’s disillusioned with his surroundings.But, rather disappointingly, the film quite simply isn’t as entertaining as Alfonso Cuaron‘s predecessor, and the conclusion of the journey feels false and all too convenient. Nevertheless, it’s of a high quality and should make stars of its leads if it’s given the exposure in North America that it deserves. It certainly marks Ricardo de Montreuil as a director to watch.

She was 91.The Academy Award-nominated actress’ career began on Broadway in the early 1940s; Dee’s big-screen breakthrough was in The Jackie Robinson Story, playing opposite the legendary ballplayer himself, in 1950. She gained widespread critical acclaim for her performance in the 1961 film adaptation of Lorraine Hansberry’s A Raisin in the Sun opposite Sidney Poitier. Throughout her career, Dee worked concurrently on stage, on television, and in film; she garnered acclaim for her performance in the 1979 miniseries Roots: The Next Generations , an Obie award for the play Boesman and Lena in 1971, and a Best Supporting Actress Oscar nomination for American Gangster in 2007.Dee married Ossie Davis in 1948, and they were together until his death in 2005. They appeared together in five films, including No Way Out (Davis’ screen debut), Do the Right Thing and Jungle Fever, and were associated with a number of organizations and activists that fought on behalf of civil rights.

But why should we stop there? We’re proud to announce the imminent launch of RTArt — for the first time ever, we’ll be applying the Tomatometer to paintings!Our Tomatometer scores will be based on the aggregated reviews of art critics from hundreds of sources, both contemporary and historic; the list includes reviews from newspapers, websites, magazines, stone tablets, scrolls, and oral histories.We have a lot of great things planned for RTArt, and we plan to expand our coverage and add new features in the coming weeks. Since humans have been making art for more than 40,000 years, we’ve decided to focus on painting for the time being. If all goes well, we will start to assign Tomatometers to works from other artistic disciplines, including sculpture, photography, architecture, textiles, ceramics, graffiti, origami, and performance art.Getting our art section up and running has been a massive undertaking. Each member of the RT staff has had to take extensive art history courses and become fluent in French, Latin, German, Arabic, and Japanese. Given that many older reviews aren’t online, we’ve had to travel around the globe to find original reviews; many were written in arcane languages and were printed on fragile materials. Hazards abounded: While searching for reviews for an Albrecht Dürer triptych in the basement of a medieval church in Fischland, Germany, editor Ryan Fujitani unwittingly awakened the spirit of a malevolent Saxon warrior.Our beta launch is fast approaching, but we’ll be making some adjustments for a while, and we definitely value your feedback. So please take a tour through our virtual museum, and remember — you can’t spell “art” without RT!When you visit the RTArt pages, here’s what you can find:(Click on the image to see a full-size version)","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"Marvel, space, classics, Turner, Purge, movies","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"introducing-rtart"},{"id":"47613269790179","title":"Filmmaker to Wear Multiple Hats on Prehistoric \"Erectus\"","content":"var mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Filmmaker to Wear Multiple Hats on Prehistoric \"Erectus\"by Scott Weinberg | October 11, 2005 |  CommentsFilmmaker Adam Rifkin will write, direct, and star in the caveman comedy \"Homo Erectus,\" says The Hollywood Reporter.

It’s also your week to catch films you might have missed in theaters, from Jennifer Aniston’s tale of puppy love (Marley &amp; Me) to the latest heart-wrencher from Will Smith (Seven Pounds). Those who dare to go foreign will be justly rewarded with two well-reviewed imports (the French thriller Tell No One and the Spanish sci-fi Timecrimes), while art-house devotees have two remastered Wong Kar-Wai films to choose from (Happy Together and Fallen Angels). Horror fans have an octet of new flicks to check out (After Dark Horror Fest 8 Films to Die For)…and did we mention the sweet new Blu-ray that should be on the top of any philosophical cyberpunk’s wishlist (The Matrix 10th Anniversary Blu-ray Digibook)?Slumdog Millionaire — 94%Jai Ho it up this week with the multiple Oscar-winning feel-good hit, Slumdog Millionaire! Danny Boyle‘s Dickensian Best Picture-winner, about an Indian working-class hero who competes on the Hindi version of Who Wants to Be A Millionaire, won over audiences and critics last year thanks to energetic filmmaking, a sweetly romantic story, and its exotic, catchy soundtrack. (That end-sequence Bollywood number, set to composer A.R. Rahman’s Oscar-winning song, “Jai Ho,” didn’t hurt either; even Ellen DeGeneres couldn’t resist recreating the dance on her daytime talk show.) If you missed the Little Film That Could in theaters (it narrowly avoided the ignominy of a direct-to-video release), you can bring it home today and relive all the feel-goodness of our most recent Oscar season.Slumdog Millionaire comes to DVD in single-disc and Blu-ray releases. I know, single-disc; these days getting just one disc in a new release seems a bit skimpy, but Fox Home Entertainment has actually packed a decent host of extras here, including a commentary track by Best Director Boyle and star Dev Patel and a second commentary with writer Simon Beaufoy and producer Christian Colson (both of whom won Oscars for their work). The DVD also includes a dozen deleted scenes. On Blu-ray you’ll get the above, plus additional behind-the-scenes featurettes, a music video, and a short film by newbie Rahi Anil Bharve (Manjha) which was hand-picked by Boyle.Want more of the Bollywood-meets-Hollywood genre? Check out Desperate Housewives hottie Jesse Metcalfe in the cross-global romance The Other End of the Line (27%), in which he romances Bollywood star Shriya Saran.Below, watch an exclusive deleted scene from Slumdog Millionaire.Next: Aniston, Wilson, and Marley &amp; MeMarley &amp; Me — 60%Everyone knows there’s nothing cuter than a puppy, a fact well-exploited by the filmmakers behind Marley &amp; Me. (If you haven’t seen it yet, we recommend you do your best to avoid spoilers.) Based on the non-fiction bestseller by John Grogan, Marley &amp; Me follows a couple (Jennifer Aniston and Owen Wilson) and their adventures with their beloved-but-rambunctious yellow Labrador, Marley. Though critics called it only sporadically funny, this sentimental flick is a must-see for pet owners and animal-lovers — especially the kind that lets their dogs kiss them on the mouth. (It’s really unsanitary, people.) Pick up the 2-Disc Bad Dog Edition for a ton of extended/deleted scenes, a director commentary, making-of featurettes, a PSA for animal adoption, a gag reel, and more.Next: Will Smith in Seven PoundsSeven Pounds — 28%Superstar Will Smith has got range to rival any working actor in Hollywood (Six Degrees of Separation — drama! Independence Day — action! Ali — boxing!) and part of what’s impressive about him is his ever-varying career path. Unfortunately for Smith, he decided to follow up his blockbuster flicks I Am Legend and Hancock with Seven Pounds, a gimmicky thriller about an auditor on a secret mission involving seven strangers — a twisty, complicated schmaltz fest that critics tore to pieces. Deleted scenes, behind-the-scenes featurettes (including one on a particularly deadly species of jellyfish) and a commentary by director Gabriele Muccino (who directed Smith in the superior Pursuit of Happyness) accompany the film.Next: French thrills in Tell No OneTell No One — 93%You may not have heard of this French import thriller, but the fact that it made numerous critics’ Top Ten lists last year should be reason to check it out this week on DVD. Eight years after his wife’s murder, a doctor (Francoise Cluzet) is pulled into a web of intrigue when his dead wife resurfaces, alive and well. Actor-director Guillaume Canet helms this twisty thriller, with a supporting cast led by Kristin Scott Thomas, Francois Berleand (the Transporter trilogy), and Marie-Josée Croze (Munich‘s Dutch assassin).Next: A time-travel movie that actually makes sense!Timecrimes — 86%First time director Nacho Vigalondo (who earned an Oscar nomination for his 2003 short film, 7:35 de la Mañana) makes an impressive feature-length debut with Timecrimes, a Spanish-language science-fiction black comedy about one ordinary man who, thanks to a fateful encounter with a time travel machine, must contend with and battle alternate versions of himself. Critics loved the lo-fi thriller, noting that — against all odds — its sci-fi logic just might make the most sense of any time travel movie ever made. Hollywood liked Timecrimes, too — an English-language remake is already in the works. See the original this week and get a jump on your fellow movie geeks.Next: Don’t even try to pronounce it – CthulhuCthulhu — 58%Based on the H.P. Lovecraft novella The Shadow Over Innsmouth, this indie horror pic follows a history professor (Jason Cottle) to his Pacific Northwest home town, where he becomes embroiled in a local New Age cult who he believes plans a mass human sacrifice. The townsfolk are a weird bunch — Tori Spelling plays one, for example (and sexually assaults our hero to boot, blech) — who worship a fabled sea creature. While more gay panic allegory than straight up science fiction, Cthulhu will find its own cult audience among Lovecraft geeks, who incidentally are the only ones with any clue as to how you pronounce “Cthulhu.”Next: Two classic Vincente Minnelli musicals come to Blu-rayAn American in Paris Blu-ray — 98%, Gigi Blu-ray — 73%It’s hard to say what portion of the Blu-ray audience will overlap with the demographic for these classic musicals, but if you’re a Playstation 3-owning grandma, have we got the new releases for you! Golden Age auteur Vincente Minnelli directed actress Leslie Caron in both films (both also written by the writing team of Alan Jay Lerner and Frederick Loewe), which have been given the Blu-ray treatment in honor of Warner Bros.’ 85th Anniversary. In An American in Paris (1951), Caron gets wooed by American expatriate Gene Kelly to Gershwin tunes like “I Got Rhythm,” “S’Wonderful,” and “Our Love is Here To Stay.” In Gigi (1958), Caron is a turn-of-the-century Parisian girl being groomed as a courtesan who falls for Louis Jordan (AKA Kamal Khan from Octopussy). Both Blu-ray releases include extras ported over from their previous 2-Disc Special Editions, which are great for fans of Old Hollywood.Next: A Wong Kar-Wai double bill — Happy Together and Fallen AngelsHappy Together — 78%Lyrical filmmaker Wong-Kar Wai made his international breakthrough with this tragic romance about an on-and-off gay Chinese couple living as expatriates in Argentina. Working with the late Hong Kong pop star Leslie Cheung (who had previously starred in Wong’s Days of Being Wild and Ashes of Time) as the promiscuous Po-Wing, and fellow Wong collaborator Tony Leung Chiu-Wai (Ashes of Time, In the Mood For Love, 2046) as his lover, Lai Yiu-Fai, Wong won the Best Director prize at the Cannes Film Festival. The new Kino Special Edition offers a remastered cut of the film, a previously-released making-of documentary, trailers and stills, and a 2008 feature from Wong Kar-Wai’s career retrospective at the Museum of the Moving Image.The director’s 1995 film about a Hong Kong hitman and his agent, Fallen Angels (95%), is also available on a new Special Edition this week.Next: The After Dark HorrorFest III collectionAfter Dark HorrorFest 8 Films to Die For — N/AHorror fans have eight new titles to look forward to, as the third annual After Dark HorrorFest slate comes to DVD. Horrors range from cannibals (Slaughter) to cults (Perkins’ 14), to unnecessary sequels (The Butterfly Effect 3: Revelations), and include Korean horror (Voices) and pics with familiar faces (Autopsy, starring Robert Patrick , Michael Bowen, and 90210’s Jessica Lowndes). Rounding out the octet are an Australian outback flick (Dying Breed, starring Saw scribe Leigh Whannell), a suicide thriller (From Within, featuring Rumer Willis and The Sarah Connor Chronicles’ Thomas Dekker), and the Lena Headey vehicle The Broken, which is surprisingly helmed by Brit newcomer Sean Ellis (Cashback).Next: Celebrate the 10th Anniversary of The Matrix!The Matrix 10th Anniversary Blu-ray DigiBook — 86%There may be no spoon, but this week, there is a must-have Blu-ray: The Matrix 10th Anniversary Blu-ray Book, which brings the essential existential sci-fi adventure to Blu-ray for the first time as a single-film release. Of course, if you already own either the Matrix Trilogy or Ultimate Matrix Collections on Blu-ray, this will be an unnecessary addition to your library — but if not, take advantage of this title, which comes in digibook packaging that includes a 47-page booklet crammed with Matrix trivia. Special features on the Blu-ray are plentiful and include a digital copy of the film, four expert commentary tracks, a feature-length documentary and much more.Until next week, happy renting!","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"CMT, Horror, MSNBC, TV, remakes, blockbuster, Cartoon, ITV, justice, One, and, marvel, spanish","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"RT-on-DVD-Exclusive-Slumdog-Millionaire-Clip-Seven-Pounds-and-The-Matrix-10th-Anniversary-Blu-ray"},{"id":"47613273473509","title":"Spirit Award Nominees Announced","content":"var mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Spirit Award Nominees AnnouncedI'm Not There leads the pack.by Jeff Giles | November 28, 2007 |  CommentsThe nominations for this year’s Spirit Awards are in — and Todd Haynes might want to clear some room on his mantle.Variety reports that Haynes’ I’m Not There leads the pack with four nominations — earning nods for best film and director, as well as supporting nods for Cate Blanchett and Marcus Carl Franklin — and the festival’s inaugural Robert Altman Award. Also receiving four nominations apiece are Juno, The Diving Bell and the Butterfly, and The Savages, while A Mighty Heart, Rocket Science, and Lust, Caution each earned three.I’m Not There, The Diving Bell and The Butterfly, Juno, and A Mighty Heart will compete for best feature with Gus Van Sant‘s Paranoid Park, while Haynes, Van Sant, Tamara Jenkins, Jason Reitman, and Julian Schnabel are the nominees for best director.The lead actresses honored by the nominating committee are Angelina Jolie, Tang Wei, Parker Posey, Sienna Miller, and Ellen Page; the actor’s list consists of Philip Seymour Hoffman, Pedro Castaneda, Don Cheadle, Frank Langella, and Tony Leung.For the complete list of nominees, click on the link below!Source: Variety","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"golden, boxoffice, what","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"spirit-award-nominees-announced"},{"id":"47613301295604","title":"RT on DVD: Call It, Friend-O  — No Country For Old Men Hits DVD","content":"RT on DVDvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})RT on DVD: Call It, Friend-O -- No Country For Old Men Hits DVDBee Movie, Dan in Real Life, August Rush,, Hitman join the Coen thriller in this week's new releases.by Jen Yamato | March 10, 2008 |  CommentsThe critically-acclaimed, Oscar-winning No Country For Old Men comes to DVD this week, accompanied by a litany of fellow Fresh films (Lake of Fire, Summer Palace, Dan in Real Life) as well as a gaggle of critical duds (Hitman, Bee Movie, August Rush, and more).No Country For Old MenTomatometer: 94%Joel and Ethan Coen add another celebrated film to their resume with this four-category Oscar-winning thriller about a bag of stolen cash, a man on the run, the killer on his tail, and the old lawman desperately trying to make sense of it all. While we’ll get no commentary track on this initial DVD release (just wait for the inevitable super-sized special editions), three features comprise the bonus menu, but the film itself is its own reward — just ask those Academy voters.Bee MovieTomatometer: 54%Jerry Seinfeld‘s bid for post-Seinfeld success came last year in the form of a honeybee: a neurotic, rather Jerry-esque bee named Barry Bee Benson, to be exact, who leaves corporatized hive life for the great big world of humans in New York City’s Central Park. When Barry discovers that humans have been stealing the hard-earned honey of his buzzing brethren, he takes the most American action there is — he sues the human race. With a supporting voice cast that includes Chris Rock, Renee Zellweger, Patrick Warburton, and Matthew Broderick — and cameos by Sting, Ray Liotta, and Oprah Winfrey — Bee Movie is full of that familiar Seinfeld sardonic humor, although, as the critics say, it’s fairly forgettable.Dan in Real LifeTomatometer: 66%Steve Carell‘s trademark hangdog deadpan finds appropriate anchor in this romantic comedy from Peter Hedges (Pieces of April). Carell stars as Dan, the widowed father of three girls who writes an advice column for a living; when Dan meets his dream girl (Juliette Binoche) during a family get-together, he’s elated — until he learns she’s his brother’s new girlfriend. A soundtrack by Swedish singer-songwriter Sondre Lerch underscores Dan’s comic heartache, though some critics found the script to be occasionally too flat and contrived. A decently packed bonus menu with director commentary, deleted scenes, and outtakes round out the disc.August RushTomatometer: 38%Freddie Highmore, Britain’s omnipresent kid actor, stars as a musically-gifted orphan on a quest to find his birth parents — and exposure any and every person he meets along the way to the magic of music. Sound schmaltzy enough for you? Well, throw in Robin Williams (channeling his doppelganger, U2 front man Bono) as a musical street pimp named Wizard, salvation in the form of a choir, and lines like “The music is all around us. All you have to do is listen,” and you’ve got one heckuva a saccharine smorgasbord.Nancy DrewTomatometer: 48%If, like some of us, you were an avid fan of the Nancy Drew mystery books — over 170 stories published under the pseudonym “Carolyn Keene” since 1930 — then you might have felt some apprehension when a feature-length film about the classic sleuthing teen was announced. Unfortunately for us purists, the reviews confirm those fears. Emma Roberts stars as the titular teen, whose prudish, Type-A manner clashes with the spoiled kids she encounters when she and her dad (Tate Donovan) move to Tinseltown. A Hollywood mystery surfaces, of course, but grown audiences will remain unspooked. I say, bring on the Choose Your Own Adventure movie instead!SleuthTomatometer: 36%The gimmick of casting this cat-and-mouse thriller is intriguing on its own; having starred as a young adulterer opposite Laurence Olivier in 1972’s Sleuth, Michael Caine now plays the older role opposite Jude Law in Kenneth Branagh‘s remake. Unfortunately, the script by Harold Pinter, adapting Anthony Shaffer’s play, fails to serve the two leads well, making for a tedious time — unless you enjoy watching two distinguished British actors out-act one another. Law, Caine, and Branagh make recompense in a jointly recorded commentary track in the special features.&nbsp;HitmanTomatometer: 15%With a title like Hitman, you know what you’re getting into with this video game adaptation from French director Xavier Gens (Frontier(es)). Timothy Olyphant stars as a bar coded professional killer named Number 47 dealing with his sinister bosses, a Russian politico, and a hot prostitute (Olga Kurylenko) on the run. Overwhelmingly derided by the critical set, who might alternately recommend the film to a PS2-obsessed pre-teen boy, Hitman at least serves one purpose: bringing you a closer look at future Bond girl Kurylenko half a year before Quantum of Solace hits theaters.Lake of FireTomatometer: 94%When Nirvana covered the Meat Puppets’ “Lake of Fire” in their Unplugged album session, they sang that the Biblical body of water was “where bad folks go when they die.” In his sprawling documentary on abortion, director Tony Kaye brings us a comprehensive look at the often violent, always vehement hot button debate that has raged for 25 years since Roe vs. Wade. Kaye, who filmed the doc over a period of 17 years, is the same director who earned Hollywood’s praise for directing the 1998 skinhead drama American History X (then disappeared from view following his bitter falling out with New Line and star Edward Norton). Be warned that Lake of Fire contains graphic images; a commentary with Kaye accompanies the DVD.Summer PalaceTomatometer: 70%A young rural woman gets accepted to Peking University and encounters sexual awakening, politics, and discontent against the backdrop of the Tiananmen Square protests in controversial director Lou Ye‘s epic drama. Actress Hao Lei gives a brazen performance as the film’s restless protagonist, who spends over two decades (the late 1980s to the 2000s) struggling to get over the lost love of her life. At over two and a half hours, Ye’s film could be split into two stories — one of the young woman and another of her adult years) — but his film captures the zeitgeist of an entire generation forever marked by Tiananmen-era experiences, at times recalling the verve of Godard and the French New Wave. Shown in competition at the Cannes Film Festival without government approval, the sexually-explicit film was subsequently banned in China, its filmmakers censured from further filmmaking for a five year span.&nbsp;So there you have your new releases for this week.

And the top HD DVD seller, “The Kingdom,” sold just 10% as many copies as the top Blu-ray Disc release, “3:10 to Yuma.”Source: The Hollywood Reporter","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"Interview, Premiere, Lifetime, free, Travel, Academy, King, dc, richard, Britbox, dark, Logo, hard, and","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"down-but-not-out-hd-dvd-soldiers-on"},{"id":"47613297279474","title":"Cannes 2009: George Clooney to Play Assassin","content":"var mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Cannes 2009: George Clooney to Play AssassinStar to be directed by Control helmer.by Orlando Parfitt | May 19, 2009 |  CommentsThere’s a double dose of George Clooney news that’s emerged at Cannes yesterday.Firstly, Variety reports that the greying star has signed on to topline A Very Private Gentleman — an adaptation of the Martin Booth novel — which will be directed by Control helmer Anton Corbijn.The Cloon will play an assassin who hides out in a rustic Italian town before carrying out a final, murderous assignment. Against his better judgement, the cold-hearted killer starts to make friends and becomes entangled in a romantic relationship.Secondly, his war movie Men Who Stare at Goats – which stars the actor as an ex-member of a secret US army unit that used paranormal tactics – has found itself a US distributor.

It’s a plane! It’s a Slusho, whatever that is! Cloverfield stomps its way onto DVD as not only the most exciting new release of the week, but the one most chock-full of special features. Charlie Wilson’s War, The Savages, and The Orphanage are also new — but be on the lookout as the year’s worst flick to date, One Missed Call, also shuffles onto shelves.CloverfieldTomatometer:76%The best-kept secret of 2007 (look up viral marketing in the dictionary and see J.J. Abram’s grinning mug) turned out to be the rebirth of the kaiju — a Godzilla-esque creature wreaking havoc in Manhattan, as seen through the eyes of Handicam-wielding twenty-somethings. Online campaigns involving Slusho and the mysterious 1-11-08 teaser title made for a gonzo opening weekend take, but significant drop-off suggests that many of you were waiting for DVD.Bonus Features:Two alternate endings, deleted scenes, commentary by director Matt Reeves and tons of Easter Eggs make Cloverfield a must-own. Now, figure out where to buy it, since no less than four special store-specific editions will be available, ranging from a Steelbook case (FYE and Suncoast), exclusive ringtone (K-Mart and Sears), “T.J. Miller’s Video Diary” bonus DVD (Best Buy) and our recommendation, a “Rob’s Goin’ to Japan Party Mix” CD (Target).&nbsp;Charlie Wilson’s WarTomatometer: 83%If modern, smarmy Tom Hanks doesn’t rub you the wrong way (why, oh why, couldn’t he have stopped at A League of Their Own??) and you’d like to see him charm the pants off of Julia Roberts’ conservative socialite, then perhaps there’s nothing stopping you from watching the true story of Texas Congressman Charlie Wilson and how he run the Soviets out of Afghanistan. But if you’re paying attention, you already know how that situation panned out.Bonus Features:There’s not much here, but a “Who Is Charlie Wilson?” featurette brings us up close and personal with not only Hanks, producer Aaron Sorkin, and director Mike Nichols (The Graduate), but also Wilson himself and his lover/benefactor, Joanne Herring.The SavagesTomatometer: 90%After a nine-year absence, Tamara Jenkins (Slums of Beverly Hills) wins us over again. This time, her angsty protagonists are middle-aged siblings (Best Actress nominee Laura Linney, Philip Seymour Hoffman) whose perfectly rancorous relationship is tested when they must deal with their increasingly senile, elderly father (Philip Bosco). One of last year’s critical darlings, The Savages deserves a wider audience for its bittersweet, acute observations — you’ll laugh, you’ll cry, you’ll see poop on the walls.Bonus Features:There’s not much to see here: extended scenes, interviews, and a “Behind the Scenes” photo gallery. But don’t let that deter you; give The Savages a try and you’ll likely end up touched. After all, who doesn’t love their parents?The OrphanageTomatometer: 84%Orphaned by the Oscars (it was Spain’s official entry but didn’t make the final cut) and at the box office, here your chance to adopt this overlooked flick! In the Guillermo del Toro-produced stab at familial horror, Laura (Belen Rueda) moves into the orphanage she grew up in, but finds the house already occupied by spirits who seemingly kidnap her son. Come for the thrills, stay for the surprisingly tender story.Bonus Features:The Orphanage largely takes place in one setting, so location, location, location was undoubtedly a vital adage on set. Two DVD features reveal the efforts taken to bring Laura’s nightmarish world to life: the first, “When Laura Grew Up,” shows the filmmakers at work building the orphanage set. The second takes us into “Tomas’ Secret Room,” where the haunting climax of the movie takes place.&nbsp;Starting Out in the EveningTomatometer: 86%I don’t know about you, but nothing gets our blood boiling like a good May-December pairing. Starting Out in the Evening boasts the match-up of sexagenarian Frank Langella and Lauren Ambrose (Six Feet Under) as an aging writer and grad student , respectively, who grow close in Andrew Wagner’s film about relational intimacy and alienation.Bonus Features:Director Wagner offers in-depth commentary in the disc’s only non-trailer offering.Hannah Takes the StairsTomatometer: 67%Is the movie movement known as mumblecore (a certain brand of D.I.Y. flicks with ultra-low budgets and nonprofessional actor) all it’s cracked up to be? Take the first step in making your call with the latest notable mumblecore effort, a wry, intimate story about a flaky girl and her crush on two goofy co-workers.Bonus Features:Those mumblecore kids are majorly hands-on with the filmmaking process and their subsequent DVD releases. Hannah continues the trend with a commentary, behind-the-scenes footage, deleted scenes, and a short film by director Joe Swanberg, Thanks for the ADD! And speaking of which, check out Swanberg’s MySpace page for even more short films, including the trailer to his next feature, Nights and Weekends.&nbsp;One Missed CallTomatometer: 0%At last, the worst-reviewed movie of 2008 has arrived on DVD! (Okay, it’s only the worst so far, but we’re betting it can go the distance.) It takes something special to go 64 reviews without a single fresh rating, but this remake of Takashi Miike’s J-horror pic — in which people like Shannyn Sossamon get phone calls portending their imminent deaths — manages the feat. Even Uwe Boll’s Dungeon Siege: In the Name of the King notched a five percent Tomatometer. Bravo, One Missed Call. Bravo.Bonus Features:Here’s the kicker: there are no bonus features. Zilch. Zero. Nada. Can you blame Warner Bros. or their no-name filmmakers (not to mention Sossaman and co-star Ed Burns, who both seemed listless while promoting the flick at Comic-Con) for washing their hands of the career-killing box office bomb?Fun fact: One Missed Call‘s Australian title is Don’t Pick Up the Cell Phone! (Note exclamation point.) Rent accordingly.&nbsp;","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"drama, TCA","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"rt-on-dvd-cloverfield-charlie-wilson-and-2008s-worst-reviewed-film"},{"id":"47613307601399","title":"RT on DVD: Watch an Exclusive Clip from Starship Troopers: Marauder","content":"RT on DVDvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})RT on DVD: Watch an Exclusive Clip from Starship Troopers: MarauderThe bugs are back in town this week!by Jen Yamato | August 4, 2008 |  CommentsSparred by the triumphant onscreen return of a certain Johnny Rico, we turnour DVD-minded focus to a few stars of yesterday popping up in new DVD releasesthis week: Casper van Dien, Christopher Lambert, and Heather Graham. Also, checkout this week’s geek-tastic new releases: a Starship Troopers box set, CodeMonkeys, and Captain James Tiberius Kirk’s restored adventures aboard theStarship Enterprise.Casper Van Dien is back in Starship Troopers: MarauderIf you know the name Johnny Rico, then you know Casper van Dien. Back in 1997,Van Dien turned in a career-defining performance as the brash “roughneck”recruit Rico inPaul Verhoeven‘sStarship Troopers; since that breakout role, heappeared in no less than 28 (mostly made-for-TV or direct-to DVD) films. Thisweek Van Dien returns, eleven years later, to the franchise that kicked off hiscareer. (Read Casper van Dien’s Five Favorite Films here and hear what Rico’s upagainst in Starship Troopers 3.)Exclusive: Watch two exclusive behind-the-scenes featurettes about the new weaponry and the Marauder powersuit from Starship Troopers 3!Unnecessary DVD re-release of the week: Christopher Lambert’s FortressIn the world of home video, it seems everything old can become new again whenre-masterings, retrospective commentaries, or new footage come into play. Butwhat if no new changes are made whatsoever? Don’t check out Lionsgate’s newre-release of Stuart Gordon‘sFortress, the horror veteran’s schlocky-but-entertainingsci-fi flick from 1993 starring direct-to-video kingChristopher Lambert. In it,Lambert stars as an Army officer imprisoned when he and his wife decide toconceive more than the allotted one child per couple; highlights include whathappens when unruly prisoners get “intestined.” But anyone looking for furtherinsights from Gordon or even Lambert will be duly disappointed; the new release,out this week, is merely a repackaged version of Artisan’s 2001 release. As forLambert, he’s since returned to his bread-and-butter — direct-to-video andforeign language films – though we are excited at the thought of himresurrecting Lord Rayden for a 2010 Mortal Kombat sequel.The Where-Has-Heather-Graham-Gone Update of the WeekSpeaking of celebrities who’ve fallen off the face of Planet Hollywood, thisweek we stumble acrossHeather Graham. Once an in-demand Hollywood Roller Girl,Graham has taken to appearing in tiny indie and DVD flicks in the past fewyears: a travel writer in the romantic-comedy Cake; a hot lesbian in theromantic comedy Gray Matters; a hot lesbian in the dark dramaBroken. (Anyonesee a trend here?) This week Graham’s back with another quirky indie: MissConception, the comic tale of one woman’s quest to conceive a child at any costsbefore her “baby making days” are over.Click for this week’s new releases!Nim’s IslandTomatometer: 49%Abigail Breslin continues to steal the title of America’s Sweetheart from DakotaFanning with her starring role as Nim Rusoe, the precocious, self-sufficientdaughter of a scientist (Gerard Butler) who has lived her whole life on – youguessed it! – an island. Critics were mixed on the fantasy-adventure, but gavekudos to the flick (and to producer/co-starJodie Foster as a neurotic writer)for offering wholesome, well-intentioned counterprogramming for the Bratz crowd.Bonus Features:Amusing animated CGI sequences could look great on Blu-ray; deleted scenes,featurettes, and commentaries by both husband and wife directors Mark Levin andJennifer Flackett and stars Jodie Foster and Abigail Breslin flesh out thebehind-the-scenes adventure.Code Monkeys: Season 1Tomatometer: N/AStill upset about the video game crash of 1983?

Cheer up bywatching Code Monkeys, G4’s original animated series chronicling the employeesof the fictitious GameaVision video game company during the 1980s. Code Monkeyscombines South Park-style humor with 8-bit animation and features cameos by techcelebrities like Dungeons &amp; Dragons creator Gary Gygax, God of War developerDavid Jaffe, and Steve Wozniak as the “CEO” of GameaVision who leaves to start alittle company called Apple.Bonus Features:Shout Factory’s 2-disc release includes Behind the Scenes of Code Monkeys, DailyPranks, gaming tips from G4’s Kristin Holt, original GameaVision games, andmore.TheCounterfeitersTomatometer: 94%Austria nabbed its first Academy Award when The Counterfeiters won Best ForeignFilm last February; this week, the World War II tale comes to DVD. Based on thereal-life memoirs of Adolph Burger, the critically-acclaimed drama follows theharrowing experiences of Holocaust victims forced to work for Nazis in exchangefor their lives.Bonus Features:Delve deeper into the film and the events that inspired it with commentaries andinterviews with director Stefan Ruzowitzky, star Karl Markovics, and Holocaustsurvivor/memoirist Burger himself.RogueTomatometer:100%Breaking news: we’ve got a film this week about a giant killer crocodile, andit’s got a fresh Tomatometer!! Suspend your disbelief long enough to rent thiscreature feature, starringRadha Mitchell andMichael Vartan, about a tour groupterrorized in the outback by Australia’s native predator. (Where’s Paul Hoganwhen you need him?)Bonus Features:Check out commentary by writer/director Greg McLean (Wolf Creek), a making-ofdocumentary shot by the director himself, and a few additional features.Starship Troopers 1-3 Box SetTomatometer:N/AHow should you prepare for the debut of Starship Troopers: Marauder, writer Ed Neumeier’s directorial debut and the long-awaited return of Johnny Rico?

Other war-themed films include White Light/Black Rain: The Destruction of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, The Rape of Europa, and Nanking.Michael Moore‘s Sicko, arguably the year’s highest-profile documentary, is also being submitted for consideration. Notable omissions from the shortlist are In the Shadow of the Moon, The King of Kong, and Terror’s Advocate.

Few who’ve seen Sally Potter‘s adaptation of Orlando, with Swinton in the title role, will forget the power of her performance, a power she brings to every role she tackles, from Constantine to Burn After Reading. Her supporting role in Michael Clayton earned her an Oscar, but her performance in Julia, out now on DVD, went largely unnoticed despite its impact on those who saw it. Out now on DVD, Swinton sits down with RT to talk about the film.[tomatometer]MuzeID=1211574[/tomatometer]What was it about Julia as a character that made you want to play her?Tilda Swinton: She reminds me of so many of the great drunks I have known and loved in my life, who have always felt so unlike the kind of loser character often put forward in cinema portrayals.Is there a particular appeal to exploring characters as unglamorous and as unrelentingly real as Julia?TS: It certainly does one good to notice how extreme ‘unrelenting realness’ very often is; how far from any concept of good taste or subtlety. When we were developing this film, we went out of our way to be clear with ourselves just how far we needed to go. People like Kate del Castillo‘s character really are that unhinged, desperate people with guns and insanely ferocious dogs do shout that loud, people like Julia do drink that much and that often, the effort to appear sober the morning after drinking as much as she does does involve that much overacting, look that forced and feel that wierd to be around.Tilda Swinton in JuliaWhat are the real challenges and areas of consideration when you’re taking on a character afflicted by something like alcoholism?TS:The responsibility of going far enough. The resistence to stopping short of the mark for the sake of modesty.What was the experience of working with Erick Zonca like?TS: Exhilarating. Multilingual. Random. Addictive. He has to be the least cerebral filmmaker I have ever worked with; he directs outside of any formal or literary concerns whatsoever. He directs energy – nothing less – and is not interested in anything except the authentic. His constant request is for ‘something of different’, ‘something of fantasy’ and, of me in particular, ‘more ugly, Tilda, make more ugly faces’. His allergy to generica and his passion are truly infectious and a tonic to be around. I’d work with him again in a heartbeat.Continue onto the next page as Tilda Swinton talks about working with children and on location and tells us more about her upcoming reteaming with Jim Jarmusch.[tomatometer]MuzeID=1211574[/tomatometer]Aidan Gould is remarkable as Tom, what are the joys and challenges of working with children?TS: I can only think of joys. That they know the proper value of play. That they are up for the practical artifice of pretend; I’ve yet to meet a child of nine burdened with any concept of a method, or the pressure of taking their character home with them or all that displacement stuff. That they are in touch with the fun of making things up. That they are in no screwed-up battle with their dignity all the while. Altogether, in combination with the need for children to work restricted hours, it’s grace.There’s an incredible amount of location work involved here and some striking locations — do you prefer working on location?TS: Possibly. It makes for a completely different texture to what you actually shoot, let’s face it, and in the land of realness, or semi-realness, as in Julia, there is a kind of ease that comes with walking into real places surrounded by energies other than that of the film. Real walls, real pavement, real sky all help hold down the make believe and pin it into place.Tilda Swinton in JuliaWe’re soon to see you in another Jim Jarmusch film, could you tell us a little about your character and the film itself?TS: Pretty much nothing, I’m afraid. Isaach de Bankole wears sensational shiny suits. I wear a white wig and cowboy hat. Paz de la Huerta wears – mainly – not a stitch. We are all in Spain. Isaach meets us there, on an unexplained mission, as he does Bill Murray, Gael Garcia Bernal, John Hurt, Youki Kudoh and others. We hand him cryptic messages in matchboxes and expound on art, music, science, hallucinogenics and sex. My subject is cinema. Isaach keeps moving.

When Bill learns that his co-star is Aaron Roman (Eric Gores), a rich kid with no acting experience, what appeared to be the chance for a major comeback turns into a series of outlandish complications. As the duo embark on a journey of outrageous misadventures, the unlikely pair discover that it takes more courage to face real life challenges than it does fighting bad guys on the big screen. Although Aaron may be inexperienced in acting, his tenacious spirit, unwavering optimism and unconditional friendship turns out to be an important, enduring gift to Bill.\"And get this cast: Joe Mantegna, Linda Hamilton, Henry Winkler, Shannon Elizabeth, Jamie Lee Curtis, and … Arnold Schwarzenegger?

When it came time for his move across the country, things fell right into place: By the time he got the call for an interview, he could already tell them his new address in the city.“You can be a film critic anywhere,” he told Rotten Tomatoes, “but there really is something about being in New York and being at the Film Forum, seeing a recently restored version or our print of Army of Shadows that you really just kind of feel like,&nbsp;Oh, I’m in Film Nerd Heaven.”David Fear is now a Senior Editor and critic at Rolling Stone, and the former Film Editor of Time Out New York.What’s your personal record for most movies seen in a day?When I was younger and much, much more full of piss and vinegar, I think I did a six-film day at Sundance once. It might have been my first or second Sundance back in 2004, 2005. I don’t recommend it.If you ate six meals in a day, they could be the greatest meals in the world. They could be five-star chef meals. But you’ve stopped tasting it after a while and it just becomes shoveling food into your mouth and going, “Oh my God, when is this going to end?”I found that when I would start doing more than three, maybe four movies a day at a festival, I would stop tasting the food.Do you prefer 3-D or non–3-D screenings?Do you even have to ask that? I’ve actually gone out of my way to see to 2-D screenings because, here’s the thing, with very rare exceptions, there’s only really three movies that you absolutely, positively need to see in 3-D.There’s really no point to seeing Avatar unless you’re seeing it in 3-D. It’s a bad movie, but how he uses 3-D to really immerse you in a bad movie that he’s made is remarkably impressive.Are you pro– or anti–note-taking?I don’t understand how you can do this gig and not take notes. If you’re really serious about potentially wanting to do this, practice writing stuff in a notebook without looking at your notebook. I’m very, very pro-note taking – so long as it’s not with one of those light pens. Man, f–k those light pens.You’re sitting down to write. Would you prefer a shot of espresso or alcohol? What’s your spirit of choice?Espresso for writing and then bourbon for transcribing. It makes the activity of transcribing so much less painful.(Photo by Paramount Vantage)What’s the hardest review you’ve ever written?If I still had a chance to work on and revise my There Will Be Blood review, I would still be doing it. Not only because it’s just one of my favorite films ever, but there’s so much going on and it’s such a slippery film for me to try and really grasp and write about in a way that feels articulate and as close to complete as possible.I still have nightmares about writing that review and really feeling like I hadn’t quite gotten it yet. Not that I hadn’t got the movie – I knew exactly how I felt about the movie – but to try and translate that into a piece, and explain why I think it’s one of the great artworks of the 21st century to date was… I still have nightmares about it.Someone that everyone should follow on Twitter?I’m biased because I know him, but Justin Chang [of the Los Angeles Times]. To my money, there’s just not a better film critic working today than Justin. You should follow him on Twitter for the puns – not just the fact that he’s one of the smartest, funniest film writers today, but he is like a God-level pun maker. His punny games, his punny business is just absolutely insane.Up-and-coming critic that you think people should read?There are two young critics that I hope people are paying attention to.I hope people are reading Kameron Austin Collins, he’s one of the film critics for Vanity Fair. I ended up meeting him and found out he was only in late 20s. I was just like, “Oh my God. If you’re writing at this level in your late 20s, you’re going to be a f–king monster in the next 10 years.”I would say the same about Monica Castillo. She’s all over the place byline-wise, but she’s one of those people I feel she’s maturing really beautifully as a writer.(Photo by Paramount Pictures)Do you have a favorite classic film?I could watch&nbsp;The Lady Eve&nbsp;every single day for the rest of my life and never get tired of it. There are a handful of films that I feel are as close to perfect as humanly possible, and&nbsp;The Lady Eve&nbsp;is one of them.It’s such a cliché answer, but I’ve probably seen&nbsp;The Godfather&nbsp;close to a hundred times and that’s barely an exaggeration. Between that and the&nbsp;second&nbsp;Godfather&nbsp;film, I almost feel like I can quote most of them off the top of my head.Is that the movie you’ve watched more than any other?Yeah, that would have to be it. There’s a couple of movies that I’ve definitely gotten into the double digits with. I’ve seen&nbsp;Dazed and Confused&nbsp;a lot because it’s a comfort movie. I can sink into that movie.Is there an actor, director, or screenwriter whose work you always love?The closest thing I would say I have to a favorite filmmaker – and take that phrase with a huge grain of salt – would be Yasujirō Ozu. I feel the movies he makes were reverse-engineered for me.(Photo by 20th Century Fox)Do you have a favorite movie from your childhood?I remember seeing Monty Python and the Holy Grail on PBS one night… I watched that constantly as a kid. You know when you found something that’s your sense of humor?And then, because I’m a child of the ‘70s, Star Wars. My parents actually took me out of school to go see a matinee of it the first week that it was open. I had no idea what I was going into and as a six-year-old kid and then walked out of it a changed human being.Is there anything that you consider “required viewing”?Yeah. Actually, I think it’s out of print now… Visions of Light. It’s a documentary about cinematography and covers the gamut, talks a lot about cinematographers in the ’30s and ’40s, talks a lot about the new Hollywood guys, talks a lot about British cinematographers. It really is this incredible primer that not only is just a beautiful film, obviously, because it’s talking about people who’ve shot movies beautifully. It’s an extraordinary gateway drug.(Photo by Universal Pictures)You recently wrote a piece on the 20-year resonance of Fight Club. I’m wondering if there’s a movie released this decade that you think in 10 or 20 years we’re going to look back and think, “That was the 2010s.”If I had to be honest, I think the movie would be Get Out. It feels like it’s very much a movie for the end of the Obama era and very, very much a movie for the beginning of the Trump era. Never mind that it’s also a really great move and it’s a movie that keeps giving the more you see it, and it’s so beautifully constructed. It works well as a horror film, works well as a satire, works well as social commentary, and worked well as a personal expression of the sensibility of the person who made it.What’s the biggest misconception you hear about critics?That we hate movies. It’s really the opposite. I think a lot of us love the art form enough that when we see it used badly, we feel we need to call it out. I don’t trust the critic that doesn’t live, breathe, eat, and s–t movies.What are you most proud of in your career so far?As an editor, I’m not a religious person but, I think blessed is really the only word I can think of… When I get something from a good writer and think like, “Oh, this is good but there’s a great piece in here. Let’s find this great piece.”In a way, it’s like you’re not the mother, you’re the midwife – being able to help a really beautiful baby be born into the world by trying to be a good editor. Getting back a second, or a third, or sometimes a fourth draft and finally having the moment where you’re like, “Yes! Holy s–t! You found it.”David Fear is a Senior Editor and critic at&nbsp;Rolling Stone.

With the holiday season in full swing, we’ll be sharing some of our personal favorites from Disney that have been released on Blu-ray. If you’re searching for some family friendly high definition goodness, see if some of our personal Disney favorites can help jump start your gift giving![tomatometer]MuzeID=1184018[/tomatometer]EnchantedTake the hottest Disney Princess since Beauty and the Beast‘s Belle in Enchanted‘s Giselle, add a generous helping of Amy Adams’ charm, a dash of Dr. McDreamy himself (Patrick Dempsey) at his Grey’s Anatomy peak, and weave in some characters and themes from Disney classics, and you have yourself one of Disney’s most enjoyable movies in recent memory. Taken from her animated fairy tale world of Andalasia, where her days consist of the tasks of being pretty, singing with her animal friends, and waiting for Prince Charming (or Prince Edward, played by James Marsden), Giselle is tricked by an evil queen into falling down a well/portal that lands her in modern day New York City. While trying to find her way home to Andalasia, Giselle has to learn what it’s like to not be an animated character and also discover the real life meaning of true love, which begins to understand through, of all people, an emotionally detached divorce lawyer. Nearly all of Enchanted’s special features are presented in 1080P, with the exception of Carrie Underwood’s (another plus!) music video for “Ever Ever After.” The Blu-ray includes making-of clips, deleted scenes, a pop up story, and trailers for National Treasure: Book of Secrets and Sleeping Beauty on Blu-ray.[tomatometer]MuzeID=1109769[/tomatometer]Monsters, Inc.Monster’s Inc: the other black sheep of the Pixar canon? It’s their least discussed movie outside of A Bug’s Life, but not for lack of quality; this tale of monsters employed by a mega-corporation to scare children in the human world to harness the energy of their screams is a compltely solid, clever tale but somehow lacks a certain je ne sais quoi that keeps it from classic status. The characterizations may not run too deep and the universe of the monsters too overwhelming for most audiences, but it builds up to a stunning emotional finale and the climatic chase sequence is arguably the best action sequence Pixar has ever put out. The Blu-ray features a lengthy commentary feature from the filmmakers, an overview of the Monsters ride in Tokyo, two original shorts, “interviews” with the characters, deleted scenes, and is definitely packed with enough fun stuff for the kids.[tomatometer]MuzeID=1164826[/tomatometer]RatatouilleIt’s old hat at this point to praise Pixar for its innovation, for its attention to detail, for its emotionally satisfying storytelling. So let’s take slightly a different tack with Certified Fresh Ratatouille: has there ever been a more tactile, sensorial animated feature than this one? Nearly everything in Ratatouille seems tangible, from the pots and pans in the Parisian kitchens to the fur on its protagonist’s little rat body. And the tasty concoctions that our hero Remy (voiced by Patton Oswalt) cooks up are so vividly realized that you can practically smell them. How real does this movie feel in high-definition? You’ll have to find out for yourself, but to entice you, the Ratatouille Blu-ray has a 14-minute documentary on the intersection between cinema and cuisine, along with deleted scenes and two Pixar shorts: Lifted and Your Friend the Rat.[tomatometer]MuzeID=1048889[/tomatometer]The Nightmare Before ChristmasContrary to what many have come to believe, The Nightmare Before Christmas was not, in fact, directed by Tim Burton (Edward Scissorhands, Big Fish); the stop-motion animated film was helmed by Henry Selick, who went on to bring us the similarly animated films James and the Giant Peach and this year’s Coraline. Burton did, however, produce Nightmare and come up with its story, and his fingerprints are all over the film, from its dark yet playful themes right down to the character design. The story focuses on Jack Skellington, the Pumpkin King of Halloweentown, who happens upon a mysterious door in the middle of the forest that leads him to discover Christmastown. Enchanted by the charms of Christmas, Jack returns to Halloweentown and attempts to recreate the holiday for his own townsfolk, with disastrous results. In Blu-Ray, each character bursts with life onscreen in never-before-seen clarity, and Danny Elfman’s musical numbers pop in HD audio. There are also tons of special features, including featurettes, commentaries, an original poem narrated by Christopher Lee, Burton’s short film Vincent, and a lot more. The film is quickly becoming a holiday classic, and with the amount of stuff you get with the disc, this is definitely a Blu-Ray to pick up and store in your collection.[tomatometer]MuzeID=1187275[/tomatometer]WALL-EForget the supposed eco-message about our dying Earth — “I just wanted to cover the world in trash,” said director Andrew Stanton, and never has an entire planet piled high with refuse looked so beautiful. From the opening seconds of WALL-E — as we zoom into a vacated world, the sound of a long-gone show tune collapsing into Thomas Newman’s eerie score — Pixar’s lonely robot movie casts an unforgettable spell, taking us at once back to the glory days of ’70s sci-fi and into the shiny future of CG storytelling. The movie’s bleep-and-clank first half (a sound design marvel from Ben Burtt) is as bold a piece of filmmaking as anything this decade, and if WALL-E resorts to more conventional storytelling for its denouement, it’s never less than superb. As you’d expect the film scrubs up fresher than an oil bath on Blu-ray, where you can really see the intricacy of Stanton’s compositions and his animators work on the robots’ expressions. Features include a picture-in-picture commentary, audio tracks with Stanton and Burtt and a load of making-of featurettes. Essential stuff.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"History, and, Film, One, Crunchyroll","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"what-were-watching-on-bluray-from-disney"},{"id":"47613339500038","title":"Cannes 2009: The Tomato Report – Critics Pick Their Awards Favourites","content":"var mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Cannes 2009: The Tomato Report - Critics Pick Their Awards FavouritesThe Palme d'Or gets awarded tonight - what are critics tipping?by Chris Tilly | May 24, 2009 |  CommentsWith the Cannes Film Festival winding down this weekend, talk is now turning to who will win the Palme d’Or this evening. We tracked down several journalists covering the fest to gauge their opinion, and it seems there are two very definite front-runners at present – Michael Haneke‘s The White Ribbon, a taut period drama about a German village pre-WWI, and Jacques Audiard‘s A Prophet, a prison film about a young man’s efforts to survive incarceration in a French jail.“I am rooting for A Prophet to win,” says Heat’s Charles Gant. “It’s the Gomorrah of this year’s festival, but thanks to its linear storyline it’s arguably more accessible and satisfying than last year’s Mafia drama. But maybe its genre conventionality will count against it with the jury, earning it a lesser prize, possibly Best Actor for young Tahar Rahim, making his big-screen debut.“One school of thought says it would be controversial for the jury to give the Palme D’Or to another French film after The Class won in 2008, but I don’t think juries think like that.“The favourite at this stage is probably Michael Haneke’s The White Ribbon. He’s never won before and it’s a very solid Euro arthouse offering: a slow-build film that commands engagement through Haneke’s usual trick of withholding information.“The third film in strong contention is Jane Campion‘s Bright Star. I’m not excited by that idea, although I did considerably like the film. In style and subject (poet John Keats’ chaste love affair with his neighbour), it seems slightly conventional, especially when compared with recent winners such as The Class and Romanian abortion drama 4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Days.”Jacques Audiard’s A Prophet.The Times’ Wendy Ide concurs with Gant. “In my opinion, the two strongest contenders are A Prophet and The White Ribbon. The latter might just swing it because of its uncompromising and distinctive style, intellectual rigor, and because jury president Isabelle Huppert has collaborated with him before. But then again, the jury could just go nuts and give it to Antichrist.”The latter is Lars von Trier‘s controversial horror film, which stars Willem Defoe and Charlotte Gainsbourg as a grieving couple trying to mend their relationship in an isolated cabin in the woods. It has certainly divided opinion out here, but The Independent’s Kaleem Aftab is most definitely a fan. “I genuinely hope it wins,” he said. “Love it or hate it, von Trier’s visually stunning film provokes debate and makes you question life.”We also caught up with Leslie Felperin, who had just finished lunch with her fellow Variety critics, where talk had also apparently turned to the Palme. “The collective consensus is that first and foremost you can never tell what a jury’s going to plump for,” she said. “So often serious horse-trading goes on and something worthy but dull takes the prize because the jurors are too divided about the more obvious candidates.“We were all joking at lunch that we can just imagine juror Asia Argento championing Lars von Trier’s Antichrist to the horror of the others. Having said that, I would bet that the Michael Haneke movie, The White Ribbon, is a strong contender for the Palme just because he’s never won the Palme itself (although he’s won best director and, I think, grand jury prizes), and one of his leading ladies, Isabelle Huppert, is head of the jury this year. I hasten to add that I haven’t even seen the film, but apparently it’s very good.“Jacques Audiard’s A Prophet ought to and probably will win something because it’s brilliantly made, although it could be described as a ‘genre’ movie, and juries often fail to honour such films. Which is dumb, but there you go.”The White RibbonBut what of Inglourious Basterds, Quentin Tarantino‘s eagerly anticipated WWII flick that ticks all the genre boxes? According to Empire’s Damon Wise, the film’s popularity will count against it. “It would enable QT to join the double-Palme club, but I think the film’s entertainment factor might count against it,” he says.It may also not help that jury president Huppert had originally been set to star in the film, before Tarantino replaced her for being too “divistic.”“I think it’s wide open at the minute,” he continues, “But with Isabelle Huppert as head of the jury, with the likes of Asia Argento and Hanif Kureishi backing her up, I don’t think the Palme will go to anything ‘meh’. I’ve been told it’s 50-50 between A Prophet and, er, something else, and I think Audiard’s film will appeal to [jury member] James Gray, certainly. A French film won last year, which might hold it back though. The jury’s five actresses, however, may suggest that women will be especially favoured this year, so Jane Campion and Andrea Arnold could be looking at a win, although perhaps not the Palme itself.“So I’ll stick my neck out. I think the Palme will go to Antichrist or The White Ribbon. If Haneke wins, Lars gets best director, and vice versa.”Finally, Total Film’s Jonathan Dean is championing a film about a drug dealer’s tripped out experience in Tokyo that has been causing quite a stir at the tail-end of the festival. “In a world where awards are handed out to films that don’t so much push the envelope as blow it up, Enter The Void would win the Palme d’Or for the next five years. Visually extraordinary and the most mind-warping film I’ve ever seen, [director] Gaspar Noe is a master of invention. Credit would be deserved.“But clearly, seeing as it’s a bit mad and really tails off in the last hour, Enter The Void won’t win. No chance. Instead I reckon – like everyone else, that A Prophet is the one to beat, even if personally I’d be satisfied with the other favourite The White Ribbon. Keep an eye out for Fish Tank too. A brilliant film sure to push jury members Huppert and Argento’s buttons.”The winner of the Palme D’Or will be announced this evening.
