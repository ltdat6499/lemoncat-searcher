Born into poverty on a Puerto Rican farm, Moreno and her seamstress mother immigrated to New York City when Moreno was five years old. After studying dance and performing on Broadway, Moreno was cast as any ethnic minority the Hollywood studios needed filled, be it Polynesian, Native American or Egyptian. Despite becoming the first Latina actress to win an Academy Award for her role as Anita in \"West Side Story\" (1961), the studios continued to offer Moreno lesser roles as stereotypical ethnic minorities, ignoring her proven talent. RITA MORENO: JUST A GIRL WHO DECIDED TO GO FOR IT illuminates the humor and the grace of Moreno, as well as lesser-known struggles faced on her path to stardom, including pernicious Hollywood sexism and abuse, a toxic relationship with Marlon Brando, and serious depression a year before she emerged an Oscar winner. Moreno's talent and resilience triumphed over adversity, as she broke barriers, fought for representation and forged the path for new generations of artists.","poster":"https://resizing.flixster.com/TGeBb70mtWIrly3DaP1X8xcdo1E=/206x305/v2/https://resizing.flixster.com/mboEYp3zuKNUaq9eqz_Gel-N_q0=/ems.ZW1zLXByZC1hc3NldHMvbW92aWVzL2Y2MTc5ZTQ4LTM2YTYtNDZmNi05YjU4LTI1NzRhNDBlOTcyYS5qcGc=","collection":"","productions":"Lemoncat","theatersDate":"Jun 18, 2021","streamings":"netflix, amazon-prime-video-us","lemonScore":"99","slug":"rita_moreno_just_a_girl_who_decided_to_go_for_it"},{"id":"47438911653381","type":"movie","name":"Command and Control","tags":"","genres":"documentary","rating":"PG-13","summary":"Filmmaker Robert Kenner examines how human error caused an explosion at a nuclear site toward the end of the Cold War and links mutually assured destruction to self-annihilation.","poster":"https://resizing.flixster.com/TTl4wcCv6c2Wrksm_XfAyhM5sgY=/206x305/v2/https://resizing.flixster.com/AMtsZ0E0arkocjSrkbRxrhCmyTA=/ems.ZW1zLXByZC1hc3NldHMvbW92aWVzLzE0YjU3MjY0LWUzODctNDA1My05NTM3LTZiOGE0YWQzNWU0Yi53ZWJw","collection":"","productions":"Lemoncat","theatersDate":"Sep 14, 2016","streamings":"amazon-prime-video-us","lemonScore":"95","slug":"command_and_control"},{"id":"47453153334408","type":"movie","name":"Girlfight","tags":"","genres":"drama","rating":"R","summary":"Newcomer Michelle Rodriguez in an astounding performance alongside Jaime Tirelli, Paul Calderon and Santiago Douglas.
