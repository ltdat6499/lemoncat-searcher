A native of Long Island, New York, she began her acting career when she was 4, appearing with a role opposite Valerie Harper in the television movie \"An Invasion of Privacy\" (CBS, 1983). She began working on a regular basis, appearing in commercials for Burger King and working on the miniseries \"A Woman Named Jackie\" (NBC, 1990) with Roma Downey. Her career began to take off in earnest during her teen years when she was cast in the syndicated teen drama \"Swans Crossing\" (1992). She was then cast as Kendall Hart, the long lost daughter of Susan Lucci's Erica Kane, on the daytime soap opera \"All My Children\" (ABC, 1970-2011). She left the soap in 1995, but her rise to stardom would start in earnest in 1997. She was cast in a pair of teen horror movies, playing one of the guilty teens alongside Jennifer Love Hewitt and future husband Freddie Prinze Jr. in \"I Know What You Did Last Summer\" (1997). She also joined Neve Campbell and Courteney Cox for the sequel \"Scream 2\" (1997). That same year, Joss Whedon cast her as the lead in \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer,\" loosely based on the 1992 film of the same name. The show quickly developed a loyal following that would continue returning to the series well after it's seven season run ended. Outside of the show, she continued working in film, starring with Ryan Phillippe and Reese Witherspoon in the \"Dangerous Liaisons\" modernization, \"Cruel Intentions\" (1999). She also joined Sean Patrick Flanery for the romantic comedy \"Simply Irresistible\" (1999). Along with Prinze, she starred in the live action adaptation of \"Scooby Doo\" (2002), playing Daphne, a role that she would recreate for the sequel, \"Scooby Doo 2: Monsters Unleashed\" (2004). She returned to horror as well, starring in \"The Grudge\" (2004) and \"The Grudge 2\" (2006). Her film career included starring turns in \"Suburban Girl\" (2007), \"Possession\" (2008), and \"Veronika Decides to Die\" (2009). She returned to series television with the lead role in the drama \"Ringer\" (The CW, 2011-12) and opposite Robin Williams in the sitcom \"The Crazy Ones\" (CBS, 2013-14). Gellar slipped back into her manipulative \"Cruel Intentions\" character, Kathryn Merteuil, for the television movie \"Cruel Intentions\" (NBC, 2016). The project was meant as a pilot for a proposed series, but never made it to that stage.

Born Timothy David Olyphant on May 20, 1968 in Honolulu, Hawaii, he moved with his family - Gallo wine executive J.V. Bevan Olyphant, his wife, Katherine and two brothers - to Modesto, California when he was two years of age. There, he nurtured an interest in competitive swimming at Fred C. Beyer High School, and considered a career in art. Olyphant was recruited to the University of Southern California by its swimming coach, but upon discovering that he would be unable to swim and pursue his chosen major- architecture - he chose to earn his degree in fine arts. Upon graduating in 1990, he married his college sweetheart, Alexis Knief, and the pair relocated to New York, where Olyphant dabbled in coaching and stand-up comedy before abandoning fine art in favor of an acting career. After completing a two-year course of study at the William Esper Studio, he began landing minor roles on television series and in features like \"Sex and the City\" (HBO, 1998-2004) and \"Scream 2\" (1997). His first break came as a drug-dealing anti-hero in Doug Liman's edgy comedy-drama \"Go\" (1999), which in turn led to an offer from its producer, Mickey Liddell, to star in \"The Broken Hearts Club\" (2000), a romantic comedy about gay men in West Hollywood, California. Response to the film set the template for much of Olyphant's film output in the next few years: Olyphant's slyly bemused performances was, more often than not, the sole bright spot in indie and studio efforts like \"Auggie Rose\" (2000); \"Gone in Sixty Seconds\" (2000), with Nicolas Cage; \"Head Over Heels\" (2001); \"Rock Star\" (2001) with Mark Wahlberg, and \"The Girl Next Door\" (2004). That same year, Olyphant received one of his best showcases in \"Deadwood,\" producer David Milch's proudly profane and intricately plotted Western series about the lives of real and imagined individuals in the notorious titular South Dakota mining camp. Olyphant played Seth Bullock, the hot-tempered but law-abiding camp sheriff, whose notions of right and wrong often ran afoul of Ian McShane's Machiavellian saloonkeeper, Al Swearengen. A critical favorite for Milch's ornate dialogue and cast of accomplished players, \"Deadwood\" was only a modest ratings hit, and the cost of maintaining an entire town set led to its untimely demise after two seasons. But even with the abbreviated run, the attention afforded by critics and industry figures to \"Deadwood\" helped to boost Olyphant's profile from comic support to dramatic lead and co-lead, which in turn led to major roles in a slew of motion pictures. The most successful of these was undoubtedly \"Live Free or Die Hard\" (2007), whch cast him as a cyber-terrorist pitted against Bruce Willis' reluctant hero, but as before, Olyphant was the most notable element of films like \"Hitman\" (2007), which afforded him a rare lead; \"The Perfect Getaway\" (2009); \"The Crazies\" (2010) and \"Elektra Luxx\" (2010). Olyphant was soon back on television, where he played Rose Byrne's highly suspect boyfriend in the second season of \"Damages,\" and a brief run as a handsome paper salesman on several episodes of \"The Office\" (NBC, 2005-2013). His performance on \"Damages\" led to network chief John Landgraf offering him the lead on \"Justified,\" a crime thriller based on Elmore Leonard's stories about a flinty U.S. Marshal. The series helped to do what \"Deadwood\" had promised - to provide Olyphant with a long-running and high-quality showcase for his talents, which earned a Emmy nomination in 2011. When \"Justified\" ran its course after five seasons, Olyphant bounced between comic and dramatic efforts: the former included an amusing turn as a vain, fictionalized version of himself on \"The Grinder\" (Fox, 2015-16) and a series lead in the Netflix dark comedy \"The Santa Clarita Diet\" (2017-19), with Olyphant as a suburban husband attempting to contend with his wife (Drew Barrymore), who has transformed into a cannibalistic zombie. In 2019, long-standing rumors of a \"Deadwood\" revival finally materialized as a two-hour TV-movie for HBO, with Olyphant reprising his role as an older, slightly less irascible Bullock.","slug":"timothy_olyphant","born_in":"Honolulu, Hawaii, USA","birth":"1968-05-19T16:00:00.000Z","images":"https://resizing.flixster.com/CKY2KjJMuoAlKmD6loqrU0rzjCg=/506x652/v2/https://flxt.tmsimg.com/v9/AllPhotos/164843/164843_v9_bb.jpg"},{"id":"47339732656510","name":"Ann Roth","summary":"A veteran costume designer, Ann Roth had amassed more than twenty Broadway credits before entering films with George Roy Hill's \"The World of Henry Orient\" (1964).

The prospect of appearing in such a beloved story was as exciting to Nickerson as filming in a foreign country-as the movie was slated to be shot in Germany-and she was elated to win the part of the bad-mannered Violet. When \"Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory\" (1971) was released, Nickerson became an even more well known face. She went on to star in a short-lived Broadway production of \"Lolita, My Love,\" and later joined the cast of the hugely popular kids TV series \"The Electric Company\" (PBS, 1971-77) from 1972 to 1973. At age 16, Nickerson opted to switch coasts, moving to Los Angeles to try her hand at a different selection of roles. However, Nickerson would discover that unlike New York, California had laws in place limiting the number of hours per day that a minor could work. This made her a less convenient hire for many film and TV productions than many legally adult actors who were just two years her senior, and so she only appeared in a few additional projects such as the acclaimed movie \"Smile\" (1975) and the TV movie \"The Dark Side of Innocence\" (NBC, 1976) before acting in her final on-screen role in the movie \"Zero to Sixty\" (1978). Nickerson was interested in attending law school, but her plans were put on hold when she discovered that her parents had spent all of the money she had made during her stage and screen career. She began working as a receptionist at a doctor's office, and eventually became a very successful accountant. Tragically, Nickerson passed away in 2018. She was 62 years old.","slug":"denise_nickerson","born_in":"New York, New York, USA","birth":"1957-03-31T17:00:00.000Z","images":"https://resizing.flixster.com/DOMUq8Urt5uICyoPQo7cQfE__cA=/506x652/v2/https://flxt.tmsimg.com/v9/AllPhotos/135870/135870_v9_ba.jpg"},{"id":"47339765004674","name":"Julie Dawn Cole","summary":"English actress Julie Dawn Cole started her career in entertainment as a child.

There was no denying that Siegel's four-decade career generated some of the most enjoyable and mature crime dramas to come from Hollywood.","slug":"don_siegel","born_in":"Chicago, Illinois, USA","birth":"1912-10-25T17:00:00.000Z","images":"https://resizing.flixster.com/i9V85zBxOrlkjOK0qfHZ46Ea0pE=/506x652/v2/https://flxt.tmsimg.com/v9/AllPhotos/69668/69668_v9_ba.jpg"},{"id":"47340692969939","name":"Lawrence Pressman","summary":"Lawrence Pressman has been a busy guy since his first appearance on the daytime soap \"The Edge of Night\" in 1969, always able to bring a little class to a production no matter how big or small the role. In the 1970s he worked mostly in television, including small parts in popular crime dramas \"Hawaii Five-O,\" \"Barnaby Jones,\" and \"The Streets of San Francisco.\" A versatile actor, he has also appeared in sitcoms \"The Bob Newhart Show\" and \"M*A*S*H.\" He had a top role in the classic 1971 blaxploitation cop film \"Shaft.\" His most notable film role during this period was entomologist Nils Hellstrom in the cult science fiction film \"The Hellstrom Chronicle,\" a mix of fiction and documentary best remembered for its extraordinary cinematography. His other prominent television work was the seminal primetime miniseries \"Rich Man, Poor Man,\" as well as heading his own short-lived program, \"Mulligan's Stew,\" about a high school football coach (Pressman) and his wife raising a household of seven children. Work over the next couple of decades did not let up for the actor, though his most familiar gig was arguably the 1980 sitcom \"Ladies' Man\" and his prominent role as Dr. Benjamin Canfield on the medical dramedy \"Doogie Howser, M.D.\" starring a young Neil Patrick Harris. Pressman also had roles on the crime drama \"Crossing Jordan,\" the drama \"Judging Amy,\" and a recurring guest spot on the soap opera \"General Hospital.\"","slug":"lawrence_pressman","born_in":"Cynthiana, Kentucky, USA","birth":"1939-07-09T17:00:00.000Z","images":"https://resizing.flixster.com/-W72CjiFz-BsDrC6O916djPMO7M=/506x652/v2/https://flxt.tmsimg.com/v9/AllPhotos/85375/85375_v9_ba.jpg"},{"id":"47340089911713","name":"Mae Mercer","summary":"Vivamus consectetur odio leo, vel pharetra est dignissim a.

When the popularity of pointed, edgy British filmmaking faded, the young spokesman of a generation was unconcerned with parlaying his acclaim into mainstream movie stardom. McDowell's habit of fielding offers both good and bad led him to rival only countryman Michael Caine in sheer amount of screen time. His \"Clockwork\" breakout led to career-long castings as bad guys in many lesser artistic achievements, ranging from John Badham's actioner \"Blue Thunder\" (1983) to a high profile role as \"the man who killed Captain Kirk\" in \"Star Trek: Generations\" (1994). With his low voice and early head of snow white hair, McDowell was cast as professors, military men, doctors, and megalomaniacs, generally favoring offbeat projects like Paul Schrader's unsettling \"Cat People\" (1982) and the post-apocalyptic \"Tank Girl\" (1995). With the exception of his leading role in the rock-n-roll comedy \"Get Crazy\" (1983) and a hilarious run on the short-lived CBS sitcom \"Pearl\" (1996-97), McDowell was underappreciated for his sharp comic skills, and into his senior years the actor's high profile roles in Rob Zombie's \"Halloween\" films (2007, 2009) and a stint as a manipulative Hollywood player on the HBO drama \"Entourage\" (HBO, 2004-11) ensured that a new generation of audiences also came also to associate him with the villainous and sinister.","slug":"malcolm_mcdowell","born_in":"Leeds, Yorkshire, England, UK","birth":"1943-06-12T16:00:00.000Z","images":"https://resizing.flixster.com/23US1lH9-6pp_sbBwglmME3g5hU=/506x652/v2/https://flxt.tmsimg.com/v9/AllPhotos/41639/41639_v9_ba.jpg"},{"id":"47340274649516","name":"Patrick Magee","summary":"Nimbus-haired, scowling character actor who made his film debut in the savage gangster film, \"The Criminal\" (1960) and is probably best known as the vengeful scribe in the nightmarish masterpiece, \"A Clockwork Orange\" (1971).","slug":"patrick_magee","born_in":"Armagh, Northern Ireland, UK","birth":"1922-03-30T17:00:00.000Z","images":"https://resizing.flixster.com/6JF69uUZU0OW_lvah8bcKHG8hbY=/506x652/v2/https://flxt.tmsimg.com/v9/AllPhotos/72619/72619_v9_ba.jpg"},{"id":"47340286346669","name":"Warren Clarke","summary":"Born Alan James Clarke in Lancashire, England, the actor chose to change his name to Warren during the early stages of his acting career because Warren Beatty was the man his then-girlfriend most admired. Clarke's father, a stained-glass maker, and his mother, a secretary, were able to send their son to the prestigious Barlow Hall Secondary Modern School, Chorlton-cum-Hardy, Manchester. Upon graduation Clarke landed a job at the Manchester Evening News as a copy boy. During this time he took up the hobby of amateur dramatics, and made the decision to pursue acting full time. Clarke first appeared on television in the long-running program \"Coronation Street\" (ITV 1960- ), a series that follows the residents of a Manchester suburb. Three years later he had his first big-screen film appearance when he played the simple-minded droog Dim in Stanley Kubrick's \"A Clockwork Orange\" (1971) opposite Malcolm McDowell. Following his appearance in \"A Clockwork Orange,\" Clarke worked with McDowell two additional times, in \"O Lucky Man!\" (1973), and \"Gulag\" (1985).  Clarke appeared in films as varied as the Shakespeare adaptation \"Antony and Cleopatra\" (1972), the broad comedy \"Top Secret!\" (1984), the notorious flop \"Ishtar\" (1987), and the thriller \"Sleepers\" (1991). Clarke died on November 12, 2014 following a brief illness.

Born in Portsmouth, Hampshire in 1926, Morris attended his hometown's Municipal College before landing a scholarship at London's prestigious RADA, making his acting debut in a Regent's Park Theatre production of \"A Winter's Tale.\" Morris devoted most of his early career to the stage including a two-year stint at The Old Vic, but switched his attention to TV and film in the '60s, guest starring in some of the decade's most iconic shows including \"The Avengers\" (ITV, 1961-69), \"The Saint\" (ITV, 1962-69) and \"The Prisoner\" (ITV, 1967-68), and appearing in \"The Quare Fellow\" (1962), \"City Beneath the Sea\" (1962) and \"If It's Tuesday, This Must Be Belgium\" (1969). Morris' signature wide smile, sideways glances and drawn-out speech pattern then graced a number of landmark films, most memorably as Alex's pervy correction officer in \"A Clockwork Orange\" (1971) and the eerie gravedigger in \"The Wicker Man\" (1973). After adding Woody Allen's Russian literature satire \"Love and Death\" (1975) and Ken Russell's campy \"Lisztomania\" (1975) to his resume, Morris moved to America. Parts in \"My Girl 2\" (1994) and \"Bordello of Blood\" (1996), as well as a three-episode stint in \"Deadwood\" (HBO, 2004-06), and a guest spot on \"It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia\" (FX, 2005- ) then followed, before Morris died in 2015 aged 89.","slug":"aubrey-morris","born_in":"Hampshire, England, UK","birth":"1926-05-31T17:00:00.000Z","images":"https://i.pinimg.com/originals/12/a1/a7/12a1a70d052a487a185c01c25b71a09e.jpg"},{"id":"47340351984051","name":"Godfrey Quigley","summary":"Vivamus consectetur odio leo, vel pharetra est dignissim a.

Born and raised in the mountainous town of Klamath Falls, Oregon, Colley never intended on becoming an actor. A gifted athlete (he excelled in football and track and field in high school), Colley was solely focused on sports as a teen. He was good enough in track and field to try out for the 1960 Summer Olympics as a discus thrower, but didn't make the final cut. He entered the University of Oregon shortly after to study architecture, but after stumbling upon his friend's play rehearsal, decided to refocus and become an actor. Colley then moved to San Francisco, with all of its bustling creativity, and spent the next five years honing his acting craft by appearing in numerous local plays. By the late 1960s he was appearing on TV on Western shows like \"The Virginian\" (NBC, 1962-71) and \"The Wild Wild West\" (CBS, 1965-69), as well as a recurring role on \"Daniel Boone\" (NBC, 1964-70). By the early 1970s he began appearing in films, including the sequel \"Beneath the Planet of the Apes\" (1970), as well as George Lucas's feature film directorial debut \"THX 1138\" (1971). Colley would have his greatest success in the early to mid-70s as an actor in a string of Blaxploitation films. It was during this time that he appeared in \"The Legend of N****r Charley,\" \"Black Caesar,\" and \"Sugar Hill,\" all of which were early films in the Blaxploitation genre. By the late 70s and 1980s Colley was appearing mostly in TV, most notably with recurring roles on \"The A-Team\" (NBC, 1983-87) and \"The Dukes of Hazzard\" (CBS, 1979-85). His acting career slowed by the late 80s, and over the next several years he appeared only intermittently in forgettable films like \"The Blue Iguana\" (1988), \"Piranha\" (1995) and \"Midnight Massacre\" (2016). Colley spent the remaining years of his life in his hometown of Klamath Falls.

Born Sidney Eddie Mosesian on July 14, 1938 in Fresno, California, he began performing at the age of seven years: dance lessons intended to correct a coordination problem instead revealed a remarkable aptitude for movement, which led to paying jobs in children's theater and in vaudeville revival. Haig's gift for rhythm also translated into a second career as a drummer on pop, swing and jazz recording sessions while still in high school. During this period, Haig also began acting in school productions, and at the advice of actor Dennis Morgan - a friend of his drama teacher - he trained at the famed Pasadena Playhouse before heading to Hollywood. There, he landed his first role in a UCLA student project directed by aspiring filmmaker Jack Hill, who would cast Haig in many of his subsequent features, including \"Spider Baby\" (1967), a macabre horror-comedy with Lon Chaney, Jr. as the caretaker of a deranged family that included a feeble-minded but still dangerous Haig. The film went largely unseen, but by the time of its release, Haig was already working steadily in features and on television, where his 6'4\" frame and baleful visage made him ideal for antagonists of all stripes in series like \"Batman\"(ABC, 1965-1968), \"The Man from U.N.C.L.E\" (NBC, 1964-1968) and \"Star Trek\" (NBC, 1966-1969). He also enjoyed minor roles in features like John Boorman's \"Point Blank\" (1967), George Lucas's \"THX 1138\" (1971), and the James Bond thriller \"Diamonds are Forever\" (1971), but his film career took off a few years later when Hill began directing for Roger Corman's New World Pictures. Hill made exciting, often violent genre films - women in prison pictures like \"The Big Doll House\" (1971), black action titles like \"Coffy\" (1973), both starring Pam Grier - with thematic and story elements that betrayed their base premises, and frequently tapped Haig to star as either diabolical thugs or hard-living rogues. The box office success of these and other Corman productions led to supporting roles in studio efforts for Haig, including Robert Aldrich's grim \"Emperor of the North\" (1973) and Richard Fleischer's Mafia drama \"The Don is Dead\" (1973), as well turns as hoods and hustlers on countless episodes of television series like \"The Six Million Dollar Man\" (ABC, 1973-1978) and \"The Rockford Files\" (NBC, 1974-1980). In 1978, he made his debut as a series regular on the CBS children's science fiction series \"Jason of Star Command\" (1978-1981), playing a megalomanical space pirate, and while film and television work remained steadily through the 1980s, Haig had grown tired of playing heavies and henchmen. He retired from acting in 1992 and worked as a licensed hypnotherapist until 1997, when diehard fan Quentin Tarantino lured him back to screen work with a minor role as a judge in \"Jackie Brown\" (1997), starring his old screen partner, Pam Grier. In 2003, rocker Rob Zombie tapped Haig to play a psychotic killer masquerading as a clown in \"House of 1000 Corpses.\" Though only a modest hit, Haig's performance, which was equally amusing and terrifying, won him a legion of new fans among the horror faithful, and for the next decade, Haig was again a menacing and occasionally heroic presence in countless horror films. The majority of these were low-budget efforts, with Haig's presence among their sole notable elements, though he reprised his killer clown, Captain Spaulding, in Zombie's grindhouse tribute \"The Devil's Rejects\" (2003) and appeared briefly in the director's revamp of \"Halloween\" (2007). Between these efforts were minor roles in Tarantino's \"Kill Bill: Vol. 2\" (2003) and S. Craig Zahler's grueling western \"Bone Tomahawk\" (2015), but horror films, and convention appearances for fans kept Haig exceptionally busy until 2019. Failing health had prevented Haig from making more than a brief return as Spaulding in Zombie's \"3 from Hell\" (2019), and after completing his scenes, he suffered a fall in his Los Angeles home that required hospitalization. While there, he suffered a lung infection that would eventually claim the 80-year-old Haig's life on September 21, 2019.","slug":"sid_haig","born_in":"Fresno, California, USA","birth":"1939-07-13T17:00:00.000Z","images":"https://resizing.flixster.com/oNNpoFB_cNK3YX8RpRh3kjxnJJk=/506x652/v2/https://flxt.tmsimg.com/v9/AllPhotos/86194/86194_v9_ba.jpg"},{"id":"47340568493512","name":"Marshall Efron","summary":"Marshall Efron was an actor who made a successful career for himself in film.

Lucas again struggled to find a studio to take a risk on his sci-fi epic \"Star Wars\" (1977), although its monumental triumph both set the standard for the blockbuster film and established Lucas as a titan in the industry. When he teamed with fellow boy genius Steven Spielberg on \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\" (1981) and its sequels, his stature was secured. In addition to overseeing the continuing adventures of Luke Skywalker in various forms, Lucas acted as executive producer on several projects throughout the 1980s and became the industry's premier innovator of theatre and film technology through his companies ILM and Lucasfilm . While merchandising from \"Star Wars\" continued to earn him millions, Lucas continually tinkered with the existing trilogy, often angering diehard fans. \"Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace\" (1999) and its two prequels ruled the box office, but fan and critical reaction was tepid. Another long-awaited project \"Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull\" (2008) also made money, but ultimately left viewers cold. Consequently, Lucas' legacy would be one of conflicting emotions from generations of ardent fans who simultaneously felt inspired by and betrayed by the once infallible creative genius.","slug":"george_lucas","born_in":"Modesto, California, USA","birth":"1944-05-13T16:00:00.000Z","images":"https://resizing.flixster.com/9062MLWU0s1WTSP5YuNTrS0Ce2g=/506x652/v2/https://flxt.tmsimg.com/v9/AllPhotos/23344/23344_v9_bb.jpg"},{"id":"47340656895439","name":"Richard Roundtree","summary":"This handsome black lead made his name as the smooth title character in the classic action film \"Shaft\" (1971), which while not exactly a blaxploitation movie itself, spawned a generation of them.

Stevens' gift for warm and frequently lovely lyrics that touched on issues of love and childhood endeared him to grade schoolers, Aquarian Age idealists and aging folkies alike, who in turn bestowed star status on the singer-songwriter. Between 1970 and 1977, Stevens enjoyed a slew of Top 5 albums and singles, but a series of events, including a near-death experience in 1976, spurred a spiritual awakening that resulted in his conversion and adoption of the name Yusuf Islam. For much of the next three decades, Stevens concerned himself with charitable matters while recording spoken word or unaccompanied vocals on several Islamic-themed records in the 1990s. He returned to his folk-rock roots with two new albums in 2006 and 2009.

He first developed a taste for acting when reciting a poem to his elementary school class. As a teenager, he joined the Wolverhampton Repertory Theater; he was an experienced stage actor by the time World War II struck. He served Britain as a second lieutenant in the Royal Corps of Signals, seeing combat in Normandy, Belgium, and the Far East. After the war, he decided to return to acting, taking on the stage name Vaughan. His first film role was an uncredited turn as a police officer in Alfred Hitchcock's thriller \"The 39 Steps\" (1959). A few years of similarly small parts followed, until he scored the lead role in a b-noir picture called \"Smokescreen\" (1964). British critics panned his performance in \"The Naked Runner\" (1967) alongside Frank Sinatra. Following a small role in Sam Peckinpah's controversial thriller \"Straw Dogs\" (1971), Vaughan made his television debut on the sitcom \"Porridge\" (BBC One, 1974-77) as \"Genial\" Harry Grout. Though he only appeared on three episodes and the 1979 film adaptation, this would prove to be one of Vaughan's most popular roles in the UK. He went on to co-star in the 1980 adaptation of \"The French Lieutenant's Woman,\" alongside Meryl Streep and Jeremy Irons, before taking part in Bill Murray's adaptation of the W. Somerset Maugham novel \"The Razor's Edge\" (1984). Vaughan maintained his presence on British TV, co-starring in an adaptation of \"Bleak House\" (BBC, 1985), while also appearing in Terry Gilliam's \"Time Bandits\" (1981) and \"Brazil\" (1985). Vaughan took on his biggest film role as the father of Anthony Hopkins' stoic butler in the Merchant-Ivory production \"The Remains of the Day\" (1993). His most acclaimed television role followed, with a highly acclaimed turn as an Alzheimer's patient in \"Our Friends in the North\" (BBC Two, 1996). Vaughan's most high profile role was also his last: from 2011 to 2015 he portrayed Maester Aemon on \"Game of Thrones\" (HBO, 2011-).
